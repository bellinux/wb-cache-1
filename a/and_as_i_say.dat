2500|$|Draco is the prototypical spoiled, rich brat; he {{believes}} that his family's wealth and social position gives him the right to bully those poorer than himself, such as Ron Weasley. He also insults Hermione Granger's Muggle-born status by referring {{to her as a}} [...] "Mudblood", a term that, as stated by Hagrid, is one not used in civilised conversations. As Rowling explained in 1999, [...] "He's a bigot and he's a bully, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> in the most refined sense, he knows exactly what will hurt people".|$|E
6000|$|... "Three or four hours--the cat. The {{bones and}} sinews and the fat {{were the last}} to go, and {{the tips of the}} {{coloured}} hairs. <b>And,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> the back part of the eye, tough, iridescent stuff it is, wouldn't go at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I do {{not think}} he will find any {{difficulty}} in getting about the same proportion of value as we have done. The rich mulattoes are buying freely, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> some of the whites are doing the same. Ah, here he is! ...|$|E
60|$|I mused once more. Gussie <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> had rather lost touch, but all {{the same}} I was {{exercised}} about the poor fish, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am about all my pals, close or distant, who find themselves treading upon Life's banana skins. It {{seemed to me that}} he was up against it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have always}} obeyed me heretofore," [...] the captain said, quietly, [...] "and {{you will do}} so now. Go forward at once, <b>and</b> do <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> God bless you, my boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall see. But {{at present}} you must believe that I am right, <b>and</b> do <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> Mount that horse--I {{will help you}} if you are too weak--and--leave a space for me behind you!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the thing}} happened. He {{worked for a}} Mr. Beck, builder, and lived {{in one of his}} master's houses in Trundley Road. Mr. Beck was thrown from his trap and killed. The thing was an unruly horse, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> it happened. Cavilla had to seek fresh {{employment}} and find another house.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Upon {{our past}} {{meetings}} at Ellangowan; and, truly, I think very often we discourse concerning Miss Lucy, for Mr. Charles Hazlewood {{in that particular}} resembleth me, Mr. Mac-Morlan. When I begin to speak of her I never know when to stop; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> (jocularly), she cheats us out of half our lessons.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{tall man}} {{sitting on the}} gravel bowed with urbanity, and said: [...] "Quite at your service. Not to be {{confused}} with the Wilkinsons of Cumberland; <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> old boy, what have you done with my yacht? You see, they've locked me up here--in this garden--and a yacht would be a sort of occupation for an unmarried man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It shall not; {{it shall}} be low enough; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>saying,</b> you shall have the remainder, at the same price, {{immediately}} after Michaelmas, as soon as ever those devils are ejected." ...|$|R
60|$|Alon. I warrant you, sir, I'll {{bring you}} off without your speaking;--from another hand you had it; <b>and</b> now, sir, <b>as</b> you <b>say,</b> sir, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am <b>saying</b> for you, sir, you are loth {{to part with}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, ah! a woman's way!" [...] he adjured me desperately, {{turning his}} head {{from one side to}} the other. [...] "But you must have known that I knew you knew I had seen you, you must confess that. <b>And,</b> well ... <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> can only appeal to your generosity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you may mean by 'what,'" [...] {{answered}} Soames coldly; [...] "your say in her affairs is confined to paying out her income; please bear that in mind. In choosing not to disgrace her by a divorce, I retained my rights, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> I am {{not at all sure}} that I shan't require to exercise them." ...|$|E
60|$|So now I {{was able}} to reply with a manly, disarming frankness. The sudden {{introduction}} of the topic {{had given me a}} bit of a jolt, it is true, for in the stress of recent happenings I had rather let that prize-giving business slide to the back of my mind; but I had speedily recovered <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> {{was able to}} reply with a manly d.f.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The best {{protection}} is five shillings--I'm {{willing to go}} that length. Unless indeed she has a bottle of vitriol. But they only throw vitriol on the men who have deceived them, and I never deceived her--I told her the first time I saw her that it wouldn't do. Oh, if she's there we'll walk a little way together and talk it over <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> I'll {{go as far as}} five shillings.' ...|$|E
60|$|CHRIS. This town of Fair-speech, I {{have heard}} of it; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> remember, they <b>say</b> it's a wealthy place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course they'll have a courier to see {{to their}} things, and go train de luxe and all that," [...] Mrs. Harman {{explained}} with a certain gusto. [...] "But still it's an adventure, with him not well, <b>and</b> both <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> more like children than grown-up people." ...|$|R

He is listed as one of the 100 most famous educators, by the International Bureau of Education (IBE).|$|R
6000|$|I shall {{keep your}} paper; and if ever my works {{come to be}} collected, I will put my back into these suggestions. In the meanwhile, I do truly lack words in which to express my sense of {{gratitude}} for the trouble you have taken. The receipt of such a paper {{is more than a}} reward for my labours. I have read it with pleasure, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> I hope to use it with profit.--Believe me, your most obliged, ...|$|E
60|$|The old {{class that}} I mean has no representative. Its food was plentiful; {{but it had}} no show. Its food was plain; but it had no fads. It was serious about politics; and when it spoke in public it {{committed}} the solecism of trying to speak well. I thought that this old earnest political England had practically disappeared. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> I took one turn out of Fleet Street and I found {{a room full of}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had noticed}} {{there was a}} kind of a village back of the beach, and enough scenery to outfit a dozen moving-picture shows. But I thought, of course, it was a cannibal suburb, and I was {{wondering}} whether I was to be served with carrots or mushrooms. <b>And,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> this dressed-up man sits beside me, and we become friends in the space of a minute or two. For an hour we talked, and he told me all about it.|$|E
60|$|CHR. This town of Fair-speech, said Christian, I {{have heard}} of; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> remember, they <b>say</b> it is a wealthy place.|$|R
60|$|The Divisions <b>and</b> Animosities which, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> {{were among}} the Nobility, were very unhappily occasion'd upon two several Foundations, and {{therefore}} consisted of two several Kinds.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} approve. That {{would be the}} difficulty. He would argue the matter with me, and I should {{have to tell him}} that I could not let him come to the house, except with my father's leave. That would be out of the question. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> there would be a difficulty." ...|$|R
60|$|William made no {{difficulty}} of selling this cargo also, and in about twenty days returned again, freighted with all necessary provisions for our voyage, {{and for a}} long time; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> we {{had a great deal of}} other goods: he brought us back about three-and-thirty thousand pieces of eight, and some diamonds, which, though William did not pretend to much skill in, yet he made shift to act so as not to be imposed upon, the merchants he had to deal with, too, being very fair men.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Gerrish {{kept his}} eye on Mrs. Munger's face, now {{arranged}} for indefinite photography, as he went on. [...] "That is exactly what I say to them. That is what I said to Mr. Marvin one year ago, when he had that trouble in his shoe shop. I said, 'You're too concessive.' I said, 'Mr. Marvin, if you give those fellows an inch, they'll take an ell. Mr. Marvin,' said I, 'you've got to begin by being your own master, {{if you want to}} be master of anybody else. You've got to put your foot down, as Mr. Lincoln said; <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> you've got to keep it down.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Bolton {{might easily}} {{have taken her}} tone for that of disgust. He faced round upon her once more. [...] "It was kind of queer, his havin' the child with him, an' takin' most the care of her himself; and so, as I say, Mis' Bolton and me we took him in, as much to stop folks' mouths as anything, till they got kinder used to it. But we didn't take him into your part, as I say; <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> I'm willin' to pay you {{whatever}} you say {{for the use of}} the old Judge's study. I presume that part of it was a libbutty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 280: As Hamlet to his players: [...] "Nor do not saw the air {{too much}} with your hand thus; but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, <b>and</b> (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> may <b>say)</b> the {{whirlwind}} of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness."] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{unfinished}} {{work is a}} small thing," [...] said Challenger pompously, [...] "when {{weighed against}} {{the fact that my}} own magnum opus, 'The Ladder of Life,' is still in the first stages. My brain, my reading, my experience--in fact, my whole unique equipment--were to be condensed into that epoch-making volume. <b>And</b> yet, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> acquiesce." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor lady, she {{had good}} reason. M. de Cintre was no husband for a sweet young lady like that. <b>And</b> then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> {{it has been}} a sad house. It is better, in my humble opinion, that she were out of it. So, if you will excuse me for <b>saying</b> so, <b>I</b> hope she will marry you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Ligoun went slowly, without haste, {{as though}} many years were yet before him. It seemed {{that he was}} certain he would make his kill, in his own way, ere they could slay him. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> he went slowly, and knives bit into him, and he was red with blood. And though none sought after me, who was a mere stripling, yet did the knives find me, and the hot bullets burn me. And still Ligoun leaned his weight on my youth, and Opitsah struck at him, and we three went forward. And when we stood by Niblack, he was afraid, and covered his head with his blanket. The Skoots were ever cowards.|$|E
60|$|The London traffic {{problem is}} just one of those {{questions}} that appeal very strongly to the more prevalent and less charitable types of English mind. It has a practical and constructive air, it deals with impressively enormous amounts of tangible property, it rests with a comforting effect of solidity upon assumptions that are at once doubtful and desirable. It seems free from metaphysical considerations, and it has none of those disconcerting personal applications, those penetrations towards intimate qualities, that makes eugenics, for example, faintly but persistently uncomfortable. It is indeed an ideal problem for a healthy, hopeful, and progressive middle-aged public man. <b>And,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> it deals with enormous amounts of tangible property.|$|E
60|$|He {{had just}} left the room in which I sat with Basil Grant and his brother Rupert, the voluble amateur detective. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> was {{invariably}} the case, we were all talking about him. Rupert Grant was a clever young fellow, but he had that tendency which youth and cleverness, when sharply combined, so often produce, a somewhat extravagant scepticism. He saw doubt and guilt everywhere, and it was meat and drink to him. I had often got irritated with this boyish incredulity of his, but on this particular occasion I am bound to say that I thought him so obviously right that I was astounded at Basil's opposing him, however banteringly.|$|E
6000|$|His face became anxious, {{his voice}} gentle. [...] "I beg your pardon; I have presumed too far. I hope, Miss Brisbane, {{you will not}} take what <b>I</b> <b>say</b> too much to heart. Indeed, you must not mind me at all. I am, first of all, a sort of crank; <b>and</b> then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> don't know a word about painting; please forget my criticisms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{have got}} {{on one of}} your mamma's dresses," [...] Mrs. Conway laughed, {{interpreting}} Mabel's look of surprise. [...] "Yes, dear, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> you <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> have dyed my hair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes,--of course. I saw {{you coming}} out, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> want to <b>say</b> {{a word or}} two, I have ventured to follow you. When Mr. Belton was down here I {{did not have the}} {{pleasure}} of meeting him." ...|$|R
