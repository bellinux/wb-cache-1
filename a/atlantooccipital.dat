40|$|Traumatic <b>atlantooccipital</b> {{dislocation}} {{is generally}} considered incompatible with life. However, there have been isolated survivals from this injury, and a few patients initially have minimal neurologic deficits disproportionate to the gravity of their injury, a feature {{that has not been}} adequately stressed. The potentially catastrophic results of delayed therapy make early radiographic detection imperative. Marked retropharyngeal soft-tissue swelling, an abnormal basion-odontoid alignment, and posterior displacement of the atlas are diagnostic of anterior <b>atlantooccipital</b> dislocation. In the more uncommon posterior <b>atlantooccipital</b> dislocation an abnormal basion-odontoid alignment associ-ated with marked soft-tissue swelling should suggest the correct diagnosis. Conven-tional tomography can be confirmatory. Traumatic atiantooccipital dislocation has been generally accepted as a rare and fatal injury [1 - 3]; survival has been considered exceedingly infrequent. Although there have been scattered case reports of survival in the general literature, we could find only one previous report of such a case in the radiologi c literature [4].

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the appearance of the ligamentous structures of the occipitoatlantoaxial (OAA) region in the normal horse by 3 tesla (3 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI images of the longitudinal odontoid ligament, tectorial membrane, dorsal and ventral atlantoaxial ligaments, dorsal <b>atlantooccipital</b> membrane with its reinforcing ligaments, and the lateral <b>atlantooccipital</b> ligaments of 10 horse cadavers were evaluated. All ligaments and membranes were identified in all planes, except for the lateral <b>atlantooccipital</b> ligament in the sagittal plane due to its cranioventrolateral course. All were iso to mildly hypointense to musculature of the neck in T 1 W with the exception of the tectorial membrane that was moderately hypointense; moderately hypointense in PD-SPIR, and markedly hypointense (isointense to cortical bone) in T 2 W. The PD-SPIR was the best sequence to identify all ligaments and membranes from their cranial and caudal attachments. The longitudinal odontoid ligament, ventral atlantoaxial ligament, and reinforcing bands of the dorsal <b>atlantooccipital</b> membrane presented a characteristic striped heterogeneous signal behavior thought to be due to fibrocartilaginous content. The remaining ligaments and membranes showed homogeneous signal intensity. Special anatomical features in this species such as the fan-shaped longitudinal odontoid ligament, absence of the transverse ligament and presence of the ventral atlantoaxial ligament were documented. Ligamentous structures that stabilize the equine OAA region were described with MRI in this study and these findings could serve as an anatomic reference for those cases where instability of this region is suspected...|$|E
40|$|<b>Atlantooccipital</b> {{dislocation}} can {{be complicated}} by a traumatic durotomy {{that may lead}} to the rare development of a retropharyngeal pseudomeningocele. To our knowledge this has been reported only five times previously. We present the case of a 60 -year-old man involved in a motor vehicle accident who suffered an <b>atlantooccipital</b> dislocation and C 5 -C 6 three-column injury. A unique MRI image of a defect in the ventral dura posterior to C 2 was appreciated. He underwent occiput to T 2 internal fixation and arthrodesis. During surgery, CSF egress was seen caudal to the right C 2 nerve root. A DuraMatrix onlay patch reinforced with DuraSeal was placed to stop the CSF leak. A lumbar subarachnoid drain was also placed. The patient made a satisfactory recovery with residual mild weakness of his right upper extremity. In this report, we demonstrate that careful MRI review can reveal a ventral durotomy in a traumatic <b>atlantooccipital</b> dislocation and, if discovered, effective treatment including a lumbar subarachnoid drain for CSF diversion may prevent progression to a retropharyngeal pseudomeningocele. The literature on this rare presentation and associated durotomy is provided...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} a simple method {{for measuring the}} distance between the occiput and atlas when a distraction-dislocation injury is suspected in a child. Measurements were made at five evenly spaced locations along the <b>atlantooccipital</b> joint on cross-table lateral skull radiographs in 100 normal children. These data were compared with similar measurements in eight patients with proved <b>atlantooccipital</b> dislocation. The mean normal measurement fell between 1. 96 - 2. 63 mm for all five points. For boys or girls aged 1 - 15 years, the normal distance should not exceed 5 mm at any point in the joint. The likelihood that any normal child will have a measurement ~ 4. 5 mm at any point is between 0. 4 - 5. 85 % (expected false-positive rate). When trying to decide if a distraction-dislocation has occurred at the atlantooc-cipital junction, we found that there are no adequate criteria for deciding whether {{the distance between the}} base of the skull and the first cervical vertebra is abnormally increased in the child. There are a number of methods for measuring the craniocervical junction when there is concern about <b>atlantooccipital</b> dislocation or distraction injury: (1) the dens...|$|E

Furthermore, 24 <b>atlantooccipital</b> regions were dissected to demonstrate the ponticulus posterior {{in relation to the}} posterior <b>atlantooccipital</b> membrane. The ponticulus posterior in macerated specimens was observed in 5. 2 % of the Kanto Japanese subjects, 50 % of the Pongidae subjects and all of the Cercopithecidae subjects. The ponticulus lateralis in macerated specimens was observed in 3. 1 % of the Kanto Japanese subjects, none of the Pongidae subjects, 98. 4 % of the Cercopithecidae subjects. The ponticulus posterior in cervical spine X-rays was observed in 5. 5 % and no increase with aging could be seen. The ponticulus posterior has been considered by many authors to be an ossification of the posterior atlantoccipital membrane. In dissecting 24 specimens of the <b>atlantooccipital</b> region, it was noted that the ponticulus posterior extended from the posterior part of the superior articular condyle to the posterior arch behind the groove, and that the posterior atlantoocipital membrane was attached inferiorly to the superior margin of the posterior arch and superiorly to the inferior margin of the foramen magnum. As for etiology, we do not consider the formation of the ponticulus posterior to be due to the ossification of the posterior <b>atlantooccipital</b> membrane. The ponticulus posterior and ponticulus lateralis in human subjects cannot be caused by an ossification of the membrane, but must be a regressive and disappearing morphological phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{study is}} aimed to {{determine}} the incidence and predictors of difficult and impossible mask ventilation. Materials and Methods: Information like age, snoring history, obstructive sleep apnea, dental and mandibular abnormalities, macroglossia, grading like SLUX, Mallampatti, Cormack Lehanne, <b>atlantooccipital</b> extension, presence of beard or moustache, mouth opening were collected. During mask ventilation, the information related to the ventilation and intubation was collected. All {{variables found to be}} significant in univariate analysis were subjected to the multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of measured outcome. Results: Difficult mask ventilation (DMV) was observed in 30 male patients and 9 female patients. Of the 40 patients who had difficult intubation (DI), 7 patients had both DMV and intubation and 1 patient was of impossible mask ventilation/ intubation. Snoring was the lone significant risk factor for DMV. The risk factors identified for DI were snoring, retrognathia, micrognathia, macroglossia, short thick neck, Mallampatti grade [III/IV], abnormal SLUX grade, Cormack Lehanne grade [II,III/IV], abnormal <b>atlantooccipital</b> extension grading, flexion/extension deformity of neck, protuberant teeth, cervical spine abnormality, mouth opening 26 kg/m 2. BMI > 26 kg/m 2 and <b>atlantooccipital</b> extension grade > 3 were independent risk factors for DI and the presence of two of the variables made the sensitivity and specificity of 43 % and 99 % respectively with a positive predictive value of 74 %.

40|$|Atlanto-axial rotatory {{fixation}} (AORF) develops on {{the background}} of acute torticollis. Widely adopted terms such as C 1 subluxation or <b>atlantooccipital</b> rotational subluxation {{do not reflect the}} core of this pathology and carry negative weight in the diagnostics and treatment of AORF. Retrospective analysis of the diagnostics and treatment outcome of 5 children with confirmed AORF diagnosis and literature review were performed. Clinical method, radiography and functional computer tomography were used to verify the diagnosis. De-rotational halo-traction and open correction with screw fixation were applied for treatment. Head position was managed to be improved in all patients. In one case the reduction was performed using correction in suboccipital segments and in other 4 cases the correction and fixation by Harms and de-rotational halo-traction allowed to correct torticollis. The pain syndrome had been arrested completely. Disease outcome resulted in formation of C 1 -C 2 fibrous or bone fusion regardless the method of treatment. The patients with neglected AORF represent a great challenge for diagnostics and treatment. When conservative treatment fails it is necessary to involve de-rotational halo-traction with possible application of open reduction and posterior fusion.

40|$|Object. Over {{the past}} few decades, various authors have {{performed}} open or stereotactic trigeminal nucleotractotomy {{for the treatment of}} neuropathic facial pain resistant to medical treatment. Stereotactic procedures can be performed percutaneously under local anesthesia, allowing intraoperative neurological examination as a method for target refinement. However, blind percutaneous procedures in the region of the <b>atlantooccipital</b> transition carry a considerably high risk of vascular injuries that may bring prohibitive neurological deficit or even death. To avoid such complications, the authors present the first clinical use of microendoscopy to assist percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal nucleotractotomy. The aim {{of this article is to}} demonstrate intradural microendoscopic visualization of the medulla oblongata through an <b>atlantooccipital</b> percutaneous approach. Methods. The authors present a case of severe postherpetic facial neuralgia in a patient who underwent the procedure and had satisfactory results. Stereotactic computational image planning for targeting the spinal trigeminal tract and nucleus in the posterolateral medulla was performed, allowing for an accurate percutaneous approach. immediately before radiofrequency electrode insertion, a tine endoscope was introduced to visualize the structures in the cisterna magna. Results. Microendoscopic visualization offered clear identification of the pial surface of the medulla oblongata and its blood vessels, the arachnoid membrane, cranial nerve rootlets and their entry zone, and larger vessels such as the vertebral arteries and the branches of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Conclusions. The initial application of this technique suggests that percutaneous microendoscopy may be useful for particular manipulation of the medulla oblongata, increasing the safety of the procedure and likely improving its effectiveness.

40|$|M. Tech. It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the sympathetic nerve fibres coursing with the vertebral arteries may potentially be irritated by cervical pathology such as cervical dysfunction causing vasoconstriction of the vertebro-basilar arterial system leading to an ischaemic state in particular areas in the brain (Wingfield and Gorman, 2000). This arterial insufficiency to the brain has been shown to effect higher level complex brain functions (Terrett, 1995). The purpose of this research was to determine whether atlanto-occipital joint as well as atlanto-axial joint adjustments had an immediate effect on mental rotation ability in individuals with asymptomatic cervical facet joint dysfunction. Sixty male and female asymptomatic patients took part in this study. These patients were recruited by means of word of mouth and through the use of advertisements placed in the University of Johannesburg Chiropractic Day Clinic, Doornfontein Campus. Inclusion criteria required for patients {{to participate in the study}} included the patients (both male or female) be between the ages of 18 and 30 years, they presented with an asymptomatic cervical facet joint dysfunction at the <b>atlantooccipital</b> and or atlanto-axial joints, not have had either Chiropractic or any other form of treatment to the cervical spine for at least six days prior to involvement in the study, had normal or corrected to normal vision and no contraindications to cervical adjustments. vi Objective data was collected by means of a mental rotation reaction time test installed on a laptop computer which measured the patients mental rotation reaction time ability in both accuracy and time to complete each test.
