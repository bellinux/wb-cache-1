Henry Washington. Base Line road, a major thoroughfare, today runs from Highland to San Dimas, intermittently along the absolute baseline coordinates plotted by Col. Washington. San Bernardino County was first formed out of parts of Los Angeles County on April 26, 1853. While the partition once included what is today most of Riverside County, the region is not as monolithic <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound.</b> Rivalries between Colton, Redlands, Riverside and San Bernardino over the location of the county seat in the 1890s caused each of them to form their own civic communities, each with their own newspapers. On August 14, 1893, the state Senate allowed Riverside County to form out of land previously in San Bernardino and San Diego counties, after rejecting a bill for Pomona to split from L.A. County and become the seat of what would have been called San Antonio County.|$|E

This leads to turning points towards more relevant economic theories, referred to as. 1848 momentsÿ.

2500|$|In 2011, {{he played}} an {{illiterate}} boy in Haissam Hussain's comedy TV series, Akbari Asghari. Kuch Pyar Ka Pagalpan was Khan's third collaboration with Haissam Hussain, which featured {{him as a}} boy who arrives in the United States from Pakistan and is constantly looked down upon by his relatives. He later starred opposite Mahira Khan in Sarmad Khoosat's emotional TV serial drama Humsafar, for which he won Best Actor award at the Lux Style Awards in 2012. Writing for The Indian Express, Ranika Rajani praised Humsafar saying, [...] "The Pakistani drama is {{a breath of fresh}} air in comparison to its Indian counterparts." [...] Writing about the performers she said, [...] "The chemistry between Mahira Khan and Fawad Khan is also one of the reasons why Humsafar is a must watch. Both of them convincingly wow you with their performance." [...] Zee News's critic Ritka Handoo also praised the lead performances saying, [...] "The lead pair, Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan, has struck just the right chord. We as audiences have been finally gifted a new albeit quite believable on screen couple." [...] The following year, he appeared in Sarmad Khoosat's TV series, Ashk which received a negative review from The Express Tribune critic. The same year, Khan played a member of an affluent family opposite Sanam Saeed in Sultana Siddiqui's family drama TV series Zindagi Gulzar Hai. Dipti Sharma of The Indian Express praised his performance and wrote: [...] "Fawad Khan was a breeze of fresh air, as cliched <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound.</b> So, watching Fawad Khan, a man in his early 30s, playing a mature character with so many layers, nuances and subtlety, it is hard not to admire him." [...] For this role, he won Best Actor-Popular award at the Hum Awards and the Best Actor satellite at Lux Style Awards, and with Saeed he won the Best Onscreen Couple award in both popular and jury categories at the Hum Awards. His last TV serial was Ahson Talish's sociodrama Numm. Broadcast in 2013, the drama saw Khan play a boy who secretly marries a girl in London and, after returning Pakistan, is forced to marry another girl. Behadd, director Asim Raza's telefilm, featured Khan as a young divorcee who proposes to a widow who has a teenage daughter. The Times of India noted that Khan's character in Behadd was different from those he played in Humsafar and Zindagi Gulzar Hai and praised his performance writing, [...] "Behadd is another benchmark of Pakistani television heartthrob Fawad Khan." [...] His last telefilm was Anjum Shahzad's romance Armaan opposite Aamina Sheikh, where he played a young, flirtatious boy.|$|E

Chalan Beel, a wetland situated in the North Western Bangladesh is a very potential wetland with immense biodiversity and fisheries value.

However, nothing sustainable so far emerged concerning bio diversity and mother fishery conservations.

50|$|The 1972 Formula One season {{completely}} {{failed to}} capitalise {{on the promise}} shown in 1970-71. Three distinct models of car were used, beginning with the 721, which was a development of the 711. Peterson and Niki Lauda then drove the disappointing experimental 721X factory cars (using an Alfa Romeo transverse gearbox and intended to have a low polar-moment, anticipating {{in some ways the}} much more successful Tyrrell 005/006 series). Frank Williams ran regular 711 and 721 customer cars for Henri Pescarolo and Carlos Pace. The 721X was deemed to be a disaster and abandoned, but the team saw a way out; customer Mike Beuttler and his backers ordered an F1 car, and the team produced the 721G in nine days (the 'G' standing for 'Guinness Book Of Records' as the car was built so quickly) by fitting a Cosworth DFV and larger fuel tanks to the 722 F2 chassis (not as desperate an experiment <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have <b>sounded</b> -- John Cannon commissioned a Formula 5000 car which was built to a very similar scheme). The 721G was light and quick, and the works team soon built their own chassis. Had they started the year with these, wins may well have been possible. The 721G set the trend for future March F1 cars, which {{for the rest of the}} 1970s were essentially scaled-up F2 chassis. Meanwhile, March was going from strength to strength in Formula Two (which became its spiritual home) and Formula Three.|$|R

Since last week, {{readers have}} been bombarded with the good tiding, from the {{modified}} masthead, logo, and tagline, to news headlines, editorials, audio and video clips, and ads, lots of ads. The new owner goes by the appetizing name of Yu Wan Mei 鱼完美 Amalgamated Salvage Fisheries and Polymer Injection Group, supposedly a Chinese conglomerate from the inland province of Sichuan. The corporation specializes in fish by-products salvaged from the “ocean’s bounty. ” Some of its finer samples are “Broiled Shark Gums,” “Multi-Flavor Variety Pack Of Pickled Fish Cloaca,” “Lightning Power Monkfish Cerebral Fluid Energy Drink,” “Mr. Steve’s Safe And Natural Rhinoceros-Cure For The Inferior Male,” and “Yu Wan Mei Miscellaneous Flavor Paste. ” But, as the YWM homepage proclaims in bold letters, the corporation is “diversifying into myriad subsidiaries” such as “Szu-Maul Lethal Injection Truck And Van Manufacturing,” “Speedee Slab Quick-Setting Concrete Consolidated,” “Jhonson 2 ̆ 6 Jhonson Baby’s Shampow,” “Yu Wanmei EZ Home Foreclosure Program,” and “Amalgamated Chinatowns of America, Inc. ” The new owner is pushy, to say the least.

Ads containing shibboleths in simulated non-grammatical English (“Glorious Fish By-Product Make for Long Life, Good Fortune”) rudely bisect or multiply interrupt any and all reports.

The video clips go overboard with animated YWM icons and messages flashing across the screen and with the anchors blending YWM commercials effortlessly into their tabloid-style interviews. The Onion has positively turned fishy. No savvyOnion reader should be fooled by this non-too-subtle effort at mocking the sorry state of the publishing industry and the corporate takeover of the media in contemporary America.

40|$|We live in {{a digital}} age where we can watch {{television}} on the internet, browse the internet on our television, and do both simultaneously on our mobile devices. In this ever changing digital environment, many aspects of film have remained constant while many have evolved. The purpose of my project is to not only produce a quality series of films, but also to explore {{the ways in which}} we think about the content, distribution, and consumption of the films that we are exposed to. In order to closely analyze these aspects of film media, I have created a digital series titled Poems For Public Education. The process of developing this digital campaign incorporates aspects of social awareness, marketing and promotion, and film production all through the medium of the internet. In our current popular culture, everyone has access to share and view film <b>as</b> they please. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> intuitive to people who have grown up {{in the age of the}} internet, but this is truly a phenomenon that was impossible before YouTube. No longer do you need the green light of a network executive to gain access to millions of potential viewers, nor the approval of a network executive to deem your film successful. As explained by the trends manager at YouTube, Kevin Allocca, “these are the characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where everyone has access, and the audience defines the popularity [...] . these are not characteristics of old media, and they’re barely true of the media today, but they will define the entertainment of the future. ” While the aspects of distribution and consumption of film have changed in the recent past, many aspects of production have remained the same. Creating a viral Youtube video does not necessarily depend on the production value of your film; however, being a Film Media major in the Harrington School of Communication, the quality of production is vital to the visual and oratory aesthetics of filmmaking. This is where the majority of my time was spent in producing this digital series. What starts as an idea has to undergo serious development and scrutiny before it becomes a finished product. From storyboarding to directing, I oversaw every production element of these short films. I spent time coordinating talent, scouting locations, hiring grips and sound men, lighting shots, framing shots, directing camera movement, capturing professional quality audio, and editing visuals and sound in post production. Poems For Public Education finds a niche between the everchanging ways we consume and distribute film and classical film production techniques, which exposes the nature of the future of film in our society. It is not a movie, music video, TV show, news cast, or public service announcement [...] rather a digital campaign that finds itself in a realm of endless possibilities afforded by the capabilities of the internet...|$|R
