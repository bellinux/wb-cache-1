5|$|After the Revolution of 1848, then-Count Wilhelm {{became the}} first duke of Urach. A passionate {{artillery}} officer, he desired to improve the defenses of his castle and so began to build pre-outwork caponiers {{in the style of}} the imperial Fortress of Ulm (though not on a scale as grand) and a trench along the fortress to deter attack. Later he had cannons placed in the bastions on the walls. From 1898 to 1901 the two buildings left of the main gate, the Ducal Palace and the old groundskeepers house, were constructed and expanded respectively. <b>A</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> build a cableway up to the castle in 1911 was rejected because it was believed it would ruin the beauty of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Bradley was {{unanimously}} {{chosen as}} a delegate-at-large to six consecutive Republican National Conventions. At the 1880 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he was unanimously chosen to second Roscoe Conkling's nomination of Ulysses S. Grant {{for a third}} term as president. His rousing oratory gained him the attention of prominent leaders of his party. At the 1884 convention, he was instrumental in defeating <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> curtail Southern states' representation. President Chester A. Arthur chose Bradley to help recover financial damages from postal officials involved in the Star Route Frauds in 1885, but Bradley resigned this responsibility over differences with U.S. Attorney General Benjamin H. Brewster regarding the prosecution of these cases.|$|E
5|$|By July15, Typhoon Ma-on had a {{well-defined}} eye with the strongest convection in its southern periphery. It continued intensifying, and the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 220km/h (135mph). Late on July15, Ma-on weakened slightly due to stronger wind shear, which caused its eyewall to break {{apart in the}} northwest quadrant. It re-intensified the next day after an eyewall replacement cycle commenced. At 0600UTC on July16, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph) while the typhoon was located about 1185km (735mi) southeast of Okinawa. Around that time, Ma-on began <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> the northwest due to a weakening of the subtropical ridge, and it briefly entered the area warned by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA); the agency gave it the local name Ineng.|$|E

An amended complaint was {{filed by the}} three franchises a month later. In response to <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> dismiss filed by the parent company, the judge ruled in January 2009 in favor of Burger King. In his decision, Judge Gordon stated that the franchise contract clearly does provide Burger King the right to establish minimum hours standards for its franchises. After purchase of the company by 3G, Burger King conceded to the franchises request the mandate be changed to a recommendation and relaxed its position on the extended hours.|$|E
5|$|Citing {{the high}} costs and {{transportation}} logistics of proceeding while Vick was still in federal prison, state prosecutor Gerald Poindexter decided to postpone Vick's trial in Surry County Circuit Court until after Vick's release from federal custody. Vick's attorneys sought to resolve the state charges sooner. On October 14, 2008, Vick attorney Lawrence Woodward filed <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> enter a plea via two-way electronic video with the Surry County Courts. Vick planned {{to plead guilty to}} state charges {{in an effort to get}} early release from federal prison and enter a halfway house. The request for a trial without Vick physically present was denied, but Poindexter agreed to hold the state trial while Vick was still in federal custody if Vick bore the costs of his transportation to Virginia and related expenses.|$|E

Penn via rear naked choke at 4:39 of the first round, in a fight he was heavily favored to win. The title was vacated upon a contract dispute between Penn and UFC who promptly stripped him of the welterweight title, claiming Penn had breached his contract and that the signing constituted him refusing to defend his title. Penn filed suit against UFC and publicized {{his side of the}} conflict, claiming his contract had expired.

5|$|Hurricane Jeanne {{steadily}} intensified as {{it turned}} eastward, developing a 52mi (83km) wide eye. <b>A</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> the southeast began on September 22, and {{around the same time}} it reached winds of 100mph (160km/h), making it a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At the same time, the National Hurricane Center forecast to turn westward and later northwestward, with its projected five-day track within 60mi (100km) of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The westernmost outlier during one model run was the NOGAPS model, which predicted a continued westward motion across central Florida. The official forecast changed early on September 23 to bring Jeanne across northeastern Florida, though initially the cyclone was predicted to turn northeastward and hit South Carolina as a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In March 2000, the Schindlers filed <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> permit {{assisted}} {{feeding of}} Terri, {{which is not}} considered a life-prolonging procedure under Florida law.

The Medical Examiner in his postmortem report was more definitive and reaffirmed that Schiavo could not have swallowed.|$|E

5|$|On June 30, 2012, the State Attorney brought <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> remand Blythe in pre-trial detention, as he {{considered}} Blythe a flight risk. During a hearing conducted the same day, judge Petr Fassati of the Prague 8 District Court ruled that Blythe {{will be held}} on remand, with the possibility of a bail of CZK 4,000,000 (~ US$ 200,000), Blythe's alleged annual income; Blythe was held in PankrÃ¡c Prison. Bail was deposited in the court's bank account on mid-day of July 3, 2012. After this, the State Attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint. Due to public holidays it was not until July 9, 2012, that the State Attorney filed his complaint, which was to be dealt with by appellate court, the Prague Municipal Court.|$|E

According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and {{it had not been}} referred to during the Barker proceedings. The defense filed <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> dismiss the Barker charges on the ground that retrying Bell would amount to double jeopardy. On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Fraser's accession, {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} Whitlam government's actions {{in trying to}} restart peace talks in Vietnam. As the North prepared to end the civil war, Whitlam sent cables to both Vietnamese governments, telling Parliament that both cables were substantially the same. The Opposition contended he had misled Parliament, and <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> censure Whitlam was defeated along party lines. The Opposition also attacked Whitlam for not allowing enough South Vietnamese refugees into Australia, with Fraser calling for the entry of 50,000. Freudenberg alleges that 1,026Vietnamese refugees entered Australia in the final eight months of the Whitlam government, and only 399 in 1976 under Fraser. However, by 1977, Australia had accepted over five thousand refugees.|$|E
