40|$|Abstract Introduction Long-term {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) recordings {{are widely}} employed {{to assist the}} diagnosis of cardiac and sleep disorders. However, variability of ECG amplitude during the recordings hampers the detection of QRS complexes by algorithms. This work presents a simple electronic circuit to automatically normalize the ECG amplitude, improving its sampling by analog to digital converters (ADCs). Methods The proposed circuit consists of an <b>analog</b> <b>divider</b> that normalizes the ECG amplitude using its absolute peak value as reference. The reference value is obtained {{by means of a}} full-wave rectifier and a peak voltage detector. The circuit and tasks of its different stages are described. Results Example of the circuit performance for a bradycardia ECG signal (40 bpm) is presented; the signal has its amplitude suddenly halved, and later, restored. The signal is automatically normalized after 5 heart beats for the amplitude drop. For the amplitude increase, the signal is promptly normalized. Conclusion The proposed circuit adjusts the ECG amplitude to the input voltage range of ADC, avoiding signal to noise ratio degradation of the sampled waveform in order to allow a better performance of processing algorithms...|$|E
40|$|Analog {{dividers}} {{are widely}} used in analog systems. Analog realization of such circuits suffer from limited dynamic range and non-linearity issues, therefore, extra circuitry {{should be required to}} compensate these types of shortcomings. In this paper a gain controllable, <b>analog</b> <b>divider</b> is proposed based on data converters. Our circuit can be implemented both in current and voltage mode by selecting proper architectures. The resolution, power consumption and operation speed can be controlled by proper selecting of components. Another advantage of our circuit is its gain programmability. Moreover, the gain can be adjusted independently based on the relationship between input signals. Our proposed method offers two different gain control abilities, one for situation that the numerator signal is bigger than the denominator, and another gain is applied when the denominator is larger than the numerator. As a result, no extra amplifier is required for signal amplification. Moreover, the input and output signal nature can be chosen arbitrarily in this circuit, i. e. input signal may be a voltage signal while the output signal is current. Simulation results from SPICE confirm the proper operation of the circuit...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 This thesis {{discusses}} the hardware implementations of certain linear and non-linear color space transforms {{thought to be}} useful {{in the analysis of}} wood surfaces for defect detection. The developmental system's color image digitizer contains 5 bits per color while the input signal contains considerably greater resolution. This often degrades the information content of the image when certain color transforms are performed. Performing these transforms at real-time speeds demands extremely fast operating hardware. In order to avoid loss of information content and obtain real-time operating speeds, the color transforms were implemented using analog circuits. Linear transforms, as proposed by Forrer (FORR 1987), were implemented using high speed operational amplifier-based circuits. Non-linear transforms such as ratioing or intensity normalization and contrast enhancement were implemented using high-speed <b>analog</b> <b>divider</b> circuits. The results showed that, for the linear transforms described, significant improvement in image quality was observed. This was supported by analysis of the transformed image histogram. The contrast enhancement circuit has the ability to enhance certain features such as blue stain.

40|$|Low-power, high-speed, {{accurate}} computation of centroid from a pre-defined {{window in}} the image plane is important {{for a number of}} space-based and commercial applications. These include object tracking in robotic systems [l], autonomous navigation, image compression [2], and document copyright protection [3], as well as space guidance and navigation systems [4], and deep-space optical communication systems that require accurate and stable beam pointing for high speed data transfer 151. Off-focal-plane digital processors yield accurate centroid values, but only at the cost of increased latency, power and size. On or near focal plane centroid computation using current mode circuits [6], and neuro-MOS circuits [7] have been implemented. However, neither approaches are integrated with high performance image sensors, nor are they entirely compatible with one. In this paper, we present a CMOS- active Eixel Sensor (AB) with an integrated centroid-computation circuit that allows accurate X and Y centroid computation from a user-selectable window of interest.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the design of {{integrated}} readout circuits for differential capacitive sensing applications. Such circuits are needed especially for interfacing with microsensors where capacitive transduction is predominantly used. The result of this research is the development of common framework for interface circuitries suitable for different sensing applications. These interface circuits were designed and fabricated in standard Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) processes and can be integrated into the design of various sensing systems. The proposed circuits in this work are characterized by high dynamic range, low power consumption, and adjustable sensing range. Such circuits promote easy-to-use user interfaces while having a low cost. Three different circuit designs were proposed and form the highlights of this thesis. The first interface circuit is a novel realization of a synchronous demodulation technique. The main advantage of the proposed circuit compared to state-of-the-art is that it has a high sensing dynamic range of 112 dB and is capable of measuring capacitance as small as 30 aF with a total power consumption of 8 mW. Low power consumption {{is one of the most}} important design criteria for portable sensing systems besides accuracy and precision. Following this requirement, low power consumption is the main criterion in the second circuit proposed in this work. This circuit uses a switch-based capacitance-to-voltage converter that is designed and fabricated in 0. 35 μm CMOS technology. This circuit had a low power consumption of 600 μW. Its simple structure offers area and power advantages over the more complex circuits. In addition, its ratiometric sensing feature provides an adjustable sensing range which can be tuned for different applications. This circuit can detect capacitances as small as 230 aF in 1 pF range of capacitance. To reduce the effect of parasitics on the circuit performance and improve the linearity, the design of the second circuit was enhanced. By using an additional block and an <b>analog</b> <b>divider,</b> the sensitivity of the circuit to parasitics was significantly reduced. On the other hand, a time based output allowed for the elimination of the analog buffers. The fabricated circuit consumed a total power of only 720 μW and was fabricated in 0. 35 μm CMOS technology. Another advantage of this circuit over the previous designs is that the pulse-width output signal of this circuit can be more easily digitized. The proposed circuits in this thesis have been tested with different types of sensors including humidity, motion, and variable MEMS capacitors. For all of them also, the measurement results are found to be in good agreement with the analytic and simulation results. These circuits can be used as standalone chips or can be integrated into the design of larger sensing systems...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of laser}} {{radiation}} in atmospheric communication systems is revealing {{new forms of}} signal degradation not previously encountered with lower frequency transmitting sources. The coherence and directivity of the laser {{which is responsible for}} its increased signal capacity is degraded by the effect of atmospheric distortion. Random fluctuations in the index of refraction (turbulence), Rayleigh scattering, aerosol scattering and other atmospheric effects create fluctuations (boiling, breathing, dancing, attenuation, transit-time dispersion, etc.) within the beam cross section, which when received produce random fluctuations in the receiver output signal. The two systems which are described, are designed to investigate the effect of atmospheric distortions on the amplitude and phase (or transit time) of the laser beam. The Scintillation System was designed for real-time determination of amplitude scintillation statistics. The system will be incorporated into a multi-wavelength, multi-range experiment for comparison of theoretical and experimental meteorological and optical data. The system includes a laser transmitter, an atmospheric path over which the beam is allowed to diverge to a three-foot cross section, a pair of photomultipliers with variable spacing and small sampling apertures, an analog 2 ̆ 2 scintillation computer, 2 ̆ 2 and a recording device. The scintillation computer is a real time, special purpose, analog computer designed to compute the variance and covariance of log amplitude, the probability distribution of log amplitude, and the frequency spectrum of the amplitude scintillation. The system permits the recording of these data as a function of transmitter and receiver aperture, and time. The Short Pulse Distortion System is designed to detect pulse distortion due to transit-time dispersion of the laser beam. The system includes a mode-locked laser (i. e., the optical short pulse generator), a large transmitting aperture (a Cassegrainian telescope), the atmospheric path, a wideband receiver, a sampling oscilloscope, the 2 ̆ 2 Pulse Distortion Analyzer, 2 ̆ 2 and a high-quality tape recorder. The Pulse Distortion Analyzer is designed to compare the transmitted pulses to recorded reference pulses and to detect differential area due to time dispersion. The analyzer includes a novel, feed forward, automatic gain control circuit which utilizes a linear photo detector and an <b>analog</b> <b>divider</b> to smooth a 300 Hz signal with a 100 microsecond response time. This is necessary to smooth out the signal amplitude fluctuations due to atmospheric turbulence effects. Both systems have been set up and tested on a one-mile path between the Oregon Graduate Center and Skyline Drive in Portland Oregon, using a 6328 Å He-Ne Laser. The ultimate use of the scintillation computer will be in a multi-wave-length experiment conducted for the Office of Naval Research, and will utilize a uniform, meteorologically instrumented path for comparison with theoretical predictions. The Pulse Distortion System will be incorporated into a joint experiment with the Electro-optic Organization of Sylvania Electronic Systems, Inc., Mountain View, California, to be conducted over a seven-mile path...|$|E
