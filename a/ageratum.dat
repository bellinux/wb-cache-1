[...] An example of Tephrosia apollinea was found by Harry St John Bridger Philby in 1936 at Raiyan, about [...] northeast of Sana'a. In Socotra, an {{island off the coast}} of Yemen, [...] it is typically found in the Croton shrubland of lowland plains at altitudes of between sea level and 100 metres on overgrazed soils, along with Cassia holsericea. In a 2000s analysis of vegetation in the woodlands of northern Socotra, the species was found to coexist with Achyranthus aspera, <b>Ageratum</b> conyzoides, Bidens chinensis, Forsskaolea viridis, Hibiscus vitifolius, Indigofera coerulea, Leucas urticifolia, Setaria adhaerens and Solanum incanum.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ageratum</b> conyzoides (billygoat-weed, chick weed, goatweed, whiteweed) is {{native to}} Tropical America, {{especially}} Brazil, and considered an invasive weed in many other regions. It is an herb that is 0.5-1 m. high, with ovate leaves 2-6 cm long, and flowers are white to mauve.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 22 - 29 mm for males and 23 - 26 mm for females. Adults feed on flower nectar {{of a variety of}} flowers, including Asclepias, Palicourea barbinervia, Cordia globosa, Lantana ovatifolia, Morinda citrifolia, Tournefortia hirsutissima, <b>Ageratum</b> conyzoides, Coffea arabica and Croton barahonensis.|$|E

50|$|This {{garden was}} first {{laid out by}} Italian prisoners of World War I, who were shifted to Ooty. They were placed {{under the control of}} the Military station in Ootacamund. Asters, <b>ageratum,</b> balsam, begonia, petunia, pansy, phlox, cosmos, zinnia and {{perennial}} flowers like salvia, delphinium, larkspur, and dahlia are the main attraction in this garden.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ageratum</b> {{has evolved}} an ingenious method of {{protecting}} itself from insects; {{it produces a}} methoprene-like compound which interferes with the normal function of the corpus allatum, the organ responsible for secreting juvenile hormone. This chemical triggers the next molting cycle to prematurely develop adult structures, and can render most insects sterile if ingested in large enough quantities.|$|E
50|$|Larvae feed {{on various}} Asteraceae species, {{including}} <b>Ageratum</b> houstonianum, Bidens pilosa and Calendula officinalis. The young larvae are smooth and green with a brown head. Later instars develop a purple herring-bone pattern {{with a black}} head. Finally they turn brown with a thin wavy white line along each side, and white spots. Pupation {{takes place in the}} soil.|$|E
50|$|The {{tropical}} hardwood hammock shrub {{and herb}} layer is sparse, mostly consisting of seedlings and saplings of canopy and subcanopy trees and shrubs. However, shiny-leaf wild-coffee (Psychotria nervosa) is not infrequently {{found in this}} layer, as well as herbs such as rouge plant (Rivina humilis), and false mint (Dicliptera sexangularis). Two species of native grasses can also be frequently found in this layer: bamboo grass (Lasciasis divaricata), and woods grass (Oplismenus hirtellus). Historically on the mainland, a variety of ferns and terrestrial orchids could be found, including Boston fern (Nephrolepis exaltata), Florida oncidium, and sword fern (Nephrolepis biserrata). Additional species from rockland hammocks include ghostplant, and Key's nutrush. Shrub and herb layer species with very limited distributions include helmet orchid (Galeandra beyrichii), and small-flowered orchid (Prescottia oligantha)--found only on the Miami Rock Ridge, and seashore <b>ageratum</b> (<b>Ageratum</b> littorale), and limestone flatsedge (Cyperus fuligineus)--found only in the Florida Keys.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ageratum</b> houstonianum (flossflower, bluemink, blueweed, pussy foot, Mexican paintbrush) is a cool-season annual plant often {{grown as}} bedding in gardens. The plant grows to 0.3-1 m high, with ovate to {{triangular}} leaves 2-7 cm long, and blue flowerheads (sometimes white, pink, or purple). The flower heads are borne in dense corymbs. The ray flowers are threadlike, {{leading to the}} common name.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ageratum</b> littorale, (Cape Sable whiteweed) is a {{plant species}} native to Florida, the common name {{referring}} to Cape Sable inside Everglades National Park. Some publications (e. g. Flora of North America) consider this {{as being the}} same species as the West Indian A. maritimum, but The Plant List accepts the two as distinct taxa. It is their lead that we are following here.|$|E
5000|$|Alphasatellites {{are single}} {{stranded}} satellite DNA that {{are dependent on}} a virus for transmission. The genome is a single circular single strand DNA molecule.

As begomoviruses are being characterised {{at the molecular level}} an increasing number of alphasatellites are being described.|$|E
50|$|Threats to this {{endangered}} species include {{the destruction of}} its wetland habitat, and natural disasters that could conceivably destroy entire populations, such as hurricanes. Exotic plant species such as billygoat weed (<b>Ageratum</b> conyzoides), scarlet pimpernel (Anagallis arvensis), feather fingergrass (Chloris virgata), and lantana (Lantana camara), are a threat. Feral goats, off-road vehicles, fire and pollution are threats to Cyperus trachysanthos on Oahu.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ageratum</b> littorale {{grows in}} beach sand and nearby {{thickets}} {{along the coast}} as well as hummocks and roadsides at elevations of less than 10 m. It is a trailing to decumbent perennial herb up to 50 cm tall, spreading by means of underground rhizomes. Stems are glabrous except at the nodes. Leaf blades are ovate to oblong, up to 4 cm long. Flowers are blue, lavender or white, in cyme-like arrays.|$|E
50|$|Eupatorieae is a {{tribe of}} over 2000 {{species of plants}} in the aster family. Most of the species are native to tropical, subtropical, and warm {{temperate}} areas of the Americas, but some are found elsewhere. Well-known members are Stevia rebaudiana (used as a sugar substitute), a number of medicinal plants (Eupatorium), {{and a variety of}} late summer to autumn blooming garden flowers, including <b>Ageratum</b> (flossflower) and Conoclinium (mistflower).|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 63 - 76 mm. The {{upper surface}} of the male forewings is pale lemon yellow with a large orange patch on the basal third. The female upper surface is deep ochre, {{the underside of the}} hindwing with a large brown patch. There are multiple generations per year on Cuba and Hispaniola. They feed on flower nectar of various flowers, including <b>Ageratum</b> conyzoides, Antigonon leptotus and Hibiscus species.|$|E
