2500|$|For {{the first}} time since 1988, the Camry was marketed in Australasia with a four-cylinder engine only. This {{decision}} was made as the Toyota Aurion—a model which derives from the Camry—was offered in V6 configuration only. This two-tier strategy went against Toyota Australia's previous formula of offering four- and six-cylinder engines in the mid-size Camry alongside the larger six-cylinder Avalon. The simplified Australian Camry range comprised [...] "Altise", [...] "Sportivo", [...] "Ateva", and [...] "Grande". The model range in New Zealand followed this closely, offered in three levels of specification: [...] "GL" [...] (<b>Altise),</b> [...] "Sportivo" [...] and [...] "GLX" [...] (Grande). Equipments levels correspond directly with the Australian cars, although the full suite of airbags were fitted as standard on the [...] "GL".|$|E
50|$|In Australia and New Zealand, the 2002 to 2006 Camry is {{available}} in five different trims: the <b>Altise,</b> Ateva, Sportivo, Grande (2004 onwards), and Azura. The <b>Altise,</b> Ateva, and Sportivo are available with either the 2.4 L four-cylinder or the 3.0 L V6 engine, whilst the Grande and Azura were only available with the V6. Only the <b>Altise</b> and Sportivo models could be fitted with a manual transmission — all other models are equipped with a four-speed automatic transmission. In 2003, the V6-powered <b>Altise</b> Sport model was introduced, which is basically the <b>Altise</b> model with the sports suspension that was fitted on the Sportivo and Azura models and was available in manual and automatic transmission. The Australian and New Zealand Camry Sportivo corresponds roughly to the American Camry SE.|$|E

5000|$|Introduced in late 2011, the XV50 series Camry in Australia and New Zealand {{was sold}} {{under a new}} two-tier naming and styling structure. For the {{gasoline}} models (ASV50R), <b>Altise</b> remains the base model while Ateva, Sportivo and Grande {{have been replaced by}} the Atara S, SX and SL. Australian Camrys have different interior fabrics, colour, and trim as well as the steering and suspension settings that were adapted for the local market.

50|$|When {{the revised}} range was {{launched}} in Australia and New Zealand in September 2004, the Grande model was reintroduced which, together with the Azura model, were the top-of-the-range models. The Grande however was fitted with the standard suspension rather than the sports suspension as fitted on the Azura model. The Grande and Azura models have Satellite Navigation (GPS) as standard equipment, and were the first Toyota models in Australia to be fitted with the new Toyota Link system. The Toyota Link system is a state-of-the-art satellite and mobile SMS GSM communications system that gives the driver access to roadside assistance and emergency help via the electrochromatic rear view mirror. In August 2005 the <b>Altise</b> Sport model was reintroduced (V6 auto only) together with <b>Altise</b> Limited (four-cylinder and V6) that has additional features. The Ateva model had an interior upgrade to leather trim and rear passenger air conditioning vents. The <b>Altise</b> was repositioned as a fleet model and the manual transmission was no longer available on V6 Sportivo models from January 2006 production. Automatic Camrys in Australia still used the dated four-speed because it retained the 3.0 V6 engine.|$|E
5000|$|The Australian and New Zealand {{models were}} {{significantly}} different from the other Camry models around the world and had around 77% locally developed components to suit Australian and New Zealand roads and driving conditions. The brakes, body panels (which would only fit on the Australian made body and chassis), headlights, seats, radio antenna and suspension were all locally developed after 10,000 km of extensive testing in New Zealand under the supervision of Toyota engineers. Power output on the <b>Altise</b> Sport, V6 Sportivo and Azura models was [...] compared with the [...] of the standard V6 models due to a high-flow rear muffler.|$|E

40|$|The European rusted {{flea beetle}} Neocrepidodera ferruginea (Scopoli, 1763) is {{reported}} {{for the first time}} from Québec and Ontario, Canada. It was likely introduced into southern Ontario at an international port on the Great Lakes in early 1970 s, or possibly earlier in the 1960 s. However, the exact location and date of introduction could not be precisely determined. The flea beetle has since dispersed northeastwards and reached Aylmer, north of Ottawa River, in Québec, by 2003. This is about 375 [*]km from Niagara Falls, where the oldest known specimens were collected in 1977. In 2009, various wild habitats and cultivated areas of Aylmer were surveyed. The host plants of the larvae could not be determined, but adults were swept from many plant species including various weeds and cultivated grasses: Alopecurus pratense (meadow foxtail), Dactylis glomerata (orchard-grass), Festuca rubra (red fescue-grass), and Poa pratensis (Kentucky blue-grass). Adults were also collected from flowers of several weeds: Aster sp. (undetermined species), Aster novae-angliae (New England aster), Ambrosia artemisiifolia (small ragweed), Echium vulgare (viper’s bugloss), Nasturtium officinale (water cress), Melilotus alba (white sweet-clover), Hypericum perforatum (common St. John’s-wort), Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife), Ranunculus acris (buttercup), and Solidago spp. (goldenrods). Since larvae are known to develop inside the roots and central stems of cereals, this new alien species represents a threat to Canadian agriculture, particularly if it reaches the Prairies in western Canada, where cereals represent a considerable part of their economy. European rusted flea beetle and <b>Altise</b> ferrugineuse européenne are suggested for the English and French common names of this flea beetle, respectively...|$|E
