500|$|In {{the months}} pre-dating Batmans release in June 1989, a popular culture {{phenomenon}} rose known as [...] "Batmania". Over $750 {{million worth of}} merchandise was sold. Cult filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith remembered: [...] "That summer was huge. You couldn't turn around without seeing the Bat-Signal somewhere. People were cutting it into their fucking heads. It was just the summer of Batman <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a comic book fan it was pretty hot." [...] Hachette Book Group USA published a novelization, Batman written by Craig Shaw Gardner. It remained on the New York Times Best Seller list throughout June 1989. Burton admitted he was annoyed by the publicity. David Handelman of The New York Observer categorized Batman as a high concept film. He believed [...] "it is less movie than a corporate behemoth".|$|E

Short instrumental versions of songs by The Cure, Pantera and Slayer were also played by Tomo Miličević, Shannon Leto and Tim Kelleher. The Vitamin String Quartet musicians {{who took part}} in the recording included two violinists, a violist, a cellist and a conductor. The performance of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] featured The Late Show's Gospel Choir, consisting of five men and five women dressed in red. After filming, Jared Leto described the band's excitement about being asked to record for MTV Unplugged stating, [...] "I think our generation, it was kind of a rite of passage, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> invited to do MTV Unplugged, it certainly was a pretty big deal. So many of our favorite bands did 'Unplugged' and still do it, so we were really thrilled to be asked." ...|$|E

Martin always used the excuse of poverty in Laredo, but, Tatangelo {{challenged}} him: [...] "I thought Laredo was a rich city that {{could do a lot}} of things." ...|$|E

2500|$|Secretary of Defense Gates {{summarized}} fundamental {{concerns with}} the practicality {{of the program}} concept: [...] "I don't know anybody at the Department of Defense, Mr. Tiahrt, who thinks that this program should, or would, ever be operationally deployed. The reality is that you would need a laser something like 20 to 30 times {{more powerful than the}} chemical laser in the plane right now {{to be able to get}} any distance from the launch site to fire....So, right now the ABL would have to orbit inside the borders of Iran in order to be able to try and use its laser to shoot down that missile in the boost phase. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to operationalize this you would be looking at 10 to 20 747s, at a billion and a half dollars apiece, and $100 million a year to operate. And there's nobody in uniform that I know who believes that this is a workable concept." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a November 19, 2015 radio {{interview}} with Hugh Hewitt, Palin {{was asked about}} the legalization of recreational marijuana in Alaska, to which Palin responded, [...] "We've got that libertarian streak in us, and I grew up in Alaska when pot was legal anyway. It was absolutely no big deal. I mean, you didn't smoke it because your parents would strangle you. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a jock and you were, you know, a Christian going to youth group, you just didn't do it, right? And I still believe that. But when it comes to picking our battles, for many of us in Alaska, legalization of marijuana just was never really a bright blip on the radar screen, so it didn't surprise me when the voters of Alaska went back to legalizing it. For some years there, it had not been legalized. I look on the national scene and think, 'Wow, of all things to be fighting over and battling over.' Especially when it comes to medical marijuana, I think, 'Hmm. It's just not my baby.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Catholicism {{is shown}} to still exist in some form in the 31st century, as the show makes several {{references}} to the [...] "Space Pope": in the opening titles of [...] "Hell is Other Robots" [...] (stating that the show has been [...] "Condemned by the Space Pope"); in [...] "A Bicyclops Built for Two", with Bender's rhetorical question [...] "Is the Space Pope reptilian?"; and in [...] "I Dated a Robot", in an endorsement {{at the end of}} an educational film ("Brought to you by the Space Pope"). [...] In the last of these, a graphic displays a picture of the Space Pope as a reptilian alien in Papal vestments, encircled by the words Crocodylus pontifex. Additionally, in the episode [...] "Put Your Head on My Shoulders", Fry and Amy Wong have a lighthearted conversation about their parents' expectations of them; Fry remarks, [...] "What am I, the Pope?" [...] to which Amy replies, [...] "Yeah, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the Pope they'd be all, 'Straighten your Pope hat,' and 'Put on your good vestments!'" [...] In the sixth season episode, The Duh-Vinci Code, the cast travels to Rome (announced as Future-Roma), where the Space Pope directs the ship's landing at the Vatican. A few episodes later, in [...] "The Silence of the Clamps," [...] the Space Pope is shown conducting the wedding of the Donbot's older daughter.|$|E

2500|$|Following the killing, Harambe became {{subject of}} {{multiple}} viral memes. Vox wrote in November that Harambe has an [...] "undeniable status as 2016’s meme of the year." [...] As People magazine wrote: [...] "Harambe continues {{to live on}} in the collective mind of the internet, entering into a rarefied state of venerated meme status." [...] One of the most widespread memes was noted by The Washington Post and New York magazine who observed a proliferation of over-the-top and fake tributes to Harambe. [...] "The idea is, the more intense and more sincere-seeming the expression of mourning is, the funnier the joke." [...] For example, the [...] "Dicks out for Harambe" [...] meme {{can be seen as}} a fake tribute to an incident that would normally engender sincere mourning. As Aja Romano of Vox wrote, [...] "If you were a progressive, the Harambe meme gave you a chance to mock what you viewed as the hypocritical haranguing of the mainstream while avoiding real issues of social justice; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a conservative, the Harambe meme gave you a chance to mock liberal hysteria." [...] One meme is a play on conspiracy theories, such as [...] "Bush did Harambe", a reference to the 9/11 conspiracy theories. In Australia, people joked about supporting Harambe's corpse as a write-in candidate on the ballot for the federal election. Public Policy Polling included Harambe in their polling for the U.S. presidential election. The dead gorilla had 5% support in late July 2016 (ahead of Green Party nominee Jill Stein) and 2% in August 2016 (tied with Stein).|$|E
