5|$|Biographies {{published}} {{after his}} death were typically heavy on eulogy. Theodore Martin's five-volume magnum opus was authorised and supervised by Queen Victoria, and her influence shows in its pages. Nevertheless, it is an accurate and exhaustive account. Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria (1921) was more critical, but it was discredited in part by mid-twentieth-century biographers such as Hector Bolitho and Roger Fulford, who (unlike Strachey) had access to Victoria's journal and letters. Popular myths about Prince Albert—such as the claim that he introduced Christmas trees to Britain—are dismissed by scholars. Recent biographers, such as Stanley Weintraub, portray Albert as a figure in a tragic romance, who died too soon and was mourned by his lover for <b>a</b> <b>lifetime.</b> <b>In</b> the 2009 movie The Young Victoria, Albert, played by Rupert Friend, is made into a heroic character; in the fictionalised depiction of the 1840 shooting, he is struck by a bullet—something {{that did not happen}} in real life.|$|E

25|$|During the American Revolutionary War, {{a policy}} {{similar to the}} Navy's Press Gangs was introduced. Two acts were passed, the Recruiting Act 1778 and the Recruiting Act 1779, for the impressment of individuals. For some men {{this would have been}} for being drunk and disorderly. The chief {{advantages}} of these acts was in the number of volunteers brought in under the apprehension of impressment. To avoid impressment, some recruits incapacitated themselves by cutting off the thumb and forefinger of the right hand. Both acts were repealed in 1780. The British Government also released criminals and debtors from prison on the condition they joined the army. Three entire regiments during the American Revolution were raised from this early release programme. Of the Volunteer recruits, some would find they had been enticed to take the King's shilling under false pretenses and many men would find they had signed to <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> <b>in</b> the army.|$|E

25|$|In 1961, Farrar {{was sent}} by Pathé to Saudi Arabia, where the company was {{producing}} a documentary, and during this trip he visited the deserts of both Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Jordan.

500|$|Åkerman {{made her}} acting debut on the Canadian science fiction series [...] in 1997, {{in a smaller}} role as a robot. She {{originally}} landed a role on an MTV pilot with Rachel McAdams, but the project was never {{picked up by the}} network. In 2000, she guest starred on Relic Hunter and had a smaller role in the American film The Skulls. The following year, she made appearances on the Canada-based series Doc and Twice in <b>a</b> <b>Lifetime.</b> <b>In</b> 2001, she moved to Los Angeles, California in hopes of pursuing a broader acting career. At first, she worked as a waitress and stayed at a friend's house. In 2002, she received smaller role in the film The Utopian Society. The film was edited by Francesco Sondelli, the guitarist for alternative rock band Ozono. Sondelli asked Åkerman to help the band with song lyrics and later asked her to sing. Åkerman subsequently became the band's singer, and they changed their name to The Petalstones. The band's debut album, Stung, was released in August 2005, but Åkerman eventually left to focus on her acting career, admitting that she [...] "actually can't sing". She described her singing as [...] "sort of a self-made, self-taught, if-you-can't-hit-the-note-scream-it kind of thing".|$|E
500|$|The Japanese and English {{portrayals of}} Spike have also drawn praise individually. While praising the Japanese cast as [...] "perfectly {{complementing}} the characters", Kenneth Lee of EX.org argued that [...] "there {{could be no}} one else to fill the role of Spike Spiegel except Yamadera". Meanwhile, IGN's Ramsey Isler stated that [...] "Steve Blum launched his career into new heights when he gave the performance of <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> <b>in</b> the English dub of the series, giving Spike a sense of smooth, effortless cool that many argue surpassed the original Japanese version." [...] Commending the principal American cast's work {{as one of the best}} English dubs, Serdar Yegulalp of About.com highlighted Blum as Spike as the standout performance of the series, stating that [...] "Cynicism never sounded this suave or self-assured". However, AnimeNation's John Oppliger felt Spike's character was mishandled in the English dub, where he was depicted as a [...] "carefree playboy" [...] whose ambivalent taunts [...] "come across as casual off-the-cuff bluffs, unlike his weighty, solemn statements in the Japanese version". Blum himself has called Spike a [...] "gigantic benchmark" [...] in his career and life, saying that [...] "Spike changed everything" [...] for him. He stated that his role as Spike opened up new opportunities for voicing characters, including T.O.M. on Toonami and Jamie on Megas XLR.|$|E

500|$|Stroud {{was convicted}} of first-degree murder, {{and sentenced to death}} by hanging on May 2. [...] He was ordered to await {{execution}} of his sentence in solitary confinement, but this was thrown out in December by the U.S. Supreme Court. In a second trial held on May 28, 1917, he was also convicted, but received a life sentence, which Stroud appealed, and Solicitor General John W. Davis [...] "confessed error" [...] because he wanted Stroud to receive the death penalty. As a result, Stroud was tried for a third time in May 1918, and on [...] June 28 he was again sentenced to death by hanging. [...] The Supreme Court intervened, upholding the death sentence, which was scheduled to be carried out on April 23, 1920. Stroud's mother appealed to President Woodrow Wilson and his wife, Edith Wilson, and the execution was halted just eight days before it was to be carried out; the gallows had already been built and viewed by Stroud from his cell. Stroud's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Leavenworth's warden, T. W. Morgan, strongly opposed the decision given Stroud's reputation for violence. [...] Morgan persuaded the President to stipulate that since Stroud was originally sentenced to await his death sentence in solitary confinement, those conditions should prevail until the halted execution could be carried out. President Wilson's Attorney General, Alexander Mitchell Palmer, saw to it that Stroud was sentenced to <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> <b>in</b> solitary.|$|E
