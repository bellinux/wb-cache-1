40|$|This paper {{reports the}} design and {{analysis}} of an American Sign Language (ASL) <b>alphabet</b> <b>translation</b> system implemented in hardware using a Field-Programmable Gate Array. The system process consists of three stages, the first being the communication with the neuromorphic camera (also called Dynamic Vision Sensor, DVS) sensor using the Universal Serial Bus protocol. The feature extraction of the events generated by the DVS is {{the second part of}} the process, consisting of a presentation of the digital image processing algorithms developed in software, which aim to reduce redundant information and prepare the data for the third stage. The last stage of the system process is the classification of the ASL alphabet, achieved with a single artificial neural network implemented in digital hardware for higher speed. The overall result is the development of a classification system using the ASL signs contour, fully implemented in a reconfigurable device. The experimental results consist of a comparative analysis of the recognition rate among the alphabet signs using the neuromorphic camera in order to prove the proper operation of the digital image processing algorithms. In the experiments performed with 720 samples of 24 signs, a recognition accuracy of 79. 58 % was obtained...|$|E
40|$|Data is {{compressible}} by presuming {{a priori}} knowledge {{known as a}} data model, and applying an appropriate encoding to produce a shorter description. The two aspects of compression data modeling and coding - however are not always conceived as distinct, nor implemented as such in compression systems, leading to difficulties of an architectural nature. For example, how would one make improvements upon a data model whose specific form has been standardized into the encoding and decoding processes? How would one design coding for new types of data such as in biology and finance, without creating a new system in each case? How would one compress data that has been encrypted when the conventional encoder requires data-in-the-clear to extract redundancy? And how would mobile acquisition devices obtain good compression with lightweight encoders? These and many other challenges can be tackled by an alternative compression architecture. This work contributes a complete "model-code separation" system architecture for compression, based on a core set of iterative message-passing algorithms over graphical models representing the modeling and coding aspects of compression. Systems following this architecture resolve the challenges posed by current systems, and stand to benefit further from future advances {{in the understanding of}} data and the algorithms that process them. In the main portion of this thesis, the lossless compression of binary sources is examined. Examples are compressed under the proposed architecture and compared against some of the best systems today and to theoretical limits. They show that the flexibility of model-code separation does not incur a performance penalty. Indeed, the compression performance of such systems is competitive with and sometimes superior to existing solutions. The architecture is further extended to diverse situations of practical interest, such as mismatched and partially known models, different data and code alphabets, and lossy compression. In the process, insights into model uncertainty and universality, data representation and <b>alphabet</b> <b>translation,</b> and model-quantizer separation and low-complexity quantizer design are revealed. In many ways, the proposed architecture is uniquely suitable for understanding and tackling these problems. Throughout, a discourse is maintained over architectural and complexity issues, with a view toward practical implementability. Of interest to system designers, issues such as rate selection, doping, and code selection are addressed, and a method similar to EXIT-chart analysis is developed for evaluating when compression is possible. Suggestions for system interfaces and algorithmic factorization are distilled, and examples showing compression with realistic data and tasks are given to complete the description of a system architecture accessible to broader adoption. Ultimately, this work develops one architecturally principled approach toward flexible, modular, and extensible compression system design, with practical benefits. More broadly, it represents the beginning of many directions for promising research at the intersection of data compression, information theory, machine learning, coding, and random algorithms. by Ying-zong Huang.

50|$|With the {{completion}} of the church on Atka, Father Jacob turned to education of the children, teaching them to read and write both Russian and Unangan Aleut. Initially the Russian-American Company helped support the school, but in 1841 the school was re-organized as a parish school. Many of his students would prove to be distinguished Aleut leaders. While living in the north areas was difficult, Father Jacob was active in the intellectual life as well; in addition to his own subsistence needs, he was active in collecting and preparing fish and marine animal specimens for the museums in Moscow and St. Petersburg. He corresponded with St Innocent on linguistics and translation matters. He worked on an adequate Unangan-Aleut <b>alphabet</b> and <b>translations</b> of the Holy Scriptures and other church publications. In addition to praises from St. Innocent he began to receive awards for his services. In time he was elevated to Archpriest and received the Order of St. Anna.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} forty years, {{there has been}} {{considerable}} international work on country names, their exonyms and their standardization. This work {{has been based on}} official written names. In contrast, this paper examines several issues relating to nonwritten country names within Deaf communities. First, the various systems used to form country names within signed languages are outlined. These can include “descriptive” semantic etymology based on behavioural traits of individuals from the countries, elements transferred from the spoken or written form of a name, via mouthing, finger spelling (using a manual <b>alphabet),</b> and loan <b>translation</b> of {{all or part of the}} name. Second, four issues in regard to country name signs are commented on, namely (a) the relationship between official languages and signed languages, (b) generational differences in the use of specific country names, (c) the influence of political correctness on country names, and (d) the work of the World Federation of the Deaf on country names, specifically the publication of Gestuno in 1975 and the consequential development of International Sign Pidgin. The final matter to be treated is exonyms and their standardization in signed rather than written languages...|$|R
40|$|Spoken words {{exist for}} mere moments, but from this {{fleeting}} acoustic signal {{we are able}} to apprehend considerable information. We can decode the linguistic message of the speaker as well as information about her gender, age, region of origin, identity and emotional state. As adult listeners, we are so adept at speech perception that the ability seems trivial. However, the ease with which we perceive speech belies the complexity of the perceptual, cognitive and neural mechanisms involved. The primary reason that speech perception is so complex is there is no straightforward, one‐to‐one correspondence between a speech segment (e. g., /d/) and its acoustic qualities. About fifty years ago, researchers presumed that there was a simple one‐to‐one relationship and based on this hypothesis attempted to build a reading machine for the blind whereby written text was translated into a sound <b>alphabet</b> with sound‐by‐sound <b>translation.</b> However, even with many hours of training, people could not comprehend the machine’s speech. This failure led to the discovery that speech is not a sequence of discrete sounds as text is a string of separate letters (Liberman, 1996). Acoustic elements of a spoken word (e. g., the three speech segments in ‘dean’, /din/) are not produced discretely. Rather, the acoustic information fo...|$|R
