40|$|This {{paper is}} about the design of {{improved}} algorithms to solve Isomorphisms of Polynomials (IP) problems. These problems were first explicitly related {{to the problem of}} finding the secret key of some asymmetric cryptographic algorithms (such as Matsumoto and Imai's C # scheme of [13], or some variations of Patarin's HFE scheme of [15]). Moreover, in [15], it was shown that IP can be used in order to design an asymmetric <b>authentication</b> <b>or</b> <b>signature</b> scheme in a straightforward way. We also introduce the more general Morphisms of Polynomials problem (MP). As we see in this paper, these problems IP and MP have deep links with famous problems such as the Isomorphism of Graphs problem or the problem of fast multiplication of n n matrices. The complexities of our algorithms for IP are still not polynomial, but they are much more e#cient than the previously known algorithms. For example, for the IP problem of finding the two secret matrices of a Matsumoto-Imai C # scheme over K = F q, the complexity of our algorithms is O(q n/ 2) instead of O(q (n 2)) for previous algorithms. (In [14], the C # scheme was broken, but the secret key was not found). Moreover, we have algorithms to achieve a complexity O(q 3 2 n) on any system of n quadratic equations with n variables over K = F q (not only equations from C #). We also show that the problem of deciding whether a polynomial isomorphism exists between two sets of equations is not NP-complete (assuming the classical hypothesis about Arthur-Merlin games), but solving IP is at least as di#cult as the Graph Isomorphism problem (GI) (and perhaps much more di#cult), so that IP ! is unl ikely to be solvable in polynomial time. Moreover, the more general Morphisms of Polynomials problem (MP) is NP-hard. Finally, we suggest [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aggregation schemes {{allow to}} combine several {{cryptographic}} values like message <b>authentication</b> codes <b>or</b> <b>signatures</b> into a shorter value such that, despite compression, some notion of unforgeability is preserved. Recently, Eikemeier et al. (SCN 2010) considered {{the notion of}} history-free sequential aggregation for message authentication codes, where the sequentiallyexecuted aggregation algorithm {{does not need to}} receive the previous messages in the sequence as input. Here we discuss the idea for signatures where the new aggregate does not rely on the previous messages and public keys either, thus inhibiting the costly verifications in each aggregation step as in previous schemes by Lysyanskaya et al. (Eurocrypt 2004) and Neven (Eurocrypt 2008). Analogously to MACs we argue about new security definitions for such schemes and compare them to previous notions for history-dependent schemes. We finally give a construction based on the BLS signature scheme which satisfies our notion. ...|$|R
30|$|For {{the case}} of static databases, the above problem can be {{addressed}} by trivially adopting message <b>authentication</b> <b>or</b> digital <b>signature</b> technique. Namely, the client signs each data item before uploading it to the cloud server, and the cloud server is required to return the requested data item together with its valid signature. Nevertheless, this solution cannot work well when the database is updated. The main challenge is related to how to revoke the valid signatures given to the cloud server for the previous values of the modified data item. A naive solution is that the client locally keeps track of every change. However, such a solution negates the advantages of database outsourcing. Although existing techniques such as accumulators [10, 11, 44], and authentication data structures [35, 42, 49, 52] that can be adopted to address such problem, these solutions either rely on nonconstant size assumptions (e.g., the q-Strong Diffie-Hellman assumptions) or require expensive operations such as the generation of primes and re-shuffling procedures.|$|R

The paper {{deals with}} the {{mathematical}} apparatus of recurrent V?k - and Uk ?sequences, on whose basis a method of asymmetric encryption information is presented, the essence {{of which is to}} replace the exponentiation via calculation of a certain element of Uk ?sequence. The peculiarity of the presented method of encryption is that all the procedures are carried out consistently, so a specialized processor was offered for encryption (decryption) containing one device for calculating elements of V?k - and Uk ?sequences. To simplify the organization of memory, it is implemented as a separate memory block for storage of various data. A comparison of processors that implement the proposed method and the known Al Gamal method shows that the former offer almost the same time of encryption - decryption at k = 2 and more time at k > 2. However, a significant advantage of this method is that it allows setting the desired cryptographic reliability depending on the parameter k. Also, the advantage of the developed specialized processors of asymmetric encryption based on recurrent V?k - and Uk ?sequences may be the principles of their organization that can become the basis for construction of specialized processors of different cryptographic purpose that implement the public key technology, in particular in <b>authentication</b> <b>or</b> digital <b>signature</b> tasks, where the speed advantages of cryptographic transformations based on V?k - and Uk?sequences may be more significant and important. ? ?????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??????? ????????????

40|$|Abstract. Authentication {{watermarking}} is {{a hidden}} data inserted into an image, {{in order to}} detect any alterations. It seems to be almost impossible to design a really secure authentication watermarking without making use of the solid cryptography theory and techniques. In a cryptography-based authentication watermarking, a message <b>authentication</b> code (<b>or</b> digital <b>signature)</b> of the whole image is computed and the resulting code is inserted into the image itself. However, inserting the code alters the image and consequently its authentication code, invalidating the watermark. To avoid this problem, for gray-scale or color image, usually the least significant bits (LSBs) are cleared, the authentication code of the LSB-cleared image is computed and then the code is inserted into LSBs. Surely, one cannot perform the same procedure for binary images. This paper proposes a quite simple solution for inserting a secure authentication watermarking in dispersed-dot halftone images. This technique can also be applied {{to any kind of}} binary images (including clustered-dot halftones), though the visual quality is not as good as when applied to dispersed-dot halftones. The proposed technique can be used with both secret-key or public-key ciphers. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work is {{motivated}} by future developments of mass mar-kets, where cryptographic infrastructures will {{become more and more}} important. One core component of such an infrastructure is a secure cryptographic hash function, which is used for a lot of applications like challenge-response <b>authentication</b> systems <b>or</b> digital <b>signature</b> schemes. Low budget impelementations of such components are therefore very important. In particular, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has started a competition for a new secure hash algorithm (SHA- 3). New hash functions should outperform older hash functions and thus we study the performance of some of the candidates. A significant comparison between the submitted candidates is only possible, if third party imple-mentations of all proposed hash functions are provided. Of the submitted candidates, we implemented Grøstl, JH and Skein. Our focus on low budget cryptographic solutions makes it natural to investigate possible optimizations for area efficient implementations, and to neglect pure high-throughput considerations. Our results show, that- while all investigated candidates are quite large compared to a compact AES implementation- it is possible to implement all candidates reasonably small. In our evaluation JH {{is by far the most}} compact implementation, whereas Skein is the largest one. Our Grøstl implementation on the other hand is smaller than Skein and much faster than both other candidates and easily beats them in the throughput-area ratio by a factor of four...|$|R
