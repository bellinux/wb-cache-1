40|$|Abstract—Amplify-and-forward (AF) relay based {{cooperation}} {{has been}} investigated in the literature given its simplicity and practicality. Two models for AF, namely, fixed gain and fixed power relaying, have been extensively studied. In fixed gain relaying, the relay gain is fixed but its transmit power varies {{as a function of}} the source-relay (SR) channel gain. In fixed power relaying, the relay’s instantaneous transmit power is fixed, but its gain varies. We propose a general AF cooperation model in which an average transmit power constrained relay jointly adapts its gain and transmit power {{as a function of the}} channel gains. We derive the optimal <b>AF</b> <b>gain</b> policy that minimizes the fading-averaged symbol error probability (SEP) of MPSK and present insightful and tractable lower and upper bounds for it. We then analyze the SEP of the optimal policy. Our results show that the optimal scheme is up to 39. 7 % and 47. 5 % more energy-efficient than fixed power relaying and fixed gain relaying, respectively. Further, the weaker the direct source-destination link, the greater are the energy-efficiency gains. I...|$|E

Dietary treatments included corn oil (CO), animal fat (AF), fish oil (FO) and a dry blended (animal and vegetable) fat product (DB) at either 0. 9 or 1. 5 % calcium. Diets were isocaloric with each containing an equal number of calories from fats. Birds were reared in floor brooder pens and fed experimental diets from Day 1 to 21 and then assigned the same dietary treatments in one of two environmentally controlled chambers.

These studies, undertaken in patients with AF and structural heart diseases, demonstrate, that - according to the pathophysiological concept of atrial remodeling - significant changes on electrical, contractile, and structural level, which are characterized by a huge interindividual variability. There were no associations between different remodelling levels. We found no relationship between remodeling and AF duration and left atrial hemodynamic load, respectively.

The accuracy of the undertaken analytical approach is confirmed through comparison with simulation results. It is shown that significant capacity enhancement can be achieved through SCM implementation at R, for all the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values on both hops, but especially in the region of small SNRs on hops.

40|$|Background: We {{previously}} {{demonstrated the}} small heat shock protein, HSPB 1, to prevent tachycardia remodeling in in vitro and {{in vivo models}} for Atrial Fibrillation (<b>AF).</b> To <b>gain</b> insight into its mechanism of action, we examined the protective effect of all 10 members of the HSPB family on tachycardia remodeling. Furthermore, modulating effects of HSPB on RhoA GTPase activity and F-actin stress fiber formation were examined, as this pathway was found of prime importance in tachycardia remodeling events and the initiation of AF. Methods and Results: Tachypacing (4 Hz) of HL- 1 atrial myocytes significantly and progressively reduced the amplitude of Ca 2 + transients (CaT). In addition to HSPB 1, also overexpression of HSPB 6, HSPB 7 and HSPB 8 protected against tachypacinginduced CaT reduction. The protective effect was independent of HSPB 1. Moreover, tachypacing induced RhoA GTPase activity and caused F-actin stress fiber formation. The ROCK inhibitor Y 27632 significantly prevented tachypacing-induced F-actin formation and CaT reductions, showing that RhoA activation is required for remodeling. Although all protective HSPB members prevented the formation of F-actin stress fibers, their mode of action differs. Whilst HSPB 1, HSPB 6 and HSPB 7 acted via direct prevention of F-actin formation, HSPB 8 -protection was mediated via inhibition of RhoA GTPase activity. Conclusion: Overexpression of HSPB 1, as well as HSPB 6, HSPB 7 and HSPB 8 independently protect against tachycardia remodeling by attenuation of the RhoA GTPase pathway at different levels.

The BTB SCM scheme outperforms the WTB SCM scheme on the basis of outage probability for best and moderate sets of subcarrier pairs. The outage {{performance of}} poor set of subcarrier pairs is comparable in both schemes and show lower outage only in the high SNR regime. On the basis of outage capacity performance comparison, it is concluded that the BTB SCM scheme outperforms the WTB SCM scheme for all range of SNR.

Furthermore, it is shown that the percentage increase in outage capacity due to BTB SCM decreases as the SNR increases.|$|R

There was an almost 4 -fold increase in risk of AF in patients with stage 4 CKD compared with age-matched and sex-matched patients without CKD. 5 – 7 CKD is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerotic disease, 8 but conflicting data exist about the incremental effect of CKD and its severity on the risk of ischemic stroke in the setting of AF. Although several latest studies have reported that CKD is associated with increased risk of stroke among patients with AF, 5, 9, 10 patients with renal disease were under-represented in most trials that validated stroke risk stratifica-tion schemes, and current risk scores, such as CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc, do not include CKD as a potential risk fac-tor for thromboembolic events. 11, 12 Therefore, there is limited information on whether moderate–severe CKD improves the predictive value of stroke risk stratification.

While most earlier works used singular perturbation theory and assumed that an isolated real root exists for the nonlinear set of algebraic equations that constitute the slow subsystem, here, two time-scale systems are analyzed {{in the context of}} integral manifolds. It is shown that the singularly perturbed system has a center manifold and, for small values of the slow state, an approximate solution of the nonlinear set of transcendental equations can be computed. Geometric singular perturbation theory is used as the model-reduction technique, and modified composite control design is used to formulate the stabilizing control laws for slow state tracking. The control laws are independent of the scalar perturbation parameter and an upper bound for it, and the closed-loop error signals are determined such that uniform boundedness of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. Additionally, asymptotic stabilization is shown for the nonlinear regulation problem.

The presence of AF increases lifetime stroke risk nearly 5 -fold. Conventionally, patients at moderate or high risk of stroke have been prescribed antiplatelet agents or vitamin K antagonists to reduce the risk, but each has significant limitations. Accordingly, the development of new oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors [DTIs] and factor Xa inhibitors) has attracted significant interest.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} for {{the first}} time the application of wavelet entropy (WE) to detect episodes of the most common cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation (AF), automatically from the electrocardiogram (ECG). Given that AF is often asymptomatic and usually presents very brief initial episodes, its early automatic detection is clinically relevant to improve AF treatment and prevent risks for the patients. After discarding noisy TQ intervals from the ECG, the WE has been computed over the median TQ segment obtained from the 10 previous noise-free beats under study. In this way, the P-waves or the fibrillatory waves present in the recording were highlighted or attenuated, respectively, thus enabling the patient’s rhythm identification (sinus rhythm or AF). Results provided a discriminant ability of about 95 %, which is comparable to previous works. However, in contrast to most of them, which are mainly based on quantifying RR series variability, the proposed algorithm is able to deal with patients under rate-control therapy or with a reduced heart rate variability during AF. Additionally, it also presents interesting properties, such as the lowest delay in detecting AF or sinus rhythm, the ability to detect episodes as brief as five beats in length or its integration facilities under real-time beat-by-beat ECG monitoring systems.

40|$|Two-way {{relaying}} in wireless {{systems has}} initiated a large research effort {{during the past}} few years. While one-way relay with a single data flow introduces loss in spectral efficiency due to its half-duplex operation, two-way relaying based on wireless network coding regains part of this loss by simultaneously processing the two data flows. In a broader perspective, the two-way traffic pattern is rather limited and it is of interest to investigate other traffic patterns where such a simultaneous processing of information flows can bring performance advantage. In this paper we consider a scenario beyond the usual two-way relaying: a four-way relaying, where each of the two Mobile Stations (MSs) has a two-way connection to the same Base Station (BS), while each connection is through a dedicated Relay Station (RS). While both RSs are in the range of the same BS, they are assumed to have antipodal positions within the cell, such that they do not interfere with each other. We introduce and analyze a two-phase transmission scheme to serve the four-way traffic pattern defined in this scenario. Each phase consists of combined broadcast and multiple access. We analyze the achievable rate region of the new schemes for two different operational models for the RS, Decode-and-Forward (DF) and Amplify-and-Forward (AF), respectively. We compare the performance with a state-of-the-art reference scheme, time sharing is used between the two MSs, while each MS is served through a two-way relaying scheme. The results indicate that, when the RS operates in a DF mode, the achievable rate regions are significantly enlarged. On the other hand, for <b>AF</b> relaying, the <b>gains</b> are rather modest. The practical implication of the presented work is a novel insight on how to improve the spatial reuse in wireless cellular networks by coordinating the transmissions of the antipodal relays.

30|$|Subcarrier mapping (SCM), {{which is}} {{considered}} to be a capacity-maximization scheme for a dual-hop OFDM relay system, is studied extensively in the literature [6 – 16]. Two types of ordered SCM schemes, i.e., worst-to-best (WTB) and best-to-best (BTB) are commonly considered. For the purpose of pairing the subcarriers of a source-to-relay link or hop- 1 to the subcarriers of a relay-to-destination link or hop- 2, the subcarriers of each hop are ordered in ascending/descending order of magnitudes of their channel frequency response (CFR). In WTB SCM, the received signal on a subcarrier of hop- 1 with a worst CFR, i.e., the subcarrier with lowest magnitude of CFR is forwarded on the best subcarrier, i.e., the subcarrier with greatest magnitude of CFR, of hop- 2. The second worst subcarrier of hop- 1 is mapped to the second best subcarrier of hop- 2 and so on. In BTB SCM, the received signal on subcarrier of hop- 1 with best CFR is forwarded on the best subcarrier of hop- 2. The second best subcarrier of hop- 1 is mapped to the second best subcarrier of hop- 2 and so on. In particular, the mapping of subcarriers for an OFDM AF relay system is initially introduced in [6]. In [7], numerical analysis for SCM with reduced signaling overhead, by using the subsets of subcarriers, is presented. In [8], close-form expressions for end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and capacity are derived for a downlink dual-hop orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) AF relay system by considering Rayleigh fading on hop 2. In [9], close-form capacity analysis is presented by considering Rayleigh fading on both hops. In [10], analysis of a dual-hop OFDM relay system is presented for AF as well as DF relay. In [11], ergodic capacity comparison is presented for different mapping schemes and relaying protocols. In [12], SCM is studied for the bit-error rate (BER) minimization. In [13], different SCM schemes are compared and close-form expressions are derived for BER and capacity in Rayleigh fading. An interesting recent work on SCM-based opportunistic relaying, presented in [14, 15], is worth mentioning. Specifically, [14] presents an optimized solution to minimize the sum power subject to sum rate constraint for the dual-hop OFDM system. In [15], capacity maximization subject to total power constraint is investigated. It is shown that a proposed scheme achieves maximum capacity for various positions of relay in a dual-hop system.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of multimedia services, wireless communication engineers may face {{a major challenge}} {{to meet the demand}} of higher data-rate communication over error-prone mobile radio channels. As a promising solution, the concept of cooperative communication, where a so-called relay node is formed to assist the direct link, has recently been applied to alleviate the severe pathloss and shadowing effects in wireless systems. In addition, without spending extra spectrum and power resources, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems have been shown to provide an immense improvement in system performance compared to its single-antenna counterpart. As such, cooperative MIMO communication is essential for wireless and mobile networks because of its remarkable increase in spectral efficiency and reliability. Although the utilization of cooperative communication in MIMO systems has gained great attention in the literature, most of the research works have assumed perfect conditions. Inspired by the aforementioned discussion, this thesis takes a step further to investigate the performance of cooperative communications with practical constraints. The thesis provides a general framework for performance analysis of cooperative communications subject to several practical constraints such as antenna correlation, rank-deficiency of the channel matrix, co-channel interference, and interference-limited constraint of cognitive radio networks based on an underlay spectrum-sharing approach. The thesis is divided into six parts. The first part investigates the performance of orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) over MIMO relay networks in Nakagami-m fading channels under the antenna correlation effect. The second part extends the full-rank MIMO channel to the case of the MIMO channel matrix being of rank-deficiency. Several important findings on the impact of the single-keyhole effect (SKE) and double-keyhole effect (DKE) are observed for two types of amplifying mechanism at the relay, namely, linear and squaring approaches. An important observation corroborated by our studies is that for offering a tradeoff between performance and complexity, we should use the linear approach for SKE and the squaring approach for DKE. The third part generalizes the keyhole effect to multi-keyhole channels. The exact and asymptotic expressions for symbol error probability (SEP) are derived for some specific cases such as multi-keyhole MIMO/multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel. The fourth part proposes a distributed Alamouti space-time code for two-way fixed <b>gain</b> amplify-and-forward (<b>AF)</b> relaying. In particular, closed-form expressions for approximated ergodic sum-rate and exact pairwise error probability (PWEP) are derived for Nakagami-m fading channels. To reveal further insights into array and diversity gains, an asymptotic PWEP is also obtained. The fifth part analyzes the outage performance of a two-way fixed <b>gain</b> <b>AF</b> relay system with beamforming, arbitrary antenna correlation, and co-channel interference (CCI).

40|$|The {{information}} densities in {{magnetic recording}} {{systems have been}} in- creased considerably {{over the last few}} decades. Much <b>af</b> the <b>gain</b> in the in- formation density can be ascribed ta the improvement af the magnetic prop- erties af the recording media. However, recording on a magnetic medium is a camplex process which, despite extensive research in the past, is only partly understood. The purpose af the research described in this thesis is ta contribute towards a better understanding af the recording process. The approach that has been followed is a combination af experiment al study with numerical modelling. The thesis consists af four parts, two on the magnetic hysteresis and two on the recording process. 1 : Experimental study of the hysteresis The technique af magnetic recording is possible only thanks ta the magnetic hysteresis. (Hysteresis is the property af magnetic media ta remain magne- tized af ter a temporary exposure ta a magnetic field.) Two new methods for studying the hysteresis af recording media have been developed. The first methad is based upon a generalization af the Wohlfarth re- lation. With this methad, the interactions between the magnetic units in the medium can be studied. In the original methad, the effects af these interactions could be compared for only two initial states af the material, the bulk-erased and the entirely-magnetized state. The generalization en- ables a comparison ta be made between any two initial remanent states. Application af this new methad on a particulate tape sample has revealed the complexity af the interactions. The second methad cap be used ta study the intrinsic magnetic proper- ties af recording media, irrespective af their easy magnetization direction. The demagnetizing fields that may arise from components af the magne- tization perpendicular ta a sample are compensated in this methad. The methad has been applied ta a sputtered Co-Cr medium and a Metal Evap- orated Go-Ni-O medium. The results show that there is a remarkablë re- semblance between these two media in respect of the angular dependence of their coercivity. 2 : Modelling the hysteresis For an accurate simulation of the magnetic hysteresis process, the well- known moving-Preisach and Stoner-Wohlfarth hysteresis models have been combined. With a simple modification, a fast numerical implementation of the combined hysteresis model has been obtained. The magnetic interac- tions, incorporated in a fashion similar to that used in the moving-Preisach model, can account for many of the details of the minor loops, including the anhysteretic susceptibility. The vector properties of the new hystere- sis model are the same as those of the Stoner- Wohlfarth model. With the combination of the two models, the hysteresis 100 ps of different recording media, including the Metal Evaporated Go-Ni-O medium, can be repro- duced very accurately. Only the very fine details of the hysteresis process, involving the interactions between the magnetic units, are not simulated correctly. This has been demonstrated with the new method for studying these interactions. 3 : Experimental study of the recording process Much about the recording process itself can be learned from specific record- ing experiments. The recording process on thick particulate media has been investigated by applying a new analysis method. This method is based upon a scaling argument. The length of a magnetic transition is assumed to be proportion al to the magnetic potential over the gap of the recording head. With this scaling-based analysis, the spacing 1088 can be estimated from a series of frequency responses measured at selected yalues-of the recording current. The method yields a reasonably accurate indication of the head- to-tape spacing. However, the indicated value is somewhat sensitive to the range of recording currents usesl in the experiments. Application of the method to different particulate recording media shows that the Hi 8 MP tape has the best intrinsic frequency response, whereas un-oriented barium ferrite media have a relatively high optimal recording depth. Entirely different phenomena are encountered when thin Go-Gr me- dia with a perpendicular easy axis orientation are rec?rded with a ring head. Additional minima appear in the frequency response of these media. The occurrence of these minima can be described with a double-transition model, in which the transition recorded at {{the leading edge of the}} recording head is only partially erased at the trailing edge. 4 : Modelling the recording process The basic principles of the recording process can be understood from simple recording models. For a more detailed simulation of the recording process, the combined hysteresis model has been implemented in a numerical record- ing model. A modified Newton iteration scheme reduces the computation time considerably. The scaling-based analysis has been evaluated with this recording model. The assumptions on which the analysis was based proved not to be justified. However, owing to a cancellation of errors, the value of the head-to-tape spacing that results from the analysis is still within 25 % of the actual value. The recording model is still under development. Simulations with the current version show that the basic recording characteristics of very differ- ent tapes can be reproduced within 2 dB. However, similar results can be obtained with simpIer models. Future research will have to show that this new recording model is better suited for also reproducing more complex phenomena such as overwrite and bias recording...|$|R
