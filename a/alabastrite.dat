5000|$|This stone {{variety is}} the [...] "alabaster" [...] {{of the ancient}} Egyptians and Bible and is often termed Oriental alabaster, since the early {{examples}} came from the Far East. The Greek name <b>alabastrites</b> {{is said to be}} derived from the town of Alabastron in Egypt, where the stone was quarried. The locality probably owed its name to the mineral; the origin of the mineral name is obscure (though see above).|$|R
50|$|The Heptanomis is {{remarkable}} for its quarries {{of stone and}} its rock-grottoes. Besides the <b>Alabastrites,</b> we find {{to the north of}} Antinoë the grottoes of Beni Hasan, the Speos Artemidos of the Greeks. Nine miles lower down are the grottoes of Kom el-Ahmar, and in the Arabian desert, on the east, quarries of the beautiful veined and white alabaster, which the Egyptians employed in their sarcophagi, and in the more delicate portions of their architecture. From the quarries of Tourah and Massarah, in the hills of Gebel-el-Mokattam, east of Memphis, they obtained the limestone used in casing the pyramids. The roads from these quarries may still be traced across the intervening plain.|$|R
5000|$|Strabo places Docimium somewhere about Synnada: {{he calls}} it a village, and says that there is there a quarry of Synnadic stone, as the Romans call it, but {{the people of the}} country call it Docimites and Docimaea; the quarry at first yielded only small pieces of the stone, but owing to the later efforts of the Romans large columns of one piece are taken out, which in variety come near the <b>Alabastrites,</b> so that, though the {{transport}} to the sea of such weights is troublesome, still both columns and slabs were brought to Rome of wondrous size and beauty. The red colors which streaked the white marble taken from the city's holy mountain were attributed to the drops of blood from the dying god Attis. The word Docimaea (...) in this passage of Strabo appears to be corrupt. It should be either [...] or [...]|$|R
40|$|Land snail middens occur widely {{throughout}} the circum-Mediterranean, {{particularly in the}} Maghreb and Libya, but are relatively understudied {{when compared with the}} better known coastal marine middens. The site of Taforalt (Grotte des Pigeons) in north east Morocco contains thick ashy deposits with considerable numbers of land snails, dating between 13, 000 and 11, 000 BP. The site has been excavated periodically since its discovery in 1908, but little {{attention has been paid to}} the land snail component. Recent excavations at the site as part of the Cemeteries and Sedentism Project has facilitated reinvestigation of the Iberomaurusian layers, including the upper ashy midden unit. This investigation addresses questions surrounding chronological variation in the lithic assemblage, subsistence strategies, population health and mortuary practices. Preliminary work on the land snails has identified a low species diversity in the grey series midden layers, characterised by the large edible species Alabastrina <b>alabastrites,</b> Helix cf aspersa, Dupotetia dupotetiana, Otala punctata and Cernuella sp, which appear to represent an abrupt intensification in the use of land snails as a food source. Significant quantities of associated plant material and animal bone suggest that land snails are part of a broader based diet which is adopted from around 13, 000 BP. ...|$|R
