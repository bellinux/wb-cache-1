5|$|The Republicans campaigned {{heavily on}} the tariff issue, turning out {{protectionist}} voters in the important industrial states of the North. Further, the Democrats in New York were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of David B.

5|$|The senator {{alleged that}} Stevenson had downplayed {{the threat of}} communism, and was thus unfit to be president.

He saw service in Gascony in 1294. In 1297 he {{took part in}} a military campaign in Flanders. As a reward for his service in Flanders, he received the wardship of John de Mowbray, who Braose eventually married to his daughter Aline. From 1298 to 1306 he was involved in the Scottish wars, and was at the Battle of Falkirk on 22 July 1298.

5|$|In 1968, Tongan mission {{president}} John H. Groberg {{declared that}} a 50th Anniversary Golden Jubilee would be held. The concept for the celebration was confusing to church members {{as it was}} unclear what the 50th anniversary was honoring. Groberg was not quite sure himself. However, several years prior to his appointment as mission president, Groberg received inspiration that he would preside over the mission in Tonga and hold a 50th anniversary jubilee during his term. A {{few months before the}} celebration, which was scheduled for November, Groberg received <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> widow of Tonga's first mission president. In the letter, she shared that the mission's first conference was held in November 1918. The anniversary of the Tonga's first mission-wide conference became the reason for the jubilee.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Argentina {{approached}} the UK {{with a proposal}} to buy a number of Vulcans. An application, made in September 1981, requested the 'early availability' of a 'suitable aircraft'. With some reluctance, ministers approved the export of a single aircraft but emphasised that clearance had not been given {{for the sale of}} a larger number. <b>A</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the Ministry of Defence in January 1982 stated that little prospect was seen of this happening without ascertaining the Argentine interest and whether such interest was genuine: 'On the face of it, a strike aircraft would be entirely suitable for an attack on the Falklands.' Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands less than three months later.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Bahrain was invaded {{by both the}} Omanis and the Al Sauds. In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan {{installed}} his son, Salim, as Governor in the Arad Fort. In 1816, the British political resident in the Gulf, William Bruce, received <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sheikh of Bahrain who was concerned about a rumour that Britain would support {{an attack on the}} island by the Imam of Muscat.

5|$|It now {{dawned on}} the Privy Council {{that it had}} made a terrible mistake. Led by the Earl of Arundel and the Earl of Pembroke, on 19 July the Council {{publicly}} proclaimed Mary as queen; Jane's nine-day reign came to an end. The proclamation triggered wild rejoicing throughout London. Stranded in Cambridge, Northumberland proclaimed Mary himself—as he had been commanded to do by <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Council. William Paget and the Earl of Arundel rode to Framlingham to beg Mary's pardon, and Arundel arrested Northumberland on 24 July. Northumberland was beheaded on 22 August, shortly after renouncing Protestantism. His recantation dismayed his daughter-in-law, Jane, who {{followed him to the}} scaffold on 12 February 1554, after her father's involvement in Wyatt's rebellion.|$|E
5|$|John did {{not return}} to the crusaders in Egypt for several months.

Since his nephew Walter IV was {{approaching}} the age of majority, John surrendered the County of Brienne in 1221. During John's absence from Egypt, Al-Kamil again offered to restore the Holy Land to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in June 1221; Pelagius refused him. John returned to Egypt and rejoined the crusade on 6 July 1221 at the command of Pope Honorius.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the same}} year, during the revolt of the Danubian armies in autumn, Theodosius and his {{father-in-law}} were hunting in the outskirts of Constantinople. There they received <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mutinous troops, in which they demanded Maurice's resignation, a redress of their grievances, and offered the crown to either of the two. They presented the letter to Maurice, who rejected the army's demands. The emperor however began suspecting Germanus of playing {{a part in the}} revolt. Theodosius promptly informed his father-in-law of this and advised him to hide, and on 21 November Germanus fled first to a local church and then to the Hagia Sophia, seeking sanctuary from the Byzantine emperor's emissaries.|$|E
5|$|Mahendra Pratap {{was head}} of the Indian princely states of Mursan and Hathras. He had been {{involved}} with the Indian National Congress in the 1900s, attending the Congress session of 1906. He toured the world in 1907 and 1911, and in 1912 contributed substantial funds to Gandhi's South African movement. Pratap left India for Geneva {{at the beginning of the}} war, where he was met by Virendranath Chattopadhyaya of the Berlin Committee. Chattopadhyaya's efforts—along with <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Kaiser—convinced Pratap to lend his support to the Indian nationalist cause, on the condition that the arrangements were made with the Kaiser himself. A private audience with the Kaiser was arranged, at which Pratap agreed to nominally head the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Most of Clarke's time in England {{was during}} the Interregnum, when rule {{of the country was}} under Parliament and Oliver Cromwell as the Lord Protector.

Clarke also assisted the colony in 1656 by sending home four barrels of powder and eight barrels of shot and bullets, and in 1657 he handled <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> colony requesting assistance with legal proceedings against William Harris.|$|E
