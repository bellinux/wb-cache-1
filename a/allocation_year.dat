40|$|This report {{documents}} parallel scaling {{characteristics of}} NERSC user project codes between Fiscal Year 2003 {{and the first}} half of Fiscal Year 2004 (Oct 2002 -March 2004). The codes analyzed cover 60 % of all the CPU hours delivered during that time frame on seaborg, a 6080 CPU IBM SP and the largest parallel computer at NERSC. The scale in terms of concurrency and problem size of the workload is analyzed. Drawing on batch queue logs, performance data and feedback from researchers we detail the motivations, benefits, and challenges of implementing highly parallel scientific codes on current NERSC High Performance Computing systems. An evaluation and outlook of the NERSC workload for <b>Allocation</b> <b>Year</b> 2005 is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} research involves four tasks. The {{first of}} these is to simulate accurately the turbulent processes in the atmospheric boundary layer. TASS was originally developed to study meso-gamma scale phenomena, such as tornadic storms, microbursts and windshear effects in terminal areas. Simulation of wake vortex evolution, however, will rely on appropriate representation of the physical processes in the surface layer and mixed layer. This involves two parts. First, a specified heat flux boundary condition must be implemented at the surface. Using this boundary condition, simulation results will be compared to experimental data and to other model results for validation. At this point, any necessary changes to the model will be implemented. Next, a surface energy budget parameterization {{will be added to}} the model. This will enable calculation of the surface fluxes by accounting for the radiative heat transfer to and from the ground and heat loss to the soil rather than simple specification of the fluxes. The second task involves running TASS with prescribed wake vortices in the initial condition. The vortex models will be supplied by NASA Langley Research Center. Sensitivity tests will be performed on different meteorological environments in the atmospheric boundary layer, which include stable, neutral, and unstable stratifications, calm and severe wind conditions, and dry and wet conditions. Vortex strength may be varied as well. Relevant non-dimensional parameters will include the following: Richardson number or Froude number, Bowen ratio, and height to length scale ratios. The model output will be analyzed and visualized to better understand the transport, decay, and growth rates of the wake vortices. The third task involves running simulations using observed data. MIT Lincoln Labs is currently planning field experiments at the Memphis airport to measure both meteorological conditions and wake vortex characteristics. Once this data becomes available, {{it can be used to}} validate the model for vortex behavior under different atmospheric conditions. The fourth task will be to simulate the wake in a more realistic environment covering a wider area. This will involve grid nesting, since high resolution will be required in the wake region but a larger total domain will be used. During the first <b>allocation</b> <b>year,</b> most of the first task will be accomplished...|$|E

We examine the technical and economic potential of artificial storage and recovery for drought mitigation in the Murrumbidgee Region of New South Wales, Australia. Potential locations for infiltration basins and injection/recovery wells are identified according to criteria such as water availability, aquifer suitability, recharge potential, and potential to provide a usable resource. The estimated annual artificial recharge potential is 180, 000 mL {{through a combination of}} injection wells and infiltration basins. The cost estimates for artificial recharge vary from AU$ 62 mL- 1 to AU$ 174 mL- 1 depending on the choice of recharge method. Underground storage capacity can be developed at less than half the cost of surface storage facilities without undesirable environmental consequences or evaporation losses. The estimated benefits of artificial storage and recovery through infiltration basins are three to seven times the costs, during low <b>allocation</b> <b>years.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} 30 years the {{agreements}} {{developed for the}} aquifer systems of the lower Rio Grande and related river compacts of the Rio Grande River have evolved into a complex setting of transboundary conjunctive use. The conjunctive use now includes many facets of water rights, water use, and emerging demands between the states of New Mexico and Texas, the United States and Mexico, and various water-supply agencies. The analysis of the complex relations between irrigation and streamflow supply-and-demand components {{and the effects of}} surface-water and groundwater use requires an integrated hydrologic model to track all of the use and movement of water. MODFLOW with the Farm Process (MF-FMP) provides the integrated approach needed to assess the stream-aquifer interactions that are dynamically affected by irrigation demands on streamflow allotments that are supplemented with groundwater pumpage. As a first step to the ongoing full implementation of MF-FMP by the USGS, the existing model (LRG_ 2007) was modified to include some FMP features, demonstrating the ability to simulate the existing streamflow-diversion relations known as the D 2 and D 3 curves, departure of downstream deliveries from these curves during low <b>allocation</b> <b>years</b> and with increasing efficiency upstream, and the dynamic relation between surface-water conveyance and estimates of pumpage an...|$|R
