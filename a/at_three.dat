A set of four graphs is shown to be the obstruction set for the class of graphs with branchwidth <b>at</b> most <b>three.</b> Moreover, we give a safe and complete set of reduction rules for the graphs with branchwidth <b>at</b> most <b>three.</b> Using this set, a linear time algorithm is given that verifies if a given graph has branchwidth <b>at</b> most <b>three,</b> and, if so, outputs a minimum width branch decomposition...|$|R

5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. <b>At</b> <b>three</b> places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges.

Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When high water closes the fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E
