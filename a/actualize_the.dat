40|$|Past {{studies have}} listed {{a series of}} {{barriers}} to <b>actualizing</b> <b>the</b> concept of community tourism in developing countries. This paper continues to explore such barriers {{in the context of}} China from the neglected yet important perspective of guanxi (literarily meaning 'personal relationship networking') by analysing how guanxi has become a major problem for <b>actualizing</b> <b>the</b> principles of community tourism in China. Focusing on a single-clan village in China's Anhui Province, the study examines how the incidence of guanxi stands as a stumbling block to the community residents' participation in the tourism development process. The examination indicates that such 'guanxi barriers' can manifest in two major forms: 'family guanxi' and 'business guanxi'. Together they create a 'circle of guanxi elites', in which equitable and active participation in the tourism development process, by all the community residents, is difficult to achieve. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
