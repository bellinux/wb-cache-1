25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> have to put my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E
25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am <b>afraid.</b> <b>I</b> made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E
500|$|In the downhill, Guèye {{finished}} his {{run with a}} time of 1:59.64, in 45th place. He registered times of 1:42.63 and 1:46.04 in the giant slalom, finishing in 57th place. He later said that [...] "We have no word for downhill in Senegalese because we have no mountains. I was so <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> almost threw up. I have fully tested the safety measures and can tell you that they work." ...|$|E

500|$|During the evening, Elliot and Smith {{discussed}} {{destroying the}} three junks and deploying men {{to attack the}} battery the next day, but Smith acceded to Elliot's recommendation not to do so. Elliot stated that an attack would destroy the village and cause [...] "great injury and irritation" [...] to the inhabitants. In a letter to trader James Matheson on 5 September, Elliot felt {{that it would be}} unbecoming of a British warship to shoot to death the Chinese junks, which his [...] "poor Cutter" [...] could do under their batteries. He wrote: [...] "Perhaps I ought not to have fired at all but every man's patience has limits and mine has been sorely tried. I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> have disappointed the men's ardent spirits here but I believe I have done well to refrain." [...] He circulated a paper on shore the same day which stated: ...|$|E

"To {{those people}} who complained that a {{photograph}} appeared in the press showing Connie and Sam kissing when they did not actually kiss in the transmitted episode, I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> must say a genuine mistake occurred for which I apologise. The only script that ever featured Connie and Sam actually kissing was in the final scene of Episode 44 (transmitted on 29 August). This was edited together as scripted and shot. Nothing was cut [...] I am sorry if some members of our audience felt cheated. A photographer attended the shoot for Episode 46 and took a selection of shots of Sam and Connie. A photograph from this shoot was mistakenly released and marked as being from Episode 45 as Connie was wearing the same outfit in both episodes. I can only apologise for this mistake. [...] I am sorry a few people had concerns over these episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1909 Lasker drew a short match (two wins, two losses) against Dawid Janowski, {{an all-out}} attacking Polish expatriate. Several months later {{they played a}} longer match in Paris, and chess historians still debate whether this was for the World Chess Championship. Understanding Janowski's style, Lasker chose to defend solidly so that Janowski {{unleashed}} his attacks too soon and left himself vulnerable. Lasker easily won the match 8–2 (seven wins, two draws, one loss). This victory was convincing for everyone but Janowski, who asked for a revenge match. Lasker accepted and they played a World Chess Championship match in Berlin in November–December 1910. Lasker crushed his opponent, winning 9½−1½ (eight wins, three draws, no losses). Janowski did not understand Lasker's moves, and after his first three losses he declared to Edward Lasker, [...] "Your homonym plays so stupidly that I cannot even look at the chessboard when he thinks. I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> will not do anything good in this match." ...|$|E

500|$|The decal on Homer's truck reads [...] "Rex Rascal", a {{reference}} to American animator Tex Avery. In the steak restaurant, a photo of actor and comedian Tony Randall can be seen next to Barclay's photo. Homer's postcard, which reads [...] "Wish you were her", shows a picture of American model Bettie Page. In the scene where Homer drives Barclay's truck into the convoy, Navitron Autodrive System says [...] "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> can't let you do this, Red. The risk is unacceptable." [...] The line, {{as well as the}} Navitron Autodrive System's, is {{a reference}} to HAL 9000, the antagonist in the 1968 science fiction film [...] The episode also references media mogul Ted Turner, with a sign that reads [...] "Atlanta: the home of Ted Turner's mood swings". The title of the episode references the infamous 1986 Stephen King movie Maximum Overdrive, which was one of Simpsons cast member Yeardley Smith's first credited screen roles.|$|E
500|$|Former Sega of America senior {{producer}} Scot Bayless {{attributes the}} unsuccessful market {{to a lack}} of direction from Sega with the add-on. According to Bayless, [...] "It was a fundamental paradigm shift with almost no thought given to consequences. I honestly don't think anyone at Sega asked the most important question: 'Why?' There's a rule I developed during my time as an engineer in the military aviation business: never fall in love with your tech. I think that's where the Mega-CD went off the rails. The whole company {{fell in love with the}} idea without ever really asking how it would affect the games you made." [...] Sega of America producer Michael Latham offers a contrasting view of support for the add-on, however, stating [...] "I loved the Sega CD. I always thought the platform was under-appreciated and that it was hurt by an over-concentration of trying to make Hollywood interactive film games versus using its storage and extended abilities to make just plain great video games." [...] Former Sega of Europe president Nick Alexander commented on the Mega-CD, saying [...] "The Mega CD was interesting but probably misconceived and was seen very much as the interim product it was. I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> cannot recall the sales numbers, but it was not a success." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{following}} the Hurricane Katrina disaster, Hastert told an Illinois newspaper that [...] "It {{looks like a}} lot of that place [...] could be bulldozed" [...] and stated that spending billions of dollars to rebuild the devastated city [...] "doesn't make sense to me." [...] The remarks enraged Governor Kathleen Blanco of Louisiana, who stated that Hastert's comments were [...] "absolutely unthinkable for a leader in his position" [...] and demanded an immediate apology. Former President Bill Clinton, responding to the remarks, stated that had they been in the same place when the remarks were made, [...] "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> would have assaulted him." [...] After the remarks caused a furor, Hastert issued a statement saying he was not [...] "advocating that the city be abandoned or relocated" [...] and later issued another statement saying that [...] "Our prayers and sympathies continue to be with the victims of Hurricane Katrina." [...] Hastert was also criticized for being absent from the Capitol during the approval of a $10.5 billion Katrina relief plan; Hastert was in Indiana attending a colleague's fundraiser and an antique car auction. [...] Hastert later said that he donated the proceeds from one of the antique cars he sold at the auction to hurricane-relief efforts.|$|E

500|$|I saw the boy getting {{injured in}} his leg, {{and the father}} asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father. The father was asking the {{ambulances}} to help him, because {{he could see the}} ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [...] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at me and he said, [...] "Help me." [...] I said, [...] "I cannot, I can't help you." [...] The shooting till then was really heavy... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45minutes. Then... I hear something, [...] "boom!" [...] Really is coming with a lot of dust. I looked at the boy, I filmed the boy lying down in the father's lap, and the father really, getting really injured, and he was really dizzy. I said, [...] "Oh my god, the boy's got killed, the boy's got killed," [...] I was screaming, I was losing my mind. While I was filming, the boy got killed... I was very <b>afraid,</b> <b>I</b> was very upset, I was crying, and I was remembering my children.... This was the most terrible thing that has happened to me as a journalist.|$|E
500|$|Rachid Chouhal was {{the oldest}} athlete to {{represent}} Malta at the London Games {{at the age of}} 37. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Chouhal qualified for the Games via a wildcard because his fastest time of 10.83 seconds, set at the Marsa Sports Complex on 2 June 2012, was 0.59 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for his event, the 100 metres. Before the Games Choudal said [...] "When I want something, I go for it. I am not <b>afraid.</b> <b>I</b> am confident in my training and am careful not to get hurt. I know that the level of the athletes competing in the 100 metre sprint is very high. My aim is to do a personal best or season's best." [...] He was drawn in the fourth heat of the preliminary round on 4 August, finishing fourth out of eight runners, with a time of 10.83 seconds. Chouhal ranked ahead of Tilak Ram Tharu of Nepal (10.85 seconds) and Masoud Azizi from Afghanistan (11.19 seconds) but behind the Saint Vincent and the Grenandines' Courtney Williams (10.80 seconds) in a heat led by Gérard Kobéané of Burkina Faso (10.42 seconds). Overall Chouhal finished 58th out of 75 athletes, but did not progress to the first round because he was 0.21 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in his meat who advanced to the later stages.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} an inspirational message of inner strength, and finds Carey {{reaching out to}} listeners. The song uses a rainstorm {{as a metaphor for}} troubles in life, while encouraging others to [...] "make it through the rain" [...] through perseverance. The first chorus begins: [...] "When you get caught in the rain / With no where to run / When your distraught and in pain without anyone / When you keep crying out to be saved", illustrating a moment in an individual's life where they are surrounded by conflict. The chorus then serves as a guide to those still suffering, [...] "I can make it through the rain, I can stand up once again on my own / And I know that I'm strong enough to mend / And every time I feel <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> hold tighter to my faith / And I live one more day and I make it through the rain". Similarly, the second verse once again revisits difficult times when [...] "shadows grow close", before continuing into the second chorus and climax. While the song in meant for listeners to gain confidence and strength, it also allows them into Carey's personal struggles she endured throughout 2001. Lola Ogunnaike of The New York Times described the song as a [...] "triumph over adversity", while a writer from the Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "it's an insight into her recent troubles." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Carey described the song's lyrical content in depth: ...|$|E

500|$|Janssen {{said the}} film is [...] "definitely played {{with a bit of}} a wink and doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Wirkola himself {{described}} it as [...] "a little more grounded" [...] and action-centered than Dead Snow. He recalled that he has tried to downplay comedy elements: [...] "If you go too far, it can turn into a spoof almost...We shot a lot more than what is in the movie of course and it’s just balancing it when you’re cutting." [...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was <b>afraid.</b> <b>I</b> actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how they do things here with testing and the studio." [...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can see why they do it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E
