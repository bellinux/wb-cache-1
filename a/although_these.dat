5|$|A {{large number}} of {{additional}} alkali and alkaline neptunium oxide compounds such as Cs4Np5O17 and Cs2Np3O10 have been characterized with various production methods. Neptunium has also been observed to form ternary oxides with many additional elements in groups 3 through 7, <b>although</b> <b>these</b> compounds are much less well studied.|$|E
5|$|After 1940 {{the lower}} aft six-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over. The ship's {{anti-aircraft}} armament was augmented by two quadruple 1.1-inch gun mounts by early 1942, <b>although</b> <b>these</b> {{were replaced by}} twin Bofors 40 mm gun mounts later in the war. At about the same time, Milwaukee received eight Oerlikon 20 mm cannon.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>these</b> {{are mainly}} {{mountain}} species with limited interactions with humans, the red-billed chough has a coastal {{population in the}} far west of its range, and has cultural connections particularly with Cornwall, where it appears on the Cornish Coat of Arms. A legend from that county says that King Arthur did not die but {{was transformed into a}} red-billed chough, and hence killing this bird was unlucky.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>these</b> are {{not found}} on Earth naturally, boron forms {{a variety of}} stable {{compounds}} with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N2, cannot be isolated in condensed form, but B2F4 and B4Cl4 are well characterized.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>these</b> mounted {{troops have}} been {{described}} as cavalry, their weapons and armour were similar to those of foot soldiers, and they did not fight as an organised group in the way that cavalries are normally understood to have done.|$|E

5|$|Doxorubicin is photosensitive, and {{containers}} {{are often}} covered by an aluminum bag and/or brown wax paper to prevent light from affecting it. Doxorubicin {{is also available}} in liposome-encapsulated forms as Doxil (pegylated form), Myocet (nonpegylated form), and Caelyx, <b>although</b> <b>these</b> forms must also be given by intravenous injection.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Mugabe {{remained}} {{suspicious of}} many of ZANLA's commanders and {{had a number of}} them imprisoned. In 1977 he imprisoned his former second-in-command, Wilfred Mhanda, for suspected disloyalty. After Tongogara was {{killed in a car accident}} in 1979, there were suggestions made that Mugabe may have had some involvement in it, <b>although</b> <b>these</b> rumours were never substantiated.|$|E

5|$|Hedgehogs are not {{native to}} the Outer Hebrides—they were {{introduced}} in the 1970s to reduce garden pests—and their spread {{poses a threat to}} the eggs of ground nesting wading birds. In 2003, Scottish Natural Heritage undertook culls of hedgehogs in the area <b>although</b> <b>these</b> were halted in 2007 due to protests; trapped animals were instead relocated to the mainland.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the branchiostegal lung, the coconut crab has an additional rudimentary set of gills. <b>Although</b> <b>these</b> gills are comparable in number to aquatic species from the families Paguridae and the Diogenidae, they are reduced in size and have comparatively less surface area.|$|E
5|$|In the Arthurian legends, each {{knight of}} the Round Table is often {{accompanied}} by a heraldic description of a coat of arms. <b>Although</b> <b>these</b> arms could be arbitrary, some characters were traditionally associated with one coat or a few different coats.|$|E

5|$|More taxonomic {{changes have}} {{occurred}} at the genus level, <b>although</b> <b>these</b> revisions have proven more conclusive, often supported by genetic and molecular analysis. The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of a broadly defined genus Lemur into separate genera for the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and brown lemurs due {{to a host of}} morphological differences.|$|E
5|$|Morphological {{analyses}} tend {{to recover}} a conchiferan clade that receives less support from molecular analyses, <b>although</b> <b>these</b> results {{also lead to}} unexpected paraphylies, for instance scattering the bivalves throughout all other mollusc groups.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah is {{also known}} to {{occasionally}} trap other small vertebrates, including frogs, lizards and even birds, <b>although</b> <b>these</b> cases probably involve sick animals, or those seeking shelter or water in the pitcher, and certainly do not represent the norm. Insects, and particularly ants, comprise the majority of prey in both aerial and terrestrial pitchers. Other arthropods, such as centipedes, also fall prey to N. rajah.|$|E
