5000|$|Wax resist: {{which is}} painted over the bare untainted clay, {{results in the}} {{suspension}} <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> in water [...] before the raku glaze goes on. This is done so that the glaze does not cover {{the area where the}} <b>wax</b> <b>resist</b> was applied, thus creating a design. When in the kiln, the wax melts off and the carbon, that results from oxygen reduction, replaces the wax. This {{is the result of the}} combustion reaction. Raku glazes contain alumina, which has a very high melting point. Therefore, carbon will not replace the glaze as it does the melted wax. Any unglazed areas turn black due to the carbon given off from the reduction of oxygen. Next, the clay is moved from the kiln to a container, usually a trashcan, which contains combustible organic materials such as leaves, sawdust, or paper.|$|R
5|$|Traditional Indonesian wax-resist batik {{designs on}} cloth combine {{representational}} motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the <b>wax</b> <b>resist,</b> and random variation introduced by cracking <b>of</b> the <b>wax.</b> Batik designs have a fractal dimension between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of Cirebon has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of Yogyakarta and Surakarta (Solo) in Central Java have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of Lasem {{on the north}} coast of Java and of Tasikmalaya in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.|$|R
50|$|Raku is {{a unique}} form of pottery making; what makes it unique is the range of designs that can be created by simply {{altering}} certain variables.

40|$|The <b>waxes</b> <b>of</b> Cagliari were {{manufactured}} between 1803 - 1805, {{and represent}} {{a work of}} the maturity of Clemente Susini (1754 - 1814) the chief modeller of La Specola. The dissections reproduced by Susini were carried out by Francesco Antonio Boi (Olzai, 1767 -Cagliari, 1865), from the University of Cagliari who had been sent on purpose to Florence by the Viceroy Carlo Felice of Savoy (1765 - 1831). The models which arrived in Cagliari in 1806 contained in 23 showcases, are attached to 23 wooden tables that bear the original tag with date and Susini’s signature. The latter is a distinctive character in that, of the over 2000 models accomplished under Susini’ guidance, only a few bear his signature. Moreover, they were made when Susini was eventually free from the influence of Felice Fontan. By order of Carlo Felice the models {{to be made for}} Cagliari, which consist of a special mix <b>of</b> <b>waxes</b> able to <b>resist</b> the hot climate of south Sardinia, had to be unique and, thus, at variance with those of La Specola, no copies of them are seen in other collections. On the other hand, possibly thanks to Francesco Antonio Boi, a few mistakes seen in the collections of Florence, Vienna, and Bologna, such as the presence of lymphatics in the human brain, are absent here. A distinctive character is the relevance given to visceral and somatic nerves which are shown in more than one third of the models. Of particular relevance is a representation of human brain convolutions preceding the one published by Rolando in 1830, and an extremely accurate and detailed preparartion of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. An overall evaluation of the collection greatly emphasizes both his artistic and scientific values, reflecting the intelligent cooperation between the Florentine artist and the Sardinian anatomist...|$|R
