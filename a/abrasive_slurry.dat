50|$|In rotary {{ultrasonic}} vibration machining (RUM), the vertically oscillating tool is able {{to revolve}} about the vertical center line of the tool. Instead of using an <b>abrasive</b> <b>slurry</b> to remove material, {{the surface of the}} tool is impregnated with diamonds that grind down the surface of the part. Rotary ultrasonic machines are specialized in machining advanced ceramics and alloys such as glass, quartz, structural ceramics, Ti-alloys, alumina, and silicon carbide.

50|$|Because {{ultrasonic}} vibration machining {{is driven}} by microchipping or erosion mechanisms, the material removal rate of metals can be slow and the sonotrode tip can wear down quickly from the constant impact of abrasive particles on the tool. Moreover, drilling deep holes in parts can prove difficult as the <b>abrasive</b> <b>slurry</b> will not effectively reach {{the bottom of the}} hole. Note, rotary ultrasonic machining is efficient at drilling deep holes in ceramics because the absence of a slurry cutting fluid and the cutting tool is coated in harder diamond abrasives. In addition, ultrasonic vibration machining can only be used on materials with a hardness value of at least 45 HRC.|$|E

40|$|The micro-scale {{abrasion}} test (ball crater test) {{is becoming a}} standard method for testing abrasive wear of coatings. Two main methods are common: (i) non-perforating tests, where the craters are restricted to the coating and (ii) perforating test where the craters go wide into the substrate. Both types of crater tests have been applied to a representative selection of coatings (DLC, TiN, Al) on two different substrates (steel, Ti-Alloy). The tests have been performed using different <b>abrasive</b> <b>slurries</b> (4 µm SiC or 1 µm Al 2 O 3 in water or glycerine) and the crater wear volumes have been evaluated using optical microscopy and profilometric methods. The results show that optical evaluation in both, non-perforating and perforating tests lead to an overestimation of crater volumes, due to a rounding of crater edges {{in the first case}} (non-perforating) and due to step formation at the coating substrate interface in the latter case (perforating). Profilometric evaluation generally yields more reliable results than optical evaluation. The use of different <b>abrasive</b> <b>slurries</b> dramatically changes the wear rates of up to a factor of 140. This can be utilized to adjust the wear condition to different applications.

40|$|The {{addition}} of ceramic reinforced material, SiC particles, to resin matrices, {{results in the}} improvement of the overall performance of the composite, allowing the application of these materials as tribo-materials in industries such as: automotive, aeronautical and medical. Particle-reinforced polymeric composites are widely used as biomaterials, for example as dental filler materials and bone cements. These reinforced composites have improved mechanical and tribological performance and have higher values of elastic modulus and hardness, and also reduce the shrinkage during the polymerisation compared with resin matrices. However, the effect of the filler level in mechanical and tribological behaviour is not quite understood. The aim of this work is to determine the influence of the particle volume fraction and particle size in the wear loss of the composites and their antagonists. Reciprocating wear tests were conducted using a glass sphere against resin polyester silica reinforced composite in a controlled medium, with an <b>abrasive</b> <b>slurry</b> or distilled water. For 6 μm average particle dimension, seven particles contents were studied ranging from 0 % to 46 % of filler volume fraction (FVF). Afterwards, filler volume fractions of 10 % and 30 % were selected; and, for these percentages, 7 and 4 average particle dimensions were tested and were evaluated regarding their wear behaviour, respectively. The reinforcement particle dimensions used ranged from 0. 1 μm to 22 μm with the 10 % filler fraction, and for 30 % of filler content the range extended from 3 μm to 22 μm. The results allow us to conclude that in an <b>abrasive</b> <b>slurry</b> medium the composite abrasion resistance decreases with the increase of the particle volume fraction, in spite of the accompanying rise in hardness and elastic modulus.
