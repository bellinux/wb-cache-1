5|$|The {{concert in}} Cologne was {{recorded}} and released as an album titled Symphonic Odysseys by Dog Ear Records, Nobuo Uematsu's recording label. It was announced {{to be in}} production on October 26, 2011, and released on December 28, 2011. The artwork for the album features {{a cross between a}} sword and <b>a</b> <b>violin</b> on a white background, in the vein of the Symphonic Fantasies album, which had a cross between <b>a</b> <b>violin</b> and a game controller. The cover art was produced by German design house Schech, who earlier provided the artwork for the European release of Symphonic Fantasies. Accompanying the CD is a booklet which contains photos of the concert and discusses the arrangers and compositions included in each song. The album contains everything played at the concert, with the Final Fantasy suite split into three tracks, and the album is split at the intermission into two CDs. Its fourteen tracks have a duration of 1:34:56. While Dog Ear Records published the album in Japan, the album was released in Europe through the online music retailer MAZ-Sound.|$|E
50|$|The {{components}} {{that make up}} <b>a</b> five string <b>violin</b> {{are very similar to}} those found on <b>a</b> traditional <b>violin.</b> The strings are typically tuned to the following pitches, given in scientific pitch notation: C3, G3, D4, A4 and E5.The shape of the body and neck of <b>a</b> five string <b>violin</b> closely resemble that of <b>a</b> traditional <b>violin.</b> The body may be slightly wider and deeper to improve the resonance of the C string.

5|$|The music {{style in}} Bahrain {{is similar to}} that of its neighbors. The Khaliji style of music, which is folk music, is popular in the country. The sawt style of music, which {{involves}} a complex form of urban music, performed by an Oud (plucked lute), <b>a</b> <b>violin</b> and mirwas (a drum), is also popular in Bahrain. Ali Bahar was one of the most famous singers in Bahrain. He performed his music with his Band Al-Ekhwa (The Brothers). Bahrain was also the site of the first recording studio amongst the Persian Gulf states.|$|E
5|$|After a brief intermission, {{the second}} act was started by {{arrangements}} of pieces from The Last Story, Final Fantasy XIV and Blue Dragon. The Blue Dragon piece featured <b>a</b> <b>violin</b> performance by Juraj Čižmarovič, who also performed at the Symphonic Legends concert. They were followed by a suite of music from Lost Odyssey to round out {{the second half of}} the concert, which lasted twenty minutes. The concert was extended by two encore performances featuring Benyamin Nuss on piano; the first was an arrangement from Final Fantasy X, and the second a suite of battle music from Final Fantasy VII.|$|E
5|$|Erik Chisholm wrote {{well over}} 100 works, {{including}} 35 orchestral works, 7 concertante works (including <b>a</b> <b>violin</b> concerto and two piano concertos), 7 works for orchestra and voice or chorus, 54 piano works, 3 organ works, 43 songs, 8 choral part-songs, 7 ballets, and 9 operas including one on Robert Burns. He also made several interesting arrangements by composers such as Handel and Mozart. He arranged a string orchestra {{version of the}} Symphony for Solo Piano, Op. 39 Nos. 4–7 by Charles-Valentin Alkan, a composer still largely unknown at that time, the original {{of which has been}} said to surpass even the Transcendental Études of Franz Liszt in scale and difficulty.|$|E

5|$|He {{continued}} his busy schedule, travelling to the United States, England, Finland, Canada and Japan, and sketching <b>a</b> <b>violin</b> concerto, {{but by the}} first week of 1994 it was clear that cancer had taken hold, and after an operation the composer weakened quickly and died on 7 February at the age of eighty-one. He had, a few weeks before, been awarded Poland's highest honour, the Order of the White Eagle (only the second person to receive this since the collapse of communism in Poland—the first had been Pope John Paul II). He was cremated; his devoted wife Danuta died shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In his fifties, Elgar {{composed}} a symphony and <b>a</b> <b>violin</b> concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took {{many years to}} achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, {{to be seen as}} appealing chiefly to British audiences. His stock remained low for a generation after his death. It began to revive significantly in the 1960s, helped by new recordings of his works. Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music continues to be played more in Britain than elsewhere.|$|E

With Welsh as his first language, he attended Ysgol Gynradd Coed-y-Gof and Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf (in Llandaff North, Cardiff) for his primary and secondary school education, respectively. Jones has Grade 8 violin and Grade 6 piano qualifications, and took part in school musicals and school and county orchestras. He took Biology, Geography and Economics at A-Levels.|$|E

5|$|Though {{bitter about}} being sidelined, Stanford {{continued}} to compose. Between {{the turn of}} the century and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 his new works included <b>a</b> <b>violin</b> concerto (1901), a clarinet concerto (1902), a sixth and a seventh (and last) symphony (1906 and 1911), and his second piano concerto (1911). In 1916 he wrote his penultimate opera, The Critic. It was a setting of Sheridan's comedy of the same name, with the original text left mostly intact by the librettist, Lewis Cairns James. The work was well received at the premiere at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London, and was taken up later in the year by Beecham, who staged it in Manchester and London.|$|E
5|$|The Delius {{household}} was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, {{and played}} for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz {{was drawn to the}} music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, and had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as <b>a</b> <b>violin</b> teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to London for Delius to attend concerts and opera.|$|E

50|$|In jazz-rock fusion styles, jazz violinists may use <b>an</b> {{electric}} <b>violin.</b> Jazz fusion groups typically use rock instruments such as electric guitar, bass guitar, electric keyboards, and drums; {{to compete}} with these loud instruments, violinists often use <b>an</b> amplified <b>violin</b> that is plugged into an instrument amplifier. Moreover, the use of <b>an</b> electric <b>violin</b> allows the violinist to apply effects such as a wah pedal, phaser, reverb, or a distortion fuzzbox, to create unusual new sounds.|$|R
25|$|The {{hurdy-gurdy}} is a {{stringed instrument}} that produces sound by a hand crank-turned, rosined wheel rubbing against the strings. The wheel functions much like <b>a</b> <b>violin</b> bow, and single notes {{played on the}} instrument sound {{similar to those of}} <b>a</b> <b>violin.</b> Melodies are played on a keyboard that presses tangentssmall wedges, typically made of woodagainst {{one or more of the}} strings to change their pitch. Like most other acoustic stringed instruments, it has a sound board and hollow cavity to make the vibration of the strings audible.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>violin</b> is {{tuned in}} fifths, in the notes G3, D4, A4, E5. The lowest note of <b>a</b> <b>violin,</b> tuned normally, is G3, or G below middle C. (On rare occasions, the lowest string may be tuned down {{by as much}} as a fourth, to D3.) The highest note is less well defined: E7, the E two octaves above the open string (which is tuned to E5) may be {{considered}} a practical limit for orchestral violin parts, but it is often possible to play higher, depending on the length of the fingerboard and the skill of the violinist. Yet higher notes (up to C8) can be sounded using artificial harmonics.|$|E
