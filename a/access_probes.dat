40|$|The {{multicomponent}} soluble form {{of methane}} monooxygenase (sMMO) catalyzes the oxidation of methane through the activation of O 2 at a nonheme biferrous {{center in the}} hydroxylase component, MMOH. Reactivity is limited without binding of the sMMO effector protein, MMOB. Past studies show that mutations of specific MMOB surface residues cause large changes in the rates of individual steps in the MMOH reaction cycle. To define the structural and mechanistic bases for these observations, CD, MCD, and VTVH MCD spectroscopies coupled with ligand-field (LF) calculations are used to elucidate changes occurring near and at the MMOH biferrous cluster upon binding of MMOB and the MMOB variants. Perturbations to both the CD and MCD are observed upon binding wild-type MMOB and the MMOB variant that similarly increases O 2 reactivity. MMOB variants that do not greatly increase O 2 reactivity fail to cause {{one or both of}} these changes. LF calculations indicate that reorientation of the terminal glutamate on Fe 2 reproduces the spectral perturbations in MCD. Although this structural change allows O 2 to bridge the diiron site and shifts the redox active orbitals for good overlap, it is not sufficient for enhanced O 2 reactivity of the enzyme. Binding of the T 111 Y-MMOB variant to MMOH induces the MCD, but not CD changes, and causes only a small increase in reactivity. Thus, both the geometric rearrangement at Fe 2 (observed in MCD) coupled with a more global conformational change that may control O 2 <b>access</b> (<b>probed</b> by CD), induced by MMOB binding, are critical factors in the reactivity of sMMO...|$|R

40|$|The neutron probe {{is a tool}} {{employed}} for the measurement of water content in a soil mass. The presence of {{a gap between the}} soil and the neutron <b>probe</b> <b>access</b> tube, filled with either air or water, inevitably introduces a systematic error in neutron probe readings. In this study, experimental investigations and numerical analyses were carried out to evaluate the effects of this gap on neutron probe calibration. The numerical model was developed based on the multigroup neutron diffusion equations and the finite element method. The experiments were conducted in a heavy clay soil. The results show that an air gap of 2. 5 - 30 mm between the soil and a 50 -mm-diameter aluminium tube could lead to an underestimation of soil water content by 5 - 45 %, but significant underestimation was apparent for air gaps < 10 mm. It is also found that the neutron count is significantly overestimated if the gap around the access tube is filled with water rather than air, but this effect is most significant for larger gaps. The results of this research clearly indicate that a gap between the neutron <b>probe</b> <b>access</b> tube and the soil profile should be avoided during field installation, and that if a gap between the access tube and soil develops during service, a systematic error will be introduced into measurements...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to {{investigate}} the complexity {{of a variety of}} problems related to text indexing and text searching. We present new data structures that can be used as building blocks for full-text indices which occupies minute space (FM-indexes) and wavelet trees. These data structures also can be used to represent labeled trees and posting lists. Labeled trees are applied in XML documents, and posting lists in search engines. The main emphasis of this thesis is on lower bounds for time-space tradeoffs for the following problems: the rank/select problem, the problem of representing a string of balanced parentheses, the text retrieval problem, the problem of computing a permutation and its inverse, and the problem of representing a binary relation. These results are divided in two groups: lower bounds in the cell probe model and lower bounds in the indexing model. The cell probe model is the most natural and widely accepted framework for studying data structures. In this model, we are concerned with the total space used by a data structure and the total number of <b>accesses</b> (<b>probes)</b> it performs to memory, while computation is free of charge. The indexing model imposes an additional restriction on the storage: the object in question must be stored in its raw form together with a small index that facilitates an efficient implementation of a given set of queries, e. g. finding rank, select, matching parenthesis, or an occurrence of a given pattern in a given text (for the text retrieval problem). We propose a new technique for proving lower bounds in the indexing model and use it to obtain lower bounds for the rank/select problem and the balanced parentheses problem. We also improve the existing techniques of Demaine and Lopez-Ortiz using compression and present stronger lower bounds for the text retrieval problem in the indexing model. The most important result of this thesis is a new technique for cell probe lower bounds. We demonstrate its strength by proving new lower bounds for the problem of representing permutations, the text retrieval problem, and the problem of representing binary relations. (Previously, there were no non-trivial results known for these problems.) In addition, we note that the lower bounds for the permutations problem and the binary relations problem are tight {{for a wide range of}} parameters, e. g. the running time of queries, the size and density of the relation...|$|R

40|$|ASLR is {{no longer}} a strong defense in itself, but it still serves as a {{foundation}} for sophisticated defenses that use randomization for pseudo-isolation. Crucially, these defenses hide sensitive information (such as shadow stacks and safe regions) at a random position in a very large address space. Previous attacks on randomization-based information hiding rely on complicated side channels and/or probing of the mapped memory regions. Assuming no weaknesses exist in the implementation of hidden regions, the attacks typically lead to many crashes or other visible side-effects. For this reason, many researchers still consider the pseudo-isolation offered by ASLR sufficiently strong in practice. We introduce powerful new primitives to show that this faith in ASLR-based information hiding is misplaced, and that attackers can break ASLR and find hidden regions on 32 bit and 64 bit Linux systems quickly with very few malicious inputs. Rather than building on memory <b>accesses</b> that <b>probe</b> the allocated memory areas, we determine the sizes of the unallocated holes in the address space by repeatedly allocating large chunks of memory.

40|$|The {{development}} of imaging and therapeutic agents against neuronal targets is {{hampered by the}} limited <b>access</b> of <b>probes</b> into {{the central nervous system}} across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The evaluation of drug penetration into the brain in experimental models often requires complex procedures, including drug radiolabeling, as well as determinations in multiple animals for each condition or time point. Prospective in vivo imaging of drug biodistribution may provide an alternative to "classical" pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies in that a contrast-enhanced imaging signal could serve as a surrogate for the amount of drug or biologic delivered to the organ of interest. For the brain-targeting applications, it is necessary to develop formulation strategies that enable a simultaneous drug and contrast agent delivery across the BBB. In this chapter, we describe methods for encapsulating drugs into liposome nanocarriers with surface display of both the imaging contrast agent for one or multiple imaging modalities and the single-domain antibody that undergoes receptor-mediated transcytosis across the BBB. Contrast-enhanced imaging signal detected in the brain after intravenous injection of such formulation(s) is proportional to the amount of drug delivered into the brain parenchyma.
