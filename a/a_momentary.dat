5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason was {{recorded}} primarily on Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria. Its production {{was marked by}} an ongoing legal dispute with Waters as to who owned the rights to Pink Floyd's name, an issue resolved several months after the album was released. Unlike many of Pink Floyd's studio albums, <b>A</b> <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason has no central theme and is instead a collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason was {{released}} in the UK and US on 7September 1987. It went straight to number three in both countries, held from the top spot by Michael Jackson's Bad and Whitesnake's self-titled album.|$|E
5|$|Though it {{received}} mixed reviews and was derided by Waters, <b>A</b> <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason outsold Pink Floyd's previous album The Final Cut (1983), and {{was supported by}} a successful world tour. In the US, it has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by English {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, {{released in the}} UK and US on 7 September 1987, on the labels EMI and Columbia. It followed guitarist David Gilmour's decision to include material recorded for his third solo album on a new Pink Floyd album with drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright. Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re-admitted to the band, Wright and Mason helped Gilmour craft what became the first Pink Floyd album since the December 1985 departure of bass guitarist, singer, and primary songwriter Roger Waters.|$|E
5|$|After Waters' {{departure}} in 1985, Wright {{began to}} contribute to Pink Floyd again, beginning with sessions for the album <b>A</b> <b>Momentary</b> Lapse of Reason. However, he did not legally rejoin as an equal to Gilmour and Mason, and was a salaried musician for the resulting tour, as his contract {{said he could not}} rejoin as a full member. On the album credits, his name was listed after Mason and Gilmour and his photo did not appear on the cover.|$|E
5|$|Edward habitually smoked twenty {{cigarettes}} and twelve cigars a day. In 1907, a rodent ulcer, {{a type of}} cancer affecting the skin next to his nose, was cured with radium. Towards {{the end of his}} life he increasingly suffered from bronchitis. He suffered <b>a</b> <b>momentary</b> loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909. In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu a week later on 5 May.|$|E

5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by <b>a</b> <b>momentary</b> steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E
5|$|Schirra {{was awakened}} at 1:40 am ET {{on the morning}} of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a {{bluefish}} he had speared the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a radar set. The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was <b>a</b> <b>momentary</b> clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of the main engines and was kept under control by the booster's vernier thrusters. Sustainer engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{heads to}} Torona IV to open {{negotiations}} with the Jarada, an insect-like race that is unusually strict in matters of protocol. After practicing the complex greeting the Jarada require to open negotiations, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) decides to relax with a Dixon Hill story in the holodeck. Playing Detective Hill in the holoprogram, Picard takes up the case of Jessica Bradley (Carolyn Allport), who believes Cyrus Redblock (Lawrence Tierney) is trying to kill her. Picard decides to continue the program later and leaves the holodeck to affirm their estimated arrival at Torona IV. He invites Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and visiting historian Dr. Whalen (David Selburg) {{to join him in}} the holodeck. While Crusher is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. McNary (Gary Armagnac) brings Picard into the police station for questioning as a suspect in her murder. Meanwhile, the Enterprise is scanned from a distance by the Jaradan, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. Crusher later enters the holodeck, first experiencing <b>a</b> <b>momentary</b> glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.|$|E

40|$|This article {{develops}} {{the hypothesis that}} intervention strategies that cultivate positive emotions are particularly suited for preventing and treating problems rooted in negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, aggression, and stressrelated health problems. Fredrickson's (1998) broaden–and–build model of positive emotions provides the foundation for this application. According to this model, the form and function {{of positive and negative}} emotions are distinct and complementary. Negative emotions (e. g., fear, anger, and sadness) narrow <b>an</b> individual's <b>momentary</b> thought–action repertoire toward specific actions that served the ancestral function of promoting survival. By contrast, positive emotions (e. g., joy, interest, and contentment) broaden <b>an</b> individual's <b>momentary</b> thought–action repertoire, which in turn can build that individual's enduring personal resources, resources that also served the ancestral function of promoting survival. One implication of the broaden–and–build model is that positive emotions have an undoing effect on negative emotions. By broadenin...|$|R
