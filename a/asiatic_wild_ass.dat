40|$|Large mammals re-introduced into {{harsh and}} {{unpredictable}} environments {{are vulnerable to}} stochastic effects, particularly in times of global climate change. The Mongolian Gobi is home to several rare large ungulates such as re-introduced Przewalski's horses (Equus ferus przewalskii) and <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> (Equus hemionus), but also to a millennium-old semi-nomadic livestock herding culture. The Gobi is prone to large inter-annual environmental fluctuations, but the winter 2009 / 2010 was particularly severe. Millions of livestock died and the Przewalski's horse population in the Gobi crashed. We used spatially explicit livestock loss statistics, ranger survey data and GPS telemetry to {{provide insight into the}} effect of a catastrophic climate event on the two sympatric wild equid species and the livestock population in light of their different space use strategies. Herders in and around the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area lost on average 67 % of their livestock. Snow depth varied locally, resulting in livestock losses following an east-west gradient. Herders had few possibilities for evasion, as competition for available winter camps was high. Przewalski's horses used three different winter ranges, two in the east and one in the west. Losses averaged 60 %, but differed hugely between east and west. Space use of Przewalski's horses was extremely conservative, as groups did not attempt to venture beyond their known home ranges. <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> seemed to have suffered few losses by shifting their range westwards. The catastrophic winter 2009 / 2010 provided a textbook example for how vulnerable small and spatially confined populations are in an environment prone to environmental fluctuations and catastrophes. This highlights the need for disaster planning by local herders, multiple re-introduction sites with spatially dispersed populations for re-introduced Przewalski's horses, and a landscape-level approach beyond protected area boundaries to allow for migratory or nomadic movements in <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> {{were once}} found across central Asia, {{but over time}} their range has been reduced until today all {{subspecies}} are under threat. This paper examined the literature about <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> with an aim to illustrating gaps in our knowledge as a target for future research. A search was made on BIOSIS ISI for the following strings: Equus hemionus, <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> khulan, kulan, kiang, khur, and onager. In total 61 relevant references were found, published between 1900 and 2005. Most of these references {{were published in the}} 1990 s, with only one published between 1900 and 1970. Khur and khulan were most under-represented in the literature with only five and two citations respectively resulting from these key words. When put into subjective categories most papers published (28) were on the conservation, behavior or ecology of <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses.</b> All physiology papers dealt with captive animals, and nearly half of all genetics papers focused on onagers. Very little was published on the habitat use of <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> and there was almost nothing on the distribution of subspecies, or genetic differences between them. This research highlighted the importance of key words and consistent nomenclature. We need to focus more on the ecology of wild populations, in particular examining habitat use, social structure and distribution. In addition {{it is very important that}} more is published on threats to these animals so that action can be taken in time...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> {{is larger}} than African wild ass at about 290 kg and 2.1 m (head-body length). They are reddish-brown or yellowish-brown in color and have broad dorsal stripe on {{the middle of the}} back. Unlike most horses and donkeys, onagers have never been domesticated. They are among the fastest mammals, as they can run as fast as 64 km/h (40 mph) to 70 km/h (43 mph). The onager is closely related to the African wild ass, as they both shared the same ancestor.

40|$|<b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> and Przewalski horses {{initially}} inhabited steppe, semi-desert {{and desert}} areas, but Przewalski horses became extinct in the wild, and kulans disappeared {{at the beginning}} of the 20 th century, except for a small population in Turkmenistan. The Bukhara Breeding Centre (Uzbekistan) was created in 1976 for reintroduction and conservation of wild ungulate species. In 1977 – 1978, five kulans (two males and three females), from Barsa–Kelmes island on the Aral sea, were introduced into the reserve. The group increased to 25 – 30 animals in 1989 – 1990, when eight Przewalski horses from Moscow and St Petersburg zoos were introduced. We analysed the home ranges, preferred habitats and social interactions of these closely related species during 1995 – 1998 by seasonal and group composition. Horses and asses formed a reproductive group and a secondary non-reproductive group. The home range of the secondary group was larger than the reproductive group and seemed to be less dependent from the watering places. Przewalski horses were less adapted to semi-desert conditions (both water and vegetation needs) than kulan...|$|R

40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} habitat {{fragmentation}} caused by anthropogenic activities {{are the main}} factors that constrain long-distance movement of ungulates. Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa) and <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> (Equus hemionus) in Mongolia are facing habitat fragmentation and loss. To better understand how their movements respond to potential anthropogenic and natural barriers, we tracked 24 Mongolian gazelles and 12 <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> near the Ulaanbaatar–Beijing Railroad and the fenced international border between Mongolia and China between 2002 and 2012. None of the tracked gazelles crossed the railroad, even though gazelles were captured {{on both sides of}} the tracks at the start of the study. Similarly, we did not observe cross-border movements between Mongolia and China for either species, even though some animals used areas adjacent to the border. The both species used close areas to the anthropogenic barriers more frequently during winter than summer. These results suggest strong impacts by the artificial barriers. The construction of new railroads and roads to permit mining and other resource development therefore creates the threat of further habitat fragmentation, because the planned routes will divide the remaining non-fragmented habitats of the ungulates into smaller pieces. To conserve long-distance movement of the ungulates in this area, it will be necessary to remove or mitigate the barrier effects of the existing and planned roads and railroads and to adopt a landscape-level approach to allow access by ungulates to wide range...|$|R

Horses and kulans each formed a reproductive group and a secondary bachelor group. The home range of the secondary group in both species was larger then that of the reproductive group and seemed to be less dependent on watering places. Kulans and Przewalski 2 ̆ 7 s horses demonstrated different strategies of habitat use.

40|$|<b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> inhabit some of {{the most}} arid environments in the world. All live in fissionfusion societies, but {{demography}} varies and the deserts in which they live often differ in subtle ways. Characterizing details of social structure of <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> populations has been a challenge and has made it difficult to determine causes and consequences of any differences that might exist. We use network theory to compare the social structures of two populations of Asiatic asses/ onagers inhabiting the Negev desert, Israel and khur of the Little Rann of Kuch, India and show that populations differ in important structural ways that represent adaptive responses to variations in ecological demographic and phenotypic circumstances. Our analyses show that onagers inhabiting more variable environments then khur also live in larger, more cohesive groups than khur. Presumably networks with this structure facilitate the spread of information and foster cooperation. We also show that demography matters since social fragmentation increases as populations grow. Increases in the number of components in populations, reductions in the number of associates and diminished cliquishness within components, appear to be adaptive responses to integrating increasing numbers of individuals into social networks. We also find some support for the idea that social connectedness varies with phenotype. In our larger populations, non-lactating females who are most challenged in finding sparse feeding sites, are more selective than lactating females in their choice of strong associates. Presumably networks with this structure enhance foraging success by increasing information flow among like-minded individuals. As our study demonstrates, network analysis facilitates testing predictions about the cause of social structure and its impact on transmission processes...|$|R
40|$|The Syrian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus hemionus hemippus) {{lived in}} Israel in {{historic}} times until the 1930 s, when it {{disappeared from the}} entire Middle East region. Khulans from other subspecies (E. h. onager - six individulas and E. h. kulan - five individuals) were brought to Israel from European zoos during 1968 - 69 (the authors of project considered that onager and kulan were the same subspecies) and these animals bred together in the semi-captivity conditions of the Haibar Yotvata Reserve. Later, during a 12 -year period from 1982 through 1993, six groups totalling 38 khulans (17 males and 21 females) were realized in the Negev Desert. These groups had quite low success rates in establishing viable, breeding population following release because of several mistakes made during the project. First, all were realized during spring, which due to the local conditions of vegetation, watering places and weather in the Negev Desert, was the wrong season; late autumn and winter {{would have been much}} more suitable for this purpose. Second, many groups had too many males creating the wrong male to female ratio. Third, individuals for realizing were too adult. Fourth, groups were held in pre-release enclosures less than 5 - 6 months, which didn’t allow for acclimation and creating new social structure. And fifth, individuals were only evaluated based on genetics, while social behavioral traits were not taken into consideration. The result of these mistakes was difficulty in establishing a cohesive, stable population and an initially slow population growth. Over time, however, they became more successful, at the beginning of project, though over time it became more successful and currently there are about 100 khulans in the <b>wild</b> population. <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> are still kept in the semi-captivity conditions of the Haibar Yotvata Reserve, where they live with other ungulate species.

40|$|The {{rapid pace}} of the {{development}} of satellite wildlife tracking tools has left little time for thorough testing of new equipment and identifying possible sources of technical failures. In the Gobi and Eastern Steppe region of Mongolia we deployed 104 satellite collars, collecting animal locations using the Doppler based Argos or the global positioning system (GPS), on 45 <b>Asiatic</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> (Equus hemionus), 34 Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa), 15 Przewalski’s horses (Equus ferus przewalskii), eight wild Bactrian camels (Camelus ferus), and two wolves (Canis lupus). Although, we collected valuable data from little-known species in a remote environment, of 104 collars deployed, only 34 worked as good as or better than expected whereas 70 were subject to technical problems. The majority of problems had to do with a reduced performance of the Argos component (n = 13), with both the Argos and the GPS components (n = 1), or with the Argos component in combination with another unknown problem (n = 12). Further problems were caused by human error during manufacturing or deployment (n = 10), software bugs (n = 7), mechanical failures (n = 5), poor GPS performance (n = 1) and premature failures for unknown reasons (3 ≤ n ≤ 21). Although, several premature failures may have been caused by animals being poached, our failure rate remains high and indicates that managers and researchers need to be aware that there is a high risk of equipment failure when applying newly emerging satellite tracking technology. This entrains logistic and financial uncertainties which may be difficult to explain to the scientific community, the public, management and funding agencies alike. We recommend the development of a web-based platform where users and producers of telemetry products can quickly post and exchange their experiences...|$|R
