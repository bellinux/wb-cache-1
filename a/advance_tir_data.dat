Airborne high {{spatial resolution}} TIR is a novel source of data that became available lately. Recent developments in spatial resolution of the TIR sensors have been an interesting topic for scientists. TIR sensors {{are very sensitive to}} the energies emitted from objects. Past researches have been shown that increasing the spatial resolution of an airborne image will decrease the spectral content of the data and will reduce the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Therefore, in this paper a comprehensive assessment is adapted to estimate an appropriate spatial resolution of the <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> (TELOPS <b>TIR</b> <b>data),</b> in consideration of the SNR. So, firstly, a low-pass filter is applied on <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> and the achieved products fed to a classification method for analysing of the accuracy improvement.

Furthermore, estimation of the appropriate spatial resolution of the <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> is evaluated for obtaining higher spectral content and SNR. For this purpose, different resolutions of the <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> are created and fed to the maximum likelihood classification method separately.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the fundamental science question of modeling land surface temperature (LST) {{by combining the}} field experiment, spatial interpolation, and satellite thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing. Specific objectives {{of this study are}} to: (1) calibrate the spatial interpolation of LST using satellite-derived surface emissivity; (2) calibrate the conversion from at-satellite brightness temperature to LST using surface variables; and (3) simulate and predict the air temperature profiles in a forest canopy using field observations and satellite <b>TIR</b> <b>data.</b> To this end, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> were applied to derive surface emissivity and brightness temperature. Hourly temperature observations at national weather stations (NWS) within the study area were extracted from National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and used to interpolate temperature surfaces. Field-observed temperatures were used to evaluate the interpolation process and to develop algorithms for predicting air temperature profiles in a forest canopy. The results showed that no single interpolation method was capable of obtaining accurate LST from weather station measurements. The accuracy of interpolated LST for the experimental site was significantly improved by calibration using satellite-derived surface emissivity. Brightness temperature derived from Landsat <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> were well corrected using surface variables such as surface emissivity and solar zenith angle (SZA). The results also showed that split-window method can be adopted to estimate LST using brightness temperatures derived from Landsat- 7 low-gain and high-gain <b>TIR</b> <b>data.</b> Twenty-four polynomial models were developed using field observations to simulate and predict the air temperature profiles in a forest canopy at any hour during a summer day. The results showed that the effects of diurnal and seasonal variations of the temperature had to be considered in predicting air temperatures profiles in forest canopy.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} fifty years, a diverse set of thermal {{infrared}} (<b>TIR)</b> remote sensing <b>data</b> has been acquired from {{the orbits of}} Earth and Mars, which both have ubiquitous volcanic landforms. These data vary in spatial, spectral and temporal resolution and are critical for investigating an ever-expanding set of science applications including {{the focus of this}} review paper: volcanic processes. Volcanic studies using <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> include active monitoring of flows and plumes on Earth and mapping the compositional and thermophysical diversity on Mars. Furthermore, recent advances in high-resolution, low-cost, ground and laboratory TIR instrumentation now help to augment the orbital data through a synergistic approach to data analysis and validation. Field and laboratory studies also serve as terrestrially-focused analogues that provide important insights to interpret the geologic processes that have operated on other planetary surfaces including Mars. This review expands upon our invited talk of the same title at the 2014 Geological Society of America Meeting to include several case studies designed to give the reader an overview of how <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> can be applied to volcanic processes on Earth and Mars. These case studies highlight prior work by the authors presented at past meetings, but which have not been published elsewhere. The examples were chosen specifically to identify the <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> similarities between the two planets, and include analyses of volcanic surfaces to (1) derive composition and texture using TIR spectra (Earth and Mars); (2) analyze mantled flows with thermophysical data (Earth and Mars); (3) estimate lava discharge rate using TIR-derived temperature (Earth with application to Mars); and (4) model flow dynamics based on geomorphic measurements (Mars). Because of our focus on the TIR, we do not attempt to document other remote sensing wavelength regions nor even every volcanic study using <b>TIR</b> <b>data.</b> As <b>TIR</b> instruments have improved over time along similar trajectories, the higher spatial and spectral resolutions provide the ability to examine volcanic processes in more quantitative ways, despite the fact that no TIR instrument has ever been designed solely to study volcanic phenomena.

40|$|Models {{simulating}} {{the seasonal}} growth of vegetation have been recently coupled to soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer schemes (SVATS). Such coupled vegetation-SVATS models (V-S) account for {{changes of the}} vegetation leaf area index (LAI) over time. One problem faced by V-S models is {{the high number of}} parameters that are required to simulate different sites or large areas. Therefore, efficient calibration procedures are needed. This study describes an attempt to calibrate a V-S model with satellite [Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) ] data in the shortwave and longwave domains. A V-S model is described using ground data collected over three semiarid grassland sites during the Hydrological Atmospheric Pilot Experiment (HAPEX) -Sahel experiment. The effect of calibrating model parameters with time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and thermal infrared (<b>TIR)</b> <b>data</b> is assessed by examining the simulated latent heat flux (LE) and LAI for a suite of calibration experiments. A sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters related to plant growth vigor and to soil evaporative resistance were the best candidates for calibration. The NDVI and TIR time series were used to calibrate these parameters, both independently and simultaneously, to assess their synergy. Ground-based, airborne, and satellite sensor (AVHRR) data were successively investigated. Both airborne and AVHRR NDVI data could be used to constrain the vegetation growth vigor. These calibrations significantly improved the simulation of the LAI and LE (rmse decreased by 21 % for LE), and the site-to-site variability was greatly enhanced. The soil resistance could also be calibrated with ground-based <b>TIR</b> <b>data,</b> but the effect on the simulated variables was small. Although both NDVI and ground-based <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> were suitable to constrain the V-S model, the synergy between the two wavelengths was not clearly established. Last, satellite <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> from the AVHRR proved unsuitable for model calibration. Indeed, the AVHRR surface temperature values were systematically lower than both ground-based data and model outputs.

MASTER data acquired during the initial eruptive episode on Oct 14 showed maximum temperatures of similar to approximately 330 C and <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> acquired concurrently from a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) camera showed maximum temperatures similar to approximately 675 C, in narrow (approximately 1 -m) fractures of molten rock on a new resurgent dome.

40|$|Although {{the study}} of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect dates back to the early 1800 's when Luke Howard {{discovered}} London s heat island, it has only been with the advent of thermal remote sensing systems that the extent, characteristics, and impacts of the UHI have become to be understood. Analysis of the UHI effect is important because above all, this phenomenon can directly influence the health and welfare of urban residents. For example, in 1995, over 700 people died in Chicago due to heat-related causes. UHI s are characterized by increased temperature in comparison to rural areas and mortality rates during a heat wave increase exponentially with the maximum temperature, an effect that is exacerbated by the UHI. Aside from the direct impacts of the UHI on temperature, UHI s can produce secondary effects on local meteorology, including altering local wind patterns, increased development of clouds and fog, and increasing rates of precipitation either over, or downwind, of cities. Because of the extreme heterogeneity of the urban surface, in combination with the sprawl associated with urban growth, thermal infrared (<b>TIR)</b> remote sensing <b>data</b> have become of significant importance in understanding how land cover and land use characteristics affect the development and intensification of the UHI. <b>TIR</b> satellite <b>data</b> have been used extensively to analyze the surface temperature regimes of cities to help observe and measure the impacts of surface temperatures across the urban landscape. However, the spatial scales at which satellite <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> are collected are for the most part, coarse, with the finest readily available <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> collected by the Landsat ETM+ sensor at 60 m spatial resolution. For many years, we have collected high spatial resolution (10 m) data using an airborne multispectral TIR sensor over a number of cities across the United States. These high resolution data have been used to develop an understanding of how discrete surfaces across the urban environment (e. g., rooftops, pavements) interact from a surface-lower atmosphere energy flux perspective, to force the development of the UHI. Moreover, the airborne TIR sensor we used in our UHI studies was a multispectral sensor that had six channels in the 8 - 12 pm range. The advantages of collecting multispectral <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> became readily evident as a valuable tool for better calculation of unique surface thermal energy responses for urban materials over the 8 - 12 micrometer region, and also for getting a better handle on surface emissivity characteristics for these discrete surfaces. In this presentation, we will provide evidence on the virtues of how high spatial resolution multispectral <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> can provide for better analysis of the UHI that cannot now be attained via <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> obtained from satellites. Furthermore, we wish to provide compelling evidence on why future TIR satellite sensors should collect data at fine spatial resolutions (e. g. {{less than or equal to}} 30 m) to better allow for measurement of surface thermal energy fluxes from discrete urban surfaces, and to better understand how surface fluxes from different urban materials in cities around the world in different climatic regimes, affect development of the UHI characteristics...|$|R

However, due to {{the limitations of the}} existing satellite sensors, there is no earth observation which can obtain TIR at detailed spatial- and temporal-resolution simultaneously. Thus, several attempts of image fusion by blending the <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> from high temporal resolution sensor with data from high spatial resolution sensor have been studied. This paper presents a novel data fusion method by integrating image fusion and spatio-temporal fusion techniques, for deriving LST datasets at 30 m spatial resolution from daily MODIS image and Landsat ETM+ images.

This has many applications {{to the analysis of}} data from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) instrument that is currently in orbit at Mars. ASTER and THEMIS, whereas orbiting different planets, have similar spatial and spectral resolutions. THEMIS represents the highest spatial resolution (100 m) to date of the Martian surface, thereby allowing small (~ 1 km) impact craters to be studied in detail for the first time. Meteor Crater serves as an analog for the many similar-sized impact sites on the surface of Mars. These sites are future research targets with THEMIS, and ASTER data of Meteor Crater provides ideal data and geologic landscape in preparation for future THEMIS investigations. Fieldwork at Meteor Crater yielded sample collection of the primary lithologies and an opportunity to validate previously-collected high-resolution (3. 2 m), airborne Thermal Imaging Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) data. Laboratory thermal emission spectra were obtained for the samples collected. Deconvolution of ASTER <b>TIR</b> emissivity <b>data</b> were performed with image end-members and sample end-members. Comparisons of the spaceborne data to high-resolution airborne TIMS data were used to assess the validity of the ASTER end-member analyses. The ASTER image end-member analysis agreed well with the earlier TIMS end-member analysis where the effects of resolution degradation were accounted for. Laboratory spectra and mineral spectral libraries provided poor fits of deconvolution of multispectral <b>TIR</b> <b>data.</b> Lithologies with similar spectral signatures or with low areal abundances were difficult to identify. Using the same methodology as that applied to the ASTER <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> of Meteor Crater, THEMIS <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> of a small (~ 1 km) impact crater in Syrtis Major were analyzed.

The composition of the rim, ejecta, and surrounding plain was determined to be basaltic. It is hoped that the work performed here will complement future investigations of fresh impact sites with THEMIS data that may be used to solve geologic questions such as 1.) the composition of ejecta blocks that represent pre-impact, underlying stratigraphy in high-albedo, dust-covered regions of Mars, 2.) the approximate age of impact, and 3.) regolith/dust thickness, which appears to be a factor of # 2...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} {{airborne}} multispectral thermal infrared (<b>TIR)</b> remote sensing <b>data</b> collected {{at a high}} spatial resolution (i. e., 10 m) over several cities in the United States to study thermal energy characteristics of the urban landscape. These <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> provide {{a unique opportunity to}} quantify thermal responses from discrete surfaces typical of the urban landscape and to identify both the spatial arrangement and patterns of thermal processes across the city. The information obtained from these data is critical to understanding how urban surfaces drive or force development of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which exists as a dome of elevated air temperatures that presides over cities in contrast to surrounding non-urbanized areas. The UHI is most pronounced in the summertime where urban surfaces, such as rooftops and pavement, store solar radiation throughout the day, and release this stored energy slowly after sunset creating air temperatures over the city that are in excess of 2 - 4 'C warmer in contrast with non-urban or rural air temperatures. The UHI can also exist as a daytime phenomenon with surface temperatures in downtown areas of cities exceeding 38 'C. The implications of the UHI are significant, particularly as an additive source of thermal energy input that exacerbates the overall production of ground level ozone over cities. We have used the Airborne Thermal and Land Applications Sensor (ATLAS), flown onboard a Lear 23 jet aircraft from the NASA Stennis Space Center, to acquire high spatial resolution multispectral <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> (i. e., 6 bandwidths between 8. 2 - 12. 2 (um) over Huntsville, Alabama, Atlanta, Georgia, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Sacramento, California. These <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> have been used to produce maps and other products, showing the spatial distribution of heating and cooling patterns over these cities to better understand how the morphology of the urban landscape affects development of the UHI. In turn, these data have been used by government officials, urban planners, and other decision-makers, to make more informed decisions on how to mitigate the UHI and its subsequent impacts...|$|R
40|$|Thermal Infrared (<b>TIR)</b> {{remote sensing}} <b>data</b> can provide {{important}} measurements of surface energy fluxes and temperatures, which are integral to understanding landscape processes and responses. One {{example of this}} is the successful application of <b>TIR</b> remote sensing <b>data</b> to estimate evapotranspiration and soil moisture, where results from a number of studies suggest that satellite-based measurements from <b>TIR</b> remote sensing <b>data</b> can lead to more accurate regional-scale estimates of daily evapotranspiration. With further refinement in analytical techniques and models, the use of <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> from airborne and satellite sensors could be very useful for parameterizing surface moisture conditions and developing better simulations of landscape energy exchange over a variety of conditions and space and time scales. Thus, <b>TIR</b> remote sensing <b>data</b> can significantly contribute to the observation, measurement, and analysis of energy balance characteristics (i. e., the fluxes and redistribution of thermal energy within and across the land surface) as an implicit and important aspect of landscape dynamics and landscape functioning. The application of <b>TIR</b> remote sensing <b>data</b> in landscape ecological studies has been limited, however, for several fundamental reasons that relate primarily to the perceived difficulty in use and availability of these data by the landscape ecology community, and from the fragmentation of references on TIR remote sensing throughout the scientific literature. It is our purpose here to provide evidence from work that has employed TIR remote sensing for analysis of landscape characteristics to illustrate how these data can provide important data for the improved measurement of landscape energy response and energy flux relationships. We examine the direct or indirect use of <b>TIR</b> remote sensing <b>data</b> to analyze landscape biophysical characteristics, thereby offering some insight on how these data can be used more robustly to further the understanding and modeling of landscape ecological processes...|$|R
40|$|Lithologic mapping in {{the hostile}} and {{inaccessible}} mountainous region like the Himalaya and Tibet has frequently {{been a great}} challenge for geologists. The remote sensing techniques should be a potential player in lithologic mapping and structural analysis in these mountainous regions. With the successful development of minrealogic indices, e. g., Quartz Index (QI), Carbonate Index (CI), Mafic Index (MI) based on the ASTER multispectral thermal infrared (<b>TIR)</b> <b>data,</b> which have demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of ASTER <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> on lithologic mapping in the semi-arid to arid regions, we began to develop a lithologic mapping system since 2005. The system can store some necessary information for data searching and provide a priority order determination for the scenes covering the specified region. Also, it can calculate the mineralogic indices and generate the lithologic mapping images to cover the target region. This lithologic mapping system was successfully applied to lithologic mapping in some target regions in western China. We employ continuously ASTER <b>TIR</b> multispectral <b>data</b> for lithologic mapping in the western Tibetan Plateau, in which the geologic mapping is a great challenge for the human beings because the average elevation in this region is over 5000 m above sea level in 2009 JFY. Here, we show the regional scale lithologic mapping result. Detailed lithologic mapping and geologic analysis of ASTER multispectral data in this region will improve {{our understanding of the}} evolution of the India-Asia collision...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} early MODIS <b>TIR</b> channel <b>data</b> was {{evaluated}} over some special lake sites which were apparently covered by melting snow/ice and surrounded with snow covers. The MODIS data over such a lake in Kamchatka, Russia on 13 April 2000 {{indicate that the}} ninth channel in bands 21 and 24, and the fourth channel in band 22 are very noisy, and that the maximum difference and standard deviation of band 31 brightness temperatures in a sub-area of 10 by 5 pixels are 0. 24 K and 0. 04 K, respectively. After skipping the noisy channels, the standard deviations in other bands but band 21 range from 0. 10 to 0. 68 K, indicating satisfactory signal-to-noise ratios of the MODIS <b>TIR</b> <b>data.</b> Modifications {{were made in the}} product generation executive code PGE 16 for the daily MODIS Land-surface Temperature (LST) product to avoid the effects of the noisy channels. A vicarious calibration field campaign was conducted in Bolivia during May 26 and June 17, 2000. The calculated band brightness temperatures based on lake surface temperatures measured by multiple IR radiometers and thermistors deployed in the high-elevation Lake Titicaca (3841 m above sea level) and the atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles measured by radiosondes launched by the lakeshore are well matched the MODIS <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> produced by the new Level- 1 B code (version 2. 4. 2).

40|$|On {{several days}} in 2000 & 2001 the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection {{radiometer}} (ASTER) on the Terra satellite obtained data over the Jornada Experimental Range test site along the Rio Grande river and the White Sand National Monument in New Mexico. ASTER has 14 channels from the visible (VNIR) through the thermal infrared (TIR) with 15 m resolution in the VNIR and 90 m in the TIR. The overpass time is approximately 11 AM (MST). With 5 channels between 8 and 12 m these multispectral <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> from ASTER provide the opportunity to separate the temperature and emissivity effects observed in the thermal emission from the land surface. Ground measurements during these overflights included surface temperature, vegetation type and condition and limited surface emissivity measurements. Preliminary results indicate good agreement between ASTER emissivities and ground measures. Analysis of earlier aircraft data {{has shown that the}} multispectral <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> are very effective for estimating both the surface temperature and emissivity. These results will be compared with those obtained from the ASTER data for this site. With multispectral thermal infrared observations provided by ASTER it is possible {{for the first time to}} estimate the spectral emissivity variation for these surfaces on a global basis at high spatial resolution...|$|R
40|$|We {{attempt to}} {{identify}} thermal anomalies using thermal infrared (<b>TIR)</b> <b>data</b> collected over the Coso Geothermal Power Project with the spaceborne ASTER instrument. Our analysis emphasizes correc-tions for thermal artifacts in the satellite images caused by topography, albedo, and thermal inertia. This approach leads to noise reduction {{and has the}} potential to reveal thermal anomalies which are weak or not distinguishable in the uncorrected imagery. We have carried out field experiments concurrent with the collection of pairs of daytime and nighttime ASTER images over Coso. The field data include subsurface temperature measured with temperature probes at depths down to 1 m, surface temperatures recorded with a hand-held infrared camera and an infrared thermometer, reflectance of contrasting sur-faces measured with a hand-held spectroradiometer for the purpose of estimating the albedo effect, and radiosonde atmospheric profiles of temperature, wa-ter vapor, and pressure in order to apply atmospheric corrections to the images. The combined use of re-mote sensing and field data is intended to evaluate the performance of remote sensing as a cost-effective geothermal exploration tool. We reason that if reli-able thermal anomalies are identified at Coso, we can subsequently search for similar markers in <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> collected over areas of unknown geothermal potential between Coso and Mono Lake in eastern California...|$|R
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} correction of thermal infrared (TIR) imagery involves the combined tasks {{of separation of}} atmospheric transmittance, downwelling flux and upwelling radiance from the surface material spectral emissivity and temperature. The problem is ill posed and is thus hampered by spectral ambiguity among several possible feasible combinations of atmospheric temperature, constituent profiles, and surface material emissivities and temperatures. For many materials, their reflectance spectra in the Vis-SWIR provide a means of identification or at least classification into generic material types, vegetation, soil, etc. If Vis-SWIR data can be registered to <b>TIR</b> <b>data</b> or collected simultaneously as in sensors like the MASTER sensor, then the additional information on material type can be utilized to help lower the ambiguities in the <b>TIR</b> <b>data.</b> If the Vis-SWIR and TIR are collected simultaneously the water column amounts obtained form the {{atmospheric correction}} of the Vis-SWIR {{can also be utilized}} in reducing the ambiguity in the atmospheric quantities. The TIR atmospheric correction involves expansions in atmospheric and material emissivity basis sets. The method can be applied to hyperspectral and ultraspectral data, however it is particularly useful for multispectral TIR, where spectral smoothness techniques cannot be readily applied. The algorithm is described, and the approach applied to a MASTER sensor data set...|$|R

Also WS and salinity can be estimated with MSR data under {{the condition of the}} refined SSST. Simulation study results support the idea of the proposed data fusion method...|$|R
