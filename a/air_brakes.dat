5|$|The company started {{producing}} {{bus chassis}} in 1950, and the superstructures were {{built by a}} number of Finnish coach builders. The last models were appreciated {{by a number of}} bus operators, and missed after production was stopped. All Vanaja bus chassis were fitted with <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> by 1958, after the failure of hydraulic brakes on a Vanaja bus had led to one of the worst traffic accidents ever to have happened in Finland.|$|E
5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal cantilever wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E

The end customer was bus operator Väinö Paunu Oy, which also participated in the development work. In 1960, VAT introduced the VLK500 chassis with air suspension and dual-circuit <b>air</b> <b>brakes.</b> VAT returned to building rear-engined buses in 1966–67, but sales did not reach {{the level of the}} mid- and front-engined models. The company conducted a number of experiments with the construction; one example was a bus with a frameless structure in which the beams were replaced by a lighter solution.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME {{of the newly}} formed Southern Railway in 1923, and inherited the 1920 SECR order for ten Kclass locomotives. The order was still outstanding in 1924, {{although most of the}} component parts had been made. On 14 January 1925, Maunsell ordered No.790 to be overhauled and trialled on the Central section. As the locomotive proved suitable for the operating conditions of this section, the Southern Railway's Locomotive Committee proceeded with the assembly of the Kclass parts using outside contractors. Nine sets of parts (Nos. A791A799) were conveyed to Armstrong Whitworth for assembly and the finished locomotives delivered in May and June 1925. These were dual-fitted with vacuum and Westinghouse (<b>air)</b> <b>brakes</b> for use with the former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) rolling stock on the Central section. Other differences from the prototype included the relocation of the regulator to the dome and an increase in superheater area. The tenth set of parts was retained by Ashford and used for the first member of the K1class later that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{order for}} 50 {{aircraft}} placed in 1946 was modified to 48 single seaters and one aircraft for the OKB itself, all lacking armament. They were manufactured in March–April 1947 {{with the standard}} armament of one 37mm Nudelman N-37 autocannon, with 40 rounds, and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 guns, but the production line shut down afterward to incorporate some of the desired changes. These included reinforcement and enlargement of the vertical tail to improve lateral stability; <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> were added on the wings and the fuel system was improved. The underside of the rear fuselage was recontoured to smooth the air flow of the engine exhaust and air suction inside the fuselage was eliminated. Production restarted {{and a total of}} 243 single seaters were completed during the remainder of the year. 250 fighters and 60 trainers were scheduled to be built in 1948, but production was disrupted by preparations to begin manufacture of the vastly superior MiG-15 later that year. Only 302 fighters were delivered that year before production ceased.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was given the}} service designation of MiG-9 (internal OKB designations of I-301 and izdeliye FS) and a small batch of ten aircraft, equipped with original German engines, was ordered during 1946 from Factory No. 1 in Kazan before flight testing was completed. They were intended {{to be used in}} the parade, but bad weather forced the cancellation of their flypast. Two of them were assigned to participate in the state acceptance trials while others were used as testbeds for various programs. The trials were concluded in June and the MiG-9 generally met the performance goals set by the Council of People's Commissars. The test pilots found the fighter easy and simple to fly. Defects noted during testing were that the engines flamed out when firing the cannon at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion, no ejection seat was fitted, nor were <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> or a fire suppression system. The fuel tanks were not self-sealing and no armor was provided for the pilot. Despite these drawbacks, the MiG-9 was ordered into production at Factory No. 1 before the acceptance tests were completed as the Soviet leadership believed that its shortcomings could be rectified during production. A batch of 50 aircraft, 40 single-seat fighters and 10 two-seat trainers, were ordered in late 1946 to participate in the 1947 May Day parade. In recognition of their accomplishment Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich were awarded the Stalin Prize in 1947.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Air</b> <b>brake</b> {{systems have}} been widely used in heavy trucks and {{intercity}} buses for its great superiority over other brake system. In traditional, many researchers focused on the vehicle dynamics which employ the static characteristic of brake system to analysis the vehicle brake capacity. In fact, the practical performance of <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system may be greatly different from the static theory. Thus, it is necessary to build an integrate <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system model to simulate the process of brake accurately. Also, some works focused on the dynamic characteristics of brake system have been completed, but it is not comprehensive without the considering the effect of vehicle dynamics. In this paper, a completely <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system dynamic model is built, where the <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system contains pneumatic subsystem and mechanical subsystem. The <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system is embedded in a heavy truck dynamic model which contains three axles. The simulation results show the brake distance, vehicle velocity, vehicle deceleration, and brake torque for each wheel in the process of brake...|$|R
25|$|Harding {{left the}} lead {{locomotive}} No.5017 running to keep air pressure supplied to the train's <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> and also applied {{a number of}} hand brakes. Yves Bourdon, a member of MMA's Board of Directors, stated that the <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> of all locomotives and freight cars had been activated, as well as hand brakes on 5 locomotives and 10 of the 72 freight cars. However, the TSB agrees with a July 6 statement to police by the train's engineer that he set hand brakes on just the five locomotive engines, a buffer car, and a car housing the remote control apparatus. The engineer also attempted a brake test but incorrectly left the locomotive <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> on; this gave the false impression that the hand brakes alone would hold the train.|$|E
25|$|On January 27, 2009, {{one of the}} coaster cars did {{not make}} it over the last hill on the Fairly Odd Coaster and stalled. No one was hurt, and once the lap bars were unlatched, the riders in the stalled car were let off. The other two cars on the circuit were stopped safely by the computer's {{actuation}} of the ride's <b>air</b> <b>brakes.</b> The ride's <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> made a noise like a gunshot, which caused a small panic. The ride was running normally the next day.|$|E
25|$|The MMA has {{alleged that}} the lead {{locomotive}} was tampered with after Harding had left; that the diesel engine was shut down, thereby disabling the compressor powering the <b>air</b> <b>brakes,</b> which allowed the train to roll downhill from Nantes into Lac-Mégantic once the air pressure dropped in the reservoirs on the cars. Teamsters Canada Rail Conference vice-president Doug Finnson disputed this theory, stating that the key braking system on a stopped, unsupervised train are the hand brakes, which are completely independent from the motor-powered compressor that feeds the <b>air</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A large <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> {{was built}} into the tail cone of the aircraft. [...] The {{hydraulically}} operated <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> formed two leaves that could be opened into the airstream to quickly decelerate the aircraft. [...] The style of <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> chosen by Blackburn was highly effective in the dive-attack profile that the Buccaneer was intended to perform, as well as effectively balancing out induced drag from operating the BLC system. [...] It featured a variable incidence tailplane that could be trimmed to suit the particular requirements of low-speed handling, or high-speed flight; the tailplane had to be high mounted due to the positioning and functionality of the Buccaneer's <b>air</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|R
25|$|A railway <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> is a {{conveyance}} {{braking system}} which applies {{the means of}} compressed air which modern locomotives use to this day. George Westinghouse, a pioneer of the electrical industry, invented the railroad <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> in 1872.|$|R
50|$|The PRR was {{the first}} American {{railroad}} to adopt the Westinghouse <b>air</b> <b>brake,</b> the first tests of which were made in September 1869; Class A locomotives were among those fitted with <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> equipment for those earliest tests.|$|R
25|$|With all the {{locomotives}} shut down, the {{air compressor}} no longer supplied {{air to the}} air brake system. As air leaked from the brake system, the main air reservoirs were slowly depleted, gradually reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} locomotive <b>air</b> <b>brakes.</b> At 00:56, the air pressure had dropped to a point at which the combination of locomotive <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> and hand brakes could no longer hold the train, and it began to roll downhill toward Lac-Mégantic, just over seven miles away. A witness recalled watching the train moving slowly toward Lac-Mégantic without the locomotive lights on. The track was not equipped with signals to alert the rail traffic controller to the presence of a runaway train.|$|E

25|$|The first Chicken, no. 33, was {{met with}} dissatisfaction by the employees. They were built without <b>air</b> <b>brakes,</b> which meant that the {{conductor}} would have to traverse a full tram to reach the emergency brake should the motorman fall unconscious. The railway authorities sided with the employees, requiring the company to rebuild the unit. A similar concern was raised concerning the trailers. As <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> are fail safe, the trailers would automatically brake should the trailer become disconnected. With the need for pressurized air system in place, the advantages of pneumatic door were reaped. However, the pneumatics systems largely ate up the costs savings of rebuilding material. Most of the work was carried out at Sagene Depot, and was carried out between mid-1954 to 1958.|$|E
