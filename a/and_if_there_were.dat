25|$|The cafés {{and bars}} of Montparnasse were {{a meeting place}} where ideas were hatched and mulled over. The cafés at the centre of Montparnasse's night-life were in the Carrefour Vavin, now renamed Place Pablo-Picasso. In Montparnasse's heyday (from 1910 to 1920), the cafés Le Dôme, La Closerie des Lilas, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupoleall of which are still in {{business}} were the places where starving artists could occupy a table all evening for a few centimes. If they fell asleep, the waiters were instructed not to wake them. Arguments were common, some fuelled by intellect, others by alcohol, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> fights, and there often were, the police were never summoned. If you couldn't pay your bill, people such as La Rotonde's proprietor, Victor Libion, would often accept a drawing, holding it until the artist could pay. As such, {{there were times when}} the café's walls were littered with a collection of artworks, that today would make the curators of the world's greatest museums drool with envy.|$|E

500|$|Due to its {{commercial}} and critical success, Square Enix released a direct sequel to Final Fantasy X in 2003, titled Final Fantasy X-2. The sequel is set {{two years after}} the conclusion of Final Fantasy X, establishing new conflicts and dilemmas and resolving loose ends left by the original game. Although the sequel did not sell as well as the original, 3.96 million units versus 6.6 million units, it can still be considered a commercial success. As a result of the title's popularity, Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima decided to establish a plot-related connection between Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy VII, another well-received Final Fantasy game. In 2013, after the release of the HD Remaster, Nojima stated {{that he would like to}} see a second sequel to X, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> demand for it, it could happen.

500|$|When the Thirteenth Amendment was {{submitted}} to the states on February 1, 1865, it was quickly taken up by [...] several legislatures. By {{the end of the}} month it had been ratified by eighteen states. Among them were the ex-Confederate states of Virginia and Louisiana, where ratifications were submitted by Reconstruction governments. These, along with subsequent ratifications from Arkansas and Tennessee raised the issues of how many seceded states had legally valid legislatures; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> fewer legislatures than states, if Article V required ratification by three-fourths of the states or three-fourths of the legally valid state legislatures.

500|$|... "It seems fair to {{say that}} if the {{influence}} of a scientist is interpreted broadly enough to include impact on fields beyond science proper, then John von Neumann was probably the most influential mathematician who ever lived," [...] wrote Miklós Rédei in John von Neumann: Selected Letters. James Glimm wrote: [...] "he is {{regarded as one of the}} giants of modern mathematics". The mathematician Jean Dieudonné said that von Neumann [...] "may have been the last representative of a once-flourishing and numerous group, the great mathematicians who were equally at home in pure and applied mathematics and who throughout their careers maintained a steady production in both directions", while Peter Lax described him as possessing the [...] "most scintillating intellect of this century". In the foreword of Miklós Rédei's Selected Letters, Peter Lax wrote, [...] "To gain a measure of von Neumann's achievements, consider that had he lived a normal span of years, he would certainly have been a recipient of a Nobel Prize in economics. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> Nobel Prizes in computer science and mathematics, he would have been honored by these, too. So the writer of these letters should be thought of as a triple Noble laureate or, possibly, a -fold winner, for his work in physics, in particular, quantum mechanics".|$|E

Whatever it takes. We're going into our 40th anniversary so the timing couldn't be more perfect. Eventually Doyle's got to write a new album; I've got to write a new album; Glenn's got to write a new album. Why don't we work together and make the greatest album ever? Now we've got different elements. We've got Doyle playing more of a metal kind of thing. We've got Dave, who we're trying to figure out what the fuck he's doing. And Glenn's got his own thing. And Acey [...] fills in good, too. And I've got the band where it is today. So it's a matter of re-molding and using all the different elements that I've got." [...] When asked if Danzig would want to record new music Only said, [...] "I think it's got to evolve naturally. The thing is we've tried to plan things, and then we stand there and wait, and as it comes we'll just do it. When we go back — I don't know about Glenn — but I canceled our touring and everything for this, so I'm going to go home and write and lift." ...|$|E

2500|$|In her {{review of}} the first volume, Sheena McNeil praised the series for its {{beautiful}} art and suspenseful plot. Another reviewer enjoyed the second volume, finding her art [...] "lovely" [...] and the story enjoyable. Anime News Network's Liann Cooper enjoyed the art and plot of the second volume, writing that the backstory of the series helped to create interest for the reader. In her follow-up {{review of the}} third volume, Cooper wrote: [...] "Yes, this is a weird manga <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> an award for most messed-up plot, Angel Sanctuary would be a strong contender. But, amidst all of the bizarro relationships and religious references you become acutely aware that this title has a sinful appeal that just makes you desire more." [...] Holly Ellinwood of Active Anime described the [...] "heavy crossover of religions combined with social issues and personal lines of integrity" [...] as [...] "spellbinding". Ellingwood also praised that art as [...] "absorbing.... more detailed than most, beautifully Gothic even when depicting the most foul horrors" [...] and noted that the series focused on unconditional love. Although Manga Life's Kat Collyns praised Yuki's art as beautiful, Collyns found the plot [...] "confusing" [...] at times and wrote that the series' issues of gender and incest might discourage readers. Another reviewer stated: [...] "Angel Sanctuary, both the story and the art, is overly crowded, somewhat confusing, mildly disturbing, and potentially addicting." [...] In , Jason Thompson rated Angel Sanctuary 3 out of 4 stars, describing it as [...] "The archetypical 1990s goth manga." [...] While he enjoyed the art, he wrote that the plot proved difficult to follow because of the page layouts, the large cast of androgynous characters, and the [...] "barrage of events and names".|$|E
