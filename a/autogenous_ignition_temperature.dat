40|$|Thermite {{compounds}} {{have received}} a renewed interest due {{to their ability to}} store large quantities of energy that is comparable to conventional energetic materials. Such reactive materials can be manipulated to create a nanolaminated structure. It has been shown that an increase in the fraction of nanolaminated particles can reduce the <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> and increase reactivity. In the present study, methods to lower the <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of aluminium copper-oxide (Al-CuO) are assessed. Arrested reactive milling (ARM) was used on stoichiometric Al-CuO powders to increase the nanolamination and reduce the <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> to 840 Kelvins (K). Milling alone not only reduced the <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> slightly, but for milling times greater than 30 minutes, intermediate phases were produced, which had negative impacts on the reaction characteristics. Another method to reduce the <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of Al-CuO involved creating a hybrid mixture using a compound with a lower <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> to further decrease the <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of Al-CuO. ARM was used to lower the <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of a nickel aluminium (Ni-Al) intermetallic compound down to 480 K. Hybrid mixtures were then created with varying concentrations of milled and unmilled Al-CuO-Ni. Powders were then tested in a tubular furnace to determine the <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> dependence on heating rate and concentration of constituents. It has been shown that an unmilled hybrid mixture with 75 % and 50 % concentration of Al-CuO has an <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of 840 K. Higher concentrations of Ni-Al resulted in lowered <b>ignition</b> <b>temperatures</b> which varied between 600 K and 480 K. A milled hybrid mixture has lower <b>ignition</b> <b>temperatures</b> than an unmilled mixture. It was shown that a milled hybrid mixture with a 75 % concentration of Al-CuO has an <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of 840 K, corresponding to pure Al-CuO.

40|$|Abstract 7 -aminocephalosporanic acid (7 -ACA) {{is the key}} {{intermediate}} {{powder to}} product cephalosporin. The <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> test device (NU-TC 1000) for dust cloud {{was used to test}} the minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of 7 -ACA dust cloud. When the dispersion mass of 7 -ACA dust is 0. 8 g, the minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of dust cloud is 496 °C.

40|$|The ASTM G 72 /G 72 M- 15 Standard Test Method for <b>Autogenous</b> <b>Ignition</b> <b>Temperature</b> of Liquids and Solids in a High-Pressure Oxygen-Enriched Environment is {{currently}} {{used to evaluate}} materials for the ignition susceptibility driven by exposure to external heat in an enriched oxygen environment. Testing performed on highly volatile liquids such as cleaning solvents has proven problematic due to inconsistent test results (non-ignitions). Non-ignition results can be misinterpreted as favorable oxygen compatibility, although {{they are more likely}} associated with inadequate fuel-to-oxidizer ratios. Forced evaporation during purging and inadequate sample size were identified as two potential causes for inadequate available sample material during testing. In an effort to maintain adequate fuel-to-oxidizer ratios within the reaction vessel during test, several parameters were considered, including sample size, pretest sample chilling, pretest purging, and test pressure. Tests on a variety of solvents exhibiting a range of volatilities are presented in this paper. A proposed improvement to the standard test protocol {{as a result of this}} evaluation is also presented. Execution of the final proposed improved test protocol outlines an incremental step method of determining optimal conditions using increased sample sizes while considering test system safety limits. The proposed improved test method increases confidence in results obtained by utilizing the ASTM G 72 <b>autogenous</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> test method and can aid in the oxygen compatibility assessment of highly volatile liquids and other conditions that may lead to false non-ignition results...|$|E

40|$|Solvents used {{to clean}} oxygen system {{components}} must be assessed for oxygen compatibility, as incompatible residue or fluid inadvertently left behind within an oxygen system can pose a flammability risk. The most recent approach focused on solvent ignition susceptibility {{to assess the}} flammability risk associated with these materials. Previous evaluations included Ambient Pressure Liquid Oxygen (LOX) Mechanical Impact Testing (ASTM G 86) and <b>Autogenous</b> <b>Ignition</b> <b>Temperature</b> (AIT) Testing (ASTM G 72). The goal in this approach was to identify a solvent material that was not flammable in oxygen. As environmental policies restrict the available options of acceptable solvents, it has proven difficult to identify one that is not flammable in oxygen. A more rigorous oxygen compatibility approach is needed {{in an effort to}} select a new solvent for NASA applications. NASA White Sands Test Facility proposed an approach that acknowledges oxygen flammability, yet selects solvent materials based on their relative oxygen compatibility ranking, similar to that described in ASTM G 63 - 99. Solvents are selected based on their ranking with respect to minimal ignition susceptibility, damage and propagation potential, as well as their relative ranking when compared with other solvent materials that are successfully used in oxygen systems. Test methods used in this approach included ASTM G 86 (Ambient Pressure LOX Mechanical Impact Testing and Pressurized Gaseous Oxygen (GOX) Mechanical Impact Testing), ASTM G 72 (AIT Testing), and ASTM D 240 (Heat of Combustion (HOC) Testing). Only four solvents were tested through the full battery of tests for evaluation of oxygen compatibility: AK- 225 G as a baseline comparison, Solstice PF, L- 14780, and Vertrel MCA. Baseline solvent AK- 225 G exhibited the lowest HOC and highest AIT of solvents tested. Nonetheless, Solstice PF, L- 14780, and Vertrel MCA HOCs all fell well within the range of properties that are associated with proven oxygen system materials. Tested AITs for these solvents fell only slightly lower than the AIT for the proven AK- 225 G solvent. Based on these comparisons in which solvents exhibited properties within those ranges seen with proven oxygen system materials, it is believed that Solstice PF, L- 14780, and Vertrel MCA would perform well with respect to oxygen compatibility...|$|E

In this paper, tradition <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> determination methods and their application limitations were discussed by analyzing the DTA curve.

30|$|The <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of CWS is {{determined}} by a vertical line which is firstly made upwards through the DTG peak point to meet the TG oblique line, and then a tangent line to TG oblique line made to meet the extended TG initial level line. Thereby, the <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> {{is defined by the}} temperature at the intersection point (Umar et al. 2006). As shown in Fig.  8, the <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of the four CWSs all decrease with the increase of D, but increase with the increase of heating rates. When D of BRYM, BR 1, BR 2, and BR 3 increases from 2.31 to 2.47, 2.24 to 2.38, 2.26 to 2.37 and 2.30 to 2.41 respectively, the <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of CWSs made of BRYM, BR 1, BR 2, and BR 3 decreases from 475 to 442, 481 to 461, 482 to 451 and 480 to 446  °C at the heating rate of 50  °C/min, while at the heating rate of 15  °C/min decreases from 438 to 389, 462 to 441, 467 to 440 and 462 to 437  °C respectively. The results show that the CWS <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> is reduced with the decrease of heating rate. It can be explained that the heat exchange, not only from furnace wall to coal particles but also from particle surfaces to inner nucleus, increases with the decrease of heating rate (Cheng et al. 2008). The pore fractal dimension is defined as quantitative characterization for pore structures, and the pore fractal dimension is larger, meaning the more micropores which lead to increase specific surface areas. The large specific surface areas can provide more interface for oxygen which is conducive to volatilization and heterogeneous ignition. So as to reduce the coal particle size, particle resistance is reduced, and the lower <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> shows that the coal is more inflammable and the apparent activation energy becomes smaller.|$|R

Compared with conventional combustion, the inhibiting effect of CO 2 was found to be comparatively large in dust clouds, particularly for the coal dusts with high volatile content.

In addition, a modified steady-state mathematical model based on heterogeneous reaction was proposed to interpret the observed experimental phenomena and to estimate the ignition mechanism of coal dust clouds under minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> conditions. The analysis revealed that heterogeneous ignition dominates the ignition mechanism for sub-/bituminous coal dusts under minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> conditions, but the decrease of coal maturity facilitates homogeneous ignition.
