2500|$|Another {{control a}} {{compressor}} might offer is hard/soft knee. [...] This controls whether the {{bend in the}} response curve between below threshold and above threshold is abrupt (hard) or gradual (soft). <b>A</b> soft <b>knee</b> slowly increases the compression ratio as the level increases and eventually reaches the compression ratio set by the user. <b>A</b> soft <b>knee</b> reduces the audible change from uncompressed to compressed, especially for higher ratios where <b>a</b> hard <b>knee</b> changeover would be more noticeable.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background and Purpose: Two-stage {{revision}} arthroplasty is {{a common}} technique {{for the treatment of}} infected total knee replacement. Few reports have addressed the conversion of <b>a</b> fused <b>knee</b> into <b>a</b> total <b>knee</b> replacement. However, there is no case reported of converting <b>an</b> infected fused <b>knee</b> into <b>a</b> hinge <b>knee</b> using <b>a</b> one-stage procedure. Methods: We report on a 51 -year old male patient with <b>an</b> infected fused <b>knee</b> after multiple surgeries. Results and Interpretation: A one-stage conversion of septic fused knee into total <b>knee</b> arthroplasty by <b>a</b> rotational hinge prosthesis was performed. The case highlights that with profound preoperative assessment, meticulous surgical technique, combined antibiotic treatment and the right implant, one-stage revision in a surgical challenge may have a role as a treatment option with good functional outcome...|$|R

40|$|Ligament {{balancing}} affects {{many of the}} postoperative {{criteria for}} <b>a</b> successful <b>knee</b> replacement. <b>A</b> balanced <b>knee</b> contributes to improved alignment and stability. Ligament balancing helps reduce wear and loosening of the joint. A patient with <b>a</b> balanced <b>knee</b> {{is more likely to}} have increased range of motion and proprioception, and decreased pain. All these factors help minimize the need for revision surgery. Complications associated with ligament balancing can include instability caused by over-balancing and the possibility of neurovascular damage during or as a result of ligament balancing. This article attempts to summarize the literature, to define <b>a</b> balanced <b>knee,</b> and outline the benefits and possible complications of ligament balancing. Different techniques, sequences, and tools used in ligament balancing, and their relevance in correcting various deformities are reviewed...|$|R

5|$|While the NHL {{returned}} to action in 2005–06, {{he missed the}} first month of the season after suffering <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury in a pre-season game. Doctors considered Regehr fortunate, believing that <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> brace he had been wearing prevented a more severe injury that would have seen him miss up to six months. Despite missing 14 games, he set career highs in goals (6), assists (20) and points (26). He continued to quietly lead the Flames defence and earned a spot on the Canadian Olympic team in 2006. Regehr briefly played with his brother, Richie, who made his NHL debut with the Flames on December 29, 2005. He played the full season in 2006–07, including his 500th career game on March 15, 2007, against the Dallas Stars and scored his 100th career point on March 31 against the Vancouver Canucks.

5000|$|At {{heel strike}} the {{vertical}} ground reaction force is located anterior to {{the axis of}} rotation of the knee joint. Momentarily, this creates <b>an</b> external <b>knee</b> extension moment during the first percent of stance. To counteract this moment, <b>an</b> internal <b>knee</b> flexion moment is generated to assist with stabilizing the knee joint as it prepares for weight acceptance. Once the foot is flat the vertical ground reaction force moves posterior to the knee joint as the trunk glides over the stance foot, resulting in <b>an</b> external <b>knee</b> flexion moment. This is counteracted by <b>an</b> internal <b>knee</b> extension moment which continues {{through the rest of}} stance. This knee extension moment assists with weight acceptance and deceleration of the forward motion of the center of mass.|$|R
