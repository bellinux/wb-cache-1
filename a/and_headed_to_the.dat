As they neared land Braham and Walsh noticed a slight whine in the aircraft's radio speakers meaning the Mosquito was being tracked by radar.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 Florida {{subtropical}} storm, officially {{known as}} Subtropical Storm One, {{was the only}} subtropical cyclone of the inactive 1982 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm originated from two different systems around the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea on June 16. The systems merged into trough while a circulation began to form {{off the coast of}} Florida on June 18. The depression made landfall in Florida and strengthened into a storm over land. The storm entered the Atlantic Ocean <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, becoming extratropical on June 20 near Newfoundland. The storm was the only system of 1982 to affect the eastern half of the United States, and it caused three fatalities and caused $10million in damage (1982USD, $21million 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of January 29, Mậu and Khiêm alerted the rebel troops to assume their {{positions}} around Saigon. These included many of those used in the first coup: armored cars and tanks and some elements from the 5th and 7th Divisions, two airborne battalions and one Marine battalion {{and an assortment of}} Special Forces, Ranger and Civil Guard units. A number of American officers and embassy officials were alerted to be in their offices at 02:00. Lodge was kept fully informed throughout the night. As the time approached, Khánh donned his paratrooper uniform <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military headquarters at Tan Son Nhut, where he saw that the compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khiêm, he found that his co-conspirator had overslept after having forgotten to set his alarm clock.

5|$|Saavedra {{began to}} lose {{political}} power from this point. The decree of Mariano Moreno that changed the military promotions, which was never derogated, began to bear fruit, even if Moreno {{was not in the}} Junta anymore. The army became more professional, and less based on militias. Many of the new military authorities opposed Saavedra. The political crisis increased with the unfavourable military outcomes of the war: Belgrano was defeated at the Paraguay campaign, Castelli at the Upper Peru campaign, and the capture of Montevideo became increasingly difficult with the intervention of Portuguese troops supporting it. The many members of the Junta made the internal work difficult, as all measures were discussed by all members, hindering the swift reactions needed by the war. Saavedra left Buenos Aires at this point, <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Upper Peru, to take command of the Army of the North. He thought that he could be of greater help as a military leader than facing the political struggles of Buenos Aires.|$|E

25|$|After three days, Bouchard {{informed}} Brown {{that his}} ship {{was close to}} sinking and that the officers wished to return to Buenos Aires. He then asked for {{a division of the}} booty, and received the Consecuencia, the Carmen, and 3,475 pesos as compensation (he had to leave the Halcón behind). Bouchard elected to return to Buenos Aires via Cape Horn, and it was there that new incidents with the crew arose, many of which were solved with violence, such as a duel with one of his sergeants. When an officer on the Carmen notified Bouchard that the ship was in imminent danger of foundering, Bouchard nonetheless ordered the man to continue the journey. As a result, the crew mutinied <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Galápagos Islands. The Consecuencia, with Bouchard still in command, made port in Buenos Aires on 18 June.|$|E

25|$|On {{her third}} {{international}} sailing, Suomen Joutsen left Helsinki on 1 November 1933 <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean, where she visited the ports of Marseille, Alexandria and Naples. While heading towards Gibraltar {{on her way}} to the Atlantic, an English steam ship tauntingly offered to tow the Finnish full rigged ship which was sailing slowly close to the wind. However, shortly afterwards the wind changed its direction and Suomen Joutsen overtook the steamer with a towing line hanging from the stern hawsehole, offering to provide assistance for the slower ship. After stopping briefly at the Canary Islands, the ship crossed the Atlantic and arrived in Haiti on 10 March 1934 after 25 days of sailing. The return voyage began six days later. On 6 April, while in the middle of the Northern Atlantic, Suomen Joutsen was hit by hurricane-force winds that caused the ship to list almost 56 degrees. She survived the worst storm of her career without major damage and arrived in Helsinki on 16 May 1934.|$|E
25|$|Intrepid was {{reclassified}} to an anti-submarine warfare carrier, CVS-11, on 8 December 1961.

After {{the completion of the}} overhaul and refit, she departed on 2 April with Carrier Antisubmarine Air Group 56 embarked. After training exercises, Intrepid was selected as the principal ship in the recovery team for astronaut Scott Carpenter and his Project Mercury space capsule, Aurora 7. Shortly before noon on 24 May 1962, Carpenter splashed down in Aurora 7 several hundred miles from Intrepid. Minutes after he was located by land-based search aircraft, two helicopters from Intrepid, carrying NASA officials, medical experts, Navy frogmen, and photographers, were airborne <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rescue. One of the choppers picked him up over an hour later and flew him to the carrier which safely returned him to the United States. Intrepid spent the summer of 1962 training midshipmen at sea, and received a thorough overhaul at Norfolk in the fall.|$|E
25|$|In August 1444, a Mamluk force under Aynal Gecut {{landed at}} the Hospitaller held island of Kastellorizo, razing its castle before departing for Rhodes. On 10 August, the Mamluk fleet {{consisting}} of 85 ships {{appeared in the}} channel between Rhodes and Asia Minor. The Mamluks landed at the north–western edge of the island, north of Trianta. Facing no resistance they captured positions adjacent to the Rhodes citadel, and began firing arrows at the city's defenders who responded in kind. The following day, the Mamluks focused their attention {{on the western side}} of the castle, especially the poorly defended gate of Agios Antonios, bombarding it with their artillery. A second Mamluk column raided the Mandraki port to the east of the castle, destroying numerous ships and causing heavy casualties to their crews. Once the gate was secured the Grand Master ordered a foray into Mandraki. French and Catalan members of the order pushed the Mamluks out of the harbor, slaying many and forcing others to flee. Hostilities were halted {{for a period of time}} as the two forces reorganized. On 10 September, the Hospitallers attacked the Santa Maria outpost south–west of the Agios Antonios gate. Heavy fighting ensued and the Mamluks eventually withdrew taking their dead and wounded with them. On 13 September, the Mamluks packed their tents and lifted the siege contrary to the orders of their sultan, leaving for the location of their initial landing. Jean de Lastic proposed conducting an assault on the Mamluks in order to disrupt their withdrawal, however his military council rejected the plan. On 18 September, the Mamluks finished embarking on their ships <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> direction of Asia Minor.|$|E

Are those hands coming apart, or are they finding each other?' ... we tried to bring up these deeper questions that relate to song and her life and finding beauty in chaos and finding beauty in pain and finding pain in beauty."
