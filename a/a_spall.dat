50|$|The {{possible}} anvilstone {{has received}} {{a great deal of}} scrutiny. This is a very large stone: 4.5 kg in weight, 21.6 cm long, 15 cm wide, and 12 cm thick. It is much larger than any other stones at this level (Ray 2000:69). Using the Sac River, experiments were conducted to determine if the stone could have been moved to this position by the river. Even during water discharges from the Stockton dam, the stone failed to be moved by the water. Ray and Lopinot have thus concluded that it is most likely a manuport, though other transport methods such as rootwad rafting and ice-rafting can not be entirely ruled out (Chandler 2001b). One other curious feature regarding the stone’s location is that the stone is broken into three pieces, situated very close together. One end of the stone is broken off, with <b>a</b> <b>spall</b> from the break. The broken piece is rotated 120 degrees from its original position and would be at a right angle to the flow of the water had its relocation been through water action. In addition, the spall, which is from the upper surface of the stone, is under the smaller piece. This is highly suggestive of the piece being deliberately moved after the break occurred (Ray 2000:69).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{bilinear}} {{brittle failure}} criterion that utilizes the {{unconfined compressive strength}} (UCS) and <b>a</b> <b>spalling</b> limit of 3. 4, together with a tensile strength cut-off {{can be used to}} model the height of failure above coal mine roadways. Transverse isotropy can be incorporated into a continuum analysis by using a Young’s Modulus/Independent shear modulus ratio of 15. To predict the height of failure, the two key variables are the roof strength index (UCS/pre-mining vertical stress) and the horizontal to vertical stress ratio. By factoring in the stress concentrations that occur about a longwall excavation the criterion can be used to predict heights of failure on initial roadway development and in the maingate.

40|$|International audienceSome {{insights}} on boundary effects in nonlocal damage modelling are addressed. Interaction stresses {{that are at}} the origin of nonlocality are expected to vanish at the boundary of a solid, in the normal direction to this boundary. Existing models do not account for such an effect. We introduce tentative modifications of the classical nonlocal damage model aimed at accounting for this boundary layer effect in a continuum modelling setting. Computations show that some nonnegligible differences may be observed between the classical and modified formulations. In a one dimensional spalling test, only the modified formulation provides <b>a</b> <b>spall</b> of finite nonzero thickness, whereas spalls smaller than the internal length cannot be obtained according to the original formulation. For the same set of model parameters, including the internal length, the fracture energy derived from the size effect test method is also very different according to both approaches. Parameters in the size effect laws for notched and unnotched specimens, obtained from computation of geometrically similar bending beams, are more consistent with the modified nonlocal model compared to the original nonlocal formulation...|$|E
40|$|We present {{one-dimensional}} numerical simulations {{describing the}} behavior of solid matter exposed to subpicosecond near infrared pulsed laser radiation. We point out {{to the role of}} strong isochoric heating as a mechanism for producing highly non-equilibrium thermodynamic states. In the case of metals, the conditions of material ejection from the surface are discussed in a hydrodynamic context, allowing correlation of the thermodynamic features with ablation mechanisms. A convenient synthetic representation of the thermodynamic processes is presented, emphasizing different competitive pathways of material ejection. Based on the study of the relaxation and cooling processes which constrain the system to follow original thermodynamic paths, we establish that the metal surface can exhibit several kinds of phase evolution which can result in phase explosion or fragmentation. An estimation of the amount of material exceeding the specific energy required for melting is reported for copper and aluminum and a theoretical value of the limit-size of the recast material after ultrashort laser irradiation is determined. Ablation by mechanical fragmentation is also analysed and compared to experimental data for aluminum subjected to high tensile pressures and ultrafast loading rates.
