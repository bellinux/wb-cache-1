5|$|Winner {{was an art}} collector, and <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur</b> of British illustration. His art {{collection}} included works by Jan Micker, William James, Edmund Dulac, E. H. Shepard, Arthur Rackham, Kay Nielsen and Beatrix Potter. It also included almost 200 signed colour-washed illustrations by Donald McGill. In 2008 announced his intention to bequeath the house as a museum, but discussions with Kensington and Chelsea council stalled after {{they were unable to}} meet the £15 million cost of purchasing the freehold of the property, which expires in 2046. The freehold is owned by the Ilchester Estate.|$|E
5|$|Charles I was <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur</b> of art, {{and paid}} greater {{attention}} to the aesthetic aspects of Windsor Castle than his predecessors. Charles had the castle completely surveyed by a team including Inigo Jones in 1629, but little of the recommended work was carried out. Nonetheless, Charles employed Nicholas Stone to improve the chapel gallery in the Mannerist style and to construct a gateway in the North Terrace. Christian van Vianen, a noted Dutch goldsmith, was employed to produce a baroque gold service for the St George's Chapel altar. In {{the final years of}} peace, Charles demolished the fountain in the Upper Ward, intending to replace it with a classical statue.|$|E
5|$|During the 1640s and 1650s, Velázquez {{served as}} both court painter and curator of PhilipIV's {{expanding}} collection of European art. He {{seems to have}} been given an unusual degree of freedom in the role. He supervised the decoration and interior design of the rooms holding the most valued paintings, adding mirrors, statues and tapestries. He was also responsible for the sourcing, attribution, hanging and inventory of many of the Spanish king's paintings. By the early 1650s, Velázquez was widely respected in Spain as <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur.</b> Much of the collection of the Prado today—including works by Titian, Raphael, and Rubens—were acquired and assembled under Velázquez's curatorship.|$|E

5|$|One of the king's most {{substantial}} achievements was in {{the cultural}} sphere; he became a notable patron of the arts. Władysław was <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur</b> of the arts, in particular, theater and music. He spoke several languages, enjoyed reading historical literature and poetry. He collected paintings and created a notable gallery of paintings in the Warsaw castle. Władysław assembled an important collection of Italian and Flemish Baroque paintings, much of which {{were lost in the}} wars after his death. He sponsored many musicians and in 1637 created the first amphitheater in the palace, the first theater in Poland, where during his reign dozens of operas and ballets were performed. He is credited with bringing the very genre of opera to Poland. Władysław's attention to theater contributed to the spread of this art form in Poland. He was also interested in poetry, as well as in cartography and historical and scientific works; he corresponded with Galileo.|$|E
25|$|He was a keen Contract Bridge player, who {{regularly}} organized bridge tournaments at his residence. He {{was also an}} enthusiastic sportsman and a lifelong member of the Egyptian Shooting Federation, becoming chairman of the Rifle Committee in 1979 and elected, later in life, to its governing board of directors. He had a fondness for the culinary arts and gastronomy, and was <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur</b> of fine tea.|$|E
25|$|In {{due course}} he became <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur</b> {{of wine and}} was often {{accompanied}} by some good claret to help lubricate his voice through a day of cricket commentating. He subsequently wrote a regular wine column for The Guardian newspaper and he also published two books, Burgundy Vines and Wines co-written with Christopher Fielden in 1976, and Arlott on Wine in 1987. Before retiring to Alderney, he auctioned his well-stocked wine cellar containing many fine clarets, at Sotheby's.|$|E

25|$|Bob Jones, Jr. was <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur</b> of European art {{and began}} {{collecting}} after World War II on about $30,000 a year {{authorized by the}} University Board of Directors. Jones first concentrated on the Italian Baroque, a style then out of favor and relatively inexpensive {{in the years immediately}} following the war. Fifty years after the opening of the gallery, the BJU collection included more than 400 European paintings from the 14th to through the 19th centuries (mostly pre-19th century), period furniture, and a notable collection of Russian icons. The museum also includes a variety of Holy Land antiquities collected in the early 20th century by missionaries Frank and Barbara Bowen.|$|E
25|$|Though Fortunato is {{presented}} as <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur</b> of fine wine, L. Moffitt Cecil of Texas Christian University argues that his actions in the story make that assumption questionable. For example, Fortunato comments on another nobleman being unable to distinguish amontillado from sherry when amontillado {{is in fact a}} type of sherry, and treats De Grave, an expensive French wine, with very little regard by drinking it in a single gulp. Cecil also states that a true wine connoisseur would never sample wine while intoxicated and describes Fortunato as merely an alcoholic. Cecil also suggests that some people might feel Fortunato deserved to be buried alive for wasting a bottle of fine wine.|$|E

25|$|John Stuart Mill, the English thinker and politician, began a {{formative}} year visiting France {{at the age}} of 14 with {{a two-week}} stay at Pompignan in June 1820. In long letters to his father (who financed the educational trip), the precocious Mill details his extensive reading in the library of the chateau, including almost one work per day by Voltaire, Lefranc's main enemy, without once referring to the marquis' own works. Even by then something of <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur</b> of gardens, he walked in what he called the 'pleasure grounds' of the chateau almost every day, and sometimes to the plateau above (whose views he was to recall later, in other works), without ever giving any detail on the park itself. Mills was in Pompignan as a guest of Samuel Bentham, who was renting a property in the grounds, giving weight to the belief that the marquis (the second) was impecunious at that point. But we can take it that the garden must have been in good order during Mill's visit, or he would have remarked on it.|$|E
500|$|Tesla was asocial {{and prone}} to seclude himself with his work. However, when he did engage in a social life, many people spoke very {{positively}} and admiringly of Tesla. Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a [...] "distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force." [...] His secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: [...] "his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul." [...] Tesla's friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, [...] "seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer {{who was also a}} poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur</b> of food and drink." ...|$|E
500|$|Starr has {{received}} praise from critics and movie industry professionals regarding his acting; director and producer Walter Shenson called him [...] "a superb actor, an absolute natural". By the mid-1960s, Starr had become <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur</b> of film. In {{addition to his}} roles in A Hard Day's Night (1964), Help! (1965), Magical Mystery Tour (1967) and Let It Be (1970), Starr also acted in Candy (1968), The Magic Christian (1969), Blindman (1971), Son of Dracula (1974) and Caveman (1981). In 1971, he starred as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa's 200 Motels and was featured in Harry Nilsson's animated film The Point!

500|$|In 1632, an {{anonymous}} pamphlet—attributed to the Portuguese Francisco de Braganza—was published {{with the title}} [...] "A copy of the opinions and censorship by the most revered fathers, masters and senior professors of the distinguished universities of Salamanca and Alcalá, and other scholars on the abuse of lascivious and indecent figures and paintings, which are mortal sin to be painted, carved and displayed {{where they can be}} seen". The court was able to exert counter-pressure, and a piece by the famous poet and preacher Fray Hortensio Félix Paravicino, which proposed the destruction of all paintings of the nude, and was written {{to be included in the}} pamphlet, was never published. Paravicino was <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur</b> of painting, and therefore believed in its power: [...] "the finest paintings are the greatest threat: burn the best of them". As his title shows, Braganza merely argued that such works should be kept from the view of a wider public, as was in fact mostly the practice in Spain.|$|E
500|$|On October 16, 1794, after {{receiving}} a silver dollar from David Rittenhouse, Secretary of State Edmund Randolph forwarded the dollar coin to President Washington for his inspection. In an attempt to help circulate the coins, Rittenhouse spent {{many of the new}} coins and traded them for foreign coins to market the new products of the Mint. Others were distributed to VIPs and distinguished visitors to the Mint. After the initial production, Rittenhouse ordered all dollar coin production to end until Mint personnel could build a more powerful press that would be capable of better striking the coins. The Columbian Centinel (Boston, MA) first wrote an article about the new dollar coins on November 26, 1794: Some of the new dollars now coining at the Mint of the United States have found their way to this town. A correspondent put one in into the editor's hands yesterday. Its weight is equal to that of a Spanish dollar, but the metal appears finer... The tout ensemble (entire design) has a pleasing effect to <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur,</b> but the touches of the graver are too delicate, and there is a want of that boldness of execution which is necessary to durability and currency ...|$|E
500|$|The {{last major}} {{building}} work {{took place during}} the reign of King GeorgeV when, in 1913, SirAston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. GeorgeV, who had succeeded EdwardVII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919)– the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. GeorgeV's wife Queen Mary was <b>a</b> <b>connoisseur</b> of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, [...] long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} his most trenchant satires are {{directed}} against George III, who, after examining some of Gillray's sketches, said [...] "I don't understand these caricatures."
