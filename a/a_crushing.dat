5|$|General Douglas MacArthur's Operation Cartwheel {{began with}} {{spectacular}} {{victories in the}} landing at Lae and the landing at Nadzab but then faltered {{in the face of}} inclement weather, unfavourable terrain, and—above all—tenacious and aggressive Japanese opposition on land and in the air. The initiative passed to Major General Hatazō Adachi's Eighteenth Army which launched a series of counter-attacks against Major General George Wootten's 9th Division in the Battle of Finschhafen. At the Battle of Sattelberg, Wootten finally inflicted <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat on Adachi.|$|E
5|$|In 1259, Geoffrey {{participated in}} the princely army that joined the Achaean–Epirote–Sicilian {{alliance}} opposing the Empire of Nicaea. The allied forces, riven by distrust between the Latins and the Epirote Greeks, were dealt <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat in the Battle of Pelagonia. Prince William {{and most of his}} barons, including Geoffrey, were captured {{in the aftermath of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|In Rome, Domitian {{was placed}} {{under house arrest}} by Vitellius, as a {{safeguard}} against Flavian aggression. Support for the old emperor waned as more legions around the empire pledged their allegiance to Vespasian. On 24 October 69, the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian (under Marcus Antonius Primus) met at the Second Battle of Bedriacum, which ended in <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat for the armies of Vitellius.|$|E

5|$|King Henry V of England took {{advantage}} of the internal strife in France, invading the northwest coast, and in 1415 he delivered <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat to the French at Agincourt. Nearly an entire generation of military leaders died or were taken prisoner in a single day. John, still feuding with the royal family and the Armagnacs, remained neutral as Henry V went on to conquer towns in northern France.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{was active}} in provincial Liberal Party {{organizational}} work during {{the latter part of}} the 1920s. In 1925, the party had suffered <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat after 43years in power. On election day, the Liberals were reduced to three seats in the Nova Scotia legislature. Many believed that the time had come to return the party to its reformist roots. Macdonald worked with other reform-minded members to establish a network of younger Liberals intent on reviving their party.|$|E
5|$|The Christian forces {{assembled}} at Sepphoris. Raynald and Gerard of Ridefort convinced Guy of Lusignan to {{take the}} initiative and attack Saladin's army, although RaymondIII of Tripoli had tried to persuade the king to avoid a direct fight with it.

5|$|The {{following}} year the Muslims launched an offensive into the Arabah south of Lake Tiberias, taking Al Karak. Other raids penetrated into the Negev reaching {{as far as}} Gaza. The Battle of Yarmouk in 636 resulted in <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat for the larger Byzantine army; within three years, the Levant had been lost again. By the time of Heraclius's death in Constantinople, on February 11, 641, most of Egypt had fallen as well.|$|E
5|$|The victory proved short-lived, however: {{as early}} in 86 Fuscus {{embarked}} on an ill-fated expedition into Dacia, {{which resulted in the}} complete destruction of the fifth legion, Legio V Alaudae, in the First Battle of Tapae. Fuscus was killed, and the battle standard of the Praetorian Guard was lost. The loss of the battle standard, or aquila, was indicative of <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat and a serious affront to Roman national pride.|$|E
5|$|Wałęsa's {{contention}} for the 2000 {{presidential election}} ended with <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat when he polled 1.01 {{percent of the}} vote. His humiliation was increased because Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who was re-elected {{in the first round}} with 54 percent of the vote, is a former Communist apparatchik. Wałęsa polled in seventh place, after which he announced his withdrawal from Polish politics.|$|E

5|$|According to Pat Southern, principes {{appear to}} have been born from {{remnants}} of the old second class of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus. The second class stood in some of the first few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to principes. They would support the heavier first class in the front ranks. It is probable that engagements with the Samnites and <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat {{at the hands of the}} Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy.|$|E
5|$|As Austria {{was short}} of {{experienced}} military commanders, Maria Theresa released Marshall Neipperg, {{who had been}} imprisoned by her father for his poor performance in the Turkish War. Neipperg took command of the Austrian troops in March. The Austrians suffered <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat at the Battle of Mollwitz in April 1741. France drew up a plan to partition Austria between Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Spain. Marshall Belle-Isle joined Frederick at Olmütz. Vienna was in a panic, as none of Maria Theresa's advisors expected France to betray them. Francis Stephen urged Maria Theresa to reach a rapprochement with Prussia, as did Great Britain. Maria Theresa reluctantly agreed to negotiations.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years he would serve on the always-virulent {{south-eastern}} border, where he made his home in the city of Illńce. In 1644 under Koniecpolski he took part in the battle of Ochmatów where Commonwealth forces dealt <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat to Toğay bey's (Tuhaj Bej) Tatars. He served as one of seven pułkowniks in Koniecpolski's army, and once again his cavalry unit charge proved to be a decisive moment of the battle, bringing him much fame. That year he also became a regimentarz in his own light cavalry unit, but he still held the rank of a porucznik of hussars.|$|E

5|$|France hosted England at Colombes on 1 January 1908 for {{the third}} rugby {{encounter}} between the two nations. Although France lost the game 0–19, the press did not consider it <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat, given that on the previous occasions England had scored 35 points and then 41. During the first half, two French players departed the field injured, {{so that by the}} second half, England had the advantage in numbers and were able to control the game, which at the start had appeared (to the French press) to be well-balanced. The forwards were considered to be at least equal to, if not better, than the English. Guillemin and Duval amongst the forwards, as well as the backs Hubert and Moure, drew praise from Reichel.|$|E
5|$|Limestone traffic {{continued}} on the Tiverton section. Only two boats were working the canal by 1904, {{and the last}} commercial traffic was roadstone from Whipcott quarry to Tiverton, where there was <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> plant. Around 7,000tons per year were transported up to 1925. After this the only income was from the washing of sheep, for which a charge was made for every 20 sheep, and the sale of water lilies which grew in the canal. In the 1930s, dams were built {{at both ends of}} a section near Halberton, where persistent leakage could not be cured.|$|E
5|$|Nine years later, he {{defeated}} {{and killed}} Edwin's eventual successor, Oswald, at the Battle of Maserfield; {{from this point}} he {{was probably the most}} powerful of the Anglo-Saxon rulers of the time, laying the foundations for the Mercian supremacy over the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. He repeatedly defeated the East Angles and drove Cenwalh the king of Wessex into exile for three years. He continued to wage war against the Bernicians of Northumbria. Thirteen years after Maserfield, he suffered <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat by Oswald's successor and brother Oswiu, and was killed at the Battle of the Winwaed {{in the course of a}} final campaign against the Bernicians.|$|E

40|$|Bilateral {{asymmetry}} of the paired claws of {{the lobster}} Homarus americanus is determined {{during the fourth}} and fifth juvenile stages by differential reflex activity; the side with the greater activity becomes the crusher while the contralateral side becomes the cutter. Juvenile lobsters reared during this critical period with a substratum that could not be grasped or with reduced input from predominantly internal mechanoreceptors (proprioceptors) (achieved by cutting the dactyl and its chordotonal organ or by tenotomizing the claw opener or closer muscles) failed to develop <b>a</b> <b>crusher</b> claw and hence remained bilaterally symmetrical: they developed paired cutter claws. Therefore, the proprioceptive component of the reflex activity is implicated in bringing about the initial lateralization of the claw ganglion into <b>a</b> <b>crusher</b> and <b>a</b> cutter side. Moreover, lobsters with a single claw reared without a substratum developed <b>a</b> <b>crusher</b> on the intact side only if the intact claw was exercised. In the unexercised condition, differences in reflex activity between the side with a claw and the side without one were insufficient for the development of <b>a</b> <b>crusher</b> claw on the intact side. A minimal amount of reflex activity is necessary for the development of <b>a</b> <b>crusher.</b> Lobsters reared with this minimal amount of activity in both claws developed asymmetrical claws rather than paired crusher claws. This means that initial lateralization of the claw ganglion into <b>a</b> <b>crusher</b> side, on <b>a</b> random basis, inhibited the opposite side from also becoming <b>a</b> <b>crusher.</b> This would explain why we failed to produce lobsters with paired crusher claws and why they were seldom found in the wild...|$|R
