5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be <b>a</b> <b>subversive</b> document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control <b>a</b> <b>subversive</b> document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} contents of the document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives <b>a</b> <b>subversive</b> document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his newfound}} fame and his outspoken views on U.S. imperialism Garcia Márquez was labeled as <b>a</b> <b>subversive</b> {{and for many}} years was denied visas by U.S. {{immigration}} authorities. After Bill Clinton was elected U.S. president, he lifted the travel ban and cited One Hundred Years of Solitude as his favorite novel.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, audiences {{had a very}} {{different}} take on his work. Many perceived it as <b>a</b> <b>subversive</b> and Marxist satire on American capitalism. If not subversive, {{it was at least}} considered a Marxist critique of pop culture. Given Warhol's apolitical outlook in general this is not likely the intended message. It is likely that his pop art was nothing more than an attempt to attract attention to his work.|$|E
50|$|In 1945 the Village Institutes {{began to}} be {{subjected}} to violent attacks by the conservative wing of the RPP and the newly founded DP. The Village Institutes were accused of fostering <b>an</b> <b>subversive,</b> unruly, anti-traditional generation and being the hotbeds of Marxist indoctrination. These attacks were waged mainly by the great landowners in and outside of the Parliament and their mouthpieces in the press.|$|R

5|$|The abrupt {{abolition}} of slavery which Rio Branco had warned against eventually occurred eight years later. This {{resulted in the}} alienation of the second Viscount of Uruguai's ultraconservative faction and powerful political interests.

5|$|After {{becoming}} a cause célèbre {{from the late}} 1960s to the 1980s, the mythical Priory of Sion was exposed as a ludibrium created by Plantard {{as a framework for}} his claim of being the Great Monarch prophesied by Nostradamus. Evidence presented in support of its historical existence and activities before 1956 was discovered to have been forged and then planted in various locations around France by Plantard and his accomplices. Nevertheless, many conspiracy theorists still persist in believing that the Priory of Sion is an age-old cabal that conceals <b>a</b> <b>subversive</b> secret.|$|E
5|$|As he {{continues}} his investigations, Craven is visited by Emma's ghost. The fingerprints on the getaway car used by Emma's killer match that of Lowe, a man Craven arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes Craven {{to meet his}} colleague, Harcourt (Ian McNeice), who informs him that Emma {{was a member of}} <b>a</b> <b>subversive</b> anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by Emma, had broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (Joe Don Baker), an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radioactive material, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with a wry sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium.|$|E

5|$|During the interwar {{period of}} the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist {{historian}} Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed that it was <b>a</b> <b>subversive</b> secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States—which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism—became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such {{as members of the}} John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nasuada {{chooses to}} move the Varden from Tronjheim to Surda to mount {{an attack on the}} Empire. The Varden, who are {{effectively}} refugees, suffer financial troubles, until Nasuada learns that she can create an expensive lace with magic, and sell it at extremely low rates. One night when Nasuada is in her room, a character named Elva saves her from an assassination attempt. Elva is enchanted, and locates the assailant, who is killed after unwillingly surrendering information to Varden magicians about <b>a</b> <b>subversive</b> group based in Surda called the Black Hand, who is plotting to kill Nasuada. Nasuada later attends a meeting with key figures in Surda's government to discuss a potential upcoming battle against the Empire. They learn that the conflict is coming sooner than they initially suspected, and mobilize forces to attack, as well as sending for help from the dwarves.|$|E

25|$|Scouting has {{sometimes}} become entangled in social controversies {{such as the}} civil rights struggle in the American South and in nationalist resistance movements in India. Scouting was introduced to Africa by British officials as an instrument of colonial authority but became <b>a</b> <b>subversive</b> challenge to the legitimacy of British imperialism as Scouting fostered solidarity amongst African Scouts. There are also controversies and challenges within the Scout Movement itself such as current efforts to turn Scouts Canada into a democratic organization (see also Non-aligned Scouting and Scout-like organisations).|$|E
25|$|The {{court upheld}} much {{legislation}} under the defence power, interpreting it broadly wherever {{there was a}} connection to defence purposes, in cases such as Andrews v Howell (1941) and de Mestre v Chisholm (1944).

The court also allowed the federal government to institute a national income tax scheme in the First Uniform Tax case (1942), and upheld legislation allowing the proclamation of the pacifist Jehovah's Witnesses religion as <b>a</b> <b>subversive</b> organisation, in the Jehovah's Witnesses case (1943).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} entrepreneurship as <b>a</b> {{process of}} <b>subversive</b> organising, <b>a</b> journey towards becoming Other. Examining {{the field of}} stand-up comedy in Finland, we argue that the desire to become an entrepreneur {{is not only an}} individual quest, but also <b>a</b> social, <b>subversive</b> desire to resist fixed, institutionally bounded professional identities. Subversive desire, performed through de/professionalisation and de/institutionalisation, constitutes entrepreneuring as a social practice of creation: a nonlinear quest towards difference, discontinuity and intuitive futures yet to come. Subversive practice, in this respect, promotes and sustains, rather than resolves, the inherent tensions of entrepreneuring...|$|R
