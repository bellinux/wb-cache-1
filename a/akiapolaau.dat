5000|$|The <b>akiapōlāau</b> (Hemignathus wilsoni), {{pronounced}} ah-kee-ah-POH-LAH-OW, is {{a species}} of Hawaiian honeycreeper, that is endemic to the island of Hawaii. Its natural habitats are dry and montane moist forests, and the only bird species on the island to occupy the woodpecker niche. [...] The bird is 5.5 in in length, and has an unusually curved beak-(a specialist species). The <b>akiapolaau</b> is a pudgy bird which has a whitish bottom and tail, black legs, yellow chest, orangish head, black face mask and bill and gray black wings. The male's song is either a loud, short pit-er-ieu or a rapid warba-warba. [...] Its various calls include an upslurred whistle, a short cheedle-ee warble, and a short sweet.|$|E
50|$|The <b>akiapōlāau</b> occurs {{mainly in}} old-growth mesic and wet forests in Kaū and Hamakua. Koa (Acacia koa) and ōhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) are {{dominant}} canopy species in its habitat. Disease-carrying mosquitoes have restricted it to elevations of between 1300 and 2100 m. It formerly inhabited māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) -naio (Myoporum sandwicense) dry forests at elevations of 1900 to 2900 m on Mauna Kea, but this population was extirpated in 2002.|$|E
5000|$|The Hawaii creeper {{was put on}} the {{endangered}} species list in 1975; however, it was unknown whether the bird was uncommon or endangered http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=8914. Although this species has been put into full view of habitat degradation, it has been able to reproduce, so this not thought to be a serious problem to this species. It has also been found in lower elevations in areas like the common amakihi and apparently handles the diseases better than other species just like it. Introductions of alien animals however have caused this bird to be put under pressure. This pressure includes the bird having competition for food. The other pressure is the fact that these birds are being eaten by rats which cause the populations to drop very quickly. The nests of the Hawaii creepers are low to the forest floor which leave the bird to vulnerable to predators such as rats http://www.state.hi.us/dlnr/dofaw/cwcs/files/NAAT%20final%20CWCS/Chapters/Terrestrial%20Fact%20Sheets/Forest%20Birds/hawaii%20creeper%20NAAT%20final%20%21.pdf The species is eaten as eggs, chicks, and even as full-fledged adults. Now its northern population is being protected in the same area as is the <b>akiapolaau</b> and other native birds: Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. It is threatened by disease and habitat loss. Also, the Hawaii creeper has probably benefited from the conservation of other endangered birds in Hawaii http://www.state.hi.us/dlnr/dofaw/cwcs/files/NAAT%20final%20CWCS/Chapters/Terrestrial%20Fact%20Sheets/Forest%20Birds/hawaii%20creeper%20NAAT%20final%20%21.pdf ...|$|E

We dispute {{the validity of}} Bryan 2 ̆ 7 s (1905 a) description of three eggs and two nests of the <b>Akiapolaau.</b> Eggs that he attributed to this species were much smaller than ours, and his nest descriptions did not match the only nest apparently belonging to the <b>Akiapolaau</b> in the B. P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu, where Bryan worked. Twigs and bark were distinctively combined in the nest that we examined.

The Kilauea Forest Reserve is notable for the island of Hawaii because it provides habitat for at least nine species of endemic birds, of which six species are members of the Hawaiian Honeycreeper family (Drepanididae) : Amakihi, Akepa, Creeper, <b>Akiapolaau,</b> Apapane, and Iiwi. The other endemic species are the Hawaiian Hawk, the Elepaio, and the Hawaiian Thrush. The thrush is abundant throughout the forest, and is common even in areas that have been disturbed by cattle and by logging operations. Two species of introduced birds occur in relatively large numbers: Japanese White-eye and Red-billed Leiothrix. Other species of introduced birds are found in the pasture land adjacent to the forest but have not been seen within the forest itself. The foraging behavior of endemic and introduced species is discussed. No data are available to suggest that introduced species compete with endemic birds for food or for nesting sites. Nesting data are presented. An apparently unusual feature about the Apapane is that this species not uncommonly builds its nest on the tops of tree fern fronds, rather than in ohia trees, which is the typical site for nests of this species in ohia-tree fern forests. The adaptability of three endemic species (Elepaio, Amakihi, <b>Akiapolaau)</b> and two introduced species (Japanese White-eye, Red-billed Leiothrix) to wide vegetational and climatic conditions is discussed...|$|E

The dominant and subdominant plants are listed for 10 major vegetational and climatic areas within Volcanoes National Park. These areas are located at elevations between 1, 400 and 10, 000 feet. Information on the birds found in eight of the 10 areas during the late 1940 s is available in the paper by Baldwin (1953); two of Baldwin's study plots are not included in the IBP transects, but data on the birds in these plots from 1970 - 1972 are included in this report. Notable differences between bird populations in the 1940 s and the early 1970 s are: 1. The apparent disappearance from the Park of two species of rare and endangered honeycreepers: <b>Akiapolaau</b> and Ou; 2. An apparent disappearance of the Apapane from certain low-elevation habitats; 3. A decrease in the range, and probably in population density, of the Elepaio; 4. The disappearance of the Hawaiian Thrush from at least two plots at low elevations; 5. A reversal in density of the Red-billed Leiothrix and the Japanese White-eye. The White-eye was first recorded in certain regions of the Park between 1940 and 1944. It now is found at nearly all levels and in all habitats within the Park from sea level to above tree line, and it is now the most common exotic species in the Park. The Red-billed Leiothrix is now common in suitable habitat, but population density probably is lower than during the 1940 s. 6. The Hawaiian Goose now occurs regularly within Park boundaries, especially during the breeding season; the species was close to extinction during the 1940 s and was not seen by Baldwin. The discovery that the Apapane sometimes build nests in collapsed lava tubes is discussed. That this type of nesting behavior is not rare is suggested because it was found on Mt. Hualalai and at three widely separated sites on Mauna Loa. At least three species of Plasmodium, the protozoan parasite that causes bird malaria, have been identified in the blood of one endemic (Apapane) and two introduced (Leiothrix and White-eye) species of birds in Volcanoes National Park. Studies on the mosquito vector for Plasmodium are needed. Baldwin's (1953) thorough study of the insect food of the Amakihi, Apapane, and Iiwi is summarized, as is his discussion of the phenology of the tree species whose flowers provide nectar for the honeycreepers. The need for contemporary observations on the relationship of the Iiwi to lobeliad flowers is noted...|$|E

An intensive 19 month phonological was carried out on the southwestern slope of Mauna Kea, Hawaii, from March 1973 through October 1974. This study {{was part of a larger}} six year project on the breeding ecology of two native birds in the region, and is only a preliminary report. Study areas were established at approximately 6, 500, 7, 000, and 7, 500 feet elevation; five 100 x 100 feet (30. 5 m x 30. 5 m) phenology plots were measured within each study area and all the trees were tagged and measured. Percentage of canopy cover, flowering, and fruit production were measured monthly; index values were established for each phenophase so that they could be expressed graphically as well as analyzed statistically. The forest on this slope of Mauna Kea is composed almost entirely of mamane (Sophora chrysophylla) and naio (Myoporum sandwicense). Each of the three elevations studied has a significantly different composition of tree species; the birds present at each elevation appear to reflect the composition of the forest. The Palila (Psittirostra bailleui) and <b>Akiapolaau</b> (Hemignathus wilsoni) seem to be confined to the higher elevations where mamane is dominant (7, 400 to 8, 400 feet). Tree height and circumference at breast height (CBH) increase with elevation, although not significantly. Tree density in phenology plots decreases with higher elevation. Decreased density and the location of seedlings only in open areas suggest that water may be a limiting factor. Reproduction of mamane is severely curtailed in areas of high sheep-grazing pressure, but shows good regeneration in enclosed areas. Phenological data from Mauna Kea are similar to those from Mauna Loa. There appears to be seasonality in flowering, fruiting, and leaf fall in both mamane and naio, but seasonality is more difficult to interpret in the latter. Phenophases start gradually and are protracted; flushing and flowering show an inverse relationship. Precipitation peaks coincide with flowering peaks and may trigger this phenophase. Heavy rain may cause a decrease in flowering and an almost total loss of the pod crop in mamane. Behavioral patterns of both the Amakihi (Loxops v. virens) and Palila seem to be influenced by phenological patterns on Mauna Kea. The extended bloom period of mamane correlates with the protracted nesting season of the Amakihi. Canopy cover is at its maximum density when nesting starts, and remains fairly dense throughout the breeding cycle of the Amakihi. Surplus Amakihi leave an area when mamane bloom ceases, leaving only a few permanent residents; naio blossom visitation increases at this time. Palila nest throughout the period of peak pod production. When mamane pods are present the Palila was found to utilize mamane flowers young leaves, and naio berries. Phenological aspects of mamane appear to be much more important to the birds on Mauna Kea than those of naio. It would appear that naio serves only as a supplemental food source; naio berries are taken by Palila, House Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus frontalis), and Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) in dry periods.
