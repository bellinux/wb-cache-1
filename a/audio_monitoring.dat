50|$|A {{video monitor}} also called a {{broadcast}} monitor, broadcast video monitor, broadcast reference monitor or just reference monitor, is a display device {{similar to a}} television set, used to monitor the output of a video-generating device, such as playout from a video server, IRD, video camera, VCR, or DVD player. It {{may or may not}} have professional <b>audio</b> <b>monitoring</b> capability. Unlike a television set, a video monitor has no tuner (television) and, as such, is unable independently to tune into an over-the-air broadcast like a television receiver. One common use of video monitors is in television stations, television studios, production trucks and in outside broadcast vehicles, where broadcast engineers use them for confidence checking of analog signal and digital signals throughout the system.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how <b>audio</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems {{should be}} designed, {{in the context}} of smart cities and in {{accordance}} with Swedish legislation. <b>Audio</b> <b>monitoring</b> for smart cities is promising and have previously shown great potential. However its opportunities are still relatively unexplored. ShotSpotter is one of several examples of <b>audio</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{in the context of}} smart cities. In the US only, the system has successfully been used to alert and locate shootings in over 90 cities. However, the technology is surrounded by controversies and there has been debate whether <b>audio</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems are compatible with law. Compatibility is critical since incompatibility could result in severe sanctions. Research related to this paper has been conducted according to the Design Science research strategy. The research resulted in design guidelines for <b>audio</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems, for law enforcement purposes, in accordance with Swedish law. The design guidelines are based upon existing <b>audio</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems, previous research and empirical data. The empirical data consists of 12 interviews with experts in law, phonetics and digital forensics. Additionally, the design guidelines have been evaluated by an expert in a criteria-based evaluation interview. Results of the research shows that it is, in fact, possible to design <b>audio</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems, in the context of smart cities, in accordance with Swedish legislation. The design guidelines can be applied in the development of <b>audio</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems with law enforcement purposes. With some modification, they can also be used for <b>audio</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems with other purposes.  Uppsatsen syftar till att undersöka hur ljudövervakningssystem inom ramen för smarta städer- konceptet bör utformas i enlighet med svensk lagstiftning.

50|$|A baby monitor, {{also known}} as a baby alarm, is a radio system used to {{remotely}} listen to sounds made by an infant. An <b>audio</b> <b>monitor</b> consists of a transmitter unit, equipped with a microphone, placed near to the child. It transmits the sounds by radio waves to a receiver unit with a speaker carried by, or near to, the person caring for the infant. Some baby monitors provide two-way communication which allows the parent to speak back to the baby (parent talk-back). Some allow music to be played to the child. A monitor with a video camera and receiver is often called a baby cam.|$|R
