500|$|In 2014, Gibbs {{discussed}} his preference for local politics: “At the state level, it’s {{much more about}} whether you are <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> a Democrat and winning and losing, rather than making decisions that are good for Colorado. The more dysfunctional things get at {{the federal and state}} levels, the more people seem to come together at the local level to accomplish goals that are important to communities.” ...|$|E
500|$|Cleveland {{sent the}} issue to the Congress, stating, [...] "The Provisional Government has not assumed <b>a</b> <b>republican,</b> <b>or</b> other {{constitutional}} form, but has remained a mere executive council, or oligarchy, {{without the consent of}} the people". The queen changed her position on the issue of amnesty, and on December 18, Willis demanded the provisional government reinstate her to the throne, but was refused. Congress responded with a US Senate investigation that resulted in the Morgan Report on February 26, 1894. It found Stevens and all parties except the queen [...] "not guilty", absolving them of responsibility for the overthrow. The provisional government formed the Republic of Hawaii on July 4 with Dole as its president, maintaining oligarchical control and a limited system of suffrage.|$|E

500|$|Cooper {{described}} himself as [...] "a truly terrible public speaker" [...] and rarely made addresses from the Senate floor. He was known as an independent Republican during {{his career in the}} Senate. In the first roll-call vote of his career, he opposed transferring investigatory powers to Republican Owen Brewster's special War Investigating Committee. His second vote, directing that proceeds from the sale of war surplus materiel be used to pay off war debts, also went against the majority of the Republican caucus, prompting Ohio Republican Robert A. Taft to ask him [...] "Are you <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> a Democrat? When are you going to start voting with us?" [...] Cooper responded, [...] "If you'll pardon me, I was sent here to represent my constituents, and I intend to vote as I think best." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2008 interview, Downey {{stated that}} {{his time in}} prison changed his {{political}} point of view somewhat, saying, [...] "I have a really interesting political point of view, and it's not always something I say too loud at dinner tables here, but you can't go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal. You can't. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone else, but it was very, very, very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics ever since." [...] However, {{when asked about the}} quote in a 2015 interview to promote Avengers: Age of Ultron, he denied that his previous statement reflected any longstanding beliefs on his part, and stated, [...] "I wouldn't say that I'm <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> a liberal or a Democrat." ...|$|E
500|$|Rumors persisted that Clark {{was forced}} out due to his {{contentious}} relationship with some in Washington, D.C.; however, he has dismissed such rumors, calling it a [...] "routine personnel action". The Department of Defense said it was merely a [...] "general rotation of American senior ranks". However, a NATO ambassador told the International Herald Tribune that Clark's dismissal {{seemed to be a}} [...] "political thing from the United States". General Hugh Shelton would say of Clark during his 2004 campaign that [...] "the reason he came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart. I'm not going to say whether I'm <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> a Democrat. I'll just say Wes won't get my vote." [...] Shelton never elaborated further on what these issues were.|$|E
50|$|The rally was {{organized}} by the Republicans. When it was initially announced, there was an invitation to Democratic speakers. Although the invitation was later withdrawn, this fact was not widely disseminated, resulting in confusion as to whether {{this was to be}} <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> rally, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> debate between <b>Republican</b> and Democratic supporters.|$|R

He later said his wife had [...] "vetoed" [...] this plan. Then Corsi stated: [...] "Howard Phillips of the Constitution Party asked me to {{consider}} seriously running for president in 2008 and I am doing so."

2500|$|In a 1995 interview, Wallace {{said that}} he planned to vote for Republican Bob Dole in the 1996 presidential election, commenting, [...] "He's a good man. His wife is a born-again Christian woman and I believe he is too." [...] He also {{revealed}} that he had voted for George H. W. Bush, another Republican, in 1992. His son, George Wallace Jr., officially switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party that same year. Wallace himself declined to officially identify as either <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> a Democrat. But he added, [...] "The state is slowly going Republican because of Clinton being so liberal." ...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{criteria}} {{considered to be a}} factor in selecting a vice-presidential candidate was the ability to deliver <b>a</b> traditionally <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> swing state in the November election. Every successful Democratic presidential campaign since 1960 had included a politician from a swing state (usually in the South) who helped deliver one or more states for the Democrats.|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "Use It or Lose It" [...] {{campaign}} {{called on}} bloggers and Democratic activists to pressure Democrats in safe seats {{to ask them}} to give at least 30 percent of their campaign accounts to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee or directly to Democrats in competitive congressional races (subject to FEC limits). [...] "Safe" [...] Democrats was defined as those who were either running unopposed by <b>a</b> <b>Republican,</b> <b>or</b> whose Republican opponent raised less than $10,000 (and thus were not considered serious opponents). The lists of such Democrats were pulled from FEC filings. The campaign drew media attention and also brought MoveOn on board with their own page promoting the campaign.|$|E

On Burgess's death in 1932, Briggs was nominated by US President Herbert C. Hoover to Burgess {{as director of the}} National Bureau of Standards. However, none of Hoover's nominations were acted on by the US Congress before he left office. After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as president in 1933 he was pressed to name [...] "a good Democrat" [...] as director of the National Bureau of Standards.

2500|$|In January 2010, Congressman Peter T. King {{said he was}} reconsidering {{running for}} the seat. [...] Real estate magnate and {{publisher}} Mort Zuckerman was seriously considering a bid by February 2010. [...] Nominally a Democrat, Zuckerman {{was more likely to}} run as <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> independent in order to avoid an expensive primary fight. [...] But in early March, he indicated he would not run, saying he had not the time to do it. [...] In April 2010, despite a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute result placing him five points ahead of Gillibrand in a potential matchup, Pataki removed himself from consideration.

50|$|Like Gross, Siler was <b>a</b> Taft <b>Republican</b> (<b>or</b> Old Right <b>Republican)</b> who {{was opposed}} to {{entangling}} military alliances and foreign interventions.

[...] He told the CPAC audience that he arrived in Washington as [...] "a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution", and addressed the issue of illegal immigration - one of the major issues where conservatives have attacked McCain. He said that [...] "it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first", before addressing other immigration laws. [...] Mike Huckabee spoke to CPAC two days later and said, [...] "I know that there was some speculation that I might come here today to announce that I would be getting out of the race. But I {{want to make sure you}} understand. Am I quitting? Well, let's get that settled right now. No, I'm not. And the reason is simple—I never learned arithmetic. You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am today and I didn't fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I did it by staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe that some things were right, some things were wrong, and it's better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and to be a part of the crowd." ...|$|E

6000|$|While the New Republican brings such expedients as this to bear upon {{property}} from above, {{there will also}} be the expedients of the Minimum Wage and the Minimum Standard of Life, already discussed in the third of these papers, controlling it from below. Limited in this way, property will resemble a river that once swamped a whole country-side, but has now been banked within its channel. Even when these expedients have been exhaustively worked out, they will fall far short of that [...] "abolition of property" [...] which is the crude expression of Socialism. There is a certain measure of property in a state which involves the maximum of individual freedom. Either above or below that Optimum one passes towards slavery. The New Republican is a New Republican, and he tests all things by their effect upon the evolution of man; he is a Socialist or an Individualist, a Free Trader or a Protectionist, <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> a Democrat just so far, and only so far, as these various principles of public policy subserve his greater end.|$|E
50|$|The phrase {{originated}} in the American Solid South when and where the Republican Party was so weak or nonexistent that the general elections were mere formalities, the election having effectively been decided within the Democratic Party. For example, the state of Alabama, which was heavily Democratic, did not have <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> governor <b>or</b> lieutenant governor between 1874 and 1987. Another example is Vermont, where no Democrat served as governor between 1854 and 1963.|$|R

60|$|This {{became very}} {{apparent}} on his favoring me {{so far as}} to read a few specimens of Don Juan in the moralized version. Whatever is licentious, whatever disrespectful to the sacred mysteries of our faith, whatever morbidly melancholic or splenetically sportive, whatever assails settled constitutions of government or systems of society, whatever could wound the sensibility of any mortal, except a pagan, <b>a</b> <b>republican,</b> <b>or</b> a dissenter, has been unrelentingly blotted out, and its place supplied by unexceptionable verses in his lordship's later style. You may judge how much of the poem remains as hitherto published. The result is not so good as might be wished; in plain terms, it is a very sad affair indeed; for, though the torches kindled in Tophet have been extinguished, they leave an abominably ill odor, and are succeeded by no glimpses of hallowed fire. It is to be hoped, nevertheless, that this attempt on Lord Byron's part to atone for his youthful errors will at length induce the Dean of Westminster, or whatever churchman is concerned, to allow Thorwaldsen's statue of the poet its due niche in the grand old Abbey. His bones, you know, when brought from Greece, were denied sepulture among those of his tuneful brethren there.|$|E
6000|$|My mother's {{family was}} Scottish, {{and it was}} judged fitting I should pay a visit, on my way Paris-ward, to my uncle Adam Loudon, a wealthy retired grocer of Edinburgh. He was very stiff and very ironical; he fed me well, lodged me sumptuously, and seemed {{to take it out}} of me all the time, cent. per cent., in secret {{entertainment}} which caused his spectacles to glitter and his mouth to twitch. The ground of this ill-suppressed mirth (as well as I could make out) was simply the fact that I was an American. [...] "Well," [...] he would say, drawing out the word to infinity, [...] "and I suppose now in your country things will be so-and-so." [...] And the whole group of my cousins would titter joyously. Repeated receptions of this sort must be at the root, I suppose, of what they call the Great American Jest; and I know I was myself goaded into saying that my friends went naked in the summer months, and that the Second Methodist Episcopal Church in Muskegon was decorated with scalps. I cannot say that these flights had any great success; they seemed to awaken little more surprise than the fact that my father was <b>a</b> <b>Republican,</b> <b>or</b> that I had been taught in school to spell colour without the u.
