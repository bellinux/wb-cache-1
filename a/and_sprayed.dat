5|$|In February 2014, a {{statement}} was made anonymously {{on behalf of}} some Pussy Riot members that both Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova were no longer members. However, both were among the group that performed as Pussy Riot during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, where group members were attacked with whips and pepper spray by Cossacks who were employed as security guards. On 6 March 2014, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were assaulted <b>and</b> <b>sprayed</b> with green paint by local youths in Nizhny Novgorod.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 1999, the {{spotlights}} {{surrounding the}} Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure. Several residents called police <b>and</b> <b>sprayed</b> the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit the candle from top to bottom and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the splash <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> problem. The paper also gives solutions to this problem, from the traffic safety point of view. The problem often arises in critical circumstances such as rain, wet road, wind, and overtaking. The splash <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> is {{mainly caused by}} lorries, especially during high-speed driving. The splash <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> can hinder the other road users, especially by a reduced sight. Accidents caused by splash <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> are not classified as such in Dutch statistics. Possible solutions to the splash <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> problem are as follows: (i) the road surface drainage; (ii) speed limits for heavy vehicles; (iii) the air flow improvement around lorries; and (iv) the use of shields on the lorry wheels...|$|R

5|$|PLO {{cross-border}} raids against Israel grew {{during the}} late 1970s. One of the most severe—known as the Coastal Road massacre—occurred on 11 March 1978. A force of nearly a dozen Fatah fighters landed their boats near a major coastal road connecting the city of Haifa with Tel Aviv-Yafo. There they hijacked a bus <b>and</b> <b>sprayed</b> gunfire inside and at passing vehicles, killing thirty-seven civilians. In response, the IDF launched Operation Litani three days later, {{with the goal of}} taking control of Southern Lebanon up to the Litani River. The IDF achieved this goal, and Arafat withdrew PLO forces north into Beirut.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water <b>and</b> <b>sprayed</b> onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
5|$|Kroonlands lifeboat, {{manned by}} a fresh crew, headed {{back out and}} {{returned}} with 13 steerage passengers. On board Volturno, the crew {{and some of the}} male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her boilers—rocked Volturno, and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett turned on her pumps <b>and</b> <b>sprayed</b> lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.|$|E

40|$|Pesticides are {{commonly}} applied by using hydraulic nozzles to generate droplets. The properties of these spray droplets {{can influence the}} effectiveness and risks {{associated with the use}} of pesticides. Initial spray characteristics (initial droplet size and velocity, fan angle <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> liquid density) were therefore measured for a range of hydraulic nozzles <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> mixtures. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure the spray sheet velocity. There was a significant difference between a standard hydraulic nozzle, Turbo TeeJet® and air induction nozzle for all measured spray characteristics. The standard hydraulic nozzle generated the smallest droplet sizes, the highest velocity <b>and</b> the highest <b>spray</b> liquid density. The air induction nozzle generated the largest droplet size, the slowest velocity <b>and</b> the lowest <b>spray</b> liquid density. The type of air induction nozzle <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> formulation was also found to influence spray characteristics. This work has demonstrated that initial spray characteristics such as droplet size and velocity, liquid density, fan angle and included air can vary depending on nozzle design, operating parameters <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> formulations. Initial droplet velocity was found to be significantly correlated to droplet size (Dv 0. 5) <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> pressure...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} work {{to investigate the}} swirl spray characteristics that emanates from hollow-cone <b>and</b> solid-cone <b>spray</b> simplex atomizers is presented. Main objective of the research is to investigate the spray characteristics, i. e. spray breakup length, discharge coefficient <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> cone angle at different nozzle orifice diameter and injection pressure. Discharge coefficient is almost uninfluenced by the operating Reynolds number. This test also reveals that both breakup length <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> cone angle increases as orifice diameter is increased. Higher injection pressure leads to shorter breakup length <b>and</b> wider <b>spray</b> cone angle...|$|R
5|$|The series {{then moved}} on to Britain, where Roberts would be {{involved}} in one of the closest races in Grand Prix history. Roberts' battle with Sheene at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone has been cited {{as one of the greatest}} races of the 1970s. Minutes before the start of the race, Roberts' Yamaha blew a seal <b>and</b> <b>sprayed</b> the bike with oil. His crew managed to replace the seal in time, but Roberts went to the starting line with his gloves coated with oil, causing his hand to slip on the throttle during the race. The race began with Roberts, Sheene and Dutch rider Wil Hartog breaking away from the rest of the field of riders. Hartog eventually fell behind as Roberts and Sheene continued to battle for the lead. The event featured numerous lead changes throughout the 28 lap race, with Roberts winning ahead of Sheene by a narrow margin of just three-tenths of a second. A third-place finish in the season-ending French Grand Prix, along with a crash by his main championship rival Ferrari, secured his second consecutive world championship.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{artillery}} fire continued to rain {{down on the}} camp, wounding several men and sending the defenders into disarray. Sergeant-Major Williams rushed to the headquarters to order the artillery officer to bombard the taken positions before attempting to organise a counterattack himself. Whilst under heavy Indonesian fire, Williams gathered a section of defenders who had taken refuge in a slit trench and led them towards the captured outer positions. A shell landed among the group and wounded half of them, but Williams and the remainder engaged at least thirty Indonesian infantry who had been firing into the base from the trench in vicious hand-to-hand combat and managed to push them from it with minor casualties. Williams them looked to secure the perimeter, but seeing that the Indonesians were massing for a second attack, {{he sat down in}} a vacated machine gun nest <b>and</b> <b>sprayed</b> the new wave of attackers, who attempted to seize the command bunker, with fire. This was not without cost, and Williams was fortunate to have escaped with a single head wound, which nevertheless blinded him in one eye, though he did not notice this in the heat of battle. Williams then began to receive supporting rifle fire from other British troops in nearby trenches, as well bombardment from the single remaining mortar and some 105mm artillery emplacements from a nearby camp.|$|E

40|$|This review {{attempts}} {{to summarize the}} physical models and advanced methods used in computational studies of gas-liquid two-phase jet flows encountered in atomization <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> processes. In traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach, physical modelling of atomization <b>and</b> <b>sprays</b> {{is an essential part}} of the two-phase flow Computation. In more advanced CFD such as direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES), physical modelling of atomization <b>and</b> <b>sprays</b> is still inevitable. For multiphase flows, there is no model-free DNS since the interactions between different phases need to be modelled. DNS of multiphase flows based on the one-fluid formalism coupled with interface tracking algorithms seems to be a promising way forward, due to the advantageous lower costs compared with a multi-fluid approach. In LES of gas-liquid two-phase jet flows, subgrid-scale (SGS) models for complex multiphase flows are very immature. There is a lack of well-established SGS models to account for the interactions between the different phases. In this paper, physical modelling of atomization <b>and</b> <b>sprays</b> in the context of CFD is reviewed with modelling assumptions and limitations discussed. In addition, numerical methods used in advanced CFD of atomization <b>and</b> <b>sprays</b> are discussed, including high-order numerical schemes. Other relevant issues of modelling and simulation of atomization <b>and</b> <b>sprays</b> such as nozzle internal flow, dense <b>spray,</b> <b>and</b> multiscale modelling are also briefly reviewed.

40|$|Various {{concentrations}} of Alar (Daminozide), Chlormequat (Cycocel) and Paclobutrazol (Cultar) as <b>spray,</b> drench <b>and</b> {{combination of both}} drench <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> applications were tried on two cultivars of pot grown alstroemeria to study their effect on plant height, spread, and other flowering parameters in a factorial completely randomised block design under glasshouse conditions at Mashobra which were evaluated during two successive flushes in the year 2003 - 2005. Both the cultivars viz Selection No- 14 and Riana responded favourably to retardant treatments. A height reduction of 31. 5 per cent in the first flush was recorded with Alar (1500 ppm) spray whereas a combination drench <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> application of Alar (1500 ppm) resulted in 28 per cent height reduction in the second flush. Cultivar Riana in the second flush resulted in maximum height reduction and also produced maximum spread. Cultivar Selection No- 14 took minimum days to bud formation, produced greater number of cymes per inflorescence in second flush and responded with a better pot presentability than cv Riana which remained in flowering for maximum duration in both the flushes. Significant reduction in days to bud formation was recorded with PP 333 (50 ppm) drench <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> in the first flush. A marked positive effect of PP 333 (50 ppm) drench <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> along with Alar (1500 ppm) drench <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> was observed on number of cymes per inflorescence in the first flush whereas in the second flush, Cycocel (1500 ppm) drench <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> resulted in maximum number of cymes per inflorescence. All the treatments significantly increased duration of flowering and pot presentability in both flushes, with spray application of Alar (1500 ppm) coupled with drench <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> application of Cycocel (1500 ppm) and PP 333 (50 ppm) producing the best results...|$|R
