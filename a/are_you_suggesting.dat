5000|$|It {{has been}} rumored that Sorge {{provided}} the exact date of [...] "Barbarossa", but historian Gordon Prange in 1984 {{concluded that the}} closest Sorge came was June 20, 1941 and that Sorge himself never claimed to have discovered the correct date (June 22) in advance. [...] The date of June 20 was given to Sorge by Oberstleutnant (lieutenant-colonel) Erwin Scholl, the deputy military attaché at the German embassy. Despite knowing Germany was going to invade the Soviet Union sometime in May or June 1941, Sorge was still shocked on 22 June 1941 when he learned of Operation Barbarossa, going to a bar to get drunk while repeating in English: “Hitler’s a fucking criminal! A murderer. But Stalin will teach the bastard a lesson. You just wait and see!”. The Soviet press reported in 1964 that on June 15, 1941, Sorge had sent a radio dispatch saying that [...] "The war will begin on June 22." [...] Prange, {{who did not have}} access to material released by the Russian authorities in the 1990s, did not accept the veracity of this report. Stalin was quoted as having ridiculed Sorge and his intelligence before [...] "Barbarossa": There's this bastard who's set up factories and brothels in Japan and even deigned to report the date of the German attack as 22 June. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> I should believe him too? ...|$|E

It requires working with multiple solutions and problem generation by thinking across concepts {{and thinking about}} thinking in a more complex way. This article suggests ways that teachers can help students achieve their math potential, including teaching them in more enjoyable ways, and by addressing them through their preferred learning styles. “I try so very hard—why don’t all my students get it? ” “I show many examples in class yet, in general, why aren’t they interested in learning math?” These questions haunt math teachers around the world. “Math is boring. I don’t know {{why we have to}} learn these equations ” are the standard student concerns. Where does the problem lie? Is it the fault of the students or the teachers? I suggest that it is neither. The fault is in the content delivery process. One may ask, “Isn’t delivery of content basically the same for all content areas? Or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> {{thinking is}} different for different types of content? ” Does one think differently when one studies English than when studying science, mathematics, or social sciences? Mathematical thinking, I believe, does differ significantly from thinking in other subjects, in certain, specific ways. This paper discusses some of these differences, and suggests ways to improve both the thinking and the enjoyment of the students while learning about math. I have been teaching mathematics for over 35 years at the secondary, tertiary, and graduate levels. Presented herein are some of the techniques I have used successfully to help my students develop mathematical thinking through experimentation. A few references are provided in the paper to support my ideas on improving students ’ mathematical thinking, and to show how other math teachers, to a great degree, think the same way...|$|E
