The conclusion was reached that the current <b>accommodation</b> <b>capacities</b> are unequally distributed, and, as the importance of accomodation capacities in tourism is specially highlighted, it is clear that the future of mountain tourism depends primarily on the forthcoming steps of the decision makers in the hospitality industry.

At the beginning of 2001 the region of Banat had 28 hotels, the total accommodation of which was 1025 rooms and 2374 beds arranged within basic and complementary <b>accommodation</b> <b>capacities.</b> The average size of these capacities in Banat is 36, 6 rooms and 84, 8 beds per objective, which shows that these objectives are prevailingly small. The average capacity of the basic accommodation unit – a room is 2, 3 beds.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} cultural indicators, {{one of five}} {{groups of}} comparative indicators of sustainable tourism, defined and suggested to the European Commission {{by a team of}} experts. The group of cultural indicators includes indicators such as the ratio of <b>accommodation</b> <b>capacities</b> to the number of population, and tourism intensity and they show the level of preservation of local population identity. The statistical data from the last four census year were used in the analysis of cultural indicators of tourism sustainability in spa settlements in Serbia. The ratio of <b>accommodation</b> <b>capacities</b> to the number of local population can be defined as favourable in most spas (green zone), since there is no intensive tourist construction (apart from illegal construction), while the tourism intensity based on the example of Serbian spa settlements points at very unfavourable situation, since in all four census years the recorded, the results are in the red zone, i. e. on the one hand, there is a relatively low number of local population and on the other hand, there is a high number of overnight stays.

Tourism infrastructure {{is an essential part}} of the tourism supply and must be projected on a thorough analysis of the tourism demand. This paper argues the necessity of initiating measures and activities for enhancing tourism competitiveness in Macedonia. The recommendations stemmed from detailed calculations as a base for analyzing <b>accommodation</b> <b>capacities,</b> measured by the number of hotel beds and hotel rooms in Macedonia for the period 1990 - 2010. In that respect, their optimal number is estimated by employing the standard formulas. The results pointed to a significant over dimension of current hotel accommodation supply in Macedonia.

40|$|For a {{long time}} basic <b>accommodation</b> <b>capacities</b> {{represented}} the dominant type of accommodation in tourist offer, {{while at the same}} time complementary <b>accommodation</b> <b>capacities</b> were neglected. However, recently there has been a growing interest for complementary, substitute types of tourist accommodation, both in the Republic of Croatia and in Dubrovnik, where since 2000 a significant increase of over night stays has been registered, especially in private accommodation. In this paper rooms, apartments, studio apartments and holiday houses owned by physical entities are referred to as private accommodation. Private accommodation enables tourists to engage in everyday life of local residents, learn about history, tradition and culture of a destination. Thus, a tourist may experience and taste the beauties and attractions of a place, truly enjoy autochthonous products and services, as well as obtain genuine knowledge on authentic attractions and tourist offer of a destination. Inadequate offer of private tourist accommodation has negative influence when forming the overall tourist offer of a destination. Poor quality of accommodation units, unprofessional conduct of holders of tourist accommodation offer towards consumers and lack of interest for the needs and wishes of the consumer of this complementary accommodation have all contributed in creating a bad image on this kind of accommodation in tourist offer. Consequently, this paper aims, by analysing the consumers of private tourist accommodation, to point out the importance of private accommodation in overal tourist offer of a destination, to prove that private accommodation tourist offer attracts an increasing number of tourists, and propose to local tourist administration directives on how to create a more efficient procedure in order to ensure a more efficient and better quality administration of tourist private accommodation offer, aiming to improve the overall tourist offer at a destination...|$|R

40|$|By {{including}} e-business, small tourist {{communities were}} allowed, {{apart from their}} classic offers, {{to appear on the}} global market, but that caused the need for automation and coordination of booking capacity tasks. Advertising and booking in these communities are performed by a conventional agency arrangement, the Internet, mobile services or by tourists themselves upon their arrival in the local community where they can reserve the accommodation. The possibility of booking <b>accommodation</b> <b>capacities</b> in many ways creates additional benefits for considerable usage of excess capacity, but as a side effect there is a problem of coordination of communication channels in order to avoid double-booking. On the other hand, the local administration has a problem with the registration and the payment of the tourist tax, particularly if the tourists do not stay long. With the automation and coordination of communication channels, conflicts can be completely avoided, and the reservation system informs all interested parties and reports to the local administration. </p...|$|R
