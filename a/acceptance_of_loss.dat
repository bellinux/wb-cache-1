5000|$|Bereavement and the {{adjective}} bereaved derive from a verb, 'reave', which means “to despoil, rob, or forcibly deprive” per Oxford English Dictionary. Thus, a bereaved person {{is one who}} has been deprived, robbed, plundered, or stripped of someone or something that they valued. Reaction to this state or impact of loss is called grief. According to Lazarus and Folkman (1984), coping strategies are the [...] "constantly changing cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing on or exceeding the resources of the person". People vary in the ways that they grieve and also {{in the way that they}} cope. But, acknowledging it and allowing themselves to go through the motions will allow them to cope in a healthy way. To cope with the loss, the person requires to relearn the world around them and simultaneously make a multifaceted transition from loving in presence to loving in absence (Attig, 2001). A healthy relocation of the deceased internally and maintaining a healthy dynamic connectedness/relationship is observed to provide solace to the grieving, but the wieghtage differed in pluralistic cultural settings. Grievers will go through times of extreme sadness and also times where they are numb to what has happened. Lack of appropriate coping can bring many ailments to a person including mental and physical ailments. Coping through mourning in a state of bereavement is advised in the Bible as “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.” Because it helps to achieve growth through thorough <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss,</b> the transforming capacity of profound human experiences. Freud in 1959 through an article called this as a process of “working through” the grief. Healthy coping is achieved when the bereaved person is enabled to go forward with healthy, productive living by effortfully developing “new normals” to guide that living which is characterized by lesser stressful demands compared to initial phase of grief.|$|E

40|$|Moroccan {{literature}} of the Years of Lead {{is a very interesting}} case of literature and law relationship. Moroccan society is still anchored to the past; nevertheless, it is crossed by radical political changes, in particular as far as the attention towards human rights is concerned. While from a legal perspective Ali Mezghani has referred to the Arab countries as an instance of “unfinished State”, from a literary point of view a distinction should be drawn between the historical moment of the Years of Lead in which young activists were imprisoned (Seventies) and the cultural moment in which these years’ experience resurfaced (Nineties). Writers, testimonies, interviews, films are all revolved around the same need to deal with a past which has been forgotten too often and by too many. The analysis {{of some of the most}} significant literary works of this period allows us to connect the writers’ fictions with their desire to build a future while positioning themselves in relation with a society they perceive as detached from themselves. Writing, then, becomes an elaboration of an endless mourning in which the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> does not always turn into a composition of the modern citizen...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{explore how}} {{patients}} with persistent unexplained pain interpret and utilise the biopsychosocial model. This {{might have an}} impact on the outcome from treatment programmes that adopts a biopsychosocial approach. METHOD: We conducted three interviews with 20 patients attending a pain management programme for persistent unexplained back pain; prior to attending the course, immediately following the course and at 1 year. We used the methods of grounded theory. RESULTS: Patients battled through several dialectic tensions in an attempt to legitimise their pain: First, patients wanted a medical diagnosis but also recognised that psychosocial factors contributed to their pain. Second, although the outward appearance of pain was important to legitimacy, it was also important not to appear 'too ill'. Third, meeting others with unexplained pain reinforced credibility, but patients also described how they were not 'like the others'. Finally, although holding on to one's self was important, patients also described an <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These dialectic tensions are likely to {{have an impact on}} a person's decision to embrace the biopsychosocial model, and might therefore effect their outcome. Health care professionals should be sensitive to the cultural ambiguity of patients with persistent unexplained pain...|$|E
40|$|J. M. Coetzee’s work is {{imbued with}} a preoccupation with {{individual}} freedom which is inextricable from {{a concern for}} ethical responsibility that often develops into fictional aporias, unfathomable conditions of uncompromising and crystallized resistance and isolation. This article examines a specific aspect of Coetzee’s concern {{with the issue of}} freedom by analyzing the role of the body in Slow Man (2005), which thematizes the image of the maimed body and the refusal of a prothesis as an ambivalently compensatory form of freedom: a freedom to renounce conceived as an <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss.</b> The novel foregrounds the “body in pain” as an accidentally maimed body, and constructs the rejection of an artificial replacement in the terms of an obdurate vindication of freedom, conceived as the right to self-determination. This choice can be variously read as a troubled choice of loss, failure and surrender, but it also dovetails with earlier figurations of resisting and impaired bodies in Coetzee’s allegorical “postcolonial” novels such as Foe, Age of Iron and Waiting for the Barbarians. The theme of the disabled and prosthetic body as a site of power structure is also related, in more that one way, to the idea of hospitality, a key concept which intersects some of the most recurrent and important concerns of Coetzee’s oeuvre: the irreducibility of the other and the writer’s allegiance to it, the public role of the writer, the relationship between the literary text and history, the literary text and love, the writer and his text as a home for the other...|$|E

40|$|Recognized as the “spiritual {{father of}} Pacific Island theatre” (Balme 194), John Kneubuhl’s {{life and work}} exemplify the {{transnational}} and diasporic constitution of Pacific cultures and societies. Kneubuhl was born in American Samoa in 1920 to a Samoan mother, herself the great granddaughter of George Pritchard, missionary in Tahiti and later consul to Samoa, and an American father from Iowa, himself the descendant of Swiss immigrants to the United States. Having grown up in American Samoa and Hawai‘i and studied at Yale, Kneubuhl returned to Honolulu after the Second World War and wrote his first Hawaiian plays for the Honolulu Community Theatre. From 1949 to 1968 he {{lived and worked in}} Hollywood as a successful script writer for a large number of popular television shows. In 1968 he returned home to Samoa from where he went on to spend time in Tonga and move back to Hawai’i before a final return to American Samoa, where he died in 1992 on the night that his last play, Think of a Garden, premiered in Pago Pago. Thinking of himself as a Hawaiian playwright (Johnson 109) and of Hawaiians as strangers in their own land (Orr), Kneubuhl’s great theme was the search for home, which he explored throughout a writing career that spanned fifty years. Informed by his own family background and life experience as well as his studies in Polynesian culture and history, he was skeptical toward attempts to reclaim identities and restore lost worlds and instead located home in a mental attitude “between memory and hope” (Kneubuhl 3. 2. 2), a confrontation and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> nurtured by Polynesian ritual and theatrical traditions. In this paper, I propose to show and discuss how this vision evolved in four of Kneubuhl’s Hawaiian plays, The Harp in the Willows (1947), Hello, Hello, Hello (1974), Mele Kanikau: A Pageant (1975) and A Play: A Play (1990), as it was worked into Western dramatic forms to produce a uniquely transnational Pacific theatre.

Informant nonuse of low-vision services involved: insufficient knowledge, managing for now, and practitioner behavior (inadequate rehabilitation education and management).

The data collection method was focus group interviews. The constant comparative method revealed the main category ‘preserving integrity’. The subcategories were: the need for control over information, similar relationships with both friends and neighbours (symmetrical contact), and ‘My home is my castle’.

The plans were primarily championed by the Swedish Foreign Minister, Christian Günther, and Conservative party leader Gösta Bagge, Education Minister in Stockholm. They had to counter increasing anti-Swedish opinions in Finland; and in Sweden, Liberal and Socialist suspicions against what was seen as right-wing dominance in Finland. One of the chief objectives of the plan was to ensure greatest possible liberty for Sweden and Finland in a presumed post-war Europe totally dominated by Nazi Germany. In Sweden, political opponents criticized the necessary adaptations to the Nazis; in Finland, the resistance centred on the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> sovereignty and influence—and the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> Finnish Karelia.

She remains interested in the end, infinity, death, apocalypse, paradise, eternity and immortality, with the idea of trying to name the unnamable.

I first identified this form of collective amnesia in a 1995 article describing how fisheries biologists assess changes in biomass abundance. Every generation begins its conscious life by assessing the state of the world and society around it and using what it sees as a baseline to evaluate changes that occur subsequently. 1 However, the baselines of previous generations are commonly ignored, and thus the standard by which we assess change also changes. I called this phenomenon “shifting baselines. ” For example, those studying wildlife today might be impressed by the abundance of large wild mammals (bears, wolves, various herbivores) in Alaska, while being unaware that such numbers were at one time common in the lower 48. Therefore, they might not miss the large animals there and might look askance at efforts to (re) introduce previously abundant species.

500|$|Responding to this {{emphasis}} on pleasure, Albert Guerard, Jr. argues that the poem contains a [...] "longing not for art but a free reverie of any kind. The form of the poem is that of progression by association, so that the movement of feeling is {{at the mercy of}} words evoked by chance, such words as fade and forlorn, the very words that, like a bell, toll the dreamer back to his sole self." [...] However, Fogle points out that the terms Guerard emphasizes are [...] "associational translations" [...] and that Guerard misunderstands Keats's aesthetic.

Death was a constant theme that permeated aspects of Keats poetry because he was exposed to death of his family members throughout his life. Within the poem, there are many images of death. The nightingale experiences a sort of death and even the god Apollo experiences death, but his death reveals his own divine state. As Perkins explains, [...] "But, of course, the nightingale is not thought to be literally dying. The point is that the deity or the nightingale can sing without dying.

40|$|Purpose: To explore {{dimensions}} of stigma experienced by {{older adults with}} hearing loss and those with whom they frequently communicate to target interventions promoting engagement and positive aging.  Design and Methods: This longitudinal qualitative study conducted interviews over 1 year with dyads where one partner had hearing loss. Participants were naive to or had not worn hearing aids in the past year. Data were analyzed using grounded theory, constant comparative methodology.  Results: Perceived stigma emerged as influencing decision-making processes at multiple points along the experiential continuum <b>of</b> hearing <b>loss,</b> such as initial <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> hearing <b>loss,</b> whether to be tested, type of hearing aid selected, and when and where hearing aids were worn. Stigma was related to 3 interrelated experiences, alterations in self-perception, ageism, and vanity and was influenced by dyadic relationships and external societal forces, such as health and hearing professionals and media.  Implications: Findings are discussed in relation to theoretical perspectives regarding stigma and ageism and suggest the need to destigmatize hearing loss by promoting its assessment and treatment as well as emphasizing the importance of remaining actively engaged to support positive physical and cognitive functioning...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss and analyse the impact of the new {{category}} of the employee shareholder within the context of the traditional theory of the contract of service and contract for services. A commentary on the provisions of the Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 which heralded the introduction of the employee shareholder category will be provided in addition to a focus on the implied duties traditionally applied to personal employment contracts. One of the themes of the analysis is to assess whether and how these duties will apply to the future hybrid (and obscure) statutory construct of the ‘employee shareholder’. To provide a comparative analysis, this contribution will also briefly examine whether any potential counterpart of the new British concept exists in Italian law. Finally, the paper will discuss possible flaws in the British legislation concerning employee shareholders, by taking an approach that is disarticulated from the traditional theory of employment law.
