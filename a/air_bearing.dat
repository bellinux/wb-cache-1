The most common devices are Patient lifts (for vertical transfer), Transfer benches, stretcher or convertible chairs (for lateral, supine transfer), sit-to-stand lifts (for moving patients from one seated position to another i.e., from wheelchairs to commodes), <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> inflatable mattresses (for supine transfer i.e., transfer from a gurney to an operating room table), and sliding boards (usually used for transfer from a bed to a wheelchair). Highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require a Patient lift (a floor or ceiling-suspended sling lift) which though invented in 1955 and in common use since the early 1960s is still considered the state-of-the-art transfer device by OSHA and the American Nursing Association.|$|E
2500|$|That night, Louis Martin and his daughters, Léonie, Céline and Thérèse, {{attended}} the midnight mass at the cathedral in Lisieux— [...] "but {{there was very}} little heart left in them. On 1 December, Léonie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to Les Buissonnets after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alençon", and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at Les Buissonnets as every year, Thérèse [...] "as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> toys and cakes." [...] While she and Celine were going up the stairs she heard her father, [...] "perhaps exhausted by the hour, or this reminder of the relentless emotional demands of his weepy youngest daughter", say with some irritation [...] "Therese is far too old for this now. Fortunately this will be the last year!" [...] Thérèse had begun to cry and Céline advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Thérèse pulled herself together and wiped her tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt by the fireplace and unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895 : [...] "In an instant Jesus, content with my good will, accomplished the work I {{had not been able to}} do in ten years." [...] After nine sad years she had [...] "recovered the strength of soul she had lost" [...] when her mother died and, she said, [...] "she was to retain it forever". She discovered the joy in self-forgetfulness and added, [...] "I felt, in a word, charity enter my heart, the need to forget myself to make others happy—Since this blessed night I was not defeated in any battle, but instead I went from victory to victory and began, so to speak, [...] "to run a giant's course" [...] (Psalms [...] ).|$|E

50|$|Moving <b>air</b> <b>bearings</b> are tilting {{due to the}} {{aerodynamic}} effects within the gap. Depending on the tilt stiffness, an <b>air</b> <b>bearing’s</b> force capacity decreases with an increasing velocity until it reaches a limit at which it totally fails. Micro nozzle <b>air</b> <b>bearings</b> have a velocity limit which can reach, depending on the customization, dozens of m/s.

60|$|That night, {{after the}} shop {{was closed and}} Aspel had gone home, and Mr Fred Blurt had gone to sleep, under the {{guardianship}} of the faithful Miss Lillycrop, and Mrs Murridge had retired to the coal-hole--or something like it--which was her dormitory, Mr Enoch Blurt entered the shop with a mysterious <b>air,</b> <b>bearing</b> two green tablecloths. These he hung like curtains at {{one corner of the}} room, and placed a chair behind them raised on two empty packing-boxes. Seating himself in this chair he opened the curtains just enough to enable him to peep through, and found that he could see the letter-slit in the door over the counter, but not the floor beneath it. He therefore elevated his throne by means of another packing-box. All being ready, he lowered the gas to something like a dim religious light, and began his watch. It bade fair to be a tedious watch, but Enoch Blurt had made up his mind to go through with it, and whatever Enoch made up his mind to do he did.|$|E
6000|$|They {{continued}} {{to go on}} their way together, and as they passed by a cherry tree the giant grasped the top of it, where the ripest fruit hung, gave the branches into the tailor's hand, and bade him eat. But the little tailor was far too weak to hold the tree down, and when the giant let go the tree swung back into the <b>air,</b> <b>bearing</b> the little tailor with it. When he had fallen to the ground again without hurting himself, the giant said: [...] "What! {{do you mean to}} tell me you haven't the strength to hold down a feeble twig?" [...] "It wasn't strength that was wanting," [...] replied the tailor; [...] "do you think that would have been anything for a man who has killed seven at a blow? I jumped over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting among the branches near us. Do you do the like if you dare." [...] The giant made an attempt, but couldn't get over the tree, and stuck fast in the branches, so that here too the little tailor had the better of him.|$|E
50|$|Undoubtedly, <b>air</b> <b>bearings</b> have {{outstanding}} features in many applications.

The analysis on stability and natural frequencies of rotor bearing system was performed using the linear bearing model.

50|$|One major {{advantage}} {{is the lack}} of metal-on-metal contact. Graphite has a natural lubricity.

Because of this, porous air bearings are the most reliable and have infinite lifetime.Graphite can be tuned such that the <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> will meet requirements of fluid flow, stiffness, load capacity, size, etc.This Video demonstrates a porous <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> in motion.|$|E
