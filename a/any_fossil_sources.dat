The 46 % drop in U. S. energy intensity (primary energy consumption per dollar of real GDP) during 1975 – 2005 represented by 2005 an effective energy “source ” 2. 1 as big as U. S. oil consumption, 3. 4 net oil imports, 6 domestic oil output or net oil imports from OPEC countries, and 13 net imports from Persian Gulf countries. U. S. energy intensity has lately fallen by ~ 2. 5 % per year, apparently due much more to improved efficiency than to changes in behavior or in the mix {{of goods and services}} provided, and outpacing the growth of <b>any</b> <b>fossil</b> or nuclear <b>source.</b> Yet energy efficiency has gained little attention or respect. Indeed, since official statistics focus ~ 99 % on physical energy supply, only the fifth of the 1996 – 2005 increase in U. S. energy services that came from supply was visible to investors and policymakers; the four-fifths saved was not. The last time this incomplete picture led to strongly supply-boosting national policies, in the early 1980 s, it caused a trainwreck within a few years—glutted markets, crashed prices, bankrupt suppliers—because the market had meanwhile invisibly produced a gusher o...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the life cycle operation phase of forest cableways Larix 550 and Larix 3 T with respect to energy requirements and environmental pollution caused by emissions. Energy audit quantifies energy use based on the consumption of fuels and lubricants. Energy balance includes both the energy content and the energy needed for the production of fuels and lubricants. Fuel consumption measured for one year ranged from 1. 2 – 1. 4 l/m^ 3. Based on the consumption of fuels and lubricants the paper quantifies the amount of emissions in two scenarios (minimum consumption and maximum consumption) with a special focus on GHG emissions. Calculations are made of emissions for diesel fuel and for the alternatively applicable rape-seed methyl ester (RME), and a calculation is also made of emissions originating from <b>fossil</b> <b>sources.</b> By using RME as a fuel, the amount of CO 2 emissions from <b>fossil</b> <b>sources</b> discharged into the environment can be reduced by 3. 4 kg per a cubic meter over the bark of timber extracted by cableway...|$|R
