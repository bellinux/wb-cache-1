5|$|Discovering the {{tertiary}} {{structure of a}} protein, or the quaternary structure of its complexes, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function. Common experimental methods of structure determination include X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, both of which can produce information at atomic resolution. However, NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem. Dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus. Circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal β-sheet / α-helical composition of proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower-resolution structural information <b>about</b> <b>very</b> large protein complexes, including assembled viruses; a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high-resolution information in some cases, especially for two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Solved structures are usually deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained {{in the form of}} Cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein.|$|E

By carefully recording distances (time or paces) and magnetic bearings traveled, one can plot a course and return to one's starting point using the compass alone.|$|E

25|$|Another common {{symptom of}} copper {{deficiency}} is peripheral neuropathy, which is numbness or tingling that can {{start in the}} extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso. In an Advances in Clinical Neuroscience & Rehabilitation (ACNR) published case report, a 69-year-old patient had progressively worsened neurological symptoms. These symptoms included diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal lower limb reflexes, sensation to light touch and pin prick was diminished above the waist, vibration sensation {{was lost in the}} sternum, and markedly reduced proprioception or sensation about the self’s orientation. Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain <b>about</b> <b>very</b> similar or identical symptoms as the patient. This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. Peripheral neuropathy can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there is lack of correct diagnosis. Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms. The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest.|$|E

Air Chief Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst, the head of Bomber Command, wished O'Connor luck; his XD827 would make the drop, with Squadron Leader Tony Caillard in XD827, the grandstand aircraft. The aircraft took off at 07:15 on 11 September 1958. Once in the air, though, a fault developed in the ground radar transmitter. Grandy then authorised a visual drop.

500|$|Although {{the script}} for Strange Days was {{completed}} in 1993, the lead characters were not secured in the cast list until May 1994. Originally, actor Andy Garcia was a potential candidate to star in the film, and Bono of the Irish rock band U2 was rumored to star as Faith's love interest Philo Gant. Ultimately, Academy Award nominees Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, and Juliette Lewis were chosen as the leads. Fiennes' role in the Schindler's List impressed Bigelow enough to want to cast him as Nero, stating that the role [...] "required somebody who had {{a tremendous amount of}} intelligence, complexity, depth, a series of qualities that I really felt only Ralph could supply." [...] Cameron, however, felt that a [...] "glibber and slicker" [...] actor would be better for the role, but admitted that Fiennes made Lenny [...] "a sexier character—a guy you can care <b>about</b> <b>very</b> much." [...] In contrast, Bassett was already suggested by Cameron since the beginning. The fact that Lewis was able to sing was appreciated as the producers wanted to avoid lip-synching.|$|E
500|$|In a contributor's note Salinger gave to Harper's Magazine in 1946, he wrote: [...] "I {{almost always}} write <b>about</b> <b>very</b> young people", a {{statement}} that {{has been referred to}} as his credo. Adolescents are featured or appear in all of Salinger's work, from his first published short story, [...] "The Young Folks" [...] (1940), to The Catcher in the Rye and his Glass family stories. In 1961, the critic Alfred Kazin explained that Salinger's choice of teenagers as a subject matter was one reason for his appeal to young readers, but another was [...] "a consciousness [...] that he speaks for them and virtually to them, in a language that is peculiarly honest and their own, with a vision of things that capture their most secret judgments of the world." [...] For this reason, Norman Mailer once remarked that Salinger was [...] "the greatest mind ever to stay in prep school". Salinger's language, especially his energetic, realistically sparse dialogue, was revolutionary at the time his first stories were published and was seen by several critics as [...] "the most distinguishing thing" [...] about his work.|$|E
2500|$|The {{loneliness}} in Orbison's {{songs that}} he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: [...] "I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else... Although if you grow up in West Texas, {{there are a lot}} of ways to be lonely." [...] His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees stated, [...] "He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing <b>about</b> <b>very</b> emotional things. For men to sing <b>about</b> <b>very</b> emotional things... Before that no one would do it." [...] Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: [...] "When [...] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry." [...] Peter Lehman, on the other hand, considered Orbison's theme of constant vulnerability an element of sexual masochism.|$|E

2500|$|McKay was {{attracted}} to communism in his early life, but he always asserted that he never became an official member of the Communist Party USA. However, some scholars dispute the claim {{that he was not}} a communist at that time, noting his close ties to active members, his attendance at communist-led events, and his months-long stay in the Soviet Union in 192223, which he wrote <b>about</b> <b>very</b> favorably. He gradually became disillusioned with communism, however, and by the mid-1930s, [...] had begun to write negatively about it.|$|E

2500|$|Brown's neighbor, Pablo Fenjves, testified about {{hearing a}} [...] "very {{distinctive}} barking" [...] and [...] "plaintive wail" [...] {{of a dog}} at around 10 to 15 minutes after 10:00p.m. {{while he was at}} home watching the 10 o'clock news on television. Eva Stein, another neighbor, testified <b>about</b> <b>very</b> loud and persistent barking, also at around 10:15p.m., that kept her from going back to sleep. Neighbor Steven Schwab testified that while he was walking his dog in the area near Brown's house at around 11:30p.m., he noticed a wandering and agitated Akita dog (Brown's) trailing its leash. He saw that it had bloody paws, but after examining it, he found the dog uninjured. Schwab said he took the dog to another neighbor friend of his, Sukru Boztepe. He testified that he took the dog into his home where it became more agitated. Boztepe took the dog for a walk at approximately 12:00 midnight and testified that the dog tugged on its leash and led him to Nicole's house. There he discovered Nicole Simpson's dead body. Minutes later, Boztepe flagged down a passing patrol car.|$|E
2500|$|The Doctor {{played by}} Tom Baker (1974–81) is often {{regarded}} as {{the most popular of}} the Doctors. In polls conducted by Doctor Who Magazine, Baker has lost the [...] "Best Doctor" [...] category only three times: once to Sylvester McCoy in 1990, and twice to David Tennant in 2006 and 2009. Many of the stories from his era are considered to be classics of the series, including The Ark in Space, Genesis of the Daleks, The Brain of Morbius, The Deadly Assassin and The Robots of Death. However, the violent tone of the stories produced by Letts' successor, Philip Hinchcliffe, saw the series come under heavy criticism at home from morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse. Concerns over violence during this early period led to a lightening of the tone and an erratic decline in both the popularity and quality of the series. Baker has described Hinchcliffe as [...] "amazing" [...] and identified that as his favourite period of his time on the series. He described Hinchcliffe's successor, Graham Williams, as [...] "absolutely devoted" [...] but lacking Hinchcliffe's flair. He has acknowledged that his final producer on the series, John Nathan-Turner, made changes he didn't agree with and they [...] "did not see eye-to-eye really <b>about</b> <b>very</b> much". He said they became good friends afterwards and forgot their disagreements. Baker suggested that he may have stayed in the role for one series too many.|$|E
2500|$|In March and April, eight German {{divisions}} {{were believed}} to be in reserve opposite the British from the Somme to the North Sea coast and then divisions in reserve behind the 4th Army were moved south to Artois in the 6th Army area. From [...] the success of the Brusilov Offensive became apparent and agent reports showed increased railway movement from Belgium to Germany. The final BEF military intelligence estimate before 1 July, was that there were [...] battalions opposite the British Fourth Army and [...] in reserve or close enough to reach the battlefield in the first week. Five of the seven German divisions in reserve had been engaged at Verdun and some divisions had been transferred from France to the Eastern Front. Men of the 1916 conscription class were appearing among German prisoners of war, suggesting that the German army had been weakened and that the British could break down the German front line and force a battle of manoeuvre on the defenders. In late June, the British part of the Somme plan was amended, for the rapid capture of Bapaume and envelopment of German defences north to Arras, rather than to the south at Péronne. An {{increase in the number of}} trains moving from Germany to Belgium was also discovered but the quality of German troops opposite the British was thought to have been much reduced. The true number of German divisions in reserve in France was ten, with six opposite the British, double the number known to the British. Reports of work continuing on the German defences opposite the Fourth Army in March and April, led the planners to adopt a less optimistic view, particularly due to the news <b>about</b> <b>very</b> deep shell-proof shelters being dug under German front trenches, which proved far less vulnerable to bombardment.|$|E

'Pon De Replay', 'SOS', 'Umbrella', 'Russian Roulette', 'Only Girl In The World'." [...] Despite complimenting Rihanna for sounding extremely relaxed and calling her vocal as [...] "luxurious calling to mind the atmosphere", Elan concluded that the over-all effect is underwhelming. She continued by writing that instead of re-inventing the pop wheel, [...] "We Found Love" [...] has [...] "a whiff of treading-water about it" [...] and that [...] "if there is a 'goosebump' moment to be had it comes after many multiple plays and, dare we say it, a glass of something strong."

[...] Leah Collins of The Vancouver Sun initially praised Rihanna's vocal performance in the song, writing that she [...] "smoothes out her vocals", before adding, [...] "Angelic as she sounds, though, [...] performance – which is mostly just her repeating the line 'We found love in a hopeless place' – seems to take second place to Harris' repetitive synth-based blare."
