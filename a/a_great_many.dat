5|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy plant that {{grows in a}} range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>many</b> seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E

5|$|During August, the Ju 87s {{also had}} some success. On 13 August {{the opening of the}} main German attacks on airfields took place; it was known to the Luftwaffe as Adlertag ("Eagle Day"). Messerschmitt Bf 109s of Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26) were sent out in advance of the main strike and {{successfully}} drew off RAF fighters, allowing 86 Ju 87s of StG 1 to attack RAF Detling in Kent unhindered. The attack killed the station commander, destroyed 20 RAF aircraft on the ground and <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>many</b> of the airfield's buildings.

5|$|For three hours, Experiment battled the barges, sinking two {{and killing}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>many</b> of the picaroons. During this time {{two of the}} barges left the warship and {{attacked}} the merchant ships. These barges managed {{to protect themselves from}} Experiment by sailing behind the schooner Mary, which was between the two barges and the warship. The Haitians boarded Mary and killed her captain. Many of the crew jumped into the sea, and the rest hid in the hold. The second barge attempted to take Daniel and Mary but was sunk by fire from Experiment. Once the Haitians had boarded Mary, Experiment opened fire upon her with grapeshot, driving the picaroons off.|$|E
5|$|In all {{subspecies}} but the type, {{the lower}} stamens are also hairy. In subsp. crassifolium, the hairiness is less dense and often {{absent from the}} upper part of the anthers, while lower leaves are hardly decurrent and have longer petioles. In subsp. giganteum, the hairs are densely white tomentose, and lower leaves strongly decurrent. Subsp. crassifolium also differs from the type in having slightly larger flowers, which measure 15–30mm wide, whereas in the type they are 12–20mm in diameter. Both subsp. giganteum and subsp. crassifolium were originally described as species. Due to its morphological variation, V.thapsus has had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>many</b> subspecies described. A recent revision led its author to maintain V.giganteum but sink V.crassifolium into synonymy.|$|E

5|$|Marks of cadency are {{generally}} not used with crests, {{though it is not}} incorrect to do so, and the British royal family continue this practice. It is, however, widely observed in England that no two families may use the same crest. This is in contrast to Scottish practice, in which crests are less significant, and are often borne in the same form by <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>many</b> unrelated people. As a result of this lack of need for differentiation, Scottish crests tend to be less ornamental than their English counterparts.|$|E

5|$|The English Civil War {{resulted}} in Parliament issuing orders to slight or damage many castles, particularly in prominent royal regions. This was {{particularly in the}} period of 1646 to 1651, with a peak in 1647. Around 150fortifications were slighted in this period, including 38town walls and <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>many</b> castles. Slighting was quite expensive and took some considerable effort to carry out, so damage was usually done in the most cost-effective fashion with only selected walls being destroyed. In some cases the damage was almost total, such as Pontefract Castle which had been involved in three major sieges and in this case {{at the request of the}} townsfolk who wished to avoid further conflict.|$|E
