5000|$|Amovibility {{contrasts}} with arbitrary removal, which the Catholic Church has always condemned. It {{is opposed to}} the perpetual tenure of those benefices, for removal from which the canons require a cause expressly named in law and a formal canonical process or trial. But {{there may be other}} causes that justify a removal besides those named in the canons. A removable rector is, therefore, one who may be removed without cause expressed in law, but not without a just cause; one who may be removed without canonical process, but not without certain prescribed formalities, which are really judicial, though [...] "extra-judicial" [...] as regards the canons. Since, however, removable ecclesiastics have no strict and perpetual right to their offices, any revocation made by the superior <b>ad</b> <b>nutum</b> is valid, though it might be gravely illicit and reversible. In such cases recourse may be had to a superior authority, although an ordinary appeal in the strict sense is barred.|$|E
50|$|The {{interpretation}} of amovibility has caused controversy. Many canonists {{have argued that}} because the possessor of an office holds it <b>ad</b> <b>nutum,</b> he can therefore be deprived of it without cause. Otherwise, they declare, the word amovibility would have no meaning. They note as exceptions, however, to this power of the bishop, cases in which he acts from open hatred, or injures the good name of the ecclesiastic, or damages the parish. Likewise, they say, if the person removed were not given another office, he could have recourse to a superior authority, as this would be equivalent to injuring his good name. These canonists also add that the bishop would sin if he removed an ecclesiastic without cause, as his action would be without a proper motive, and because frequent changes are necessarily detrimental to churches. Other canonists seem to maintain for removable rectors practically {{the same rights as}} to perpetuity, which are possessed by irremovable ecclesiastics.|$|E
5000|$|Soon after, on 26 April 1951, Pope Pius XII {{appointed}} Kominek titular {{bishop of}} Sophene and [...] "Pastoral Representative" [...] with residence in Wrocław. However, the Communist regime forbade him taking up residence there and from being consecrated. Nevertheless, Kominek was secretly consecrated as bishop on 10 October 1954 {{at the hands}} of Bishop Franciszek Barda, with Bishops Franciszek Jop and Wojciech Tomaka serving as co-consecrators. The consecration was kept secret until 1956, when he could finally move to Wrocław and was appointed on 1 December titular Bishop of Vaga. On 19 March 1962 he was raised in rank by being named titular Archbishop of Euchaitae and on 25 May 1962 was appointed apostolic administrator <b>ad</b> <b>nutum</b> Sanctae Sedis. He and Bishop Jop were co-consecrators at the episcopal consecration by Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak of Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II, as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Krakow on 28 September 1958. From 1962 to 1965, he attended the Second Vatican Council.|$|E
50|$|Jean-Baptiste Colbert, {{minister}} to the King, inaugurated the new office of Lieutenant General of Police of Paris in 1667. The edict which Colbert presented to Louis XIV in March 1667 resulted from several centuries' evolution of French attitudes towards public safety. He envisioned a complete solution to crime; from a situation inherited from the Middle Ages, he distilled {{the foundations of the}} modern police force under the Ancien Régime. The purpose of the office of Lieutenant General of Police was to create an autonomous force {{to take care of the}} nicer areas of the city, and curb the growth of the Cour des miracles. Paris was the first city to take such measures. Originally concerned mainly with requests from the Council of State, the position had complete authority over existing institutions of law enforcement and civil protection. In particular, the Lieutenant General of Police supported the various governmental bureaus (trades, markets, schools, archives, etc.). Appointed by the king, the office of Lieutenant General of Police is revocable <b>ad</b> <b>nutum</b> (at will).|$|E

40|$|Having as main {{objective}} the analysis {{the provisions of}} Company Law and the New Civil Code regarding the management of a trading company by a legal person, the study offers several solutions {{to a number of}} controversial issues with strict reference to two aspects: appointing and revoking the legal entity administrator.

40|$|As social {{networks}} have become widely and greatly used, {{it is necessary}} to address the legal framework of these particular digital environments, which consists not only of legislative or contractual rules, but also of a group of legal rules having a technical origin, as well as of just technical rules that can affect private relationships effectively. The nature of the agreements entered into by social web managers and users involves also the negotiability of the existential characters of the individual by recognizing a contract concerning the exchange of licenses to use intangible assets. The proposed research outcome, which is related to the fundamental values of the individual, makes it possible to revisit the use of remedies, mostly the <b>ad</b> <b>nutum</b> withdrawal from {{social networks}}, which is generally not associated with any requirement of notice.
