The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} Cub Scout Trainer Wood Badge was {{field tested}} in 1976.

Wood Badge was <b>adopted</b> <b>as</b> the official advanced training program for adult Cub Scout Leaders. The modified course blended Scoutcraft skills and troop management practices along with scaled-down content about the leadership competencies.|$|E

5|$|Despite these advances, {{movable type}} {{printing}} never gained {{the amount of}} widespread use in East Asia that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written morpheme characters impeded movable type's acceptance and practical use, and was therefore seen as largely unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468), was eventually wholly <b>adopted</b> <b>as</b> the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries still.|$|E
