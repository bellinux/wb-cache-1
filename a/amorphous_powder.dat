2500|$|Boron can be {{prepared}} in several crystalline and amorphous forms. Well known crystalline forms are α-rhombohedral, β-rhombohedral, and β-tetragonal. [...] In special circumstances, boron can also be synthesized {{in the form of}} its α-tetragonal, and γ-orthorhombic allotropes. Two amorphous forms, one a finely divided powder and the other a glassy solid, are also known. Although at least 14 more allotropes have been reported, these other forms are based on tenuous evidence or have not been experimentally confirmed, or are thought to represent mixed allotropes, or boron frameworks stabilized by impurities. Whereas the β-rhombohedral phase is the most stable and the others are metastable, the transformation rate is negligible at room temperature, and thus all five phases can exist at ambient conditions. <b>Amorphous</b> <b>powder</b> boron and polycrystalline rhombohedral β-boron are the most common forms. The latter allotrope is a very hard grey material, about ten percent lighter than aluminium and with a melting point (2080°C) several hundred degrees higher than that of steel.|$|E

40|$|In this chapter, the {{fundamental}} characteristics of spray drying are described {{with regards to}} its applications to alter the structure of food <b>powders</b> (crystalline or <b>amorphous).</b> Unlike <b>amorphous</b> <b>powders</b> which are in thermodynamically non-equilibrium state and tend to experience many phase transitions to obtain the lowest energy state, crystalline powders are stable and an alteration of its structure using spray drying involves two steps, disruption of the molecular order in crystal lattice and fast solidification to prevent molecules from orderly arrangement.

40|$|Consolidation of <b>amorphous</b> <b>powders,</b> {{which take}} {{advantage}} of the supercooled liquid region, is an alternative way to overcome the size limitation in marginal metallic glasses. Cu 36 Ti 34 Zr 22 Ni 8 based <b>amorphous</b> <b>powders</b> were obtained during high energy ball-milling. The analyses revealed that <b>amorphous</b> structures of <b>powders</b> and ribbons are quite different and this led to a different thermal behavior being the powders more thermally stable than the ribbons. Extrusion was initially proposed as a consolidation process; however, the decrease in viscosity in remainder amorphous matrix was not sufficient for that process, but certainly sufficient for sintering the sample during hot consolidation. An amorphous/nanocrystalline microstructure known for enhancing the mechanical properties of their fully amorphous counterparts was obtained. Evaluation of mechanical properties by microhardness revealed the relatively high hardness of HV 768. From these results, consolidation by sintering seems a promising route to produce bulk metallic glasses nanocomposites...|$|R
