In June 1584, Elizabeth granted him a monopoly on the importation of <b>aniseed</b> and sumac to England for ten years; this was renewed in January 1593. In 1588 he was given land and tithes in Worcestershire belonging to the Bishop of Worcester Edmund Freke.

Pimpinella anisum (anise), belonging to Umbelliferae family, is an aromatic plant which has been used In Iranian traditional medicine (especially its fruits) as carminative, aromatic, disinfectant, and galactagogue. Because the wide traditional usage of Pimpinella anisum for treatment of diseases, in this review published scientific reports about the composition and pharmacological properties of this plant were collected with electronic literature search of GoogleScholar, PubMed, Sciencedirect, Scopus, and SID from 1970 to 2011. So far, different studies were performed on <b>aniseeds</b> and various properties such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, muscle relaxant, analgesic and anticonvulsant activity as well as different effects on gastrointestinal system have been reported of <b>aniseeds.</b> It can also reduce morphine dependence and has beneficial effects on dysmenorrhea and menopausal hot flashes in women. In diabetic patients, <b>aniseeds</b> showed hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effect and reduce lipid peroxidation. The most important compounds of <b>aniseeds</b> essential oil were trans-anetole, estragole, γ-hymachalen, para-anisaldehyde and methyl cavicol. Due to broad spectrum of pharmacological effects, and very few clinical studies of Pimpinella anisum, more clinical trials are recommended to evaluate the beneficial effects of this plant in human models and synthesis of new drugs from the active ingredients of this plant in future. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAntibiotic {{resistance}} in bacteria {{is becoming a}} serious problem, especially after the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. To overcome this problem, new and effective antibacterials or resistance modulators are highly needed and plant kingdom represents a valuable source of these compounds. In this study we investigated the antibacterial and resistance modulatory activity of <b>Aniseeds</b> waste Residue Extract (ASWRE) and Star Anise Waste Residue Extract (SAWRE) (post-distillation) against 100 isolates belonging to two Gram positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) and four Gram negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Phenolic compounds of anise wastes were determined by HPLC. The antibacterial activity of anise waste extracts assays were performed by using inhibition zone diameters, MIC and MBC. Evaluation of synergy interaction between anise waste extracts and certain known antibacterial drugs like Cephradine, Chloramphenicol, Tetracycline and Amoxicillin was carried out using disc diffusion method, MIC and the fractional inhibitory concentrations (FIC). The results showed that HPLC method has been developed for the determination of 25 phenolic compounds from waste extracts. Both ASWRE and SAWRE have significant antibacterial activity against all of the test bacteria. SAWRE {{was found to have}} higher amounts of phenolic compounds contents that might be responsible for their comparatively higher antibacteria activity than ASWRE. Irradiation at 10 and 30  kGy did not significantly affect the antibacterial activity of both ASWRE and SAWRE. The combination of anise waste extracts and the tested antibiotics mostly showed synergistic effect. Synergistic interaction was most expressed against Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp 1) and Staphylococcus aureus (Sa 1) by Tetracycline and chloramphenicol; Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K 3), Acinetobacter baumannii (A 2) and Escherichia coli (E 3) by cephradine, amoxicillin and Tetracycline. The combination between anise waste extracts and the test antibiotics could be useful in fighting emerging drug-resistant bacteria. These results suggest that both <b>aniseeds</b> and star anise waste residue methanolic extract (post-distillation) could be good economic sources of multidrug {{resistance in}}hibitors, and indicate that indiscriminate co-administration of antibiotics with some aromatic and medicine wastes such as those from <b>aniseeds</b> and star anise wastes could be therapeutically wasteful. Their use in combination with conventional antibiotics should be further studied for in vivo activities. This may lead to the development of much needed drug enhancing preparations...|$|R
40|$|Anis (Pimpinella anisum L.) seeds {{obtained}} from two geographic origins Tunisia (TAS) and Egypte (EAS) were studied regarding their biochemical composition and the antioxidant potential of their extracts. The {{results showed that}} the highest value of oil was detected with TAS compared to that of EAS ones. Ten (10) fatty acids were identified for the two locations and petroselinic acid was the most prevalent in oil seeds and interestingly, TAS displayed a significantly higher level of this acid than EAS. Besides, TAS exhibited slightly higher essential oil yield than the Egyptian variety and that trans-anethole was the dominant for the two provenances. In both accessions, the highest total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin content was obtained with ethyl acetate fraction. Therefore, TAS exhibited higher chelating and reducing powers than EAS which may be due to a slightly different phenolic composition between the two accession seed extracts. The phenolic compositions of TAS and EAS revealed that ethyl acetate extracts showed higher proportions of naringin, chlorogenic acid and rosmarinic acid. However, ethanol extracts were richer in larcitrin, rosmarinic acid and cirsimartin. The overall results revealed that <b>aniseeds</b> might constitute a novel source of natural antioxidants and could be used as food additive. Peer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|Anti-hunting campaigners long urged hunts {{to retain}} their {{tradition}} and equestrian sport by drag hunting, following an artificial scent. Drag hunting involves hunting a scent that has been laid (dragged) over a course with a defined beginning and end, before the day's hunting. The scent, usually a combination of <b>aniseed</b> oils and possibly animal meats or fox urine, is dragged along the terrain for distances usually of 10 or more miles. However, drag hunting is disliked by some advocates of quarry hunting because the trail is pre-determined, thereby eliminating the uncertainty present in the live quarry hunt and {{because they tend to}} be faster. Supporters contend that while drag hunts can be fast, this need not be the case if the scent line is broken up so that the hounds have to search an area to pick up the line.|$|E

2500|$|The Medieval Bloodhound was not {{primarily}} a pack hound, but a leash hound, though {{there may have}} been packs in different places or at different times. Up to the 19th century, a single hound or a brace was used on deer-parks, to find deer for the gun. However, [...] mid century two packs appeared, that of Thomas Neville, who hunted in the New Forest area, and who preferred very black hounds, and that of Lord Wolverton. Both of these hunted semi-domesticated deer (‘carted deer’), which were recaptured on being brought to bay, and returned home. It was said of Lord Wolverton's hounds that he found it difficult to get them to hunt as a pack, because each liked to follow the scent on his own. Eventually, many were sold to Le Couteulx de Canteleu and taken to France. [...] Around the start of the 20th century, several packs existed briefly, following either deer, or the ‘clean boot’ - individual human scent without any enhancement such as animal blood or <b>aniseed.</b> Since the Second World War there have been several packs, including that of Eric Furness, who introduced a cross to a Dumfriesshire foxhound into his Peak Bloodhounds. Generally, [...] masters of Bloodhounds since then maintain a level of outcross breeding in their packs to improve speed and agility, while retaining bloodhound type. These packs hunt the clean boot and are followed by a field on horseback.|$|E
