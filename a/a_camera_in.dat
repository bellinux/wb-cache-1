5|$|James Edward Westcott (born January 20, 1922) is a {{photographer}} {{who worked for}} the United States government in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, during the Manhattan Project and the Cold War. As {{one of the few people}} permitted to have <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> the Oak Ridge area during the Manhattan Project, he created the main visual record of the construction and operation of the Oak Ridge production facilities and of civilian life in the enclosed community of Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|In Zloda, Belarus, Amador {{uses the}} {{diamonds}} as payment for a proxcard {{to access the}} Todorov Building in Minsk. The team tracks her there, but Amador escapes. Skye and Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons discover a strange video feed linked to Amador, which they soon discover {{to be coming from}} <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> her eye, the source of her apparent 'powers'. Seeing the name of the hotel Amador is at through the feed, May tracks her down and confronts her. Amador reveals that her prosthetic eye contains a fail safe, so that her handler, who also relays orders in text-form through the eye, can kill her if she refuses to complete her missions. The two fight until Coulson arrives and stuns Amador. Skye hijacks the feed, and relays it through a pair of glasses that Agent Grant Ward wears, carrying out Amador's mission while Agents Fitz and Simmons remove the prosthetic eye.|$|E
5|$|Chris sets up <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> {{his room}} {{to capture the}} creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes of}} the protagonist's college life were filmed at Keyes High school, near Secunderabad Junction railway station. A school wall was {{demolished}} and a gate was repaired for the film's opening scene. Raghuvaran was carried away during the shoot of few action sequences and slapped Brahmaji for nearly six times in a row. To avoid such issues {{in the case of}} murder scenes, Varma decided to complete few of them by using plain close-ups of the victims. Sudhakar's murder scene was filmed near Keesara in Ranga Reddy district. Gopala Reddy and Ellore placed <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> a bag and ran behind him for a shaky effect. In the cycle-chain scene in which Siva uses a cycle chain to fight with J. D., the hand pulling the chain was Ellore's; in the next shot, Nagarjuna is shown holding the chain. The scene in which Naresh is killed near his home was filmed in the streets of Vengala Rao Nagar. The cycle chase scenes were filmed in Somajiguda and the slums behind Yashoda Hospitals. The bus chase scene was shot in Yusufguda. The film's climax was filmed at the Swapnalok complex in Secunderabad, and Bhavani's suicide was filmed on a set at Venus Studios in Chennai.|$|E

25|$|Sultaana Freeman gained {{national}} attention in 2003 when she sued the US state of Florida {{for the right}} to wear a niqab for her driver's license photo.

25|$|In May 2002, Swedish {{newspaper}} Expressen {{reported that}} Victoria {{had a new}} boyfriend, her personal trainer at Master Training, Daniel Westling.

Once Westling was photographed crossing a street against a red light in order to avoid <b>a</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>In</b> July 2002, Victoria and Daniel Westling were pictured kissing {{for the first time at}} a birthday party for Caroline Kreuger, a close friend of Victoria's.|$|E
25|$|A manhunt for {{the other}} two {{suspects}} was conducted throughout the night and into the next day, when police located the two remaining suspects, who had been hiding in the woods; they were arrested without incident. The shootout between Lopez and the gunman had been videotaped by <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> Lopez's cruiser. After the incident, Lopez told authorities that he believed the video of Lunsford's murder is what had saved his life that night. The video had helped him deal with the three suspects and he had learned {{not to make the}} same mistakes that Lunsford had made eight months earlier. For his actions, Trooper Lopez was awarded the Texas Department of Public Safety Medal of Valor, the highest award a commissioned trooper can receive.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Sultaana Freeman (formerly Sandra Keller, who {{converted}} to Islam in 1997 when marrying a Muslim man), sued the U.S. state of Florida {{for the right}} to wear a niqab for her driver's license photo. However, a Florida appellate court ruled that there was no violation in the state requiring her to show her face to <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> a private room with only a female employee to take the picture, in exchange for the privilege of driving. The prevailing view in Florida is currently that hiding one's face on a form of photo identification defeats the purpose of having the picture taken, although 15 other states (including Arkansas, California, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, and Louisiana) have provisions that allow for driver's licenses absent of an identifying photograph in order to accommodate individuals who may have a religious reason to not have a photograph taken. In 2012, a string of armed robberies in Philadelphia were committed by people disguised in traditional Islamic woman's garb; Muslim leaders were concerned that the use of the disguises could put Muslim women in danger of hate crimes and inflame ethnic tensions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half Liverpool drew level in the 57th minute when he latched onto a defence {{splitting}} pass from Jan Mølby to round Everton goalkeeper Bobby Mimms and slot the ball into an empty net. Six minutes later, Mølby was again {{at the heart of}} another attack. Picking the ball up inside the Everton penalty area, he drilled a cross for Craig Johnston to score. Liverpool were now 2–1 up, but the game was in the balance until the 84th minute, when Ronnie Whelan led another attack. With the game stretched, he picked the ball up and drove towards the edge of the Everton area. Dalglish made a run across his path into space, but Whelan used it as a dummy and clipped an exquisite ball over three Everton defenders into the path of Rush who, from the angle of the six-yard area, thumped the ball past Mimms, knocking over <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> the process. Liverpool held on to win 3–1 and completed the first (and so far only) League and FA Cup double in the club's history. Rush added the Man of the Match award to his winner's medal. However, the ban on English clubs in European competition was continued, and Rush was unable to have a crack of winning another European Cup in 1986–87.|$|E
25|$|Swanson was {{angered by}} the response, as she felt those very studios had {{produced}} questionable films themselves, and were jealous at not having the chance to produce Rain. After another threatening telegram, she decided to first appeal to the MPAA, and then the newspapers. She only heard back from Marcus Loew, who promised to appeal on her behalf, and since he owned a chain of theatres this eased some of her concerns. Figuring the silence meant the matter had been dropped, Swanson began filming on Sadie Thompson which already had $250,000 invested in it. Before casting began, the young Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. wanted to audition {{for the role of}} Handsome O'Hara. However, Swanson felt he was too young and not right for the role. Lionel Barrymore had been first picked to play Davidson but was thought to be too ill at the time, though he eventually won the role. Barrymore wore the same outfit for an entire week, aggravating Swanson. She asked some of the crew to tell him to change and wash, which he did. Aside from this, Swanson was happy with his performance. Walsh had not appeared in front of <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> eight years, and feared {{he would not be able}} to direct and act at the same time. However, two days into filming, his fears had disappeared.|$|E

Truman considers this, then states: [...] "You never had <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> my head!" [...] and [...] "In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night," [...] previously his unwitting catch-phrase, takes a bow, and leaves. Watching the show at home, Sylvia races to meet Truman, while Christof's supervisors end the show for the last time and the audience starts looking for something else to watch.|$|E

5000|$|Because these body {{cameras are}} turned on for every {{encounter}} with the public, privacy issues have been brought up with specific emphasis on special victim cases such as rape or domestic violence. Police worry that with <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> right <b>in</b> front of the victim, they will not feel comfortable in revealing {{all the information that}} they know. [...] There have been two case studies done in the United States that have revealed that police officers who have cameras have less encounters with citizens as officers who do not have <b>a</b> <b>cameras,</b> <b>in</b> fear of being reprimanded for committing a mistake.|$|R
