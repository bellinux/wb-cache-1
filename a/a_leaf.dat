5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to <b>a</b> <b>leaf</b> {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched {{but in the case of}} Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to <b>a</b> <b>leaf,</b> instead the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.|$|E
5|$|For moulting, all Portias spin a {{horizontal}} web whose diameter is {{about twice the}} spider's body length and is suspended only 1 to 4millimetres below <b>a</b> <b>leaf.</b> The spider lies head down, and often slides down 20 to 30millimetres during moulting. Portias spin a similar temporary web for resting.|$|E

5|$|The most {{commonly}} eaten portion is the napiform taproot, although the entire plant is edible and the tops {{can be used}} as <b>a</b> <b>leaf</b> vegetable. The seed can also be sprouted and eaten raw in a similar way to a mung bean.|$|E
5|$|A female may lay {{from several}} dozen to several {{thousand}} eggs during her lifetime, {{depending on the}} extent of parental care. This ranges from the simple laying of eggs under <b>a</b> <b>leaf,</b> to the parental care provided by scarab beetles, which house, feed and protect their young. The Attelabidae roll leaves and lay their eggs inside the roll for protection.|$|E

5|$|In 1921 Walter Long of Gillingham, Dorset {{objected to}} the giant's nudity and {{conducted}} a campaign to either convert it to a simple nude, or to cover its supposed obscenity with <b>a</b> <b>leaf.</b> Long's protest gained some support, including that of two bishops, and eventually reached the Home Office. The Home Office considered the protest to be in humour, though the chief constable responded to say the office could not act against a protected scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{refused to}} answer further {{questions}} about the Fund, and attention turned to Stevenson's fund, especially as its details became clear. Governor Stevenson's fund, which proved to total $146,000, had been used for such expenditures as Christmas gifts to reporters, dues for private clubs, and to hire an orchestra for a dance his son was hosting. Taking <b>a</b> <b>leaf</b> from Nixon's book, the Democrats {{refused to answer}} questions about the governor's fund. Both parties were eager to bury the matter, and the story died.|$|E

5|$|Other fungi {{affect the}} {{remainder}} of the plant. Another Botrytis fungus, Botrytis polyblastis (Sclerotinia polyblastis) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry. Ramularia vallisumbrosae is <b>a</b> <b>leaf</b> spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease. Peyronellaea curtisii, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves as does its synanamorph, Phoma narcissi (leaf tip blight). Aecidium narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to <b>a</b> <b>leaf</b> spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, Apple sent a {{cease and desist}} {{letter to}} the Victoria School of Business and Technology in Saanich, British Columbia, {{claiming}} the school's logo infringed Apple's trademark rights and that the school's logo falsely suggested Apple had authorized the school's activities. The logo in question featured the outline of an apple and <b>a</b> <b>leaf,</b> although the design incorporated a mountain, had three bumps {{on top of the}} apple instead of the two used by Apple, and had no bite out of the apple, unlike Apple's logo. In April 2011, the school reported it had settled its 3-year dispute with Apple, was launching a new logo under a new name, Q College, and was expanding its operations. The settlement's full terms were undisclosed.|$|E

5|$|On February 2, 2010, Phaneuf {{made his}} Toronto Maple Leaf debut, leading all Maple Leafs players in time on ice and ended {{the night with}} a fight and given second star of the game honours. He would record his first point, an assist, four nights later {{in a game against}} the Ottawa Senators and scored his first goal as <b>a</b> <b>Leaf</b> on April 7, 2010, on Henrik Lundqvist of the New York Rangers. Phaneuf was named an {{alternate}} captain in Toronto nine games after being acquired after Mike Komisarek suffered a season-ending injury. While Phaneuf struggled offensively to begin his tenure in Toronto – he played 25 games in Toronto before scoring his first goal – then-Leafs Head Coach Ron Wilson credited him with creating a positive change in the mood in the Toronto dressing room.|$|E
5|$|On November 21, 2014, Booth {{was sent}} {{down to the}} Toronto Marlies of the AHL for a {{conditioning}} stint. He would finish with one goal in his two-game tour with the Marlies. On November 29, Booth played his first game as a Maple Leaf in a 6–2 win over the Washington Capitals. Booth recorded no points but enjoyed his first game in Toronto. However, Booth would record his first point as <b>a</b> <b>Leaf</b> three games later, an assist on a goal scored by line-mate Richard Pánik in a 5–2 victory over his former team, the Canucks. His first goal as a Maple Leaf would come on December 16, where he scored the game winner in a 6–2 victory over the Anaheim Ducks. Booth would finish the season with 13 points (7 goals, 6 assists) in 59 games.|$|E

5|$|The beak of the kakapo {{is adapted}} for {{grinding}} food finely. For this reason, the kakapo {{has a very}} small gizzard compared to other birds of their size. It is generally herbivorous, eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as kakapo food. It is particularly fond of {{the fruit of the}} rimu tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The kakapo has a distinctive habit of grabbing <b>a</b> <b>leaf</b> or frond with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. These little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird. The kakapo is believed to employ bacteria in the fore-gut to ferment and help digest plant matter.|$|E
5|$|The {{greens are}} edible as <b>a</b> <b>leaf</b> vegetable, but are rarely eaten by humans; some sources {{suggest that the}} greens contain toxic alkaloids. When used for this purpose, they are {{harvested}} young in high-density plantings, before significant root development, and typically used stir-fried, or in salads. Some people are allergic to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots. Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} size of the egg mass is {{characteristic}} of the species. Ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas bufonids produce long, cylindrical strings. The tiny yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (Eleutherodactylus limbatus) lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil. The smoky jungle frog (Leptodactylus pentadactylus) makes a nest of foam in a hollow. The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur. The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) deposits its eggs on <b>a</b> <b>leaf</b> above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below. The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten. In general, the length of the egg stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions. Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by the developing larvae.|$|E
50|$|Two basic {{forms of}} leaves can be {{described}} considering the way the blade (lamina) is divided. <b>A</b> simple <b>leaf</b> has <b>an</b> undivided blade. However, the leaf may be dissected to form lobes, but the gaps between lobes do not reach to the main vein. <b>A</b> compound <b>leaf</b> has <b>a</b> fully subdivided blade, each leaflet of the blade being separated along a main or secondary vein. The leaflets may have petiolules and stipels, the equivalents of the petioles and stipules of leaves. Because each leaflet can appear to be <b>a</b> simple <b>leaf,</b> {{it is important to}} recognize where the petiole occurs to identify <b>a</b> compound <b>leaf.</b> Compound leaves are a characteristic of some families of higher plants, such as the Fabaceae. The middle vein of <b>a</b> compound <b>leaf</b> or <b>a</b> frond, when it is present, is called a rachis.|$|R
