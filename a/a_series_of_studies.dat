5|$|Beginning in 1914, Harlow Shapley began <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> of {{globular}} clusters, {{published in}} about 40 scientific papers. He examined the RR Lyrae {{variables in the}} clusters (which he assumed were Cepheid variables) and used their period–luminosity relationship for distance estimates. Later, {{it was found that}} RR Lyrae variables are fainter than Cepheid variables, which caused Shapley to overestimate the distances of the clusters.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s it was {{recognized}} that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The American Medical Association conducted <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> in 1948, {{followed by a}} Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had {{a negative effect on}} patients and their families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E
5|$|During the project's {{development}} phase, the siting {{and size}} of the Nike-X bases became a major complaint of smaller cities. Originally intended to protect only the largest urban areas, Nike-X was designed to be built at a very large size with many missiles controlled by an expensive computer and radar network. Smaller sites were to be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept since the system was simply too expensive to build with only a few interceptors. These cities complained that they were not only being left open to attack, but that their lack of defenses might make them primary targets. This led to <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> on the Small City Defense (SCD) concept. By 1964 SCD had become part of the baseline Nike-X deployment plans, with every major city being provided some level of defensive system.|$|E

The amendment was passed; however, the financial industry lobbied to have Franken's amendment removed from the final bill.

5|$|The {{history of}} the RS-25 traces back to the 1960s when NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and Rocketdyne were {{conducting}} <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> on high-pressure engines, developed from the successful J-2 engine used on the S-II and S-IVB upper stages of the Saturn V rocket during the Apollo program. The studies were conducted under a program to upgrade the Saturn V engines, which produced a design for a 350,000lbf upper-stage engine known as the HG-3. As funding levels for Apollo wound down the HG-3 was cancelled {{as well as the}} upgraded F-1 engines already being tested. It was the design for the HG-3 that would form the basis for the RS-25.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of ctenophores {{to the rest}} of Metazoa is very important {{to our understanding of the}} early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animals. <b>A</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera and Placozoa) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal taxon instead. As such, the Ctenophora appear to be a basal diploblast clade. In agreement with the latter point, the analysis of a very large sequence alignment at the metazoan taxonomic scale (1,719 proteins totalizing ca. 400,000 amino acid positions) showed that ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals. Another study strongly rejects the hypothesis that sponges are the sister group to all other extant animals and establishes the placement of Ctenophora as the sister group to all other animals, and disagreement with the last-mentioned paper is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of stout whiting as a major east coast fishery, a number of detailed studies have been undertaken to determine the reproductive and growth characteristics of the species in southern Queensland, while <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> in southern Western Australia have focused on the diet and movements of the species in relation to the ecology of coexisting sillaginids. Like most smelt-whitings, the stout whiting is a schooling species, occasionally associating with S. vitttata, S. burrus and S. bassensis in southern Western Australia and with S. flindersi in southern Queensland. The species is thought to form large schools mostly at dawn and dusk.|$|E
