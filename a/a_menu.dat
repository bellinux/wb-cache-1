5|$|Aarhus {{has a large}} {{variety of}} {{restaurants}} and eateries offering food from cultures all over the world, especially Mediterranean and Asian, but also international gourmet cuisine, traditional Danish food and New Nordic Cuisine. Among the oldest restaurants are Rådhuscafeen (lit. The City Hall Café), opened in 1924, serving <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> of traditional Danish meals, and Peter Gift from 1906, a tavern with a broad beer selection and <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> of smørrebrød and other Danish dishes. In Aarhus, New Nordic can be experienced at Kähler Villa Dining, Hærværk and Domestic, but local produce can be had at many places, especially at the twice-weekly food markets in Frederiksbjerg. Arhus and the Central Denmark Region was selected as European Region of Gastronomy in 2017.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2013 Portland Monthly profile, Mary's Club {{has a full}} {{cocktail}} bar, {{more than}} two dozen varieties of beer and wine, and <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> featuring Mexican cuisine. The club has a one-drink minimum and a small cover charge on Friday and Saturday evenings.|$|E
5|$|One of Grant's photos {{was blown}} {{up to eight}} feet and {{displayed}} for one year in Grand Central Terminal in New York City. He also photographed the culinary creations {{of some of the}} top chefs in Dallas, who all knew Grant and respected his work. <b>A</b> <b>menu</b> item at the Casa Dominguez restaurant in Dallas was named for Grant.|$|E
5000|$|In {{computer}} interface design, <b>a</b> pie <b>menu</b> (also {{known as}} <b>a</b> radial <b>menu)</b> is <b>a</b> circular context <b>menu</b> where selection depends on direction. It is a graphical control element. <b>A</b> pie <b>menu</b> {{is made of}} several [...] "pie slices" [...] around an inactive center and works best with stylus input, and well with a mouse. Pie slices are drawn {{with a hole in}} the middle for an easy way to exit the menu.|$|R

50|$|The {{alternative}} to using {{and having to}} know the transaction codes {{is to set up}} <b>a</b> favorites <b>menu</b> which is <b>a</b> customized <b>menu</b> established by the user. The favorites menu can be structured by the user to coincide with procedural usage of the SAP software. For example, if the user is an Accounts Payable officer <b>a</b> customized <b>menu</b> of accounts payable functions could be created to enhance SAP use.|$|R
5|$|Red and Blue {{are played}} in a third-person view, {{overhead}} perspective and consist of three basic screens: an overworld, in which the player navigates the main character; a side-view battle screen; and <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> interface, in which the player configures his or her Pokémon, items, or gameplay settings.|$|E
5|$|The Baguette {{sandwiches}} {{failed to}} catch on in the American market, {{and as a result}} they were discontinued as part of <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> reorganization. In 2005, they were replaced by the TenderGrill sandwich. The new sandwich was one of several products that were designed to appeal to a group of customers Burger King identified as adult males, 24–36 years old that desired a larger, meatier product.|$|E
5|$|The {{product was}} renamed King Supreme in 2001 {{when it was}} {{slightly}} reformulated as part of <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> restructuring {{during a period of}} corporate decline. A later restructuring eliminated the King Supreme in favor of its new BK Stacker line of sandwiches. When the Stacker line was discontinued in the United States shortly after, the Big King returned in November 2013 as a permanent product.|$|E

50|$|Next up was Browns Columbia Room, a 10-seat {{cocktail}} {{haven in}} the back of The Passenger which opened in March 2010. Also without <b>a</b> cocktail <b>menu,</b> Columbia Room focuses on <b>a</b> tasting <b>menu</b> that combines seasonal ingredients, classic cocktails, and a razor-sharp attention to craftsmanship.|$|R
5|$|As {{with all}} major fast food vendors, BK has <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> that {{specifically}} targets children. The company introduced its child-oriented product line in North America {{during the summer}} of 1990 with an advertising program called the Burger King Kid's Club. In the United States, the meal is called the Kids Club Meal and it is primarily positioned against the popular Happy Meal from McDonald's. The meal includes an entrée, a side order, beverage, and a toy. The toy is usually a product tie-in with a movie or popular television show. The entrée and side offerings differ from market to market, as does portion size.|$|E
5|$|Between every down, {{the player}} selects a formation, play and, on defense, {{coverage}} shell from <b>a</b> <b>menu.</b> The game contains fifty-five offensive plays and seventy-one defensive plays, such as screen and play-action passes, blitzes and man-to-man defense. During a down, the player may control one team member {{at a time}} or allow the entire team to execute a play automatically. On offense, depending on the play, the player controls the quarterback, running back or kicker. After a pass, control automatically changes to the ball receiver. On defense, the player may at any time switch control between any members of the team. Instant replay is available to review plays.|$|E
5|$|Fight Club was {{released}} in the Blu-ray Disc format in the United States on November17, 2009. Fox Creative chose Neuron Syndicate to design the art for the format's packaging, and Neuron commissioned five graffiti artists to create 30 pieces of art. The art encompasses urban aesthetics found on the East Coast and West Coast of the United States as well as influences from European street art. The Blu-ray edition opens with <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> screen for the romantic comedy Never Been Kissed starring Drew Barrymore before leading into the actual Fight Club menu screen. David Fincher got permission from Barrymore to include the fake menu screen.|$|E
5000|$|With {{multiple}} document interfaces (and also tabbed document interfaces), <b>a</b> single <b>menu</b> bar and/or toolbar {{is shared}} between all child windows, reducing clutter and increasing {{efficient use of}} screen space. This argument is less relevant on an operating system which uses <b>a</b> common <b>menu</b> bar.|$|R
50|$|Multi-SIM allows {{switching}} among (up to) 12 stored {{numbers from}} the phone's main <b>menu.</b> <b>A</b> new <b>menu</b> entry in subscriber’s phone automatically appears after inserting the multi-SIM card into the cell phone.|$|R
50|$|CKE's {{policy has}} been to add Green Burrito dual-branding to many of their Carl's Jr. {{hamburger}} restaurants, thereby adding <b>a</b> Mexican <b>menu.</b> <b>As</b> of 2008, there were 300 co-branded Green Burrito/Carl's Jr. restaurants.|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy {{has four}} basic game modes: an overworld map, town and dungeon maps, a battle screen, and <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> screen. The overworld map is a {{scaled-down}} {{version of the}} game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. The primary means of travel across the overworld is by foot; a canoe, a ship, and an airship become available as the player progresses. With the exception of some battles in preset locations or with bosses, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld map when traveling by foot, canoe, or ship, and must either be fought or fled from.|$|E
5|$|Like in {{the first}} game, Sora can summon a Disney {{character}} to aid him in battle. Summons will replace the two computer-controlled characters and fight alongside Sora {{for as long as}} the Drive Gauge allows, or until Sora's HP runs out. Instead of being limited to only one action, Summons now have <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> of their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora. These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button. The Summon ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.|$|E
5|$|Like most European {{restaurant}}s, La Caravelle had <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> {{that changed}} daily. This made the restaurant popular with new customers and also {{brought them back}} regularly. Salvador Dalí, John Lindsay, Leland Hayward and Dorothy Kilgallen often dined at the restaurant in its early years. The journalist and broadcaster Walter Cronkite was a regular visitor to La Caravelle and enjoyed eating pike quenelles in lobster cream sauce. Other frequent visitors included the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Marlene Dietrich.|$|E
50|$|SECEDIT USERID {{was also}} used to confine a user's {{operational}} authority to <b>a</b> specific <b>menu.</b> By entering <b>a</b> Y for Mandatory <b>Menu</b> and specifying <b>a</b> default sign-on <b>menu,</b> the security officer could prevent the user from any program access not found on that sign-on <b>menu.</b> <b>A</b> user so confined could only run menu options, send messages, and sign off the system.|$|R
50|$|Included in the Beagle Bag {{collection}} is Beagle <b>Menu,</b> <b>a</b> configurable disk <b>menu</b> program that offers one-key access to select files.|$|R
5000|$|The UK now {{has their}} own value <b>menu</b> range where <b>a</b> 6 inch sub (from <b>a</b> limited <b>menu)</b> and <b>a</b> drink costs £3 called a [...] "Subway Lunch" [...] (just under $5, inc taxes) or a footlong as a lunch (again, from <b>a</b> limited <b>menu)</b> will also cost just £5.|$|R
5|$|Revelation {{features}} several gameplay enhancements {{that aid}} puzzle solving and plot progression. Early in the game, players receive a camera, {{which can be}} used to take screenshots or pictures of clues. Players can use an on-screen journal to jot down notes instead of having to write down clues as with previous Myst games. Much of the game's story is revealed via flashbacks triggered by an amulet that has the power to relay memories attached to objects. Zip mode, the amulet, the camera, and the journal are available via <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> {{on the bottom of the}} game screen.|$|E
5|$|System 6's Apple menu {{cannot be}} used to launch {{application}}s. The current application icon in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar cycles between open applications; it is not <b>a</b> <b>menu.</b> System 6 supports 24bits of addressable random access memory (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with no provision for virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has a hard drive capacity limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a drive. This limitation was not increased until System 7.5 which first increased the limit to 4GB.|$|E
5|$|The BK Whopper Bar {{is limited}} service concept created by Burger King in 2009. Whopper Bars are smaller footprint, {{specialized}} stores with <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> {{limited to the}} company's Whopper, crispy chicken sandwich and grilled chicken sandwich sandwiches; drinks; and desserts. The menu features higher-end ingredients and variants not sold in the normal Burger King locations. The concept {{is similar to the}} McCafe concept from rival McDonald's, and like the McCafe locations they are designed to go into airports, casinos, and other areas with limited amounts of space.|$|E

5|$|The Dime Store {{opened in}} the early summer of 2014 (June–July), with a grand opening on June 16. It began {{operating}} with <b>a</b> limited <b>menu</b> during the hours of 7am to 3pm; hours were later extended to 6pm. The restaurant's weekend brunch launched in July, offering <b>a</b> larger <b>menu</b> from 9am to 3pm.|$|R
50|$|Fridays has <b>a</b> large <b>menu</b> with <b>an</b> {{emphasis}} on alcoholic beverages.|$|R
5|$|The {{character}} that the player controlled would change as they progressed through the game. The creators sought {{to have the}} player control Spock {{during one of the}} Vulcan's mind melds. The ending of the game would have seen the player control Kirk, Spock and Chekov in an attempt to stop the titular superweapon. The interface for the game revolved around <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> which appears after the mouse button is held down while the cursor is hovering over an object. This was to prevent the need for controls to be shown on screen at all times, {{in a manner similar to}} LucasArts games of that period.|$|E
5|$|The new {{keyboard}} did {{not include}} the BASIC keyword markings that were found on earlier Spectrums, except for the keywords LOAD, CODE and RUN which were useful for loading software. This was not a major issue, as the +2 boasted <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> system, almost identical to the ZX Spectrum 128, where one could switch between 48K BASIC programming with the keywords, and 128K BASIC programming in which all words (keywords and otherwise) must be typed out in full (although the keywords are still stored internally as one character each). Despite these changes, the layout remained identical to that of the 128.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} restructuring, 3G {{also moved}} to change many aspects of {{corporate}} operations throughout 2011-2012. One of the first moves was to terminate Burger King's relationship with ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky, replacing it with McGarryBowen. 3G also began <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> restructuring, with the first product being a revamped version of BK's Chicken Tenders product. Other new or reformulated products would follow. In terms of its franchise operations, Burger King initiated a move to become more like competitors Subway and KFC and began to sell off the majority of corporately owned restaurants {{in order to become}} an exclusive franchised operation. 3G also moved to mend relations with its American franchises, which had become rather rancorous during TPG's tenure. Several lawsuits were settled and corporate policies that were {{at the center of the}} corporate disputes with the franchises were ended or amended.|$|E
