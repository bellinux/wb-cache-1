In this paper, a " binoisy " single-user multiple-input multiple-output (SU-MIMO) relation is considered where the additional distortions are modeled via an additive noise term at the transmit side. Through this extended SU-MIMO channel model, the effects of transceiver hardware impairments on the achievable rate of multi-antenna point-to-point systems are studied. Channel input distributions encompassing practical discrete modulation schemes, such as, QAM and PSK, as well as Gaussian signaling are covered. In addition, the impact of mismatched detection and decoding when the receiver has insufficient information about the non-idealities is investigated. The numerical results show that for realistic system parameters, the effects of transmit-side noise and mismatched decoding become significant only at high modulation orders.

40|$|Radar can be {{utilized}} {{to detect the}} mechanical heart activity and is a potential alternative to today’s heartbeat monitoring techniques in medicine. It can detect details of the heart activity, such as filling and ejection of heart chambers and opening and closing of heart valves. This {{is due to the}} radars ability to detect movements and direction of motion. Compared to electrocardiogram and ultrasound it has the advantage that it is a contactless measurement. The objective of this thesis is the development of a proof-of-concept prototype of a novel microwave on-body sensor for heartbeat detection, which can be used inside an MRI system and which could provide prospective triggering information. The main idea is to use a microwave sensor (reflectometer) with an on-body antenna illuminating the heart and detecting the reflected signal. The measurement is based on the evaluation of the heart-related time-dependent reflection coefficient of the antenna, by minimizing the static and respiration-related components of the reflection coefficient. In a first step, this is done by minimizing the <b>antenna</b> <b>mismatch</b> with an automatic impedance matching circuit after the placement of the antenna on the chest of an individual; the <b>antenna</b> <b>mismatch</b> is dependent on the position and the individual body properties. In a second step the residual static and slow variation signal from respiration is suppressed by a canceller circuit (well-known from CW radar technology as reflected power canceller). With the reflectometer sensor system consisting of a CW signal generator (transmitter, Tx), on-body antenna, adaptive impedance matching circuit and demodulator circuit as part of the reflected signal canceller, the performance of each component influences the performance of the sensor system. Thus, the thesis concentrates on the design of the circuits and the antenna but also investigates the wave propagation scenario of the sensor applied to a human chest.

40|$|Frequency {{division}} duplex (FDD) cellular standards, like WCDMA and LTE, {{require the}} simultaneous {{operation of the}} transmitter and receiver while sharing the same antenna. A duplexer, currently implemented as two highly selective off-chip SAW filters separates the transmit and receive signals. A high isolation is required to avoid saturating the receiver and keep its noise and linearity requirements feasible. The need for high-Q resonators to implement these filters prohibits duplexer integration in a CMOS process. For each band of a modern multi-band transceiver, an off-chip duplexer is required. With over forty bands currently envisioned for mobile applications, the system cost and complexity rises significantly. Replacing the bank of off-chip duplexers with a single integrated tunable duplexer would enable a fully integrated and reconfigurable multiband transceiver. In this dissertation, the performance of hybrid transformer based integrated duplexer was significantly improved, making it suitable for reliable multiband operation. A hybrid transformer relies on electrical balance rather than frequency selectivity to achieve isolation, making duplexer integration in a CMOS process that lacks high-Q passives possible. Prior demonstrations of integrated hybrid transformer duplexers suffered from high insertion loss, poor common-mode isolation and isolation sensitivity to <b>antenna</b> <b>mismatch.</b> Novel solutions were reached in this research to solve most of these issues. Power recovery by using an RF-DC converter can effectively reduce the loss in the duplexer. A discrete prototype that achieves 60 % power recycling efficiency with constant input impedance over wide dynamic range was demonstrated. A differential implementation of the hybrid transformer allows for both high differential and common-mode isolation. Implemented in a 90 nm CMOS process, it maintains more than 60 dB of differential to common-mode isolation. And finally, an antenna impedance tracking loop was demonstrated to track any antenna impedance variation and maintain high isolation. Together with a novel high power balance network, that allows high isolation in both the transmit and receive bands, this 65 nm CMOS chip achieves an isolation of more than 50 dB in the transmit and receive bands, with an antenna VSWR within 2 : 1.
