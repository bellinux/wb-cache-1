25|$|The union {{continued}} its patient organizing campaign until January 23, 1937, when the BMT fired two union {{members at the}} Kent Avenue powerhouse plant in Brooklyn for union activity. The TWU at the time had no more than thirty-five members {{out of more than}} 500 workers there. Two days later, however, at 3:00p.m., the 498 employees there, <b>all</b> <b>wearing</b> TWU buttons, began a sitdown strike, seizing control of the plant until management reinstated the workers it had fired. Other BMT employees established a picket line outside the plant and defended it from the efforts of the police to retake it, while helping to supply the workers inside with food supplied by the Retail Clerks union.|$|E
25|$|In August 1810, Tecumseh and 400 armed warriors {{traveled}} {{down the}} Wabash River {{to meet with}} Harrison in Vincennes. The warriors were <b>all</b> <b>wearing</b> war paint, and their sudden appearance at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes. The leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland, where they met Harrison. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate; he asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh acknowledged to Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms, and that his confederation was rapidly growing. Harrison responded to Tecumseh that the Miami were {{the owners of the}} land and could sell it if they so chose. He also rejected Tecumseh's claim that all the Indians formed one nation, and each nation could have separate relations with the United States. As proof, Harrison told Tecumseh that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes to speak one language if they were to be one nation.|$|E

25|$|At 9:30 pm, Donohoe and Ryan {{entered the}} car park of the Lordship Credit Union {{premises}} and they parked, as did another {{car that was}} accompanying them from another credit union branch. They both parked beside the car belonging to officials from Lordship. At this point a navy-blue coloured Volkswagen Passat - that had been waiting stationary on the hard shoulder of the road - drove across the road and blocked the entrance. Four members of the gang were hiding behind a wall surrounding the car park, <b>all</b> <b>wearing</b> balaclavas, while a fifth was driving the car. Two gang members approached the detectives' car from the rear, and as Donohoe opened his door and stepped out to investigate why the car had blocked the entrance, he was instantly shot at close range {{in the back of}} the head with a long barrelled shotgun by a masked raider. A single shot was fired. It was dark, and before Ryan could realise what was taking place he was held at gunpoint and ordered out of his car and onto the ground by a number of gang members possessing a shotgun, handgun and a hammer. Neither officer had time to draw their weapons. The raiders then broke into a car belonging to credit union staff from Lordship, threatening them, which was carrying cash and cheques to the value of about €40,000, but only took a bag with €4,000, mistakenly leaving behind more than €30,000. Ryan and the credit union staff were left physically uninjured as the gang of five fled the scene, but Ryan was dispossessed of his car keys in an attempt to hinder his reaction. It was only after the perpetrators had escaped that the alarm could be raised.|$|E

500|$|The Hockey Sweater {{is based}} on a real {{experience}} Carrier had in 1946 in his home town of Sainte-Justine, Quebec. The story centres on the obsession he and his friends had with the Montreal Canadiens' organization and their star player, Maurice [...] "The Rocket" [...] Richard. He writes of how they emulated Richard's style and mannerisms, and on the ice: [...] "we were five Maurice Richards against five other Maurice Richards, throwing themselves on the puck. We were ten players <b>all</b> <b>wearing</b> the uniform of the Montréal Canadiens, all with the same burning enthusiasm. We all wore the famous number 9 on our backs." ...|$|E

For the awards ceremony on the twenty first, Houston and Carey wore matching white gowns, symbolizing [...] "humbleness and simplicity." [...] Houston entered the arena, performing her verse, followed by Carey.

The songs they played were very fast and very short; most clocked in at under two minutes. Around this time, a new music scene was emerging in New York centered on two clubs in downtown Manhattan—Max's Kansas City and, more famously, CBGB (usually referred to as CBGB's). The Ramones made their CBGB debut on August 16, 1974. Legs McNeil, who cofounded Punk magazine the following year, later described the impact of that performance: [...] "They were <b>all</b> <b>wearing</b> these black leather jackets. And they counted off this song... and it was just this wall of noise... They looked so striking. These guys were not hippies. This was something completely new." ...|$|E

Mordvinov recalled that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse by Anastasia, her mother and her sisters.
