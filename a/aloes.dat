5|$|Since {{classical}} {{times and}} possibly much earlier, hundreds of {{species of plants}} have provided drugs to treat {{a wide range of}} conditions. Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, written by 70 AD, listed some 600 medicinal plants and around 1000 drugs made from them, including substances known to be effective such as aconite, <b>aloes,</b> colocynth, colchicum, henbane, opium and squill. The book remained a standard reference for nearly two thousand years, and was the basis of the European pharmacopoeia {{until the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E

The larger seeds of cereals, wild grasses, and other small plants are preferred, with wheat and khakiweed (Alternanthera caracasana) being favourites. Buds and soft fruits are also taken, causing considerable damage to agriculture. Insects are eaten, and nestlings seem to be fed exclusively on caterpillars.

5|$|The main factor which boosted {{industry}} and trade under the Ayyubids {{was the new}} interests Europeans developed when they {{came into contact with}} the Muslims. Commodities included incense, scents, fragrant oils, and aromatic plants from Arabia and India, as well as ginger, alum, and <b>aloes.</b> Likewise, Europeans developed new tastes in the matter of fashions, clothing, and home furnishing. Rugs, carpets, and tapestries manufactured in the Middle East and Central Asia were introduced to the West through Crusader-Ayyubid interaction. Christian pilgrims visiting Jerusalem returned with Arab reliquaries for the keeping of relics. In addition, eastern works of art in glass, pottery, gold, silver, etc., were highly prized in Europe.|$|E

Also important in ancient times were Socotra's various endemic <b>aloes,</b> used medicinally, and for cosmetics.

40|$|The {{structure}} of liquid alumina at a temperature ∼ 2400 K near its melting point {{was measured using}} neutron and high-energy x-ray diffraction by employing containerless aerodynamic-levitation and laser-heating techniques. The measured diffraction patterns were compared to those calculated from molecular dynamics simulations {{using a variety of}} pair potentials, and the model found to be in best agreement with experiments was refined using the reverse Monte Carlo method. The resultant model shows that the melt is composed predominantly of <b>AlO</b> and <b>AlO</b> units, in the approximate ratio of 2 : 1, with only minor fractions of <b>AlO</b> and <b>AlO</b> units. The majority of Al-O-Al connections involve corner-sharing polyhedra (83 %), although a significant minority involve edge-sharing polyhedra (16 %), predominantly between <b>AlO</b> and either <b>AlO</b> or <b>AlO</b> units. Most of the oxygen atoms (81 %) are shared among three or more polyhedra, and the majority of these oxygen atoms are triply shared among one or two <b>AlO</b> units and two or one <b>AlO</b> units, consistent with the abundance of these polyhedra in the melt and their fairly uniform spatial distribution...|$|R

25|$|From 1870 {{there was}} a steady decline in {{fertility}} in England, linked not to {{a rise in the}} use of artificial contraception but to more traditional methods such as withdrawal and abstinence. This was linked to changes in the perception of the relative costs of childrearing. Of course, women did find themselves with unwanted pregnancies. Abortifacients were discreetly advertised and {{there was a}} considerable body of folklore about methods of inducing miscarriages. Amongst working-class women violent purgatives were popular, pennyroyal, <b>aloes</b> and turpentine were all used. Other methods to induce miscarriage were very hot baths and gin, extreme exertion, a controlled fall down a flight of stairs, or veterinary medicines. So-called 'backstreet' abortionists were fairly common, although their bloody efforts could be fatal. Estimates of the number of illegal abortions performed in England varied widely: by one estimate, 100,000 women made efforts to procure a miscarriage in 1914, usually by drugs.|$|E

25|$|Aloeae is a {{tribe of}} {{succulent}} {{plants in the}} subfamily Asphodeloideae of the family Asphodelaceae, consisting of the <b>aloes</b> and their close relatives. The taxon may also be treated as the subfamily Alooideae by those botanists who retain the narrower circumscription of Asphodelaceae adopted prior to the APG III system. Typically, plants have rosettes of more or less succulent leaves, {{with or without a}} distinct stem. Their flowers are arranged in racemes and tend to be either small and pale, pollinated by insects, or larger and more brightly coloured, pollinated by birds. , 11 genera are recognized, most created since 2010 by splitting off another five genera from Aloe and another two from Haworthia. Only two genera, Aloe and Aloidendron, are native outside southern Africa, extending northwards to the Arabian Peninsula. Seven genera are restricted to South Africa, some with small ranges. Members of the Aloeae are cultivated by succulent plant enthusiasts; Aloe species especially are used in temperate climates as ornamental garden plants. Some species are used in traditional medicine. Aloe vera and Aloe ferox are cultivated for their extracts, whose uses include moisturizers and emollients in cosmetics.|$|E

The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the syndrome are still unknown. <b>ALO</b> {{has been reported in}} patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) after subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS), suggesting a possible involvement of the basal ganglia. We aimed to assess the effects of varying STN stimulation voltage on <b>ALO</b> in PD patients. Seven out of 14 PD patients with bilateral STN stimulation consecutively seen in our centre presented with <b>ALO.</b> We progressively increased voltage on each STN, using either 130 Hz (high-frequency stimulation, HFS) or 2 or 3 Hz (low-frequency stimulation, LFS). In five patients, HFS induced <b>ALO</b> time-locked to stimulation in 7 out of 10 STNs at a voltage higher than that used for chronic stimulation. LFS induced myoclonus in the pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle (pOOm) with a rhythm synchronous to the frequency. In the other two patients with <b>ALO</b> already present {{at the time of the}} study, HFS improved <b>ALO</b> in 3 out of 4 STNs. <b>ALO</b> recurred within minutes of stimulation arrest. Our findings show that STN-DBS can have opposite effects on <b>ALO.</b> On the one hand, <b>ALO</b> is thought to be a corticobulbar side effect due to lateral current spreading from the STN, in which case it is necessary to use voltages below the ALO-inducing threshold. On the other hand, <b>ALO</b> may be considered a form of off-phase focal dystonia possibly improved by increasing the stimulation voltages...|$|R
