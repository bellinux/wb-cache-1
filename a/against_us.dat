5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement <b>against</b> <b>U.S.</b> expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E
5|$|Carney was {{appointed}} U.S. Ambassador to Sudan on 27 June 1995 {{during a period}} of turmoil in U.S.-Sudan relations. Osama bin Laden had fled Saudi Arabia for the safe confines of Khartoum a few years earlier, and Sudan's alleged harboring and abetting of Muslim extremists on its soil was attracting attention of counterterrorism experts in the United States and abroad. Carney's tenure as ambassador followed a tumultuous period during which his predecessor, Donald K. Petterson, had been forced to draw down embassy staff by half and send their families back to America when terrorist threats were made <b>against</b> <b>U.S.</b> diplomats stationed in Khartoum.|$|E

5|$|He fell badly out {{of shape}} before the 1993–94 season and was told by manager Dino Zoff to lose two stone (13kg) {{by the start of}} the {{campaign}} else he would lose his first team place. Gascoigne went on an extreme weight loss diet and succeeded in shedding the excess fat. He kept his place in the team and captained the club <b>against</b> <b>US</b> Cremonese when regular captain Roberto Cravero was substituted. However, in April he broke his leg in training whilst attempting to tackle Alessandro Nesta.

Early protests on campus led to firebombing and window-breaking, but Corbally's decision to cancel classes and allow the students to protest without police or administration interference arguably resulted in more moderate protests than at other colleges.|$|E
5|$|Stanley gained {{national}} notoriety for {{his actions}} <b>against</b> <b>U.S.</b> Steel. In 1909, he introduced a resolution calling for {{an investigation of the}} company, but it died in the House Rules Committee. A second resolution, introduced in June 1910, passed the House, but was ignored by President William Howard Taft. Stanley introduced a stronger resolution later that month, but it was killed in committee. After Republicans lost control of the house in the 1910 congressional elections, Stanley reintroduced his resolution. House Speaker Champ Clark appointed him as chairman of a nine-member committee to investigate U.S. Steel.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Navy used five Ko-hyoteki-class midget {{submarines}} in {{an unsuccessful}} operation <b>against</b> <b>US</b> battleships during {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor.

Therefore, on 16 December 1941, the navy initiated plans for a second midget submarine operation.|$|E

Japanese forces used the area to regroup from attacks <b>against</b> <b>U.S.</b> forces on the island, to launch further attacks on the U.S. defenses that guarded the Allied airfield (called Henderson Field) located at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal, as a base to defend against Allied attacks directed at Japanese troop and supply encampments between Point Cruz and Cape Esperance on western Guadalcanal, and as a location for watching and reporting on Allied activity around Henderson Field.|$|E
5|$|The Philippine–American War was {{an armed}} {{military}} {{conflict between the}} United States and the First Philippine Republic, fought between 1899 and least 1902, which arose from a Filipino political struggle <b>against</b> <b>U.S.</b> occupation of the Philippines. Although the conflict was officially declared over on July 4, 1902, American troops continued hostilities against remnants of the Philippine Army and other resistance groups until 1913, and some historians consider these unofficial extensions part of the war.|$|E
5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement <b>against</b> <b>U.S.</b> expansion {{had been growing}} around the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet) that became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes {{that they would be}} protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the whites. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to only pay white traders half of what they owed, and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns. In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E

5|$|Born to an Aymara {{family of}} {{subsistence}} farmers in Isallawi, Orinoca Canton, Morales undertook a basic education before mandatory military service, in 1978 moving to Chapare Province. Growing coca {{and becoming a}} trade unionist, he rose to prominence in the campesino ("rural laborers") union. In that capacity he campaigned <b>against</b> <b>U.S.</b> and Bolivian attempts to eradicate coca {{as part of the}} War on Drugs, denouncing these as an imperialist violation of indigenous Andean culture. His involvement in anti-government direct action protests resulted in multiple arrests. Morales entered electoral politics in 1995, became the leader of the MAS and was elected to Congress. His campaign focused on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and the redistribution of gas wealth. He gained increased visibility through the Cochabamba protests and gas conflict. In 2002 he was expelled from Congress for encouraging protesters, although he came second in that year's presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, the Sudanese government allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity <b>against</b> <b>U.S.</b> interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, on 7 August 1942, US forces {{carried out}} an amphibious landing on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, which caught the Japanese by surprise. To counter this, a large naval force was dispatched, {{as well as}} part of the 41st Infantry Regiment, which had been {{intended}} to join Horii's force but was diverted, as Japanese attention and resources turned towards the fighting <b>against</b> <b>US</b> forces in the Solomons. The engagements around Kokoda and the US landing at Guadalcanal caused General Harukichi Hyakutake, 17th Army commander in Rabaul, to re-consider the drive on Port Moresby. It was realised that more supplies would be needed and an amphibious landing around Milne Bay was planned for late August. By 16 August, the decision to capture Port Moresby was postponed until Milne Bay was captured and the situation on Guadalcanal was resolved. Consequently, on 28 August Horii's South Sea Detachment was ordered to position itself at a suitable location south of the Owen Stanleys to capture Port Moresby once the strategic situation elsewhere had been resolved in Japan's favour.|$|E
