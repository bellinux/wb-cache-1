5|$|Following his retirement, Mosienko and Joe Cooper {{operated}} {{a string of}} bowling <b>alleys</b> in Winnipeg, one of which continues to be operated by his family. He was a supporter of Winnipeg minor hockey and Manitoba oldtimers associations. There is an arena named in Mosienko's honor {{in his hometown of}} Winnipeg.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{was an avid}} bowler, and he {{competed in}} ten-pin bowling events sanctioned by the American Bowling Congress. He bowled against {{professional}} Hank Marino in 1931, though he lost. Scott also owned bowling <b>alleys</b> in Fort Wayne. He wrote a childrenâ€™s book, called Third Base Thatcher, that was published in 1928.|$|E

5|$|The {{sides of}} the {{building}} were faced with plain brick, and flanked by narrow <b>alleys</b> with iron gates at each entrance.

5|$|In 2002, the University of Dayton {{released}} a Master Plan {{which called for}} the renovation and construction of several houses, an extension to Stonemill Road to connect directly to Evanston Avenue, and the enlargement and clean-up of the parking areas in the <b>alleys</b> behind the houses. Despite ongoing rumors, there were no plans to raze the Ghetto {{and replace it with}} more high-density housing and other university buildings, despite the landlocked nature of the campus.|$|E
5|$|This {{plan was}} not {{followed}} in the reconstruction. Although half-timbered houses were banned at first, the ban was lifted in 1731 as brick houses were considerably more expensive. Medieval Copenhagen, however, had changed permanently when the reconstruction was complete by 1737. Streets and <b>alleys</b> no longer followed the original paths and some even ceased to exist.|$|E

5|$|After {{retiring}} from football, Lavelli ran an appliance business on Cleveland's west side.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Brussels was still in many ways a medieval city. The royal quarter in the upper town, inhabited mainly by the nobility and the richer members of the bourgeoisie, was upscale and modern. The rest of the city, however, in particular the lower town, located in the western half of the Pentagon, was densely populated and industrial, characterized by an illogical street layout, back <b>alleys,</b> narrow streets, and numerous dead ends.|$|E
5|$|Bowling as a {{participation}} sport {{flourished in}} the early 1960s, but its popularity was diluted due to overbuilding; the number of bowling <b>alleys</b> sanctioned by the then-American Bowling Congress peaked at about 11,000 by mid-decade, and Kona was {{one of more than}} 30 in southern California alone. A decline in league bowling starting in the 1980s was also blamed for the downturn, but an AMF Bowling official argued that the customer base remained steady because an increase in open bowling made up for fewer league bowlers.|$|E

40|$|The {{profitabilities}} {{of three}} land use {{systems in the}} humid zone of southwest Nigeria are compared using a capital budgeting procedure combining on-station and on-farm experimental data. The systems are: non-alley farming with fallow; <b>alley</b> farming with fallow; and continous <b>alley</b> farming. The results indicate that: continous <b>alley</b> cropping is more profitable than non-alley or <b>alley</b> cropping with fallow; short fallowing in <b>alley</b> cropping reduces the rate of mining soil fertility and thus helps preserve future productivity; <b>alley</b> farming with small ruminants enhances the profitability of <b>alley</b> systems and increases their advantage over the non-alley system; and <b>alley</b> systems remain profitable even when terminal clearing costs are internalized in the current project cycle...|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{domination}} of the print industry, other businesses were also established on Fleet Street. The Automobile Association was established at No.18 Fleet Street in 1905. Since the post-Wapping migration, Fleet Street is now more associated with the investment banking, legal and accountancy professions. For example, The Inns of Court and barristers' chambers are down <b>alleys</b> and around courtyards off Fleet Street itself {{and many of the}} old newspaper offices have become the London headquarters for various companies; e.g. Goldman Sachs is in the old Daily Telegraph and Liverpool Echo buildings of Peterborough Court and Mersey House.|$|E

The flagship attraction is Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts roller coaster ride. Universal also added a completely functioning recreation of the Hogwarts Express connecting Kings Cross Station at Universal Studios Florida to the Hogsmeade station at Islands of Adventure.

5|$|One of the East End {{industries}} that serviced ships moored off the Pool of London was prostitution, {{and in the}} 17th century, this was centred on the Ratcliffe Highway, a long street lying on the high ground above the riverside settlements. In 1600, it was described by the antiquarian John Stow as 'a continual street, or filthy straight passage, with <b>alleys</b> of small tenements or cottages builded, inhabited by sailors and victuallers.' Crews were 'paid off' {{at the end of}} a long voyage, and would spend their earnings on drink in the local taverns.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} in the southeast were scarcely affected by the 19th century restoration apart from the chapel. Many of {{the walls of the}} 12th century tower have survived, partly rebuilt in the 15th century, and there are traces of a Romanesque chapel. The park was redesigned in the 19th century, enclosed in dry stone walls with several entrances. These have since been removed, as have the luxuriant gardens of the 18th century. Some traces remain in the form of boxwood, some <b>alleys,</b> the pools on the two terraces and the rockery.|$|E
5|$|The crucial factor which {{frustrated}} firefighting efforts was the narrowness of the streets.

5|$|Anspach's {{backing of}} Suys' {{proposal}} was a calculated decision, {{as he had}} radical plans to transform the city. Anspach saw the proposal as an unexpected boon, as it allowed him to accomplish several of his goals at once. It had long been his ambition to transform the impoverished lower city into a centre of business and commerce, suitable for a modern capital (Belgium had declared its independence in 1830, with Brussels its capital). He wanted to attract the middle class, most of whom had left the dingy downtown for the cleaner suburbs, including the Leopold Quarter (now often called the European quarter) and Avenue Louise, causing a large loss in tax revenue for the city. The elimination of the numerous <b>alleys</b> and dead-ends in the lower town in favour of a large, straight, wide, open-air boulevard, linking the two rapidly growing train stations, seemed both a necessity {{and an opportunity to}} beautify the city and improve both traffic circulation and hygiene.|$|E
5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, <b>alleys</b> and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{described}} the Christmas setting as a juxtaposition between the joyful {{time of year}} and the grim world of Gotham City, including decorative Santas near Gothic gargoyles and Christmas lights in dark <b>alleys.</b> The city is dislodged from time and space, contrasting 1930s (and older) buildings with Batman's futuristic technology. The New Gotham area was designed for vertical movement, allowing the placement of enemies above and below Batman to create areas dense with activity. The game features high contrast between darks and lights, with exaggerated shadows and few balancing colors. The city was divided into residential, industrial and commercial neighborhoods, which were decorated accordingly: the industrial setting is bleak, the commercial area has corporate decorations and residential neighborhoods have lights in their windows.|$|E
