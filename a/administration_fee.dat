Novell also filed its own Slander of Title counter-lawsuit against SCO. Novell has also filed claims for {{numerous}} breaches of the APA (Asset Purchase Agreement) between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation. Under the APA, Santa Cruz (and later SCO after SCO purchased Santa Cruz Operation's Unix Business) was given the right to market and sell Unixware as a product, retaining 100% of all revenues. Santa Cruz Operation (and later SCO) also was given the responsibility of administering Unix SVR4 license agreements on behalf of Novell. When money was paid for licensing, SCO was to turn over 100% of the revenue to Novell, and then Novell would return 5% as an <b>Administration</b> <b>Fee.</b> Novell claims that SCO signed Unix SVR4 licensing agreements with Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, {{as well as with}} numerous Linux End Users for Unix IP allegedly in the Linux Kernel, and then refused to turn the money over to Novell. Novell is suing for 100% of the revenue, claiming SCO is not entitled to the 5% <b>administration</b> <b>fee</b> since they breached their contract with Novell. Novell's counterclaims proposed asking the court to put appropriate funds from SCO into escrow until the case is resolved, since SCO's cash is diminishing quickly.|$|E

Novell also asked the court to attach SCO's assets pending adjudication of their claims. Had Novell won this motion, SCO would have been forced to file for bankruptcy.

(Novell would then have been obligated to pay SCO five percent of the license fees as an <b>administration</b> <b>fee,</b> but only after SCO had sent the money to Novell first.) ...|$|E
