50|$|After the {{adoption}} of the new Constitution in 1992, a new Citizenship Law recognised the citizenship registrations of the Citizens' Committees as the initial legal registry of Estonian citizens. Citizens of the Soviet Union who had filed applications with the Citizens Committees were enabled to be naturalised {{on the basis of a}} simplified procedure. By 1996, a total of 23,326 people - over 38% of those who filed a Citizenship Committee <b>application</b> <b>card</b> - had been naturalised by this procedure. Other noncitizens had to pass exams pertaining to the Estonian language, Estonian history, and the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia in order to be naturalised. Alternatively, Russia being a successor state to the Soviet Union, all former USSR citizens qualified for natural-born citizenship of the Russian Federation, available upon request, as provided by the law “On the RSFSR Citizenship” in force up to 2000.|$|E

5000|$|Despite its limitations, the American dubs of the anime and manga {{manage to}} {{preserve}} {{the spirit of the}} show; the translators and adaptation writers were forced to rewrite several of the jokes due to the differences between the Japanese and English languages. At several points in the dub, the American version makes fun {{of the fact that it}} is a translation of a Japanese product (for example, when Bo-bobo is filling out an <b>application</b> <b>card</b> in episode two, he botches it because the application is in Japanese and he cannot read it, instead drawing [...] "little doodles" [...] for answers; in the original Japanese version he messes up the application for a completely different reason, and the [...] "little doodles" [...] are his honest answers written in hiragana). This style of self-referential humor can also be seen in the American version of Kyatto Ninden Teyandee, Samurai Pizza Cats. Additionally, with the exception of the opening credits, all other on-screen Japanese text is intentionally kept in the English dub (most likely as a part of retaining the show's surreal humor).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Studies on smart <b>card</b> <b>applications,</b> in {{addition}} to focusing on instrumentality and practicality, should also consider {{the importance of social}} construction. The implications of actors with different roles on technology directly influence the developmental direction of smart <b>card</b> <b>applications.</b> This study examines smart <b>card</b> <b>applications,</b> using a private university in Taiwan as a case study. It attempts to understand and interpret how the university handles problems arising from smart <b>card</b> <b>applications,</b> from the perspective of schools and suppliers, during the planning and design phases of implementation. Additionally, it uses the Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) as an analytic lens. The results of this study show that when the university developed a new interpretation of smart <b>card</b> <b>applications,</b> it focused on value-added e-services. This emerged and unexpected consequences arose from actual work-practice situations; smart student ID cards were not merely tools for identification and payment, but also the means to shape student lifestyles...|$|R
