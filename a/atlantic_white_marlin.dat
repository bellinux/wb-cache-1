They are found between the latitudes of 45° N and 45° S in waters deeper than 100 m. Even though white marlin are found in bodies of water that are deeper than 100 m they tend to stay near the surface.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the application of}} a state-space age-structured production model to <b>Atlantic</b> <b>white</b> <b>marlin.</b> An age-structured approach was applied to accommodate the possibility that the vulnerability of white marlin to the various fisheries changes with age. A state-space representation was employed to facilitate parameter estimation by accommodating Bayesian priors and inter-annual changes in parameters such as recruitment and catchability. The latter capability may prove especially useful inasmuch as the catchability coefficients appear to have increased during the early year of several of the CPUE time series. However, initial runs of the model in an attempt to duplicate the ASPIC and FISHLAB runs made by the 2000 SCRS indicate that the steepness parameter of the spawner-recruit relationship and the age at 50 % vulnerability cannot be estimated reliably. This implies that an informative priors are required for these parameters before additional complexities are examined. The steepness parameter in particular has a strong influence on the model perception of the level of fishing mortality that can be sustained over the long term.

The {{vast majority of}} <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> taken in the U. S. fishery are caught on natural baits and subsequently released. A previous study demonstrated {{that the use of}} circle hooks with natural baits resulted in a highly significant increase in <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> postrelease survival relative to the use of straight-shank (J-type) hooks with natural baits. However, several models of circle hooks, which vary in shape {{and the degree to which}} the point is offset from the shaft, are available to anglers. Survival estimates determined from experiments conducted using one model may not be transferable to other models. We evaluated postrelease survival of <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> caught on three circle hook models commonly used in the recreational fishery. High-resolution pop-up satellite archival tags that were programmed to release from the fish after 10 d were deployed to follow the fates of 20 <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> caught on each type of circle hook. Only one mortality was inferred from the 59 tags that provided useful data. No significant differences in the incidence of deep (internal) hooking, hook-induced trauma, or postrelease survival were found among fish caught on the different circle hook models. Incidences of <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> deep hooking, hook-induced trauma, and postrelease mortality were significantly lower for the three circle hook models (combined) than for J hooks evaluated in a previous study.

50|$|La Guaira Bank (El Placer de La Guaira) is an {{underwater}} ridge that is approximately 12 {{miles off the}} coast from the city of La Guaira. The bank is approximately 12 mi long from east to west and 4 mi wide from north to south, and it rises from 50 fathom m in the surrounding area to 140 fathom m. The area provides the structure to deep-sea animals, and other organisms such as gorgonians, sponges, and coral, that require ocean currents to bring their food to them. Westerly currents flow off the coast of Venezuela, and the bank acts as a barrier to the current, creating an upwelling of nutrients to the ocean surface from deep-water stockpiles. These nutrients fuel an explosion of planktonic plant and animal growth, and attract larger animals such as whales, porpoises, seabirds, and large pelagics such as tuna, sharks, wahoo, dolphin fish, and four different types of marlin. It {{is considered one of the}} top sport fishing destinations in the world due to the unusually high numbers of <b>Atlantic</b> blue <b>marlin,</b> <b>white</b> <b>marlin,</b> sailfish, and spearfish that congregate at different seasons, and are available year round.|$|R
40|$|To improve {{billfish}} assessments, {{researchers have}} applied habitat-based models that incorporate behavioral and oceanographic parameters to standardize historical catch-per-uniteffort time -series data, accounting for significant gear changes over time. However, {{there has been}} little behavioral data from Atlantic billfishes to support these models. We provide information on habitat preferences of white marlin released from recreational and commercial fisheries in the western North <b>Atlantic.</b> <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> were tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) from recreational rod and reel (n= 22) and commercial pelagic longline (n= 2) fisheries between May-November 2002. Our data indicate that each surviving white marlin spent the majority of time at depths of 10 m or less, with all fish displaying repetitive short duration diving behavior (less than 30 minutes) to depths of 60 - 100 m. These dives were presumably related to foraging activities. Furthermore, the depths of many of the repetitive dives were within the range of deep-set pelagic longline gear. Longline sets targeting bigeye tuna may actually increase white marlin by-catch by placing baits at depths where this species may be highly motivated to feed. Until billfish feeding motivation is better understood, it may be premature to apply habitat-based stock assessment models to billfishes in the Atlantic Ocean...|$|E
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> {{are near}} the top of the food chain and will consume {{anything}} they can find that is manageable for their size. Schooling flyingfish, small tuna, dolphinfish (mahi-mahi, dorado), and squid are the preferred prey of <b>white</b> <b>marlin.</b> <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> have two ways of foraging for food.

40|$|CPUE {{time series}} for <b>Atlantic</b> blue and <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> are {{believed}} to be compromised by changes in fishing tactics by the Japanese longline fleet that cannot be completely removed by standardization methods. The highest catches for both species come from {{the early part of the}} Japanese longline fishery, before it shifted from shallow to deep sets. The consequences of limiting analyses to the most recent period were evaluated with simulated fisheries data generated by a computer program constructed around life history characteristics of Atlantic blue marlin. The population simulation generated sample time series of simulated catches and population abundance histories using several alternative assumptions about natural and fishing mortalities, stock-recruitment slopes, and measurement error. Within this framework the highest simulated catches came from the early part of the fishery and the trend in CPUE was constrained to approximate observed 1986 - 2005 CPUE trends. The resulting time series of simulated catches and abundances were fitted to a logistic surplus-production model with the full time series (1956 - 2005), the last 20 years, and the last 16 years. Overall, truncation of the 1956 - 2005 time series to only include the last 16 years of data resulted in MSY being overestimated by more than 50 %, and the ratios of final-year stock biomass to biomass at MS...|$|R

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> are mid-sized {{billfish}} with a {{bill that}} is round in cross section, and distinctly forked caudal fin. Their body structure is designed for fast swimming with a long streamline appearance. The length of K. albida is measured from the lower jaw to the fork of the tail (lower-jaw fork length; LJFL). The largest <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> reported was 2.8 m (9.2 ft) LJFL and weighed over 82 kg (180.8 lb). The coloring of <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> is used as countershading, with a dark blue dorsal side and a dirty white ventral side. Even though all <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> have the same coloring pattern, they are sexually dimorphic with the females usually larger. One of the most noticeable features of <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> is the dorsal fin, which extends along {{the majority of the}} dorsal portion of its body. The dorsal fin consists of an average of 28 to 46 rays. These rays make up a fin that is tall and rounded in the anterior but quickly levels off and then decrease as it extends to the posterior. Behind the large primary dorsal fin is the secondary dorsal fin which is made up of five to six rays. <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> have a set of similar pectoral fins and pelvic fins. These two sets of fin are rounded and wide at the tip. They also contain two anal fins which can be used for identification between species (more in Identification). The lateral line on this species is prominent, with a hump above the pectoral fin and extends the length of the fish toward the caudal fin.Internally, <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> do not have a swim bladder, but instead have small bubble shaped chambers that act as a swim bladder. Similarly to most vertebrates, they have symmetrical gonads. Unlike other marine fish, <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> do not have gill rakers which are involved in suspension feeding. <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> do have small but sharp teeth that are used when eating fish and Cephalopods.|$|R

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> are {{commonly}} misidentified as roundscale spearfish (Tetrapturus georgii).

As described in the name, roundscale spearfish have a broadband, round anterior end of their scales. <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> scales are more rigid and rounded on the posterior region of the scale. Another way to identify between the two species without doing a genetic test is by looking at the distance between the anal opening and the anal fin.

40|$|With a {{focus on}} <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> (Tetrapturus albidus), a {{concurrent}} electronic tagging and larval sampling effort was conducted {{in the vicinity of}} Mona Passage (off southeast Hispaniola), Dominican Republic, during April and May 2003. Objectives were 1) to characterize the horizontal and vertical movement of adults captured from the area by using pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs); and 2) by means of larval sampling, to investigate whether fish were reproducing. Trolling from a sportfishing vessel yielded eight adult <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> and one blue marlin (Makaira nigricans); PSAT tags were deployed on all but one of these individuals. The exception was a female <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> that was unsuitable for tagging because of injury; the reproductive state of its ovaries was examined histologically. Seven of the PSATs reported data summaries for water depth, temperature, and light levels measured every minute for periods ranging from 28 to 40 days. Displacement of marlin from the location of release to the point of tag pop-up ranged from 3 l. 6 to 267. 7 nautical miles (nmi) and a mean displacement was 3. 4 nmi per day for <b>white</b> <b>marlin.</b> <b>White</b> and blue <b>marlin</b> mean daily displacements appeared constrained compared to the results of other marlin PSAT tagging studies. <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> ovarian sections contained postovulatory follicles and final maturation-stage oocytes, which indicated recent and imminent spawning.

This much wider Atlantic distribution of the roundscale spearfish sympatric with its morphologically similar congeners, the <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> and longbill spearfish (Tetrapturus pfluegeri), raises further management complexities: it increases the geographic scale for species misidentification in catch records that form the basis for stock assessments and uncertainty in currently accepted <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> biological parameters.

40|$|Background: Misidentifications between {{exploited}} {{species may}} lead to inaccuracies in population assessments, with potentially irreversible conservation ramifications if overexploitation of either species is occurring. A notable showcase {{is provided by the}} realization that the roundscale spearfish (Tetrapturus georgii), a recently validated species, has been historically misidentified as the morphologically very similar and severely overfished <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> (Kajikia albida) (IUCN listing: Vulnerable). In effect, no information exists on the population status and evolutionary history of the enigmatic roundscale spearfish, a large, highly vagile and broadly distributed pelagic species. We provide the first population genetic evaluation of the roundscale spearfish, utilizing nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA sequence markers. Furthermore, we re-evaluated existing <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> mitochondrial genetic data and present our findings in a comparative context to the roundscale spearfish. Results: Microsatellite and mitochondrial (control region) DNA markers provided mixed evidence for roundscale spearfish population differentiation between the western north and south Atlantic regions, depending on marker-statistical analysis combination used. Mitochondrial DNA analyses provided strong signals of historical population growth for both <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> and roundscale spearfish, but higher genetic diversity and effective female population size (1. 5 - 1. 9 X) for <b>white</b> <b>marlin.</b> Conclusions: The equivocal indications of roundscale spearfish population structure, combined with a smaller effective female population size compared to the <b>white</b> <b>marlin,</b> already a species of concern, suggests that a species-specific and precautionary management strategy recognizing two management units is prudent for this newly validated billfish...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{validation}} of the roundscale spearfish (Tetrapturus georgii) as a distinct species within the Atlantic, coupled with the facts that it is sympatric with and strongly resembles the overfished <b>white</b> <b>marlin,</b> has clouded management and conservation efforts for both species. It is now realized that historical misidentifications of roundscale spearfish as <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> have occurred and have therefore complicated management efforts for the latter, since stock assessments have unknowingly been conducted on a species complex. Furthermore, the population status of roundscale spearfish is largely unknown. To aid management of both billfish species, we delineated the genetic population structure of roundscale spearfish in the western Atlantic and assessed its genetic diversity and demographic history relative to the <b>white</b> <b>marlin.</b> We genotyped 203 roundscale spearfish collected from the Northwest (NWA) and Southwest Atlantic (SWA) (n = 144, and n = 59, respectively) at 11 microsatellite loci, and sequenced a 585 bp segment of the mitochondrial control region (mtCR) for a subset (n = 83) of these individuals (NWA n = 42, SWA n = 41). The combined marker sets provided mixed evidence for population differentiation in the western Atlantic. Microsatellite population-level comparisons demonstrated some evidence of genetic differentiation among individuals from the NWA and SWA (FST = 0. 004; P = 0. 05); however, individual-based, multi-locus cluster analyses grouped these individuals into a single genetic unit. Analysis of mtCR data also showed mixed evidence of differentiation (ÔST = 0. 0037, P = 0. 284; Snn = 0. 618;P = 0. 015). Demographic analyses using roundscale spearfish mtCR data and a previously published <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> mtCR dataset demonstrated substantial historical population growth for both species. Estimates of genetic diversity (Ɵ) appeared to be higher for the <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> relative to the roundscale spearfish [0. 758 (0. 532 - 1. 197) and 0. 433 (0. 295 - 0. 730), respectively], although there was some overlap in confidence intervals.
