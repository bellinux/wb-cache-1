These planted {{protection}} forests have effectively maintained their role of controlling erosion {{for more than}} 140 years but their advanced age is now beginning to cause additional problems. These old monoculture forests, with a dominant tree age of approximately 120 years have a structure that is regular and dense (more than 1500 stems ha– 1). Tree heights vary from 12 to 27 m and the average radial growth is equal to 1.16 mm yr– 1. These stands are increasingly prone to large-scale catastrophic phenomena such as wind destruction, fires and parasitic attacks. The uncontrolled and short-term death of these ‘first-generation’ forests could lead to local reactivation of erosion (Rey and Berger, 2006). Moreover, mistletoe (Viscum album L.) has recently appeared on black pine and continues to propagate, accelerating deterioration (Vallauri et al., 2002).|$|E

Equivalent mean diameter curves proved to be very good predictors for all studied growth parameters, having smaller relative errors than the Equivalent height curves. A result of practical importance is the insignificant difference between the direct (experimental dominant height) and the indirect (predicted dominant height) way of parameter estimation. Among all six examined ways of determination of the stand stock the Equivalent mean diameter curves based on the experimental values of basal area and dominant height showed best performance. The proposed model of SDCD avoids some disadvantages of the existing growth and yield models and supplies a reliable method for estimation of the stand growth parameters...|$|E

Aims :The {{aim of this study}} was to link a stand dynamics model and an architectural model to simulate stand dynamics, in which the ecological or silvicultural modelling from the stand model and the architecture representation could be integrated, to provide individual tree details at the stand level. Methods : Stand-level simulations of <b>Austrian</b> <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> dynamics provided global results on tree growth from the empirical forest growth model PNN, and branching details for individual trees were provided by the functional–structural plant model (FSPM) GreenLab.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} three plots (20 × 50 m) {{established}} in even-aged Pinus nigra (<b>Austrian</b> <b>black</b> <b>pine)</b> stands located at approximately the same altitude, characterised by a similar age but showing different growth rate. Spatial distribution of natural regeneration (NR) were examined for each species by calculating Ripley’s K and Moran index and by analysing their age- and size structure. Although the species mixture of NR differed among the plots, Abies alba was always the most frequent. Results showed that the clumped distribution of NR prevails over the random one. The spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated at least two modes of space colonisation in line with clumped distribution of NR. In the first, the seedlings occupy different micro-areas in different times, whereas in the second the colonisation process occurs in the same micro-area for a more extended time. The resulting structure of NR is constituted by several small patches of different age in the first case or by patches with a similar uneven-aged structure in the second. These different colonisation patterns could be ascribed respectively to short-term disturbances such as sudden opening in the canopy and litter removal in the first case and to longterm disturbances or the presence of scarcely modifiable environmental factors such as soil characteristics and micro-morphology in the second. However, the colonisation process was always temporally limited. Age structures of the different species overlapped and were not related to stand basal area. As both colonisation patterns are likely to increase the structural and floristic complexity of the future stands, our data further confirm the important role played by Pinus nigra in recovering degraded lands.

30|$|As {{outlined}} above, erosion problems {{appeared in}} the Southern Prealps of France during the Little Ice Age, due to the combination of climate change and poor agricultural practices (Neboit, 1991; Vallauri et al., 2002). The first written reports that pointed out the linkage between deforestation and erosion in the mountains dated {{back to the early}} 19 th century (Dugied, 1819; Surell, 1841), but the French administration did not start to take erosion into consideration until the first strategic transport infrastructures were established in the mountains (see Mather et al. (1999) for an historical and socio-political account). The Code Forestier of 1827 provided the basis for developing how forests were to be managed, though made only modest provision for reforesting. The political decision to engage an ambitious programme of reforestation in the Alps was made in 1860, with the promulgation of the first law for the reforestation of mountains – the Restauration des terrains en Montagne (RTM) Act. This political process was clearly accelerated by the catastrophic flood of May–June 1856 in the Rhône River, which had a strong influence on policymakers (Bravard, 2002). This extreme flood had dramatic consequences, notably at Lyon, with several hundreds of houses destroyed and 18 persons killed. Two other laws were passed in 1864 and 1882 to improve and complete the legislative case for erosion control in the mountains. The erosion-control programme lasted 50 years, from the 1860 s to the First World War. Degraded lands were purchased by the State to implement reforestation and torrent-control engineering works. About 65 000 ha were successfully reforested during this period (Blanchard, 1945). By the end of the 19 th century, most of the degraded marly terrain in the Southern Alps in France had been afforested, primarily with <b>Austrian</b> <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold ssp, nigra) (Vallauri et al., 2002) in order to control erosion and torrential floods.|$|E

The investigations were performed with a modern, certified, 8 kW, manually fired log wood stove, {{and the results were}} compared to emissions from a modern 9 kW pellet stove. The examined wood types were deciduous species: black locust, black poplar, European hornbeam, European beech, pedunculate oak (also known as “common oak”), sessile oak, turkey oak and conifers: <b>Austrian</b> <b>black</b> <b>pine,</b> European larch, Norway spruce, Scots pine, silver fir, as well as hardwood briquettes. In addition, “garden biomass” such as pine cones, pine needles and dry leaves were burnt in the log wood stove. The pellet stove was fired with softwood pellets. The composite average emission rates for log wood and briquettes were 2030 mgMJ− 1 for CO; 89 mgMJ− 1 for NOx, 311 mgMJ− 1 for CxHy, 67 mgMJ− 1 for particulate matter PM 10 and average odor concentration was at 2430 OUm− 3. CO, CxHy and PM 10 emissions from pellets combustion were lower by factors of 10, 13 and 3, while considering NOx – comparable to the log wood emissions. Odor from pellets combustion was not detectable. CxHy and PM 10 emissions from garden biomass (needles and leaves) burning were 10 times higher than for log wood, while CO and NOx rise only slightly. Odor levels ranged from not detectable (pellets) to around 19, 000 OUm− 3 (dry leaves). The odor concentration correlated with CO, CxHy and PM 10. For log wood combustion average odor ranged from 536 OUm− 3 for hornbeam to 5217 OUm− 3 for fir, indicating a considerable influence of the wood type on odor concentration...|$|E

Korištenje drugih vrsta šumskog drveća te njihova uporaba u revitalizaciji do sada je kod nas nedovoljno istraženo. U tu je svrhu, u jesen 2007. godine, osnovano pokusno polje za potrebe istraživanja biološke sanacije kamenoloma Očura II autohtonim vrstama drveća i grmlja. Izabrane vrste su crni jasen (Fraxinus ornus), gorski javor (Acer pseudoplata nus), crna topola (Populus nigra), vrbe (Salix sp.), te kalina (Ligustrum vul gare) i bodljikava veprina (Ruscus aculeatus). Podaci o preživljenju nakon dvije sezone evidentiranja ukazuju na bolju otpornost na presadnju i na prilagodbu novim uvjetima školovanih sadnica javora, jasena te vrba i topola od biljaka presađenih iz šume. Sadnice kaline iz rasadnika nisu pokazale sličnu karakteristiku ranije navedenih vrsta, kao ni sklonost određenom tipu tla. Najmanje je preživljenje sadnica iz šume prenešenih na šumsko tlo (68, 8 %), a najveće, također šum skih sadnica, ali na poljoprivrednom tlu (87, 5 %). Ukupno gledajući, može se uočiti kako sadnice iz rasadnika imaju visoko i približno isto preživljenje i na poljoprivrednom i na šumskom tlu (89, 2 – 89, 7 %), a veće je od preživljenja biljaka presađenih iz šume. Ono se kreće od 73, 8 % na šumskom, do 86, 3 % na poljoprivrednom tlu. Sveukupno preživljenje biljaka (izuzevši veprinu) od 85, 0 % vrlo je visoko i zadovoljavajuće te pokazuje šire mogućnosti odabira vrsta prilikom radova na biološkoj sanaciji pojedinih kamenoloma od do sada uvriježenih u praksi. Analizom visinskih klasa, za sve promatrane vrste utvrđen je pomak za 1 – 4 klase. Najveći visinski prirast (do 120 cm) imale su sadnice vrba i topola. Biological {{revitalisation}} {{of highly}} devastated {{areas such as}} querries, depots and landfills is in Croatia, in terms of permanent green coverage, usually conducted with <b>Austrian</b> <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra Mill.). Until now research of other forest tree species utilization and their usage within sanation process haven’t been conducted. With this objective, {{in the fall of}} 2007, test field for scientific needs was established for research of biological sanation of querry Očura II with autochtonous tree and schrub species. Basic aim of this trial was to determine the possibility of application of autochtonous tree and shrub species in querry revitalisation. Trial was established in the border part of Očura II querry on already technically improved terracce. On this terracce layer of wasterock from querry was deposed which acts as foundation. Trial was established in two repetitions which depend on the soil type (deposed agricultural or forest humus substrate (soil)). In every repetition seedlings from nursery and from surrounding forest stands were planted. Seven pedological profiles have been dug up and additional observations have been conducted with pedological sonde. For indentification of pioneer forest species which come by nature on Očura querry locality, it was necessary to study and to determine vegetation, floristic composition of forest edges, as well as areas inside of querry on which natural vegetation begun to appear. Selection of plants for extraction was conducted in forest stands, on the top border area of querry, which was planned for clearcut in the near future with the aim of sequent exploitation of querry. Selected species were Flowering ash (Fraxinus ornus L.), Sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), Black poplar (Populus nigra L.), willows (Salix sp.), and European privet (Ligustrum vulgare L.). 546 plants od forest tree species was planted in total, which include 110 willows and poplar plants, 110 sycamore maple and 110 flowering ash plants and 216 bush species plants, which include 144 European privet and 72 Ruscus aculeatus plants. Selection of Ruscus aculeatus for this trial was based on preservation of individuall speciments of this endangered specie in the vicinity of it’s habitant which will be devastated by exploitation. The results of test field monitoring indicate very good survival success of young plants. Outplanted plants on the test field were in very good health condition, except Ruscus aculeatus, which was planted with the aim of protection. For now conclusions about success of plants regarding the soil type could not be made, but there is a correlation between survival of plants and their breeding. At the time of survival observation nursery seedlings had higher average survival rate then plants extracted from surrounding stands. There is no difference in survival rate between plants planted on agricultural and forest soil in first year (91, 2 – 91, 1 %) but after secund year there are differences (81, 8 % on forest soil, 87, 7 % on agricultural soil). Survival of Sycamore maple is in range from 72, 0 % to 93, 3 %. Sycamore plants which have been extracted from forest stands have the lowest survival rate while plants planted on forest soil have lower survival (72 %) then plants planted on agricultural soil (73, 7 %). Survival of sycamore nursery seedlings is satisfatory on both soil types and it ranges from 88, 0 to 93, 3 %. Flowering ash nursery seedlings have 100 % survival rate regardless of soil type, but survival of Flowering ash extracted from forest stands is different in relation to soil type. On agricultural soil this survival rate is satisfatory and amounts 93, 3 %, while plants on forest soil have 56 % survival rate. Survival rate of willows and poplars ranges from 90, 0 to 100 %. The best survival have plants which have been extracted from forest stands and been planted on forest soil, and plants from stands planted on agricultural soil have the lowest survival. Survival of nursery seedlings ranges from 92, 0 to 90, 0 %. Survival of Euro pean privet is in the range of 68, 8 to 87, 5 %. More successful are European privet plants planted on agricultural soil. The results of this research indicate that adequate species of autochtonous and pioneer forest trees and species have been selected for revitalisation of this querry, taking into account their ecological requirements and biological features...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{mechanical}} propertiesof pit props relative to various factors of forestry production. Its purposes are as follows :t. to show how wood used as supporting membres in a minebehaves in static bending and in sag, also to give some figuresfor the strength wood opposes to these stresses. 2. to find how these mechanical properties will vary (as wellas warning signs given by wood before failure, and the aspectof the wood fiber where the supporting member has failed) relative to the main factors of forestry production : thespecies, the location of the tree and the type of managementadopted. 3. to draw the relation that exists between mechanical strength,warning signs and the aspect of wood fibers at rupture onone hand and between certain aspects or properties of woodsuch as density, width of growth rings, moisture content, dimensionsand differences in shape, structure or chemical compositionon the other hand. In spite of considerable progress achieved these last few yearsby metal props, wood retains an important place in the mine whendifficult working conditions, the type of exploitation or kinds ofstresses call for this material. Wooden props consumption seemsto reach a limit between 20 to 25 dm 3 per ton of coal produced. These figures, considering the increasing coal production willalways result in a large use of wood. But mainly when one makes a comparison with supporting membersor metal frames it is likely that users will be more and moreparticular about the quality of wood props, which is quite 'fair andwhich one should wish. Mine props will be chosen from better selectedwood. Therefore, {{it is important to have}} a good knowledge ofwood mechanical properties to investigate the factors that influencethese mechanical properties and to work out new forestry managmentsthat will produce a better raw material in the best conditions About fourty different species have been investigated, mainlyindigenous species from France but also foreign species whichhave been cultivated in our country for a various length of time. Furthermore, two bunches of mine props from Finland (spruceand Scotch Pine) and a bunch of mangrove from French Guineahave been tested for comparison. Among the fourty species studied there were 16 coniferous and 24 deciduous species. In each of the two categories one single species(Scotch pine for the softwoods and oak for the hardwoods) was chosen as a reference species which was studied in details andthen compared with other species. As most of the species tested here grow in many parts of thecountry under various conditions, depending of the station andof the type of management adopted it has been necessary to considervarious test specimens for each species which were chosenaccording to special conditions so that the number of test specimensexceeds 350. For certain important species, the number of testbunches was particularly high (42 bunches of Scotch pine, 30 bunches of Maritime pine (Pinus Pinaster). Finally, in order to draw valuable means and to study within abunch of specimens the interaction of certain variables such asstorage, or the influence of defects, etc [...] . it has been necessary toprepare bunches of specimens that include a great many pieces. Sampling amounted to an average of 25 to Ioo pieces. In all, over 15 000 pieces have been experimented upon. Testing ProceduresTests have been performed in compression along the grain andin bending. The ratio between length and diameter generally exceededio, compression tests were actually sag tests. Specimens testedin bending laid freely on two supports and the load was appliedat center by means of a rounded-edge knife. The testing machine consisted in hydraulic or mechanical presseswith a measuring device of the scale type, including a dynamometerof manometer and a measure of the corresponding deflectionor crush. The load at rupture was either registered during thetest on drum register or plootted afterward for each result obtained,each one corresponding to a'point on the curve. Presses used enabled us to perform tests on specimens as longas 2. 5 o meters under a pressure exceeding one hundred tons. Individual diagrams give the following information:r. the speed at wich the load was applied before rupture, 2. a general aspect of the elastic portion which takes place atthe beginning of the test, 3. the value of the load applied on the test specimen (warningload) at the precise time when it begins to give the warningsigns (either by sight or hearing), 4. the maximum load and corresponding deflection, 5. the aspect of the rupture, 6. the work at failure which can be divided into various fractionsas indicated on graph No. i& by parallels to the « y »axes. The portion of the curve called of actual safety whichcorresponds to the breaking work in bending between the firstwarning sign (by sight) and the point where we come closerto maximum load is particularly important and must be takeninto consideration. The portion called nerve safety which laybeyond a parallel to the « y » axes corresponding to maximumload is also important and must be translated into figures. During the tests warning signs before failure, either by sight(deflection) or hearing (cracks) were carefully noted. The aspect of the rupture, the moisture content at the time ofthe test, the density determination, the growth ring counting (age) are also :among information which were written down for eachtest specimen. Presentation and Judging of ResultsResults were presented as said above, either as curves or asmomentary loads with the corresponding deflections. These figures enables us to draw or calculate the following results:I. aspect of the average curve at rupture for a given bunch,at a given moisture content, 2. a comparison of curves within a given bunch, arranged accordingto the decreasing diameters or according to the decreasingmoisture contents, 3. the average load for each bunch or part of a bunch of specimensand the girth corresponding to a maximum averageload per square centimeter (cm 2), 4. in bending, the average load corresponding to the first warningsign by sight (warning load) with the girth correspondingto the average warning load per square centimeter (cm 2), 5. for important bunches we have drawn a distribution diagramfor maximum load per cm 2 with the total result figures obtainedin order to study the position variables and dispersion variables (see Table I, graph. 103 and 109). The study ofthese variables has enabled in many cases to see how the observeddistribution comes close to a normal distribution andto figure the percentage of results included within a scaleof given values, either near the average or above a givenfigure, 6. the factor analysis within an certain number of results alsoenabled us to show clearly the influence of certain occasionalvariation factors such as accidental variation in shape, orstructure, abnormal humidity, stain or dote, etc [...] . 7. Finally, for most of the bunches tested studies of static interdependancehave been performed which result in correlativegraphs. The main correlativeness drawn was between diameter andmaximum load, but we also studied some cases of correlativenessbetween density, moisture content, soundness in relationto maximum load per cm 2. Commentaries on ResultsIt is not possible of course, in that quick presentation, to giveall our results. We will limit ourselves to average results for themain species with some commentaries about the influence of thecountries where the timber has grown. a) coniferous speciesAmong coniferous species the major part has been given to fourhome grown species : Scots pine, spruce, fir and maritime pine. The sag test give comparative results for spruce and fir, 200 kgper square centimeter for pieces measuring between 45 and 70 cmin girth at their middle and 2, 50 m long. Scots pine gives inferiorresults 175 kg, and maritime pine (because of its wide growthrings) is definetely weaker, 129 kg. In bending, over 2 meters span still for pieces of 40 to 70 cmin girth results obtained for the above four species are nearlyidentical ranging between 18 and 18, 6 kg per cm 2. But, on the other hand, warning signs by sight hearing, givenbefore failure by Scots pine and maritime pine are much moreimportant than those given by either fir or spruce and their ruptureis not so fast. It is important to notice that the scattering of results is lesspronounced for species such as fir (which has not been cultivatedextensively outside its natural area in France) than for spruce(frequently introduced on lower grounds), Scots pine (for whichthere are very poor examples) or maritime pine (which often showvery wide growth rings). The well-known relation between narrow rings, high percentageof summer wood, density and higher mechanical properties has beenconfirmed and put into figures during tests performed on mineprops. With Scots pine, for example, when the width of growth ringschanges from 3 to I mm, density at 15 % rises from 0, 55 to 0, 70 and the average maximum load per crn 2 in the sag test risesfrom 125 to 225 kg (see table 8). With spruce resistances measured according to origins vary between 170 and 220 kg and with fir between 152 and 227. Withmaritime pine, there is a wide range : 85 kg per cm 2 for the worstand 185 kg for the best (Forest of Dom de Bormes). Everything that hampers the growth of coniferous trees withouthaving any action upon the regularity of growth rings or the physiologicstate of the tree improve the mechanical resistance of thewood. The selection of pines growing on mountains with narrowand even rings, the practise of dense forest, the growth of treeson spoor soil (but properly watered) with not too warm a station,are favorable factors for a harvest of wood with high mechanicalresistances. To these well-known coniferous species we were able to cornpareother species that are not so frequently used but among whichmany give excellent results. In sag, for example, the following loads have been registered :European larch 194 kg per cm 2 Cedar (from North Africa) 193 kgCorsican pine T 82 kgDouglas 181 kgThese species compare favorably the species taken as standard. We shall notice that larch that comes from some altitudewith narrow rings gave a top figure of 243 kg per cm 2. Next to the above species are those with relatively rapid growthwhich can he placed between Scots pine and maritime pine:Japanese larch 166 kgAustrian pine 154 kgPinus uncinata 151 kgLaricio from Calabria 142 kgThuya (western red cedar) 151 kgA coniferous species with wide rings such as Sitka spruce isclassified lower with only r 24 kg. The same classification is obtained in bending:Corsican pine 26, 1 kg; Douglas 22, 6; European larch 20, 9; Japaneselarch 20, 6; Austrian pine 20, 4; Cedar 20, 3; Thuya 18, 9, arecomparable to the four species studied in this report. Pinus uncinata 17, 5, Laricio from 'Calabrica (with wide rings) 17, 4 and Sitka spruce 14, 9 give lower figures. One must note that some species such as European larch, Douglas,Cedar, Corsican pine give very distinct warning signs beforerupture (cracking in sag and deflection) and their rupture is notabrupt. The species are durable and as a whcle have a perfect shape. Such species can actually be « cultivated » to give mine props. b) deciduous speciesIn the sag test some hardwoods give results similar to those obtainedwith softwoods but the majority remains inferior to softwoods. In bending though, many hardwoods show their superiority oversoftwoods. Here are the results in sag :hornbeam (sound and dry) 187 kgred oak 172 kgcommon oak 169 kg— These species give results fairly close to chose obtained withScots pine. chestnut. 144 kgalder (sound and,dry) 142 kgare comparable in that respect to maritime pine. On the contrary,birch, aspen, lime and even robinia with 120 kg about are inferior. In bending, the results obtained with hardwoods are better :robinia (Robinia pseudoacacia) 32, 5 kgash 29, 5 kgred oak 27, 6 kgwild cherry 22, 6 kgcommon oak 22, 4 kglime 20, 3 kghornbeam (sound) 20, 2 kgchestnut rp. 8 kgfar behind come :birch 15, 8 kgaspen 1 5, 3 kgalder 154 kgAs a matter of curiosity let us call mangrove from Guinea whichresisted 300 kg per cm 2 in sag and 48, 5 kg in bending, but ofcourse, this is a record. Hardwoods give more warning signs by sight before rupture (inbending as well as in sag). Robinia, ash, oak also give a crackingsound (less pronounced though than with pines). Some hardwoods (chestnut, oak, robinia, ash, sound hornbeam) show a slow rupture of their fibers, others have an abrupt rupture(beech, even sound, maple, sorbus aria). Finally, and this is particularlyimportant, some hardwood are not durable and easely attackedby fungi (beech, hornbeam, birch, alder, aspen, Ailanthus) and because of this, lose both: their mechanical properties and theirwarning signs or security advantage. A good many hardwoods could give excellent mine props, buttheir preparation must he very carefully clone : felling when thesap is no more in circulation, grading of the pieces which must bestraight, grooving, storing in well ventilated piles to facilitate airdrying and avoid decay. c) factors (other than species and station of growth) Tc'hich have aninfuence upon mechanical properties. We have tried to evaluate the in fl uence of some factors such as:length (or span) girth (or diameter) straightnessshape of the piece (conicity) egg-like sectioncrooked graincrown of knotsmoisture contentstainetc [...] . 1) length or spanIn bending or sag_, there is generally an inverse relation betweenspan or length and the resistance. which corroborates the generalrules of resistance of materials. One must note, nevertheless, that axial compression test wereactually sag test and not straight compression test along the grain. The relation between length and diameter was alwa.) ' over 6. 2) diameterIn sag we could not draw any direct relation between load persquare centimeter and section. Among the biggest pieces tested(45 to 70,cm in girth) this relation does not seem to exist (whichis logical as long as one does not change over from sag to compressionalong the grain). Nonetheless, we could notice that the load per square centimetersupported by small pieces (from 18 to 34 cm in girth) was the sameas the load supported by bigger pieces when the former were testedin sag on 1, 60 ni only instead of 2, 50 ni in length. It wouldthen seem interesting to resume these surveys of relationship basedon the ratio: length over diameter of tested specimens, In bending, we found a relation though not very conspicuous,between the mechanical resistance and thediameter within thehunch of specimens tested over 2 ni span (45 to 70 cm in girth). This relation is not paramount because the girth often brings otherweakness factors such as large knots, greater moisture content,stain, heart checks, etc [...] . The relations studied have enabled us to figure out a shape factorwhich is the « n]» of the well-known formula of « fatigue »given by the AFNOR standards. 3 PLFu — 2 hh°in whichFt' is the value of fatigue in bendingP the load at failureL the spanb and h the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the sectionn the shape factor. We found for mine props a shape factor slightly lower thanthe one given by Marcel Monnin for structural lumber n 6 / 5 instead of 8 / 6. We have also noticed that smaller pieces (from 18 to 34 cm ingirth) showed a resistance in bending per cm 2 over a one-meterspan identical to the resistance in bending over a two-meter spanshown by large pieces. During the time spent for this survey wecould not study the influence of girth for one single span overa large range of girth (from T 8 to 70 cm), but a complementarystudy could he made on that particular subject. 3) straightnessWithout a detailed study we shall note that one single bend. inferiorto 3 cm per meter of length will result in a TO %^ to 20 reduction in the resistance in sag. In the case of a double bend irg S. the reduction will reach 30 %. An exagerated conicity (2 to ' 2. 5 cm per meter, over the diameter) will result in a TS to 20 % reduction in the sag test. If the tree shows too much of an egg shape (1 s 2 / 3 L) thiswill also reduce the resistance in bending by 20 °Jo. 4) defectsCrown of conspicuous knots of small sizes does not seem tohave any action either in bending or in sag. On the contrary,when knots are over 2 cm in diameter the resistance in bending isreduced, failure « jumps » toward the crown of knots and becomesabrupt. One notices a reduction in the maximum load ranging from 72 to i 8 %. In sag the reduction of resistance appears whenknots are 3 cm in diameter or over. This reduction reaches io to 15 %. Props then crak at the knots whether they are conspicuousor slightly covered. Early artificial pruning which will result in alarger percentage of defectless timber will at the same time increasethe resistance of props. 5) moisture contentMoisture content has a definite influence on the resistance ofwood. Standards published by AFNOR give formulae to changethe resistance of a given piece of wood (measured at H% MC) toan average MC (r 5 %). For example, the stress at rupture in bending:F 15 '= FH(r -f- c' (H 1 5)) in whichc' is a factor called « humidity factor ». We were able to figure out these factors in sag and in bendingfor some species. We found for example, in sag: 2 to 3 % for Douglas fir and mountain larch 3 to 4 % for 'fir, spruce and Scots pine 4 to 5 % for larch growing in plains and hardwoods (oak, chestnut,hornbeam) 5 to 6 % for <b>Austrian</b> <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> and maritime pine with widerings. In bending we found : 2 % for Douglas fir, white fir, spruce, larch 2 to 3 % for oak, chestnut, hornbeam, Scots pine 3 to 4 % for maritime pine and <b>Austrian</b> <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> This is very important to judge the resistance of a given pieceof timber according to its moisture content. Moisture content variesnot only after felling, to reach the equilibrium with the relativehumidity and the temperature of the storage place but alsoshows a certain up and down variation with an increase in moistureduring cold, wet seasons. 6) decaySoftwoods, when they are barked as soon as felled (which isparticularly important in the case of <b>Austrian</b> <b>Black</b> <b>pine)</b> areless exposed to stain. Nevertheless, large pine logs often showstain signs which are not very dangerous in themselves but mayhide some worse stain inside the tree. On low grounds one mustavoid felling pines when sap is circulating (burnt trees show thesame risks). Decayed wood is easily recognized because it smells of etherand because of a certain hysteresis over summer drying (decayed wood gains more water during wet seasons and loses less duringdry seasons). Many hardwoods (deciduous species) oak, chestnut, locust, etc [...] . are durable, others such as Ailanthus, alder, birch, hornbeam, beech,aspen, etc [...] . are likely to get decayed and sometimes in a veryhad way. If felled when the sap is in motion they get stained atonce. If, on the contrary, they are felled after the sap has stop -ped circulating inside the tree some of them (birch, hornbeam) can last one year but all get stained during the second year. Inthat case, the resistance is reduced by half it not more, and ruptureis always abrupt (brash) without warning signs. The preparation and use of birch and hornbeam as mine propsmust be carried out with that serious disadvantage in mind...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{intensification}} of agriculture, there were a bigger and more often habitat loss and their fragmentation. These led to the decreasing {{of the size of}} suitable habitats and their isolation. The isolation of landscape fragments is a basic geographical characteristic, which {{plays an important role in}} the ecological invasions. The invasions generally cause major economic damages and they affect the loss of biological diversity in the stands. In this work, we focused on the effects of <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra). This wood plant has been occurred in the Czech Republic since the Tertiary period and disappeared by the subsequent disintegration of continents. The aim of this study is to determine the influence of <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra) on the invertebrates compared with the native stands of scots pine (Pinus sylvetris). The experiment was conducted at 35 plots in Central Bohemia (18 plots of Scots pine, 17 plots of <b>black</b> <b>pine).</b> The invertebrates were captured by light traps. The total abundance and biomass of invertebrates were determined from the captured samples. From the processed data was not proven negative impact on non-native <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> to overall abundance and biomass of invertebrates. This fact is most likely due to the phylogenetic relationship of both pine species. There were not found any differences in abundance and biomass of most herbivorous groups of invertebrates. However, in the <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> stands was reported a higher incidence of carnivorous species of invertebrates. The stands of the <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> have no negative impact on number of invertebrates in the Czech Republic, actually there was demonstrated even higher affinity of carnivorous species of invertebrates to the <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> trees...|$|R

40|$|Litter {{quality is}} an {{important}} determinant of soil organic matter formation. Changes of organic components were investigated along decomposition of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) leaf litter and <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra Arn.) needle litter in the native adjacent coeval forest stands. To this purpose, data from proximate analyses were compared with those from CPMAS 13 C NMR. Newly shed leaf litter of black locust had significantly higher concentrations of ADSS (acid detergent soluble substances) as well as lower concentrations of cellulose and AUR (acid unhydrolyzable residues that include lignin) and higher AUR-to-Cellulose ratio than that of <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> The 13 C CPMAS NMR spectra of newly shed leaf litter of black locust and <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> revealed that O-Alkyl-C components (including cellulose and hemicelluloses) accounted, respectively, for 53. 8 % and 61. 4 % of the total area of the spectra. All other C fractions were relatively more abundant in black locust than in <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> Within individual sampling periods, relationships between residual litter mass and concentrations of ADSS, cellulose and AUR were examined, as were relationships between residual litter C and NMR fractions. Four periods were defined based {{on the slopes of}} the decomposition curve, with the length of period I defined by the start of a net decrease of AUR. Proximate analyses and NMR data showed changes in chemical composition over the decomposition process, as well as changes in decay rates of the residues, following different paths in the two litters. ADSS decayed faster in black locust litter; in contrast cellulose and AUR decayed faster in that of <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> AUR concentration increased in both litters during decomposition; however, compared to <b>black</b> <b>pine,</b> the remaining litter of black locust was richer in AUR, despite the lower initial concentration, and had a higher AUR-to-Cellulose ratio. Phenol-C and Aryl-C decayed faster in black locust litter, while Alkyl-C decayed faster in that of <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> In both litters, mass loss in periods was negatively correlated to concentration of AUR {{at the start of the}} periods. C loss in periods was negatively correlated to the concentration at the start of the periods of MC-to-PC (an index of lignin content) in black locust litter and positively correlated to Alkyl-C and O-Alkyl-C in that of <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> Phenol-C, O-Alkyl-C and Aryl-C were the most decomposable C fractions in black locust. O-Alkyl-C and Alkyl-C were the most decomposable C fractions in <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> Limit value was lower in <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> than in <b>black</b> locust. Consequently the different pattern of litter decomposition can affect the size of C sequestration in the forest floor and the quality of accumulated organic carbon...|$|R
40|$|Tree species {{influence}} {{organic matter}} sequestration in forest soil. We explored {{the pattern of}} soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON) sequestration in two 40 -year-old, adjacent forest stands, one with <b>Black</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra Arn.) and one with Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.). We compared the patterns of annual carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sequestration in the organic and mineral soil layers of the two forests with literature data for < 100 years old deciduous and coniferous forests from different climatic zones. Carbon and N inputs, with aboveground litter fall, were significantly higher in the <b>Black</b> <b>pine</b> than in the Black locust stand. In the soil profile of the <b>Black</b> <b>pine</b> stand, the amount of SOC was significantly higher and that of SON significantly lower than in the Black locust stand. The average annual sequestration rates were 41. 3 and 75. 0 g C m- 2, and 2. 9 and 2. 6 g N m- 2, respectively, in the Black locust and the <b>Black</b> <b>pine</b> stands. In both forests most of SOC and SON was stored in the organic layers (OL and OF+OH). In the mineral soil layers the amount of SOC was similar for the two stands whereas the amount of SON was significantly higher in the Black locust stand (23. 7 vs 14. 6 g N m- 2). In all soil layers, the concentrations of water soluble organic matter (WSOM) {{were higher in the}} Black locust stand compared to that with <b>Black</b> <b>pine.</b> Manganese accumulated in the OF+OH layer of the <b>Black</b> <b>pine</b> stand. The results suggest different sequestration patterns, with higher SOC sequestration rates in the <b>Black</b> <b>pine</b> stand and higher SON sequestration rates in the Black locust stand.
