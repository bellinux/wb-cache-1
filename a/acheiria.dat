40|$|SUMMARY This paper reports two second cousins with {{absence of}} the left hand. Congenital {{absence of the}} hand, <b>acheiria,</b> is a rare defect {{occurring}} in 1 : 65 000 live births. ' It is always unilateral and almost always sporadic; reports of <b>acheiria</b> recurring in a family are sparse. They include those of Hecht and Scott, 2 in which two sibs born to consanguineous parents were affected, and of Pilarski et al 3 who recorded two affected first cousins. Familial occurrence of <b>acheiria</b> and forearm Received for publication 27 June 1988. Accepted for publication 25 July 1988. amputation has been recorded, in sibs,I uncle and niece, 4 uncle and nephew, 3 and in a great grand-mother and her great granddaughter. 5 However, we know of no previous reports of <b>acheiria</b> occurring in children sharing great grandparents. Case reports Case 1 is the younger child of healthy, unrelated parents. His father was aged 33 and his mother 29 years {{at the time of}} his birth. Neither they, nor his older sib, have any hand abnormality. His mother had primary amenorrhoea and both pregnancies were induced with clomiphene. The pregnancy was FIG 1 Case I aged two and a halfyears with rudimentary digits on the left arm. X ray at 15 months old shows two ossification centres...|$|E
40|$|Mtiller and Blauth have {{suggested}} that short webbed fingers, atypical cleft hand and <b>acheiria</b> develop as morphological variants of symbrachydactyly. The clinical features and roentgenograms of our 76 patients were analysed. The common features {{of all types of}} symbrachydactyly were that all cases were unilateral, various degrees of bone hypoplasia existed in the affected limbs, and in every grade there were some cases with pectoral muscle absence. There seems to he a successive process of formation of atypical cleft hand. Monodactyly and peromelia occur as a result of more severe reduction occurring in the central finger rays of symbrachydactyly of short finger type. Journal of Hand Surgery (British Volume, 1989) 14 B: 303 - 306 Short webbed finger is called symbrachydactyly. Since Pol (1921) reported on symbrachydactyly, it has been considered to be a unilateral hand anomaly associated with brachymesophalangy, cutaneous syndact ly and microcheiria. Atypical cleft hand, however, is P central ray deficiency without a deep cleft of the palm, while transverse deficiency is an anomaly with amputation-like deformity of the hand in which the fingers or the limbs are not formed at all (Barsky, 1964). In the English literature, symbrachydactyly, atypical cleft hand and transverse deficiency are reported as different types of anomalies (Ogino et al., 1986), but in the German literature these anomalies belong to the same category, in which an anomaly occurs based on hypopla-sia of the bone. Blauth and Gekeler (1971) suggested a process in which deficiency of the middle phalanges in the central finger rays develops to form a diphalangeal or monophalangeal type of symbrachydactyly (Fig. 1). The hand in which hypoplasia of the bone develops more proximally by the same mechanism is regarded as an a...|$|E
