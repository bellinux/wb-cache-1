Extensional structures in the Las Parras and Calve basins are consistent with a roughly N-S oriented extension (locally NE-SW and NW-SE, perpendicular to the main normal faults). Thrusts show an overall E-W direction compatible with a near N-S shortening between the Late Eocene and the Early Miocene. Extension in the Algarve Basin was <b>accomodated</b> by ENE-WSW to NE-SW late Variscan faults; NW-SE transfer faults dipping to the Northeast also <b>accomodated</b> some extension and divided the area into sub-basins.
