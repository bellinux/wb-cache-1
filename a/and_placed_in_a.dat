5|$|On 19 June 1250, {{following}} the canonisation of Malcolm's wife Margaret by Pope Innocent IV, Margaret's remains were disinterred <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reliquary. Tradition {{has it that}} as the reliquary was carried to the high altar of Dunfermline Abbey, past Malcolm's grave, it became too heavy to move. As a result, Malcolm's remains were also disinterred, and buried next to Margaret beside the altar.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo 1 Command Module {{has never}} been on public display. After the accident, the {{spacecraft}} was removed and taken to Kennedy Space Center to facilitate the review board's disassembly in order to investigate {{the cause of the}} fire. When the investigation was complete, it was moved to the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> secured storage warehouse.|$|E
5|$|According to U.S. officials, bin Laden {{was buried}} at sea because no country would accept his remains. Before {{disposing}} of the body, the U.S. called the Saudi government, who approved of burying {{the body in}} the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board. The board was tilted upward {{on one side and the}} body slid off into the sea.|$|E

5|$|Augustine's {{body was}} {{originally}} {{buried in the}} portico {{of what is now}} St Augustine's, Canterbury, but it was later exhumed <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tomb within the abbey church, which became a place of pilgrimage and veneration. After the Norman Conquest the cult of St Augustine was actively promoted. After the Conquest, his shrine in St Augustine's Abbey held a central position in one of the axial chapels, flanked by the shrines of his successors Laurence and Mellitus. King Henry I of England granted St. Augustine's Abbey a six-day fair around the date on which Augustine's relics were translated to his new shrine, from 8 September through 13 September.|$|E
5|$|By the New Kingdom, {{the ancient}} Egyptians had perfected {{the art of}} mummification; the best {{technique}} took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body {{in a mixture of}} salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.|$|E
5|$|Como {{suffered}} a debilitating fall from a stage platform in 1971 while taping Perry Como's Winter Show in Hollywood. X-rays showed no serious injury to his knee, {{but by the}} next morning, it was twice its normal size. The ailing Como chartered a jet {{back to his home}} and doctors in Florida, where a second exam showed it had been seriously broken. His knee was re-set <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cast with a recuperation time of eight months. In 1993, he was successfully treated for bladder cancer. When Roselle died suddenly on August 12, 1998, at the age of 84, the couple had been married for 65 years. Como was reportedly devastated by her loss.|$|E

25|$|The Sea Beach Railroad {{was another}} steam {{railroad}}. This railroad {{was named after}} the Sea Beach Palace Hotel, its southern terminal in 1879. In 1913, it was electrified <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open cut.|$|R
5|$|Mulder, {{determining}} that Wayne is a Czech immigrant {{by the name}} of Ivan Veles, reaches the conclusion that Wayne is a demon who is trying to have a normal baby, and suspects that he terminates pregnancies when the fetus exhibits demon-like traits. Betsy has a dream similar to Laura's, but recognizes the dream-demon as her husband. Nevertheless, she loses her baby and tracks down Mulder and Scully. The two seek out Weinsider and catch him digging in Betsy's backyard. After a short conversation, the sheriff arrives at the house and shoots Weinsider. He is taken to hospital <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bed next to Laura. A mist passes from Weinsider's body into Laura's, at which point Weinsider dies and Laura recovers.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1942, Graf Zeppelin was towed back to Kiel <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{floating}} drydock. It seemed {{she might}} well see completion after all, but by late January 1943 Hitler {{had become so}} disenchanted with the Kriegsmarine, especially with what he perceived as the poor performance of its surface fleet, that he ordered all of its larger ships taken out of service and scrapped. Raeder was shortly relieved of command and replaced with the Commander of Submarines Karl Dönitz. Though Admiral Dönitz eventually persuaded Hitler to void most of the order, work on all new surface ships and even those nearing completion was halted, including Graf Zeppelin. On 30 January 1943, all major work on the ship ceased, though some limited, temporary work continued until March.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Song dynasty were adept sailors who {{traveled}} to {{ports of call}} {{as far away as}} Fatimid Egypt. They were well equipped for their journeys abroad, in large seagoing vessels steered by stern-post rudders and guided by the directional compass. Even before Shen Kuo and Zhu Yu had described the mariner's magnetic needle compass, the earlier military treatise of the Wujing Zongyao in 1044 had also described a thermoremanence compass. This was a simple iron or steel needle that was heated, cooled, <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bowl of water, producing the effect of weak magnetization, although its use was described only for navigation on land and not at sea.|$|E

25|$|On 28 March 1827, {{castings}} for a death mask were taken. The {{body was}} clothed <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oaken coffin, {{with the head}} given a wreath of white roses. Beethoven's hands held a wax cross and a lily.|$|R
50|$|In the {{simplest}} version, a long {{piece of rope}} is left <b>in</b> <b>a</b> basket <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open field, usually by a fakir. The rope levitates, with no external support. A boy assistant, a jamoora, climbs the rope and then descends.|$|R
5|$|The Code of Hammurabi was {{inscribed on}} a stele <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> public place {{so that all}} could see it, {{although}} {{it is thought that}} few were literate. The stele was later plundered by the Elamites and removed to their capital, Susa; it was rediscovered there in 1901 in Iran and is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris. The code of Hammurabi contained 282 laws, written by scribes on 12 tablets. Unlike earlier laws, it was written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylon, and could therefore be read by any literate person in the city.|$|E
5|$|The Ulster County Department of Social Services {{received}} {{reports from}} neighbors and physicians of Tina Santosky regarding her injuries: a broken femur, bruises, and cuts. Suspecting child abuse, Bernhardt S. Kramer, the Commissioner of the Ulster County Department of Social Services initiated parental neglect proceedings and removed Tina Santosky from {{the custody of}} her parents, John and Annie Santosky, in November 1973. 10 months later, the Santoskys' second child, John II, was removed after he {{was found to be}} suffering from malnutrition. On that same day, Annie Santosky gave birth to Jed, the couple's third child. Three days after Jed's birth, he was removed from their custody <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> foster home.|$|E
5|$|The {{body was}} re-cremated during the funeral, but Đức's heart {{remained}} intact {{and did not}} burn. It {{was considered to be}} holy <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> glass chalice at Xá Lợi Pagoda. The intact heart relic is regarded as a symbol of compassion. Đức has subsequently been revered by Vietnamese Buddhists as a bodhisattva (Bồ Tát), and accordingly is often referred to in Vietnamese as Bồ Tát Thích Quảng Đức. On 21 August, the ARVN Special Forces of Nhu attacked Xá Lợi and other Buddhist pagodas across Vietnam. The secret police intended to confiscate Đức's ashes, but two monks had escaped with the urn, jumping over the back fence and finding safety at the U.S. Operations Mission next door. Nhu's men managed to confiscate Đức's charred heart.|$|E

Disposal such as hot {{composting}} or contained burning is {{done when}} safe and practical {{for the specific}} plant. Burning poison ivy can be fatal to humans.|$|R
50|$|Dallam {{was used}} for storage <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{inactive}} state {{after the end of}} the war, although it apparently was used in some manner by the 3320th Technical Training Wing at Amarillo AFB during the Korean War and in the 1950s. It was closed sometime around 1963 and sold off.|$|R

Bart, {{angered by the}} numerous tricks he has fallen for, attempts to get revenge by shaking up a beer in a paint shaker. When Homer opens the beer, it results in a massive explosion that puts him in the hospital, paralyzed <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wheelchair. While everyone waits for Homer to get well, the family remembers surviving similar hardships, shown {{in the form of}} clips from past episodes.|$|E
5|$|XF-104 53-7786 {{was lost}} in a crash on 11July1957 when it {{developed}} an uncontrollable fin flutter while flying chase for F-104A flight tests. The entire tail group was ripped from the airframe, and Lockheed test pilot Bill Park was forced to eject. Fin flutter was a known problem and the aircraft had been limited to speeds {{of no more than}} Mach0.95 {{at the time of the}} accident. Tony LeVier had attempted to have the aircraft removed from flight status <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> museum, arguing that its performance was not suitable for chase duties.|$|E
5|$|After showing {{interest}} {{in natural sciences}} in his youth, he studied at the University of Innsbruck. However, his university career was interrupted {{by the need to}} complete military service. He was stationed as a translator in eastern Europe during World War II, before being captured <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> prisoner of war camp. He was released in 1948, subsequently returning to Innsbruck to complete his studies. After completing his doctorate in 1950, Moser worked in England for six months, researching the symbiotic relationships between plants and fungi. Upon his return to Austria, he took up a position with the Federal Forestry Research Institute, where he remained until 1968, taking part in influential research on the use of mycorrhizal fungi in reforestation. He began lecturing at the University of Innsbruck in 1956, and in 1972 he became the inaugural head of the first Institute of Microbiology in Austria. He remained with the Institute until his retirement in 1991. His studies continued until his death in 2002. An influential mycologist, he received a number of awards throughout his life, and numerous fungal taxa have been named in his honour.|$|E
50|$|He died at <b>a</b> {{hospital}} <b>in</b> Bratislava, after <b>a</b> long illness. His ashes {{were returned}} to his hometown <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> urn at the Jewish cemetery. The Masonic Lodge provided support for his widow Anna, but she never recovered from his death and committed suicide by poisoning {{not long after the}} German Occupation.|$|R
40|$|In ‘MAKING: Anthropology, Archaeology, Art & Architecture’ Tim Ingold {{explores the}} act of making {{in the context of}} the {{creation}} of objects and the use of the maker’s materials.

30|$|Mixtures {{containing}} various {{amounts of}} graphite flakes and organosilane (5.00 g) were put <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tubular plastic reactor (i.d. 15 mm) <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ultrasonic bath (0.55 KW, water temperature ≈ 25 °C) for 24 h. Then, {{after they were}} centrifuged for 30 min at 4, 000 rpm, the gray to black liquid phase containing graphene was recovered.|$|R
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside {{the main body of}} the table, at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from {{the main body of the}} table <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} John Quiller Rowett, who had financed this last {{expedition}} {{and was a}} former schoolfriend of Shackleton’s from Dulwich College, South London, decided to present the James Caird to the college. It remained there until 1967, although its display building was severely damaged by bombs in 1944. In 1967, the boat {{was given to the}} care of the National Maritime Museum, and underwent restoration. It was then displayed by the museum until 1985, when it was returned to Dulwich College <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new location in the North Cloister, on a bed of stones gathered from South Georgia and Aberystwyth. This site has become the James Cairds permanent home, although the boat is sometimes lent to major exhibitions and has taken part in the London Boat Show and in events at Greenwich, Portsmouth, and Falmouth. It has travelled overseas to be exhibited in Washington, D.C., New York, Sydney, Australia and Bonn, Germany.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's {{body was}} {{unloaded}} from the Victory at the Nore. It was conveyed upriver in Commander Grey's yacht Chatham to Greenwich <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lead coffin, {{and that in}} another wooden one, made from the mast of L'Orient which had been salvaged after the Battle of the Nile. He lay in state in the Painted Hall at Greenwich for three days, before being taken upriver aboard a barge, accompanied by Lord Hood, chief mourner Sir Peter Parker, and the Prince of Wales. The Prince of Wales at first announced his intention of attending the funeral as chief mourner, but later attended in a private capacity with his brothers when his father George III reminded {{him that it was}} against protocol for the Heir to the Throne to attend the funerals of anyone except members of the Royal Family. The coffin was taken into the Admiralty for the night, attended by Nelson's chaplain, Alexander Scott. The next day, 9 January, a funeral procession consisting of 32 admirals, over a hundred captains, and an escort of 10,000 soldiers took the coffin from the Admiralty to St Paul's Cathedral. After a four-hour service he was interred in the crypt within a sarcophagus originally carved for Cardinal Wolsey. The sailors charged with folding the flag draping Nelson's coffin and placing it in the grave instead tore it into fragments, with each taking a piece as a memento.|$|E
