50|$|The use of {{armoured}} {{vehicles in the}} Chaco were relatively ineffective due to their scant numbers, the lack of doctrine or experience in their use, the harsh climate and bushy terrain of the Chaco, and the logistic difficulties faced by the Bolivian Army.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the surrealists of London and Birmingham improved greatly with the arrival in London in mid-1938 of the Belgian E. L. T. Mesens, who had some sympathy with the Birmingham artists' views and whose role as Director of the London Gallery made him effectively the leader of London surrealism. Maddox was invited to the group's October 1938 meeting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> personal <b>insistence</b> <b>of</b> André Breton and both he and Melville exhibited in the Living Art in England exhibition of 1939.|$|R

He continued making films until 2009, retiring after the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease made the production of 36 vues du pic Saint-Loup too {{difficult for him to}} continue. Many of his films are known for their long running time, including the 760-minute Out 1.

40|$|Most {{research}} {{surveys in}} recent years have revealed that problems of language permeate every aspect of life of migrant communities. Migrants who have attained a reasonable command of English are likely to be better adjusted and therefore more easily accepted by the host society and less vulnerable to exploitation than are other members of their community; circumstances which obviously make for easier assimilation. A methodological study was set up to investigate degrees in acquiring the varying standards of knowledge of English among Lebanese migrants, attempts made to learn English after immigration, <b>the</b> language spoken <b>at</b> home, <b>the</b> <b>insistence</b> <b>of</b> parents that their children learn English, and several other measurements. Specifically designed questions and a brief multidimensional test were employed to assist in the overall analysis...|$|R

Beebe earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard in 1926, only to be expelled during graduate school.|$|R
