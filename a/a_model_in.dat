5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could {{only do so}} in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.|$|E

40|$|Summary Woody plants exhibit {{significant}} and predictable patterns {{of change in}} morphology and physiology as they be-come older and larger. Four models of potential pathways con-trolling these changes are presented: <b>a</b> stimulus–response <b>model</b> <b>in</b> which fully developed organs respond to changes in environment (defined here as everything external to the organ); <b>an</b> extrinsic <b>model</b> <b>in</b> which the attributes of developing organs are determined by environmental factors; <b>an</b> intrinsic <b>model</b> <b>in</b> which changes {{are a result of}} programmed changes in gene ex-pression; and <b>an</b> extrinsic–intrinsic <b>model</b> <b>in</b> which changes in gene expression are induced by environmental factors. We re-view evidence that a genetic component is involved in control-ling age- and size-related changes in foliar morphology and physiology and discuss the possibility of complex interactions among model pathways...|$|R

5|$|An {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} X-ray diffraction {{can be obtained}} from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three Miller indices (h, k, l), and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X-ray wavelength λ.|$|E
5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The result is <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, {{the action of}} a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, {{there are two kinds of}} matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.|$|E

5|$|Martinez {{began working}} as <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> order to further her {{professional}} wrestling career. She also {{worked as an}} actress, and after being cast in an independent film about wrestling, she was introduced to a wrestling promoter and trainer. She trained at his school {{for two and a}} half years. Martinez first wrestled in Southern California under the ring name Desire, appearing in several independent promotions such as Revolution Pro Wrestling, Empire Wrestling Federation (EWF) and Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), where she worked as the storyline sister of Kyra. While in UPW, she also competed under the name Halloween Barbie. She also had a run in Women's Extreme Wrestling, where she played the storyline cousin of Mercedes Martinez. On July 19, 2002, Martinez, under the name Desire, teamed with Threat to win the vacant EWF Tag Team Championship in a battle royal. They held the championship for 28 days, before losing it to PHAT (Eric Matlock and Devon Willis) on August 16. In December 2004, Martinez trained at World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)'s developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) for a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on October 9, 1876. His {{earliest}} pattern coins designed {{during his tenure}} at the Philadelphia Mint were intended for the half dollar. In 1876, Morgan enrolled {{as a student at}} the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts to prepare to create a new Liberty head design. Morgan also obtained studies from nature of the bald eagle for preparation of the reverse design. For the representation of Liberty, Morgan sought to depict an American woman rather than the usual Greek–style figures. Morgan's friend, artist Thomas Eakins, suggested he use Anna Willess Williams of Philadelphia as <b>a</b> <b>model.</b> <b>In</b> total, Morgan had five sittings with Williams; he declared her profile to be the most perfect he had seen.|$|E
5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E
30|$|Some {{organizations}} chose <b>a</b> centralized <b>model,</b> <b>in</b> which <b>an</b> identifiable, discrete design lab developed early-stage {{ideas for}} implementation in operating departments. In most cases, these labs provided internal training programs. An alternative was <b>a</b> distributed <b>model,</b> <b>in</b> which the design program was {{spread across the}} operating divisions. There were also hybrid <b>models,</b> where <b>a</b> relatively small centralized team acted as a focal unit for design and supported design programs across the organization. A fourth approach was <b>a</b> collaborative <b>model,</b> <b>in</b> which organizations shared facilities, ideas, and technology with other, noncompeting organizations.|$|R

5|$|With the {{appearance}} of both Ulysses and T. S. Eliot's poem, The Waste Land, 1922 was a key year {{in the history of}} English-language literary modernism. In Ulysses, Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters. The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the Odyssey of Homer in modern Dublin and represents Odysseus (Ulysses), Penelope and Telemachus in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly Bloom and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as <b>a</b> <b>model.</b> <b>In</b> order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of Thom's Directory—a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.|$|E
