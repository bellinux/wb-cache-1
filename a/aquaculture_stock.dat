50|$|One of {{the primary}} {{concerns}} with mariculture {{is the potential for}} disease and parasite transfer. Farmed stocks are often selectively bred to increase disease and parasite resistance, as well as improving growth rates and quality of products. As a consequence, the genetic diversity within reared stocks decreases with every generation - meaning they can potentially reduce the genetic diversity within wild populations if they escape into those wild populations. Such genetic pollution from escaped <b>aquaculture</b> <b>stock</b> can reduce the wild population’s ability to adjust to the changing natural environment. Also, maricultured species can harbour diseases and parasites (e.g., lice) which can be introduced to wild populations upon their escape. An example of this is the parasitic sea lice on wild and farmed Atlantic salmon in Canada. Also, non-indigenous species which are farmed may have resistance to, or carry, particular diseases (which they picked up in their native habitats) which could be spread through wild populations if they escape into those wild populations. Such ‘new’ diseases would be devastating for those wild populations because they would have no immunity to them.|$|E

The primary focus of this present study is to develop molecular tools to identify family relationships (pedigree assignment) and genes associated with traits (genetic parameters and functional markers) within aquaculture breeding programs, enabling effective management of genetic resources and optimizing of selection response. In essence this research will drive a necessary shift from mass selection based on phenotypes (the visible appearance of the animal) which currently dominates Australian aquaculture, often without regard to family relationships and inbreeding levels, to one that incorporates selection based on genetic information such as functional markers and information from relatives, while managing genetic diversity and rates of inbreeding.

Nevertheless, despite their {{economic}} importance and overexploitation, scarce genetic resources are available. In this work, we newly determined the complete mitochondrial genomes of these four representatives of the family Donacidae, {{with the aim of}} contributing to unveil phylogenetic relationships within the Veneroida order, and of developing genetic markers being useful in wedge clam identification and authentication, and <b>aquaculture</b> <b>stock</b> management. The complete female mitochondrial genomes of the four species vary in size from 17, 044 to 17, 365 bp, and encode 13 protein-coding genes (including the atp 8 gene), 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs, all located on the same strand. A long non-coding region was identified {{in each of the four}} Donax species between cob and cox 2 genes, presumably corresponding to the Control Region. The Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the Veneroida order indicate that all four species of Donax form a single clade as a sister group of other bivalves within the Tellinoidea superfamily. However, although Tellinoidea is actually monophyletic, none of its families are monophyletic.

To understand the potential feasibility of hybridization {{between the two}} species, two-by-two factorial cross-experiments were conducted in Shenzhen (Guangdong province). An asymmetry in fertilization was revealed: C. hongkongensis eggs could be fertilized by C. angulata sperm, but the reciprocal cross was not possible. The fertilization and hatching success in the C. hongkongensis females x C. angulata males (HA) cross was lower than the two intraspecific crosses. Moreover, hybrid larvae had a slower growth rate than those from parental progenies due to genome incompatibility. However, {{the size of the}} spat and adult growth were greater than those of the two parental progeny, with obvious heterosis during the grow-out stage.

As long as strong genotype-environment interaction for production traits is maintained by artificial selection, the economic self-interest of farmers should ensure the stability of genetic polymorphisms among breeds.

With regard to supply of quality seeds on consistent and sustainable basis, the Department of Fisheries (DoF) supports both the government and private sector hatcheries to produce quality seeds. The Good aquaculture practices (GAPs) and Code of conduct (CoC) which comply with the environmental theme are also applied.

40|$|Of the 430 + extant {{species of}} Gyrodactylus, ectoparasitic monogenetic flukes of aquatic vertebrates, Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg, 1957 {{is arguably the}} most well-known. Following the {{introduction}} of this species into Norway in the 1970 s with consignments of infected Atlantic salmon smolts, Salmo salar L., this species has had a devastating impact on the Norwegian Atlantic salmon population, decimating wild stocks in over 40 rivers. Gyrodactylus salaris is the only OIE (Office International des Epizooties) listed parasitic pathogen of fish and has been reported from 19 countries across Europe, though many of these records require confirmation. The UK, Ireland and some selected watersheds in Finland are currently recognised as G. salaris-free states; however, the threat that this notifiable parasite poses to the salmon industry in the UK and Ireland is of national concern. Current British contingency plans are {{based on the assumption that}} if G. salaris were to be introduced, the parasite would follow similar dynamics to those on salmonid stocks from across Scandinavia, i. e. that Atlantic strains of Atlantic salmon would be highly susceptible to infection, with mortalities resulting; that brown trout, Salmo trutta fario L., would be resistant and would lose their infection in a relatively short period of time; and that grayling, Thymallus thymallus (L.), would also be resistant to infection, but would carry parasites, at a low level, for up to 143 days. Two of the objectives of this study were to confirm the current distribution of G. salaris across Europe, and then, to investigate the relative susceptibility of British salmonids to G. salaris, to determine whether they would follow a similar pattern of infection to their Scandinavian counterparts or whether, given their isolation since the last glaciation and potential genetic differences, they would exhibit different responses. It has been almost six years since the distribution of G. salaris across Europe was last evaluated. Some of the European states identified as being G. salaris-positive, however, are ascribed this status based on misidentifications, on partial data resulting from either morphological or molecular tests, or according to records that have not been revisited. Additional Gyrodactylus material from selected salmonids was obtained from several countries to contribute to current understanding regarding the distribution of G. salaris across Europe. From the work conducted in the study, G. salaris is reported from Italy for the first time, alongside three other species, and appears to occur extensively throughout the central region without causing significant mortalities to their rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), hosts. The analysis of archive material from G. salaris-positive farms would suggest that G. salaris has been in the country for at least 12 years. Material obtained from rainbow trout from Finland and Germany was confirmed as G. salaris supporting existing data for these countries. No specimens of G. salaris, however, were found in the additional Gyrodactylus material obtained from Portuguese and Spanish rainbow trout, only Gyrodactylus teuchis Lautraite, Blanc, Thiery, Daniel et Vigneulle, 1999, a morphologically similar species was found. Gyrodactylus salaris is now reported from 23 out of 50 recognised states throughout Europe, only 17 of these however, have been confirmed by either morphology or by an appropriate molecular test, and only ten of these records have been confirmed by a combination of both methods. To assess the susceptibility of English and Welsh salmonids to G. salaris, a number of salmonid stocks of wild origin, were flown to the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI) in Oslo, where they were experimentally challenged with G. salaris. Atlantic salmon from the Welsh River Dee, S. trutta fario from the English River Tyne and T. thymallus from the English River Nidd, raised from wild stock in government hatcheries, were flown out and subsequently challenged with G. salaris haplotype A. After acclimation, each fish was infected with 50 – 70 G. salaris and marked, so that parasite numbers on individual fish could be followed. The dynamics on individual fish were followed against a control (Lierelva Atlantic salmon). The experiment found that the number of G. salaris on S. salar from the River Dee continued to rise exponentially to a mean intensity (m. i.) of 3851 G. salaris fish- 1 (day 40 post-infection). These salmon were highly susceptible, more so than the Norwegian salmon control (m. i. 1989 G. salaris fish- 1 d 40 post-infection) and were unable to regulate parasite numbers. The S. trutta fario and T. thymallus populations, although initially susceptible, were able to control and reduce parasite burdens after 12 (m. i. 146 G. salaris fish- 1) and 19 (m. i. 253 G. salaris fish- 1) days, respectively when peak infections were seen. Although the latter two hosts were able to limit their G. salaris numbers, both hosts carried infections for up to 110 days (i. e. when the experiment was terminated). The ability of S. trutta fario and T. thymallus to carry an infection for long periods increases the window of exposure and the potential transfer of G. salaris to other susceptible hosts. The potential role that brown trout may play in the transmission and spread of G. salaris in the event of an outbreak, needs to be considered carefully, as well as the interpretation of the term “resistant” which is commonly used when referring to brown trout’s susceptibility to G. salaris. The current British surveillance programmes for G. salaris are focused on the screening of Atlantic salmon and on the monitoring of the rainbow trout movements. The findings from this study demonstrate that G. salaris can persist on brown trout for long periods, and suggest that brown trout sites which overlap with Atlantic salmon or rainbow trout sites are also included within surveillance programmes and that the role that brown trout could play in disseminating infections needs to be factored into contingency/management plans. 	Throughout the course of the study, a number of parasite samples were sent to the Aquatic Parasitology Laboratory at Stirling for evaluation. Some of these samples represented Gyrodactylus material that were associated with fish mortalities, but the species of Gyrodactylus responsible appeared to be new to science.

Therefore, the elimination of the use of trash fish would greatly reduce the environmental impacts of spiny lobster aquaculture.

SNPs found within or near a coding sequence are of particular interest {{because they are more}} likely to alter the biological function of a protein. We aimed to use SNPs to identify markers and genes associated with genetic variation in growth. RNA-Seq whole-transcriptome analysis of pooled cDNA samples from a population of rainbow trout selected for improved growth versus unselected genetic cohorts (10 fish from 1 full-sib family each) identified SNP markers associated with growth-rate. The allelic imbalances (the ratio between the allele frequencies of the fast growing sample and that of the slow growing sample) were considered at scores > 5. 0 as an amplification and < 0. 2 as loss of heterozygosity. A subset of SNPs (n =  54) were validated and evaluated for association with growth traits in 778 individuals of a three-generation parent/offspring panel representing 40 families. Twenty-two SNP markers and one mitochondrial haplotype were significantly associated with growth traits. Polymorphism of 48 of the markers was confirmed in other commercially important <b>aquaculture</b> <b>stocks.</b> Many markers were clustered into genes of metabolic energy production pathways and are suitable candidates for genetic selection. The study demonstrates that RNA-Seq at low sequence coverage of divergent populations is a fast and effective means of identifying SNPs, with allelic imbalances between phenotypes. This technique is suitable for marker development in non-model species lacking complete and well-annotated genome reference sequences...|$|R
40|$|The giant {{or black}} tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon, was {{formerly}} the dom- inant cultured shrimp species in Asia. Since approximately 2002, {{it has been}} essentially replaced by the domesticated American whiteleg shrimp P. vannamei. The change in dominant species has affected disease concerns. For both species, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and yellow head virus (YHV) are the most lethal. For P. monodon, the next most important dis- eases are hepatopancreatic parvovirus (HPV) and monodon baculovirus (MBV). For P. vannamei, they are taura syndrome virus (TSV) and infec- tious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV). TSV was introduced to Asia in 1998 by careless importation of shrimp <b>stocks</b> for <b>aquaculture</b> but has not been reported to cause problems with local crus- tacean species. IHHNV, which is endemic in Asia, is harmless to P. mon- odon but poses a constant threat to IHHNV-free stocks of P. vannamei if they are hatched and reared in Asia under non-biosecure conditions. An emerging disease for P. monodon is monodon slow growth syndrome (MSGS), a component of {{which seems to be}} Laem-Singh virus (LSNV). Infectious myonecrosis virus (IMNV) is a P. vannamei disease, first report- ed from Brazil but now reported in Indonesia where it was probably intro- duced by careless importation of shrimp <b>aquaculture</b> <b>stocks.</b> So far, IMNV has not been reported in other Asian countries. Penaeus vannamei nodavirus (PvNV) is a new pathogen first reported from Belize in 2004 with gross and histological signs that are indistinguishable from those of IMNV. The disease has not yet affected Asian culture. A more recent disease of P. vannamei in Asia is abdominal segment deformity disease (ASDD), possi- bly caused by a yet unknown local virus...|$|R
40|$|Rainbow trout is {{a native}} species from the Northwest cost of North America {{and a member of}} the salmonid family. It is a species of major {{importance}} for <b>aquaculture,</b> wild <b>stock</b> fisheries and recreational sport fisheries. Beside its economical importance, rainbow trout is also extensively used as a model species in many biological disciplines. From an evolutionary genomic point of view, the rainbow trout genome is extremely interesting due to a whole genome duplication event, which occurred 88 – 96 Mya in the salmonid lineage. With the advent of next generation sequencing technologies, a large number of genomic tools are now available in that species including a whole genome sequence. This chapter provides a synthetic review of the current knowledge on rainbow trout genomics and what biological information has been obtained following the analysis of its genome...|$|R

40|$|The annual {{production}} from global aquaculture has increased rapidly from 2. 6 million tons or 3. 9 % {{of the total}} supply of fish, shellfish and mollusks in 1970, to 66. 7 million tons or 42. 2 % in 2012, while capture fisheries have more or less leveled out at about 90 million tons per year {{since the turn of}} the century. Consequently, the future seafood supply is likely to depend on a further increase of aquaculture production. Unlike terrestrial animal farming, less than 10 % of the aquaculture production comes from domesticated and selectively bred farm stocks. This situation has substantial consequences in terms of poorer resource efficiency, poorer product quality and poorer animal welfare. The history of biological and technical challenges when establishing selective breeding programs for aquaculture is discussed, and it is concluded that most aquaculture species may now be domesticated and improved by selection. However, the adoption of selective breeding in aquaculture is progressing slowly. This paper reports on a study carried out in 2012 to identify key issues to address in promoting the development of genetically improved <b>aquaculture</b> <b>stocks.</b> The study involved semi structured interviews of 34 respondents from different sectors of the aquaculture society in East and Southeast Asia, where 76 % of the global aquaculture production is located. Based on the interviews and literature review, three key factors are identified: (i) long-term public commitment is often needed for financial support of the breeding nucleus operation (at least during the first five to ten generations of selection); (ii) training at all levels (from government officers and university staff to breeding nucleus and hatchery operators, as well as farmers); and (iii) development of appropriate business models for benefit sharing between the breeding, multiplier and grow-out operators (whether being public, cooperative or private operations). The public support should be invested in efforts of selective breeding on the most important and highest volume species, which may not be a priority for investment by private breeders due to, for instance, long generation intervals and delays in return to investment...|$|R
50|$|As in most <b>aquaculture</b> based systems, <b>stock</b> feed often {{consists}} of fish meal derived from lower-value species. Ongoing depletion of wild fish stocks makes this practice unsustainable. Organic fish feeds {{may prove to}} be a viable alternative that relieves this concern. Other alternatives include growing duckweed with an aquaponics system that feeds the same fish grown on the system, excess worms grown from vermiculture composting, using prepared kitchen scraps, as well as growing black soldier fly larvae to feed to the fish using composting grub growers.|$|R
40|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{is essential}} for salmon <b>aquaculture</b> and <b>stock</b> enhancement programs, but may lead to genetic bottlenecks, inbreeding, and domestication selection. To evaluate the potential for incorporating mate choice into commercial and conservation salmon breeding programs, I measured the effects of mate choice on offspring phenotype. Semi-natural spawning channels were used to compare mate-choice and randomly mated (hatchery) fish for performance and morphological traits. Channel-spawned fish were out-performed by their hatchery counterparts in survival and body size; genetic and environmental effects contributed to these differences. However, channel-spawned fish had significantly more additive genetic variance for performance traits. Gene transcription of hatchery-bred and channel-spawned fish were compared using microarray analysis after a temperature stress. Few genes showed differential expression; however, overall transcriptional variance was lower in the channel-spawned fish. Mate choice {{should be included in}} rearing programs to increase the viability and adaptive potential of captive fish...|$|R
500|$|The {{introduction}} of non-native species into South Florida {{is a considerable}} problem for the park. Many of the biological controls like weather, disease, and consumers that naturally limit plants in their native environments do {{not exist in the}} Everglades, causing many to grow larger and multiply far beyond their average numbers in their native habitats. Approximately 26percent of all fish, reptiles, birds, and mammal species in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Species that adapt the most aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, by spreading quickly or competing with native species that are sometimes threatened or endangered, are called [...] "invasive". Thousands of exotic plant species have been observed in South Florida, usually introduced as ornamental landscaping, but park staff must eradicate such invasive plants as melaleuca tree (Melaleuca quinquenervia), Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius), and Old World climbing fern (Lygodium microphyllum). Similarly, animals often do not find the predators or natural barriers to reproduction in the Everglades as they do where they originate, thus they often reproduce more quickly and efficiently. Lobate lac scale insects (Paratachardina pseudolobata) kill shrubs and other plants in hardwood hammocks. Bromeliad beetles (Metamasius callizona) destroy bromeliads and the ecosystems they host. Walking catfish (Clarias batrachus) can deplete <b>aquaculture</b> <b>stocks</b> and carry enteric septicemia. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) listed eight [...] "Reptiles of Concern", including the Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus), focusing on them for their large sizes and aggressive natures, allowing licensed hunters to kill any listed animals in protected areas and sell their meat and hides. Burmese pythons, two subspecies of African rock pythons (Python sebae; northern and southern), and yellow anacondas (Eunectes notaeus) were banned from import into the U.S. in 2012. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced the inclusion of these reptiles at Everglades National Park. Exotic species control falls under the management of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which has been compiling and disseminating information about invasive species since 1994. Control of invasive species costs $500million a year, but [...] of land in South Florida remains infested.|$|R
