5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1950s, plans for a Tulsa freeway system {{included}} a route along 96th Street South. The 96th Street corridor was accessible to more motorists than other corridors further south (farther away from the urban core), while still having low right-of-way costs, comparable to more southerly corridors. This made it the ideal route for a south Tulsa freeway. In 1986, ODOT had plans to build <b>a</b> <b>toll-free</b> facility called the Creek Freeway in the corridor as part of SH-117.|$|E

5|$|East of NY198, {{the road}} becomes more open {{as it passes}} through neighborhoods with a more {{suburban}} residential feel to them. Along this stretch, NY33 connects to several streets, including Bailey Avenue (U.S. Route62 or US62) and Harlem Road (NY240). Past Harlem Road, the expressway makes a slight curve to the south as it prepares to meet <b>a</b> <b>toll-free</b> section of the New York State Thruway (I-90) at a cloverleaf interchange. Beyond I-90, the expressway veers to the south again, traversing an S-curve before connecting to Union Road (NY277) {{by way of a}} partial interchange. After another , NY33 curves south under Genesee Street before joining it at a traffic light in front of the Buffalo Niagara International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of I-287's New Jersey portion in 1993, more out-of-state tractor trailer drivers began to use the alignment of Route31 as <b>a</b> <b>toll-free</b> alternative to the New Jersey Turnpike. On July 16, 1999, oversize trucks were banned from using Route31 {{as part of a}} larger statewide ban imposed on New Jersey roads not a part of the National Highway System by then-governor Christine Todd Whitman. The legislation had a significant effect on trucks that followed Route31 as it forced them to use I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike instead. In themid-2000s, the portion of Route31 was widened during extensive construction between Flemington and Clinton that widened the road to four lanes.|$|E
5|$|Potential contestants of the {{original}} primetime version had {{to compete in a}} telephone contest which had them dial <b>a</b> <b>toll-free</b> number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method. Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian Unity Council {{incorporated}} a Montreal-based lobbying group called Option Canada with the mandate to promote federalism in Quebec. Option Canada received $1.6 million in {{funding from the}} Canadian Heritage Department in 1994, $3.35 million in 1995 and $1.1 million in 1996. The Montreal Gazette reported in March 1997 that the group also had other funds from undeclared sources.

5|$|Also on November 28, 2006, a 14-disc DVD box set titled Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition was released, {{containing}} Superman, Superman II, , Superman III, Superman IV, Superman Returns, and , {{among other}} releases. All {{contents of the}} set were housed within a tin case. The set was valued at US$99.92, and received extremely positive reviews when first released. However, after only {{a day on the}} market, Warner Bros. announced that there were two errors discovered within the set. The first was that the 2.0 audio track on Superman, was instead the 5.1 audio track already on the disc. The second was that the Superman III disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. The set was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered <b>a</b> <b>toll-free</b> number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the set. Due to popular demand, a corrected set was released and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition returned to store shelves on May 29, 2007.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1932, the California State Highway Commission {{received}} a recommendation {{to purchase the}} road {{and was able to}} invest $418,000USD by 1936. However, the U.S. Navy owned rights to the right-of-way of part of the route, and opposed the purchase. This resulted in congressional actions to establish a clear title deed for the route. House Representative Richard J. Welch was one of the earliest government officials to pressure the State of California to acquire the toll road in order to convert it into <b>a</b> <b>toll-free</b> highway. He argued that having only one toll road to travel in order to reach the Golden Gate Bridge would benefit commuters; he also cited the ten and seventh-tenths-mile difference in distance between the toll road and a route through Napa. A Navy Department deed permitting the State to purchase the road was granted by the Attorney General on October 26, 1938. The highway then became signed as State Route 48 until the 1964 renumbering.|$|E
