5|$|Tracks {{discovered}} by Matthew Mossbrucker (Morrison Natural History Museum, Colorado) suggest that Stegosaurus lived in multiple-age herds. One group of tracks is interpreted as showing {{four or five}} baby stegosaurs moving in the same direction, while <b>another</b> <b>has</b> a juvenile stegosaur track with an adult track overprinting it. Stegosaurus may have preferred drier settings than other common Morrison Formation dinosaurs, such as Allosaurus, Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service is reconstructing {{one of the}} 36 {{residential}} blocks as {{a demonstration}} block (Block 14, adjacent to and west of the Visitor Center). One barrack appears {{as it would have}} when Japanese Americans first arrived at Manzanar in 1942, while <b>another</b> <b>has</b> been reconstructed to represent barracks life in 1945. Exhibits in these barracks opened on April 16, 2015. A restored World War II mess hall, moved to the site from Bishop Airport in 2002, was opened to visitors in late 2010.|$|E
5|$|The heads-up display, which simulates {{the inside}} of Samus' helmet, {{features}} a radar display, a map, ammunition for missiles, a health meter, a danger meter for negotiating hazardous landscape or materials, and a health bar and name display for bosses. The display can be altered by exchanging visors; one uses thermal imaging, <b>another</b> <b>has</b> x-ray vision, and another features a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses and interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. Metroid Prime introduces a hint system that provides the player with clues about ways to progress through the game.|$|E

25|$|Petroleum, in {{one form}} or <b>another,</b> <b>has</b> been used since ancient times, and is now {{important}} across society, including in economy, politics and technology. The rise in importance was due to the invention of the internal combustion engine, the rise in commercial aviation, and the importance of petroleum to industrial organic chemistry, particularly the synthesis of plastics, fertilizers, solvents, adhesives and pesticides.|$|E
25|$|The date of {{composition}} {{for both the}} Ganesha Purana and the Mudgala Purana, and their dating relative to one <b>another,</b> <b>has</b> {{been a matter of}} academic debate. Both works contain age-layered strata, but these strata have not been clearly defined through the process of critical editorship. Some strata of the available redactions of the Ganesha Purana and the Mudgala Purana probably reflect mutual influence upon one another, including direct references to one another.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, however, a {{repeatable}} method of anal dilation {{proved to be}} very effective and showed a very low incidence of side effects.

25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{property is}} that even if u has a discontinuity at an initial time t=t0, the temperature becomes smooth as soon as t>t0. For example, if a bar of metal has temperature 0 and <b>another</b> <b>has</b> temperature 100 and they are stuck together end to end, then very quickly the temperature {{at the point of}} connection will become 50 and the graph of the temperature will run smoothly from 0 to 50.|$|E

There are many traditional stories about what happened to the Magi after this, with one having them baptised by St. Thomas on his way to India. <b>Another</b> <b>has</b> their remains found by Saint Helena and brought to Constantinople, and eventually making their way to Germany and the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral.|$|E

25|$|Sixth, {{critics have}} argued that the Beck Court misapplied its duty of fair {{representation}} doctrine. One legal commentator has concluded that the Supreme Court's duty of fair representation decisions do not lead to the conclusion that agency fees can be restricted solely to collective bargaining purposes. <b>Another</b> <b>has</b> argued that the modern labor unions can only meet their duty to fairly represent workers if they engage in lobbying and legislative activity, a conclusion which undercuts the Beck court's decision as well.|$|E
25|$|It is {{from these}} colophons and rarely from {{the texts of}} the poems themselves, that we gather the names of many kings and chieftains and the poets and poetesses patronised by them. The task of {{reducing}} these names to an ordered scheme in which the different generations of contemporaries can be marked off one <b>another</b> <b>has</b> not been easy. To add to the confusions, some historians have even denounced these colophons as later additions and untrustworthy as historical documents.|$|E

25|$|Imperial {{theology}} conscripted Rome's traditional cults as {{the divine}} upholders of Imperial Pax (peace) and prosperity, {{for the benefit}} of all. The emperor Augustus began the restoration of Ceres' Aventine Temple; his successor Tiberius completed it. Of the several figures on the Augustan Ara Pacis, one doubles as a portrait of the Empress Livia, who wears Ceres' corona spicea. <b>Another</b> <b>has</b> been variously identified in modern scholarship as Tellus, Venus, Pax or Ceres, or in Spaeth's analysis, a deliberately broad composite of them all.|$|E
25|$|One {{version has}} him {{throwing}} one purse for three consecutive nights. <b>Another</b> <b>has</b> him throwing the purses {{over a period}} of three years, each time the night before one of the daughters comes of age. Invariably, the third time the father lies in wait, trying to discover the identity of their benefactor. In one version the father confronts the saint, only to have Nicholas say it is not him he should thank, but God alone. In another version, Nicholas learns of the poor man's plan and drops the third bag down the chimney instead; a variant holds that the daughter had washed her stockings that evening and hung them over the embers to dry, and that the bag of gold fell into the stocking.|$|E
25|$|Predation is a {{biological}} interaction where a predator (a heterotroph that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators {{may or may}} not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation almost always results in the death of the prey. The other main category of consumption is detritivory, the consumption of dead organic matter. It can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviours, for example, where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on its decaying corpse. Selective pressures imposed on one <b>another</b> <b>has</b> led to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in various antipredator adaptations.|$|E
