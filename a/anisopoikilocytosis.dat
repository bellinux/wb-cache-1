50|$|<b>Anisopoikilocytosis</b> is {{a medical}} {{condition}} illustrated by a variance in size (anisocytosis) and shape (poikilocytosis) of a red blood cell. The underlying cause {{can be attributed to}} various anemias, most often; beta thalassemia major, a form of microcytic anemia. In β thalassemia major the beta hemoglobin chain is completely absent, rendering an increase in fetal hemoglobin (HbF).|$|E
40|$|Using fetal blood sampling, the {{diagnosis}} of triploidy can be strongly suspected {{on the basis of}} the peculiar hematological picture. Triploid fetuses present with anemia, marked <b>anisopoikilocytosis,</b> and grossly increased mean corpuscular volume, associated with thrombocytopenia and significant platelet anisocytosis. These findings are of considerable immediate diagnostic value. They allow physicians to immediately counsel parents about the prognosis of the fetus. In case of fetal or neonatal distress, this information could orientate decisions about obstetrical and pediatric management while waiting for the definitive diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Nineteen {{patients}} with morphological abnormalities {{of the red}} blood cells are described, and these formed approximately 3 % of the total cases of cardiac valvular disease. In two patients the abnormal blood film developed after the insertion of an aortic and mitral valve prosthesis respectively, but in another two patients the abnormal blood film was corrected by aortic valve surgery. <b>Anisopoikilocytosis</b> may {{have been associated with}} microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia in one patient, but in the others the cardiac valvular disease was severe and other mechanical factors were not present.

40|$|AbstractBasal {{complement}} activity {{presents a}} potential danger for “self” {{cells that are}} tightly protected by complement regulators including CD 59. Mice express two Cd 59 genes (mCd 59 a and mCd 59 b); mCd 59 b has approximately a 6 -fold higher specific activity than mCd 59 a. Consistently, mCd 59 b knockout mice present a strong phenotype characterized by hemolytic anemia with increased reticulocytes, <b>anisopoikilocytosis,</b> echinocytosis, schistocytosis, free hemoglobin in plasma, hemoglobinuria with hemosiderinuria, and platelet activation. Remarkably, mCd 59 b−/− males express a progressive loss of fertility associated with immobile dysmorphic and fewer sperm cells after 5 months of age. This work indicates that mCd 59 b is a key complement regulator in mice and that CD 59 is critical in protecting self cells; it also provides a novel model to study complement regulation in human diseases...|$|E
40|$|Unexplained global {{developmental}} {{delay and}} epilepsy in childhood pose a major socioeconomic burden. Progress {{in defining the}} molecular bases does not often translate into effective treatment. Notable exceptions include certain inborn errors of metabolism amenable to dietary intervention. CAD encodes a multifunctional enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Alternatively, pyrimidines can be recycled from uridine. Exome sequencing in three families identified biallelic CAD mutations in four children with global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, and anaemia with <b>anisopoikilocytosis.</b> Two died aged 4 and 5 years after a neurodegenerative disease course. Supplementation of the two surviving children with oral uridine led to immediate cessation of seizures in both. A 4 -year-old female, previously in a minimally conscious state, began to communicate and walk with assistance after 9 weeks of treatment. A 3 -year-old female likewise showed developmental progress. Blood smears normalized and anaemia resolved. We establish CAD as a gene confidently implicated in this neurometabolic disorder, characterized by co-occurrence of global developmental delay, dyserythropoietic anaemia and seizures. While the natural disease course can be lethal in early childhood, our findings support the efficacy of uridine supplementation, rendering CAD deficiency a treatable neurometabolic disorder and therefore a potential condition for future (genetic) newborn screening...|$|E
40|$|The {{bone marrow}} {{examination}} is useful {{in order to get}} an etiologic diagnosis of cytopenias and for the detection of opportunistic diseases in immunocompromised patients. Nevertheless, its role in the diagnosis of invasive infections caused by mycobacterium has not been clearly defined. We describe the case of a 42 -year-old woman who was admitted to study anemia, diarrhea and constitutional syndrome during two months with medical history of human immunodeficiency virus- 1 infection, old intravenous drug user, hepatitis C virus carrier, as well as having lymph node tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis during six years. The hematologic assessment was requested for the peripheral blood examination, which showed severe hyporegenerative anemia, rouleaux, <b>anisopoikilocytosis</b> and neutrophilia. In the bone marrow biopsy imprint we observed a very hypoplastic eritroid series and many macrophages with spread granularity and cytoplasm, similar to the Gaucherâs cells, which presented erythrophagocytosis and birefringence enlarge forms scattered throughout the smear, suggesting mycobacteria, with these findings, we established the diagnostic suspicion of disseminated mycobacterial disease and started the empirical treatment for Mycobacterium avium intracellulare-tuberculosis on the same day of the procedure, the etiology infection was later confirm by cultures. In this case, the {{bone marrow examination}} allowed to establish an early diagnostic suspicion from the hematology laboratory and to start the treatment before the microbiologic result...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS Nineteen {{patients}} with morphological abnormalities {{of the red}} blood cells are described, and these formed approximately 3 % of the total cases of cardiac valvular disease. In two patients the abnormal blood film developed after the insertion of an aortic and mitral valve prosthesis respectively, but in another two patients the abnormal blood film was corrected by aortic valve surgery. <b>Anisopoikilocytosis</b> may {{have been associated with}} microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia in one patient, but in the others the cardiac valvular disease was severe and other mechanical factors were not present. The mitral valve was involved in 16 patients and the aortic valve in eight. Elliptocytosis was the only abnormality in 11 blood films, schistocytes and burr cells were present in seven, and in three there were a few microspherocytes. Family studies in seven patients produced evidence of hereditary elliptocytosis in three. Anaemia was present in only two patients. One of these had infective endocarditis, and the other developed overt haemolytic anaemia following the replacement of a diseased mitral valve by a Starr-Edwards prosthesis. In this latter case there was a transiently positive direct antiglobulin test, and the anaemia and abnormal blood picture were corrected without further surgical treatment. Haemolytic anaemia did not develop in 23 patients after the insertion of an aortic valve prosthesi...|$|E
40|$|Background: Present {{study was}} carried out with {{objectives}} of creating a profile for cases of hemoglobinopathies coming at NHL medical college and comparing the results obtained in present study with those of various studies done in India and abroad. Materials and methods: The study {{was carried out}} at the Department of Pathology, N. H. L. Municipal Medical College, Ahmedabad. A total of 35 cases of thalassemias and other hemoglobinopathies were studied. The criteria for case selection were hemoglobin level less than 10 gm%, presence of hepatosplenomegaly, icterus and clinical presumption of hemolytic anemia in general. Details of the cases were recorded in a proforma. Data were then analysed using microsoft excel software. Results: Out of total 35 cases Beta 0 Thalassemia Major was the most frequent (40 %) followed by homozygous sickle cell disease (20 %). More than one third cases (34. 3 %) were of 10 {{or more years of}} age while 31. 4 % cases were in 1 - 3 years of age group. Sex wise distribution showed male preponderance (74. 3 %). Religion wise majority were hindus (80 %). Caste wise majority were of general category (83 %). Pallor was found in all cases. Most of the cases showed hypochromia, microcytosis, <b>Anisopoikilocytosis,</b> polychromatophilia. [National J of Med Res 2012; 2 (2. 000) : 137 - 140...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of extra copies of alpha-globin gene {{has been shown}} to worsen the degree of anemia in beta-thalassemia heterozygotes. We describe the clinical phenotype of eight Chinese subjects with heterozygosity for both triplicated alpha-globin gene and a beta 0 -thalassemia allele. They were identified through genotyping of beta-thalassemia intermedia and major patients, and through community-based thalassemia screening program in Hong Kong. Standard molecular techniques were used in the determination of genotype. All subjects in this series showed five copies of alpha-globin genes (alphaalphaalpha/alphaalpha) in association with a beta 0 -thalassemia allele. Although genotypically identical, six subjects showed a beta-thalassemia intermedia phenotype while two were clinically indistinguishable from beta-thalassemia minor, implying the {{presence of}} genetic modifying factors that remained undefined. Triplication of alpha-globin gene and heterozygosity for beta 0 -thalassemia accounted for 15 % of beta-thalassemia intermedia patients at our locality and was associated with a mild clinical phenotype. This genotype was not found among beta-thalassemia major patients. They presented in adulthood and were usually not transfusion dependent. When compared with simple beta-thalassemia heterozygotes, they showed obvious red cell abnormalities (hypochromasia, <b>anisopoikilocytosis,</b> circulating normoblasts), lower hemoglobin (Hb) and higher HbF levels. The presence of triplicated alpha-globin genes should always be considered in apparent beta-thalassemia carriers who were more symptomatic than expected, so that unnecessary investigations for the cause of anemia could be avoided. Finally, triplication of alpha-globin genes should be looked for in families with children affected by beta-thalassemia intermedia in which only one parent showed a picture of beta-thalassemia on Hb analysis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background: Inherited {{disorders}} of hemoglobin {{are extremely}} common in Indian population ranging from near structurally normal hemoglobins to severe transfusion dependant hemoglobinopathies. Their detection is important epidemiologically {{and to prevent}} other more serious hemoglobinopathies in future generations. Objectives: This is a retrospective study, where our objectives are to analyze the different hemoglobin (Hb) variants in West Bengal (WB) population and adjacent areas {{and to find out}} which particular district is at risk to which particular hemoglobinopathy. Materials & Methods: The study was done by BIORAD VARIANT using beta thalassemia (thal) short programme using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. Complete hemogram of all the surgical and other patients were available before HPLC study. Cases were referred mostly by surgeons and clinicians either after getting abnormal hemogram or for premarital counseling. Results: Out of 14, 145 cases 74. 35 % (10, 518 cases) showed normal Hb pattern on HPLC and rest 26. 65 % (3627 cases) showed some abnormality. Common hemoglobinopathies included beta thal trait, E trait, E beta thal, persistent fetal Hb, thal major, thal minor, HbS trait. Other disorders were rare (< 0. 01 %). Complete hemogram was done in all cases & <b>anisopoikilocytosis,</b> hypochromia, and abnormal RDW were found in majority of cases. MCV was generally normal to very low. District wise HbS and beta thal were more common in western part of West Bengal and HbE is more prevalent in central and north-east part of West Bengal. Conclusion: Abnormal hemoglobins as HbE and beta thal is very common in West Bengal. However many other Hb variants including mixed patterns are also found HPLC provides a rapid and accurate method to analyze these Hb variants and by quantifying HbA 2 level prevents occurrence of more serious hemoglobinopathies in future generations...|$|E
40|$|Fixation {{procedures}} (Bessis and Weed, 1972) ] for the SEM {{observation of}} erythrocytes nowadays prove reliable, so that most artifacts are prevented from occurring. Thus SEM {{results in a}} useful method for examining normal and haemolytic patterns. Normal reticulocytes are polylobulate since they undergo through the splenic slits shape remodeling and foreign body extrusion. In premature infants the latter may occur spontaneously throughout the circulation owing to spleen immaturity. Spherocytosis is due to ATP depletion in the oldest cells and thus represents the normal pre-lytic stage. Such deformation is present in most erythrocytes during the haemolytic bouts of hereditary spherocytosis and in most defects of anaerobic glycolysis. Like hereditary spherocytosis, also elliptocytosis is caused by protein n mbrane defects. The hallmark of thalassaemias is <b>anisopoikilocytosis,</b> due to increased membrane-haemoglobin content ratio. To overlapping unbalance of the globin chain synthesis ratio, more marked surface deformations in alpha- than in beta-thalassaemia correspond. In Hb H disease chain excess precipitates peripherally, in Cooley's anaemia centrally as large clusters. This {{is due to the}} more hydrophylic conditions of beta chains (Zavagli et al., 1982) 2. Thalassaemia may be associated with other abnormal haemoglobins, such as Hb S. Haemolysis may also be due to physical agents, namely shearing stress caused by (a) fibrin deposition throughout the microcirculation, such as in Moschkowitz and Gasser syndromes, (b) prosthetic heart valves, and (c) march haemoglobinuria. IgG-caused haemolytic anaemia may or mav not be associated with complement involvement: early stages may occur intravascularly, but lysis is completed in the spleen and liver through phagocytic receptors. Conversely paroxysmal noctural haemoglobinuria (PNH) is exclusively complement-mediated owing to the characteristic red cell susceptibility to such lytic system. Scanning can reliably distinguish PNH II from PNH III cells (Zavagli et al., 1978) ...|$|E
