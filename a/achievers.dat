40|$|This thesis reports students’ reading {{strategies}} and reasons for using those strategies in comprehending reading materials at one Senior High School in Ternate, North Maluku, Indonesia. This {{study was conducted}} to find out the reading strategies most frequently used by high <b>achiever</b> students, middle <b>achiever</b> students and low <b>achiever</b> students. It also investigated the similarities and differences of reading {{strategies and}} the students’ reasons for using those strategies in comprehending English text. According to Oxford (1990), the strategy consists of direct and indirect strategies. A direct strategy includes memory, cognitive, and compensation strategies while an indirect strategy deals with metacognitive, affective and social strategies. This study utilized a qualitative research design to get deep understanding about reading strategies most frequently used by high, middle, and low <b>achiever</b> students, the similarities and differences of reading strategies, and the students’ reasons in using those strategies. The data were taken from two sources namely questionnaire and interview. The data from the questionnaires covered the students’ reading strategies and the similarities and differences of reading strategies while the interview data covered students’ reasons in employing reading strategies. The analysis of the data from questionnaires indicated that high <b>achiever</b> students most frequently used cognitive strategies followed by metacognitive, memory, compensation, affective and social reading strategies. The middle <b>achiever</b> students most frequently used cognitive strategies followed by metacognitive, affective, social, and memory strategies while the low <b>achiever</b> students most frequently used cognitive strategies followed by social, metacognitive and affective strategies. The result of the study also indicated that there were 11 similarities of reading strategies which were employed by the different level of students (high, middle, and low <b>achiever</b> students) in different context to create/construct a context, social interaction, and as a form of self-improvement. The data from the interview revealed that all the students used reading strategies to understand a text however the low <b>achiever</b> students employed those strategies to do the exercises which were given by their English teacher. Based on the findings, this study recommends that the English teacher should encourage the low <b>achiever</b> students to employ reading strategies most frequently used by high <b>achiever</b> students. For the further study, the researcher should consider on how to apply those reading strategies in improving the low <b>achiever</b> students’ achievement and the relationship between reading strategies and reading comprhension. This study also recommends that the government should conduct teacher training and provide reading materials such as: books, magazine and newspaper in English to motivate the students in doing reading activities and increase their reading skills...|$|R

A lecturer {{is supposed to}} know some information related to students' learning styles particularly low <b>achiever</b> students {{so that they are}} able to attend the activities in the class and comprehend the given materials. This study focused on identifying the low <b>achiever</b> students' learning styles in Reading class at UMM, the problems in applying learning styles, and the solutions for solving the problems in applying learning styles. Descriptive qualitative research was employed in this study {{due to the fact that}} this study explored about low <b>achiever</b> students' learning styles, the problems they faced, and the the solutions for solving the problems. The respondents of this study were students categorized as low <b>achiever.</b> In addition, the criteria of low <b>achiever</b> students were based on their scores in Reading subject that was 54 and below. Grounded on the results and discussion of the study, it could be concluded that there were three kinds of learning styles applied by low <b>achiever</b> students in Reading class (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic). Besides, the problems faced by low <b>achiever</b> students in Reading class comprised: (1) the condition of the class was noisy; (2) the lecturer was too fast in explaining the material; (3) the learners felt bored for the same teaching activity; (4) the presentation activities did not run well.
