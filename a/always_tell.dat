25|$|Hitchcock was a film fan {{from his}} teenage years, and in 1919 began his film {{career at the}} age of twenty, working as a title card {{designer}} for the London branch of the American firm Famous Players-Lasky, the production arm of Paramount Pictures, at Islington Studios. After Famous Players-Lasky pulled out of London in 1922, Hitchcock stayed as part of the studio staff. He was hired by a new firm run by Michael Balcon and others after being noticed at work on the short film <b>Always</b> <b>Tell</b> Your Wife in early 1923. In time Balcon's company took the name Gainsborough Pictures.|$|E

500|$|During the Presidential {{campaign}} of 1952, Pat Nixon's attitude toward politics changed {{when her husband}} was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions. Pat encouraged him to fight the charges, and he did so by delivering the famed [...] "Checkers speech", so-called for the family's dog, a Cocker Spaniel given to them by a political supporter. This was Pat's first national television appearance, and she, her daughters, and the dog were featured prominently. Defending himself {{as a man of}} the people, Nixon stressed his wife's abilities as a stenographer, then said, [...] "I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat, and I <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> her she would look good in anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{partnership}} with Fingleton {{was regarded as}} one of the great opening pairings in Australian Test cricket history. In ten Tests as an opening combination, the pair averaged 63.75 for the first wicket, higher than any other Australian duo with more than 1000 runs. Brown was known for his self-effacing nature and was well liked among teammates and opponents alike. Of his batting, Brown joked that [...] "My wife said you could <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> when I was batting by the number of people leaving the ground". During a domestic match at the Adelaide Oval in December 1938, he deflected a ball onto his stumps without dislodging a bail. He added a further 147 runs to end unbeaten on 174, eternally apologising for his luck.|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} Private Eye made regular {{use of the}} Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells pseudonym to satirise {{the stereotypical}} conservative Middle Englander, {{and it became a}} running joke for several years. In 1978, BBC Radio 4 called its new listener feedback programme Disgusted, Tunbridge Wells, though it was renamed Feedback in 1979. This was following Radio 4 broadcasting the Take It From Here radio series in 1954 where [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] was prominently featured. In politics, the people behind [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] letters have strong conservative views and are commonly viewed to support the Conservative Party. However, most UK Independence Party (UKIP) members in the party's early days were viewed by commentators as being [...] "'Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells' pensioners", of which the UKIP leader Nigel Farage stated in 2013 [...] "I used to say you could <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> it was a UKIP meeting by the number of Bomber Command ties in the room." ...|$|E

500|$|Jackson was a {{national}} co-chairman of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. As such, he is involved in garnering support from the superdelegates. During the campaign, he provided the voice for some advertisements such as one South Carolina radio ad in which he said: [...] "Once, South Carolina voted for my father, and sent a strong message to the nation,...Next year, you can send more than a message. You can launch a president.'" [...] When describing Obama he stated that [...] "Barack Obama is not speaking {{as a friend of}} the community; he's part of the community...He doesn't <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> people what they want to hear. He tells them what they need to hear.'" [...] During the campaign, he described Obama as the first [...] "successor" [...] of Martin Luther King Jr. to use the thoughtful and careful approach to language to frame social debate {{in a way that is}} unlikely to alienate whites and noted his ability to get various factions to agree with him and his political positions.|$|E
500|$|Over the {{following}} years, Pascu and The Blue Workers released two EPs, the {{rhythm and blues}} record Maşina cu jazzolină ("The Jazzolin Engine") and Caseta pentru minte, inimă şi gură ("The Cassette for the Mind, Heart and Mouth"). [...] Pascu also appeared {{on a number of}} comedy recordings released by Divertis, earning Pascu the reputation of a protest song writer. [...] He was inspired by Romanian politics and the social debates of the 1990s to write hits like [...] "Morcovul românesc" [...] ("The Romanian Carrot") and [...] "Instalatorul" [...] ("The Plumber"). [...] Pascu acknowledged his political streak, recognized what he considered the necessary link between social phenomena and a songwriter's cultural perspective, and argued that songs should <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> a story. One of the parody songs included on Maşina cu jazzolină, titled [...] "Africa, Africa", drew special interest in cultural circles with its satirical undertones. The lyrics suggested that modern Romania was no better than the average African nation. According to historian Sorin Mitu, [...] "Africa, Africa" [...] showed [...] "the Romanians' tendency to relate to extra-European realities", a trend he observed during Ceauşescu's final decade, and then throughout the early post-revolutionary period.|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson, by then Leeds United manager, {{returned}} to his former club in July 1991 to sign two young centre-backs, Jon Newsome first and Wetherall a few days later, for a combined fee of £275,000. The 20-year-old Wetherall's first season at Leeds was {{the final year of}} his degree course, so he played for the reserves while training part-time. He made a brief debut in the First Division, on 3 September 1991 at Elland Road as a late substitute against Arsenal; Leeds {{went on to win the}} 1991–92 league title. He remembers it as [...] "With 20 minutes to go, we were 2–1 down and I was on the touchline ready to go on, then Lee Chapman scored and the gaffer (Howard Wilkinson) told me to sit down again. But he threw me on for the last two minutes. I <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> people that made the difference in winning the title!" [...] As his teammates took the league trophy on a celebratory open top bus tour, Wetherall chose to revise for his examinations, a decision he came to regret, because [...] "those experiences don't come around that often". Though the revision bore fruit: he graduated with first-class honours.|$|E

500|$|While experts found Bundy's precise {{diagnosis}} elusive, {{the majority}} of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). [...] Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as [...] "sociopaths" [...] or [...] "psychopaths"), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. [...] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. [...] "It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not {{having to deal with}} guilt." [...] There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. [...] "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, [...] "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody." [...] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. [...] "I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all." [...] Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.|$|E
500|$|The Blessing has {{provoked}} a more divided response. Waugh's judgement was {{that those who}} criticised the book were [...] "lazy brutes..... can't bear to see a writer grow up". More recently, Philip Hensher and others have [...] argued that although the novel is immensely enjoyable and that Mitford's [...] "marvellous voice" [...] is undiminished, she is on less sure ground with her [...] "Frenchness" [...] than with the English country house ambience, and her picture of France {{as the embodiment of}} everything civilised is less than convincing. Similar mixed comments greeted Mitford's final novel, Don't Tell Alfred, Waugh again hailing it as her best, [...] "clamouring for a sequel". In this judgement he was largely alone; other critics perceived in the anecdotal framework of the book an uncertainty as to what it was about. An American reviewer wondered what parts were to be taken seriously: [...] "What exactly goes on?... Can you <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> an Etonian, even when he goes beat? Is all modern architecture a fraud? Do U-people really talk this way?" [...] Similar questions were raised in the Times Literary Supplements review, in relation to Mitford's fictional output as a whole: [...] "Would she have been a better novelist if she had 'tried harder', gone in further, dropped the pose of amateurishness, cut the charm, looked beyond the worlds that she knew and, more importantly, loved?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Canvassing" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Marlene Griggs-Knope, Leslie's mother and an important public figure in the Pawnee school system. Marlene was played by Pamela Reed, who would continue to make several guest appearances as the character. During the casting auditions, Seth Gordon interviewed Reed {{as if she were}} playing the character and Reed improvised a great deal, creating many personality elements that were eventually incorporated into Marlene Knope's character. Gordon said, [...] "Pamela was especially sort of nimble on her feet at inventing a character in the room on the fly, and I thought that was really impressive." [...] During the audition, Reed was asked whether she was proud of her daughter, and Reed replied, [...] "I want my daughter to be successful, which is why I <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> her, there's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother." [...] The improvised line, which was based on something her father-in-law said to her, so impressed the producers that they incorporated it into the episode. Schur said the producers sought to establish Leslie's mother early in the series, and he felt her relationship to Leslie {{was the center of the}} entire [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. Schur said of Leslie's attempts to impress her mom at her public forum, [...] "We imagined it in the writer's room that she is eight years old and doing a piano recital, and she's nervous because her mom's there." ...|$|E

500|$|In early 2007, {{the band}} began auditioning drummers to take Mark's {{place in the}} {{upcoming}} tours. Initially looking for a temporary member, From Autumn to Ashes would remain a quartet {{if they did not}} get along with the drummer. However, Jeff Gretz was officially added to the line-up and in March 2007, two weeks before From Autumn to Ashes began touring. The These Speakers Don't <b>Always</b> <b>Tell</b> the Truth EP was released on March 13, 2007 featuring songs from the forthcoming album and a previously unreleased track. Holding a Wolf By the Ears was released on April 9, 2007 as the last album for the band's contract to Vagrant Records, and according to Mark, is [...] "heavier than anything we've ever done" [...] and the [...] "closest we've come to capturing how I think this band should sound." [...] Reviewer Corey Apar of Allmusic noted that the band [...] "sounds stronger than it has [...] ". Music videos for [...] "Pioneers" [...] and [...] "Deth Kult Social Club" [...] were filmed, the former based on The Lottery, a short story by Shirley Jackson, and the latter, a live video shot on Long Island as the end of February 2007. [...] "Pioneers" [...] was released as the first single from the album. In September 2007, Newton left the band and From Autumn to Ashes was joined by original bassist Pilato to take on Newton's place.|$|E
500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ...

Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'.
