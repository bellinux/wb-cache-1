5|$|Dickens was not {{the first}} <b>author</b> <b>to</b> {{celebrate}} the Christmas season in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that the staging of a nostalgic English Christmas might help restore the social harmony that had been lost in the modern world.|$|E
5|$|Eggleston {{published}} {{a total of}} 17 books throughout his life; these included seven on Canadian history, five on its politics and three personal memoirs. He further published poetry anthologies in 1927, and again in 1978 with his wife Magdalena Raškevičiutė, herself a noted Lithuanian-Canadian <b>author,</b> <b>to</b> commemorate their fiftieth wedding anniversary. Perhaps most notable of their children was classical pianist and composer Anne Eggleston (1934– 1994), who through her association with The Royal Conservatory of Music became a distinguished contemporary of figures including Robert Fleming, John Weinzweig, Oskar Morawetz and Godfrey Ridout.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was {{published}} in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999. It immediately took first place in UK best-seller lists, displacing popular authors such as John Grisham, Tom Clancy, and Terry Pratchett, and making Rowling the first <b>author</b> <b>to</b> win the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year for two years in succession. In June 1999, it went straight to the top of three US best-seller lists, including The New York Times.|$|E

50|$|Tablo's {{original}} product was a browser-based application that allowed <b>authors</b> <b>to</b> create and self-publish eBooks to {{stores such as}} Amazon and the iBooks Store. As an experimental campaign in late 2013, Tablo introduced social features that allowed <b>authors</b> <b>to</b> share their works-in-progress, which saw significant attention from authors and readers {{who were interested in}} connecting with readers while they wrote their books. Tablo relaunched as a social writing and reading community in July 2014 that allowed <b>authors</b> <b>to</b> write and publish books, and allowed readers to discover emerging books and follow their favourite authors.|$|R
5|$|John Harding {{published}} {{the first four}} letters before {{he was arrested and}} the fifth after his release. After Harding's death, George Faulkner became Swift's primary publisher in Ireland, and A Letter to the Lord Chancellor Middleton and An Humble Address were copied from manuscript copies provided by the <b>author</b> <b>to</b> Faulkner and then printed with the other letters. The Drapier's Letters were first collected and published in their entirety by Faulkner in 1735.|$|E
5|$|Max Allan Collins, who {{authored}} {{the graphic}} novel, {{was hired to}} write the novelization for the film adaptation. Collins initially turned in a draft that contained 90,000 words, but the licensing at DreamWorks required the <b>author</b> <b>to</b> use only the dialogue from the film and no additional dialogue. Collins reluctantly edited the novelization down to 50,000 words and later said he regretted taking on the task.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{disguise}} are unknown. Hingley notes that many contemporary publications attempted to suggest women had {{played a role in}} their creation, perhaps to make them sound less threatening. He suggests that anonymity might have been necessary to protect Bloxam's position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility. Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from A Celestial Atlas, suggests that this alone might be sufficient to cause the <b>author</b> <b>to</b> wish to remain anonymous.|$|E

5|$|The {{second volume}} {{represents}} the ethical stage. Victor Eremita found {{a group of}} letters from a retired Judge Vilhelm or William, another pseudonymous <b>author,</b> <b>to</b> 'A', trying to convince 'A' {{of the value of}} the ethical stage of life by arguing that the ethical person can still enjoy aesthetic values. The difference is that the pursuit of pleasure is tempered with ethical values and responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|Then {{there is}} the {{deliberate}} citation of false information which is then ascribed legitimate authors. For instance, at a minimum, five of the History's sixteen citations of Dexippus {{are considered to be}} fake, and Dexippus appears to be mentioned, not as a principal source of information, but rather as a contradictory <b>author</b> <b>to</b> be contrasted against information sourced from Herodian or the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte. In addition Quintus Gargilius Martialis, who produced works on horticulture and medicine, is cited twice as a biographer, which is considered to be another false attribution.|$|E

Cyberlink, which sells the PowerDVD player software, was quick to deny that its software {{could be used to}} obtain keys. Corel was silent about the role its WinDVD software had played in the leaking of volume and title keys. Both companies have since released updates for their player software.|$|E

5|$|Ācārya Haribhadra (8th century CE) {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of anekāntavāda. He was the first {{classical}} <b>author</b> <b>to</b> write a doxography, a compendium of a variety of intellectual views. This attempted to contextualise Jain thoughts within the broad framework, rather than espouse narrow partisan views. It interacted with the many possible intellectual orientations available to Indian thinkers around the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully {{argued that the}} Gospel of John has elements in common with Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the <b>author</b> <b>to</b> respond to it. Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown {{have argued that the}} pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.|$|E
5|$|At {{its point}} of {{publication}} in July 2011, A Dance with Dragons {{was in its}} sixth print with more than 650,000 hardbacks in print. It also had the highest single and first-day sales of any new fiction title published in 2011 at that point, with 170,000 hardcovers, 110,000 e-books, and 18,000 audio books reportedly sold on the first day. A Dance with Dragons {{reached the top of}} The New York Times bestseller list on July 31, 2011. Unlike most other big titles, the fifth volume sold more physical than digital copies early on, but nevertheless, Martin became the tenth <b>author</b> <b>to</b> sell 1million Amazon Kindle e-books.

5|$|Deparaja, {{a member}} of the royal family, {{authored}} Amaruka and a collection of romantic stories called the Sobagina Sone (1410), written {{in the form of a}} narration by the <b>author</b> <b>to</b> his wife. However, according to Kotraiah, Sobagina Sone was actually written by King Deva RayaII. The writing contains interesting details on the king's hunting expeditions and on the professional hunters who accompanied him. In 1525, Nanjunda Kavi, a feudatory prince wrote on local history, published a eulogy of prince Ramanatha (also called Kumara Rama) titled Ramanatha Charite (or Kumara Rama Sangatya) in the sangatya metre. The poem is about the prince of Kampili and his heroics at the dawn of the Muslim invasion into southern India. This work combines folk and epic literature. The protagonist rejects the advances of his stepmother, only to be condemned to death. He is rescued by a minister, but eventually achieves martyrdom fighting Muslim invaders at the capital.|$|E
5|$|In all {{subspecies}} but the type, {{the lower}} stamens are also hairy. In subsp. crassifolium, the hairiness is less dense and often {{absent from the}} upper part of the anthers, while lower leaves are hardly decurrent and have longer petioles. In subsp. giganteum, the hairs are densely white tomentose, and lower leaves strongly decurrent. Subsp. crassifolium also differs from the type in having slightly larger flowers, which measure 15–30mm wide, whereas in the type they are 12–20mm in diameter. Both subsp. giganteum and subsp. crassifolium were originally described as species. Due to its morphological variation, V.thapsus has had a great many subspecies described. A recent revision led its <b>author</b> <b>to</b> maintain V.giganteum but sink V.crassifolium into synonymy.|$|E
5|$|In his 1324 Book of Marvels the Dominican missionary Jordanus, {{bishop of}} the Roman Catholic Diocese of Quilon along the Malabar Coast of India, was the first known <b>author</b> <b>to</b> suggest that Ethiopia was the {{location}} of Prester John's kingdom. The Florentine merchant Antonio Bartoli visited Ethiopia from the 1390s until about 1404 {{when he returned to}} Europe with Ethiopian diplomats. This was followed by the lengthy stay of Pietro Rombuldo in Ethiopia from 1404 to 1444 and Ethiopian diplomats attending the ecumenical Council of Florence in 1441, where they expressed some vexation with the European attendees who insisted on addressing their emperor as Prester John. Thanks to the legacy of European medieval historiography, this belief persisted beyond the Late Middle Ages. For instance, the Portuguese missionary Francisco Álvares set out for Ethiopia in 1520 believing that he was to visit the homeland of Prester John.|$|E
