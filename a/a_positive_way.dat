5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to renew the}} station's license in early 1971, Mid-Atlantic Network ran into trouble with the FCC due to the quantity of commercials the station was airing. The station was carrying 22 minutes of commercials an hour according to a letter from then-FCC Broadcast Bureau Chief Francis R. Welsh. Welsh said in the letter that the FCC was not convinced the amount of commercials served the community in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>way.</b> At the time, the FCC allowed no more than 18 minutes of commercials per hour. However, the station's license was ultimately renewed on May 14, 1971.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} series of Ashes to Ashes, Hunt's {{relationship}} with Alex Drake is {{much of the}} same as with Tyler.

25|$|Employees who blog about {{elements}} of {{their place of}} employment can begin to affect the reputation of their employer, either in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>way,</b> if the employee is praising the employer and its workplaces, or in a negative way, if the blogger is making negative comments about the company or its practices.|$|E

25|$|In June 2003, an Israeli, Avi Mizrahi, {{was accused}} by the Israeli {{authorities}} {{of the offense}} of attempting the unauthorized access of computer material. He had port scanned the Mossad website. He was acquitted of all charges on February 29, 2004. The judge ruled that these kinds of actions should not be discouraged when they are performed in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{appeal of}} the railroads is the {{business}} side of railroading. Railroads were long central to economic growth and commerce, and still are to some extent. The history of railroads and railroaders (such as James J.

25|$|Since the {{education}} level of Rettungsassistent {{could be obtained}} by own expenses, the working market was very employer friendly. With the new Notfallsanitäter system, the number of paramedics in the system is restricted to {{a smaller number of}} paid and employed apprentices finishing their education. So a more employee friendly work market could be expected, influencing the pay grade in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
25|$|America's {{involvement}} in World War II during the 1940s affected the Market primarily in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>way.</b> In 1944, the most economically straining {{year of the}} war, the Market was at 97 percent occupancy. Food shortages {{brought on by the}} war increased the demand for the market's goods. On May 9, 1946, the Reading Terminal Market experienced its largest recorded crowd. Over 12,000 people gathered at the market to purchase meat, poultry, and pork products that were unavailable elsewhere due to shortages.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} design and cinematography also won some praise from critics. Claire Sisco King called {{the use of}} real footage unconventional and disruptive in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>way.</b> The editing was described as akin {{to that of a}} music video, and critic Laura Kern found it effectively paced. Michael Koresky described Joey's death scene in the red-drenched bathroom very effectively staged, although Peter Hartlaub found that the lighting obscured the action rather than enhancing it. Except for the strobe light effects during Chaz's death and the moment when the killer's scythe touches Eddie's glass eye, Kern found the special effects only average.|$|E
50|$|Lobster {{hatcheries}} {{throughout the}} world are seen as <b>a</b> very <b>positive</b> <b>way</b> of increasing stock levels and, when mainly funded by visitors (the Padstow facility {{is one of only}} 2 facilities in the world so far to do this), the concept is then seen as being cost-effective.|$|R

50|$|These {{questions}} examine to {{what extent}} the state, politicians or others affect or influence the media content and diversity.

25|$|Microwaves {{generated}} in microwave ovens {{cease to exist}} once the electrical power is turned off. They do not remain in the food when the power is turned off, any more than light from an electric lamp remains in the walls and furnishings of a room when the lamp is turned off. They do not make the food or the oven radioactive. Compared to conventional cooking, the nutritional content of some foods may be altered differently, but generally in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>way</b> by preserving more micronutrients - see above. There is no indication of detrimental health issues associated with microwaved food.|$|E
25|$|The Step Up {{campaign}} {{is a program}} that helps students prevent crimes, sexual assault, and excessive drinking by teaching students how to intervene and prevent in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>way.</b> They do this by explaining the Bystander effect. The U of M also has a TXT-U emergency notification text messaging system that sends out a notification to all faculty, staff, and students in case of emergency. Similarly, there are different resources which {{students are able to}} get help while getting home. 624-WALK, an escort to walk to adjacent campuses and neighborhoods, and Gopher Chauffeur, a van service that offers rides near and on campus. Both of these are free and open to all students, staff, and faculty.|$|E
25|$|Another survey {{conducted}} in 2006 by researchers from Australia's Monash University {{sought to determine}} what types of phenomena that people claim to have experienced and the effects these experiences have had on their lives. The study was conducted as an online survey with over 2,000 respondents {{from around the world}} participating. The results revealed that around 70% of the respondents believe to have had an unexplained paranormal event that changed their life, mostly in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>way.</b> About 70% also claimed to have seen, heard, or been touched by an animal or person that they knew was not there; 80% have reported having a premonition, and almost 50% stated they recalled a previous life.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the term}} is {{sometimes}} used as a term of disdain, {{it can also be}} used in <b>a</b> more <b>positive</b> <b>way,</b> particularly when exploring one of a range of gender positions. Being a 'girly girl' can then be seen as a fluid and partially embodied position - a form of discourse taken up, discarded or modified for tactical/strategic ends.|$|R
5000|$|Governments enact laws {{to label}} {{certain types of}} {{activity}} as wrongful or illegal. Behaviour of a more antisocial nature can be stigmatized in <b>a</b> more <b>positive</b> <b>way</b> to show society's disapproval {{through the use of}} the word criminal. In this context, laws tend to use the phrase, [...] "age of criminal responsibility" [...] in two different ways: ...|$|R
5000|$|Nietzsche {{argued that}} people {{generally}} wear prudent masks in company; but that an alternative strategy for social interaction {{is to present}} oneself as an absence, as a social ghost - [...] "One reaches out for us but gets no hold of us" [...] - something later echoed (if in <b>a</b> less <b>positive</b> <b>way)</b> by Carl Jung.|$|R
25|$|Network effect {{relates to}} the {{intellectual}} commons in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>way.</b> Through P2P networks users are able to share their intellectual property {{in a way that}} can benefit society as a whole.The sharing of intellectual property ultimately relates to economic growth due to the ability for creators to share information and still possibly benefit financially from it. Through P2P networks people are able to share types of education like scholarly articles, becoming a new form of public commons. Network externality like Ted.com {{is an example of how}} intellectual commons with the use of network externality benefits society as a whole. Those who present intellectual property at Ted conferences are sharing their education on a public forum that benefits whoever will listen. Therefore, the larger Ted.com network becomes positively correlates to those who benefit from its common-pool resources.|$|E
25|$|The larval saliva of B. petiolata {{contains}} many amino acids and nutrients that {{are useful for}} adult wasps. Females who are looking to lay eggs solicit larvae {{in order to receive}} some salivary fluid so they can gain some nutrients before laying the eggs. To do this, females undergo trophallaxis with the larvae. The larvae are first fed masticated food by the females wasps and then in return, the larvae produce salivary fluid. Usually, the wasps prompt the larvae to produce this salivary secretion by antennating a larva's head and vibrating its body. The larva then extends its head and produces a drop of clear saliva. Adults wasps prefer to solicit older larvae for trophallaxis, likely because they expect to receive more saliva from older larvae than from younger larvae. Sometimes, body vibrations of soliciting adults become synchronized and this seems to excite the larva in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
25|$|Furtado {{was born}} on December 2, 1978, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Her Portuguese parents, António José Furtado and Maria Manuela Furtado, were born on São Miguel Island in the Azores and had immigrated to Canada in the late 1960s.

At the age of 12, she began writing songs, and as a teenager, she performed in a Portuguese marching band. Furtado has acknowledged her family as the source of her strong work ethic; she spent eight summers working as a chambermaid with her mother, along with her brother and sister, who was a housekeeper in Victoria. She has stated that coming from a working class background has shaped her identity in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

50|$|Journalists and reviewers in the U.S., Canada and {{overseas}} have mentioned the spoof of the Fifty Shades books in <b>a</b> generally <b>positive</b> <b>way.</b> Fifty Shades of Oy Vey: A Parody was also cited and its cover {{used on the}} WCBS website's coverage of Fifty Shades of Grey and its parodies. An excerpt appeared on the Jewish erotica website Jewrotica.org on March 9, 2015.|$|R
