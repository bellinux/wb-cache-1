5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a rotating mirror for Fizeau's toothed wheel. (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off a rotating mirror R, forming <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the slit on the distant stationary mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the original slit. If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E

In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> a pig.|$|E
