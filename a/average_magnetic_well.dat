40|$|We {{study the}} spin and charge {{dynamics}} of electrons in n-doped II [...] VI semiconductor multiple quantum wells when {{one or more}} quantum wells are doped with Mn. The interplay between strongly nonlinear inter-well charge transport and the large tunable spin-splitting induced by exchange interactions with spin-polarized Mn ions produces interesting new spin dependent features. The tunneling current between quantum wells can be strongly spin polarized and, under certain conditions, can develop self sustained oscillations under a finite dc voltage. The spin polarization oscillates in both magnetic and nonmagnetic quantum wells and the time <b>average</b> in <b>magnetic</b> <b>wells</b> can differ from its zero-voltage value. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the amplitude of the spin polarization oscillations depends {{on the distribution of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>wells</b> within the sample. We discuss how the spin polarized current and the spin polarization of the quantum wells can be tailored experimentally. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures; to be published in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} minor loop size on the {{magnetic}} stiffness {{has not been}} paid attention to by most researchers in experimental and theoretical studies about the high temperature superconductor (HTS) magnetic levitation system. In this work, we numerically investigate the <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> stiffness obtained by the minor loop traverses Δz (or Δx) varying from 0. 1 mm to 2 mm in zero field cooling and field cooling regimes, respectively. The approximate values of the magnetic stiffness with zero traverse are obtained using the method of linear extrapolation. Compared with the <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> stiffness gained by any minor loop traverse, these approximate values are Not always close to the <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> stiffness produced by the smallest size of minor loops. The relative deviation ranges of <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> stiffness gained by the usually minor loop traverse (1 or 2 mm) are presented by the ratios of approximate values to average stiffness for different moving processes and two typical cooling conditions. The results show that most of <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> stiffness are remarkably influenced by the sizes of minor loop, which indicates that the magnetic stiffness obtained by a single minor loop traverse Δz or Δx, for example, 1 or 2 mm, can be generally caused a large deviation...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} the {{experimentally}} observed close alignment of magnetic field minimum variance direction with the <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> field for Alfven waves in the solar wind is consistent with theoretically predicted properties of plane large amplitude Alfven waves in the MHD approximation.

Thus, spacecraft magnetometer observations in the solar wind of minimum variance directions strongly peaked about the <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> field direction are consistent with plane large amplitude Alfven waves which have wave normals aligned with the directions of minimum variance.

40|$|Bulk {{magnetic}} susceptibility measurements on sedimentological samples from all geological periods {{have been used}} widely {{in the last two}} decades for correlations and as a proxy for sea-level variations. This paper explores the link between {{magnetic susceptibility}}, depositional setting and environmental parameters. These environmental parameters include distal–proximal transects, microfacies successions and fourth-order trends on different carbonate platform types (platform, ramp, carbonate mound or atoll) during different Devonian stages (Eifelian, Givetian and Frasnian). <b>Average</b> <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility values over a distal–proximal-trending facies succession vary markedly with depositional setting. On carbonate platforms, <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility generally increases towards the top of shallowing-upward sequences. On a distal–proximal transect, <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility is intermediate for the deepest facies, decreases for the reef belts and increases to a maximum in the back-reef zone. In ramps and atolls, magnetic susceptibility trends clearly differ; <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility generally decreases towards the top of shallowing-upward sequences and is highest in the deepest facies. The strong relationship between magnetic susceptibility, facies and sequences implies a strong environmental influence. However, the different responses in the different latform types suggest that sea-level changes leading to variation in detrital input is not the only parameter controlling <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility values. Other primary or secondary processes also probably influenced magnetic mineral distribution. Primary processes such as carbonate production and water agitation during deposition are probably key factors. When carbonate production is high, the proportion of magnetic minerals is diluted and the magnetic susceptibility signal decreases. High water agitation during deposition will also selectively remove magnetic minerals and will lead to low <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility values. These parameters explain the lowest values observed on the reef platform, inner ramp and atoll crown, which are all in areas characterized by higher carbonate production and greater water agitation during deposition. The lowest values observed in the lagoon inside the atoll crown can be related to detrital isolation by the atoll crown. However, other parameters such as biogenic magnetite production or diagenesis can also influence the magnetic signal. Diagenesis can change magnetism by creating or destroying magnetic minerals. However, the influence of diagenesis probably is linked strongly to the primary facies (permeability, amount of clay or organic matter) and probably enhanced the primary signal. The complexity of the signal gives rise to correlation problems between different depositional settings. Thus, while magnetic susceptibility has the potential to be an important correlation tool, the results of this investigation indicate that it cannot be used without consideration of sedimentary processes and depositional environments and without strongbiostratigraphical control.

The <b>average</b> <b>magnetic</b> moments calculated for FM state overestimate the experimental data, whereas the corresponding quantities computed for APM state, underestimate them.
