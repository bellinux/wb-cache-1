5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa, on September7. The system passed south of Cape Verde on September8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, the National Hurricane Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September9, which caused convective <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the National Hurricane Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200UTC on September10, while located about 885miles (1,425km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E

To this end, the objectives of the national breeding program, as of 2008, include increasing international recognition of the Finnhorse and generating demand for the breed for recreational and educational uses such as in Pony Club; to make it the standard breed used in Finland for equestrian tourism; and to improve the opportunities for Finnhorse trotters to participate in Swedish and Norwegian heats.|$|E
5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the breath is held long enough for metabolic <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E

Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes and by April 1805 the two had signed a treaty of alliance.

5|$|Invasive {{measures}} include electrocorticography, {{which uses}} electrodes placed {{directly on the}} exposed surface of the brain. This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. This has enabled the linking of brain <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{involved}} in numerous biological processes. It {{is the most important}} transition metal in all living organisms. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms: archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans. For example, the color of blood is due to hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, such as hemes, which are non-protein compounds, often involving metal ions, that are required for a protein's biological <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> happen. The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. The main roles of iron-containing proteins are the transport and storage of oxygen, as well as the transfer of electrons.|$|E

5|$|Josephine {{continued}} to intensify throughout the afternoon {{as the storm}} became more symmetrical. However, due {{to the location of}} the storm, {{there was a lack of}} accurate wind speed readings, and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity. Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm, the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification. The storm was also heading into an area where shear was forecasted to significantly increase due to an upper-level trough diving southward. Despite convection being partially removed from the center of Josephine, the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September3 as thunderstorm <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> the south of the center became more organized. The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening, causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger.|$|E
5|$|MƒÅori quickly adopted {{writing as}} a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were {{converted}} to the written form. Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and {{it was not until the}} 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known. Although still largely influenced by global trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During this period literature changed from a journalistic <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> a more academic pursuit. Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished. Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature.|$|E

On August 5, 2005, Gray and his associates followed suit and issued their updated forecast; it was consistent with NOAA's update.
