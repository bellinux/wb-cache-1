5|$|After {{initializing}} {{the concept}} in January 2013, the two discussed {{the project for}} three or four months before creating an outline for the whole story. The original outline was for 12 issues, but it left room for improvisation and a few points were removed as the story progressed. They looked at past and present social movements for civil rights for inspiration for how one would progress <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> might respond to a movement for android rights. Luna wrote the first draft of issue one, then the two worked together to rewrite it.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{the vampire}} is {{generally}} {{held to be}} a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating {{the figure of the}} vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.|$|E

The dominant urban story of the past 10 years has been of creeping privatisation and social fragmentation resulting {{in the loss of}} shared spaces in our towns and cities. This session will question this "new conventional wisdom" <b>and</b> explore <b>how</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> communities are experimenting and innovating, reclaiming corporate spaces and creating new kinds of shared spaces. The session will then ask what this means for the planning, design and management of our towns <b>and</b> cities <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people's</b> power to produce better public spaces can be better supported. ...|$|R

5|$|In modern times, the {{two main}} schools that have {{developed}} in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism. Phenomenology, founded by Edmund Husserl, focuses on {{the contents of the}} human mind (see noema) and how processes shape our experiences. Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the work of Søren Kierkegaard, focuses on Human predicament <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> deal with the situation of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. See Heidegger's Being and Time, Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception, Sartre's Being and Nothingness, and Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex.|$|E
25|$|As much {{as people}} need {{description}} of how language works <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> are using it, they also want instruction in how they ought {{to use it for}} particular purposes, mainly the niceties of standard written English for publication.

25|$|Bryant has {{conducted}} {{some of the}} first studies into cognitive factors that underpin Prolonged Grief Disorder from normal bereavement, including memory styles, appraisals, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> imagine their futures. Bryant has also conducted the first studies of different neural circuits between Prolonged Grief Disorder and other psychological conditions. In addition, he conducted a major controlled trial of treating Prolonged Grief Disorder that demonstrated that reliving memories of the loss is critical to optimising treatment response.|$|E

25|$|Neuropharmacology is a {{very broad}} region of science that {{encompasses}} {{many aspects of the}} nervous system from single neuron manipulation to entire areas of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. To better understand the basis behind drug development, one must first understand how neurons communicate with one another. This article will focus on both behavioral and molecular neuropharmacology; the major receptors, ion channels, and neurotransmitters manipulated through drug action <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> with a neurological disorder benefit from this drug action.|$|E
25|$|The nurture kinship {{perspective}} on the ontology of social ties, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> conceptualize them, has become stronger {{in the wake of}} David M. Schneider's influential Critique of the Study of Kinship and Holland's subsequent Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship, demonstrating that as well as the ethnographic record, biological theory and evidence also more strongly support the nurture perspective than the blood perspective (see Human inclusive fitness). Both Schneider and Holland argue that the earlier blood theory of kinship derived from an unwarranted extension of symbols and values from anthropologists' own cultures (see ethnocentrism).|$|E
25|$|Natural {{disasters}} are {{a dramatic}} example {{of people living}} in conflict with the environment. Early predictions and warnings are essential for the reduction of property damage and loss of life. Because landslides occur frequently and can represent some of the most destructive forces on earth, it is imperative to have a good understanding as to what causes them <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> can either help prevent them from occurring or simply avoid them when they do occur. Sustainable land management and development is also an essential key to reducing the negative impacts felt by landslides.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the ideals}} of family honor is social class. Social class {{can be defined as}} a group of people {{categorized}} into a hierarchy based on the amount of money they have accumulated, how much education they have received, and the amount of power they hold within society, amongst other variables. People who play similar roles within society tend to have similar outlooks. Social standing affects the way in which families form. It determines how and who a person mates with, how they raise their children, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> relate to one another.|$|E
25|$|Consumer {{behaviour}} is {{the study}} of the motivations surrounding a purchase of a product or service. It has been linked to the field of psychology, sociology and economics in attempts to analyse when, why, where <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> purchase {{in the way that they}} do. However, little literature has considered the link between our consumption behaviour and the basics of our being, our biology. Segmentation by biological driven demographics such as sex and age are already popular and pervasive in marketing. As more knowledge and research is known, targeting based on a consumers biology is of growing interest and use to marketers.|$|E

They have compiled a Coral Reef Resilience Action Plan. This detailed action plan consists of numerous adaptive management strategies, including reducing our carbon footprint, which would ultimately reduce the amount of ocean acidification in the oceans surrounding the Great Barrier Reef. An extensive public awareness plan is also in place to provide education on the “rainforests of the sea” <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> can reduce carbon emissions, thereby reducing ocean acidification.|$|E

50|$|Katra Bi Arzoo ("The Lady Desire Locality") {{is set in}} {{the city}} of Allahabad, Katra being a {{locality}} of the city. The novel is set in 1970s India and as its central theme it bares the brutality of emergency in India <b>and</b> <b>how</b> general <b>people</b> were affected by such a draconian regime. It is an ode to anti emergency activist <b>and</b> shows <b>how</b> <b>people</b> through their vested interest enjoyed the fruits of emergency <b>and</b> <b>how</b> emergency ruined <b>and</b> destroyed the life's people. In the foreword, Raza dedicates the novel to anti-emergency activists and say that freedom of speech is basic freedom.|$|R

25|$|Understanding {{consumer}} personality <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> view {{others is}} important. People were shown ads talking of {{the harmful effects}} of binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense of who they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s close friends.|$|E
25|$|Mathematics, {{which is}} {{classified}} as a formal science, has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori rather than empirical methods. The formal sciences, which also include statistics and logic, are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences are essential {{in the formation of}} hypotheses, theories, and laws, both in discovering and describing how things work (natural sciences) <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> think and act (social sciences).|$|E
25|$|Ximenez-Fatio House Museum {{is one of}} the best-preserved {{and most}} {{authentic}} Second Spanish Period (1783-1821) residential buildings in St. Augustine, Florida. In 1973, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It was designated a Florida Heritage Landmark in 2012. The museum complex sits just south of the city's central Plaza de la Constitución at 20 Aviles Street (formerly Hospital Street), the oldest archaeologically documented street in the United States. It is located at the center of Old Town, the city's oldest continuously occupied community. Since 1939, the property has been privately owned and managed by The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in The State of Florida (NSCDA-FL). Through their efforts, it was restored and interpreted to reflect its function as a fashionable boarding house during Florida's first tourist boom, which began after 1821. The property is a historic house museum, furnished and presented to tell stories of the visitors who lodged there, the women who owned and managed it, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> lived during Florida's territorial period.|$|E

Cummings wrote the majority of the lyrics, which are about personal strifes <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> overcome them.
