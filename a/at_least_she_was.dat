5|$|In Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, Lohan meets and {{interviews}} victims of human trafficking in Delhi, Kolkata and {{a village in}} West Bengal. They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing sexual slavery, physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says {{that he can not}} go back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family did not have enough food, and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> fed.|$|E
500|$|Geri Halliwell {{described}} the single as a [...] "big love song" [...] and [...] "a Spice Girl classic". Chisholm, in her 2008 appearance on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, commented {{that she thought}} the song was not good at all, and that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> against the release of any new material when the record company was trying to market the Greatest Hits release. She would later say [...] "Headlines grew on me, it really came in to its own when we toured it, and it really felt lovely on stage".|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is {{no part of}} the Way,' sighed the lama. 'But <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{from the}} Hills. Ah, the Hills, and the snow of the Hills!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{suppose you}} will see very much more of Gudrun, <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> a restless bird, she'll be gone {{in a week or}} two,' said Birkin.|$|R
6000|$|Desmond {{leaned forward}} a trifle, and looked hard at him. [...] "No. I {{might have been}} had things <b>been</b> different. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{certainly}} {{not in love with}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him for a moment and then she laughed. Tavernake felt a sense of relief; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not angry.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him quietly and searchingly. His heart began to beat faster. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in doubt. He had not wholly lost. His chance, even, was good.|$|E
60|$|Avice {{could only}} gather her into her arms, though embraces were against the strict rule of Benedictine nuns, and soothe and coax her {{to believe that}} by one <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not hated.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> lent to {{us, and we}} {{are bound}} to accept her.-- Address her in French, my dear; she does not {{understand}} English. In fact, you'd better take her to your own room and have a talk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The old sweet note,' said Ethel, less {{steadily}} {{than she}} had yet spoken, '"nothing could hurt {{him for what he}} had not done." [...] I don't know whether <b>she</b> knows what--what <b>is</b> in store. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not shaken yet, dear child.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{assure you}} {{it was not for}} her sake that I did it," [...] replied Miss Lindsay. [...] "It was to prevent that Jackson girl from getting first place. I don't like Helen Plantagenet; but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a lady.' ...|$|R
60|$|The girl, {{when she}} heard her mother's command, wept, shrieked, and went. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to her father. And from {{wholesome}} fear of that same saying-knife, the priest left her in peace {{all the way to}} Winchester.|$|E
60|$|Rilla {{read her}} letter over many times. There {{was a new}} light on her pale young face when she finally stood up, amid the asters Walter had loved, with the {{sunshine}} of autumn around her. For the moment <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> lifted above pain and loneliness.|$|E
60|$|He bent down, {{snatched}} hold of {{her hands}} and drew her face towards his. His heart leaped in quick, fierce beats. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not indifferent. Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes marvellously soft. She did not repulse him, nor did she yield herself at once to his embrace. She {{looked up at him}} with wet eyes and a curious smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, husband," [...] said Julia, [...] "the maid's tale can wait. Whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a traitress to the Jews, or a {{follower}} of Christus, is not our affair. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in your charge, and therefore welcome to me," [...] and stepping to where Miriam stood with bowed head she {{kissed her on the}} forehead, saying aloud: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, that {{is where}} we are going; <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> Constance <b>is.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> going to work at her {{painting}} while I pay a round of visits. Wont you come with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} {{not your}} insolence," [...] said Nigel, [...] "but I forgive it, because you labour under some strange delusion. In {{so far as}} I can comprehend your vehement charge, it is entirely undeserved on my part. You seem to impute to me the seduction of your wife--I trust <b>she</b> <b>is</b> innocent. For me, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> as innocent as an angel in bliss. I never thought of her--never touched her hand or cheek, save in honourable courtesy." ...|$|R
60|$|More {{and more}} Barbara threw out her soul towards Anthony. Across the void of Nothingness she sent it travelling, {{nor did it}} return with empty hands. Something of Anthony had greeted it, though she could not {{remember}} the greeting, had spoken with it, though she could not interpret the words. Of this <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sure, she had been near to Anthony.|$|E
60|$|There <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> prized! How unlike {{this to the}} {{treatment}} she met with from her own family! If she could not love the Earl, she could do very well without that nonsense; and she should escape from her unloving home, begin a new life, reign queen o'er herself and him, idolized, uncontradicted, with ample opportunities of usefulness, triumphant over him who had disdained her.|$|E
6000|$|Una {{identified}} him with vulgarity so completely {{that she must}} often have been unjust to him. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> surprised now and then by a reassertion {{that he was a}} [...] "highbrow," [...] and that he decidedly disapproved of any sort of vulgarity. Several times this came out when he found her reading novels which were so coarsely realistic as to admit the sex and sweat of the world.|$|E
50|$|Bart's granddaughter, {{living in}} his house. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> {{about the same age}} as Yuuri. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> realistic, and does not believe in fairies <b>at</b> all (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>at</b> first). <b>She</b> <b>is</b> mean to Mary Bell (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>at</b> first).|$|R
50|$|On 25 May 2013, {{a female}} suicide bomber, Madina Alieva, blew herself up in Dagestan, {{injuring}} <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 18. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{the widow of}} an Islamist killed in 2009.|$|R
50|$|After {{her return}} to England Euryalus was {{converted}} to a prison hulk. From 1825 to <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 1843, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a prison for boys, the youngest being nine years old.|$|R
6000|$|So {{they were}} separated, {{but as it}} chanced that case never came on, for next morning this Ogula {{was killed in the}} {{fighting}} together with two of his companions, while the others involved in the charge kept themselves out of sight. Whether Jeekie's [...] "ma" [...] was or was not eaten by the Ogula no one ever learned for certain. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> never heard of any more.|$|E
60|$|An {{invitation}} from a queen is a command, and Elizabeth {{would have felt}} bound to obey this summons, but she was sick when it came. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not well, {{and she was not}} much disposed to underrate her sickness for the sake of being able to travel on this occasion. The officers of her household made out a formal certificate to the effect that Elizabeth was not able to undertake such a journey.|$|E
60|$|Thus he speculated, suffered, {{was at once}} cast {{down and}} lifted up {{by the thought of}} her. To him, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> one of those rare and dauntless women, the red stars of history, by whom the Dantes and Leonardos are fired to express the inexpressible, and common clay is fused and made mad: one of those women who, the more they reveal, become the more inscrutable. Divinely inarticulate, he called her; arousing the passion of the man, yet {{stirring}} the sublimer efforts of the god.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Marian {{is a safe}} person, {{and will}} get no further than 'I don't know;' <b>at</b> <b>least</b> if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> the Marian I take her for," [...] said Lady Marchmont.|$|R
6000|$|The crowd scoffed in incredulity. [...] "There {{are some}} women here," [...] said Bridge. [...] "Turn {{her over to}} them. They'll tell you, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not a man." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, {{she became}} the CEO of the Group. As stated in The Telegraph: [...] "For the time being, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> revelling in her new-found role. This is hardly {{surprising}} considering Henderson has been granted a rare second chance to succeed in a role in which she once failed miserably. A decade ago {{she became the}} only female chief executive of a British public company when she took the helm at Alexon, the women's fashion group. Two years later, after she had turned an £11.3m profit into a near £1m loss <b>she</b> <b>was</b> stripped of the title." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take it then," [...] he answered, [...] "that I'm simply {{putting them}} all {{together}} for you." [...] She looked at him, on this, long again--still as if it shouldn't be said she hadn't given him time or had withdrawn from his view, so to speak, a single inch of her surface. This <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> fully to have exposed. It represented her as oddly conscientious, and he scarce knew in what sense it affected him. On the whole, however, with admiration. [...] "You're very, very honourable." ...|$|E
60|$|Caleb {{wanted to}} go too; but his {{grandmother}} {{said it would not}} do very well, for he could not keep up with Raymond; and besides, she said that she wanted him. So Caleb went out with Raymond under the great elm before the house, and pointed out the place among the rocks, where he had seen Cherry. She was not there then, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not in sight; but Raymond knew that she could not have gone far from the place, so he walked down over the bridge, and soon disappeared.|$|E
60|$|If Susan {{could not}} write notes, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not cross; {{and it would}} be well if many who could send off a much better {{performance}} with far less difficulty could go to work as patiently as she did, without one pettish word to Miss Fosbrook, though that lady seemed to poor Susie as hard a task mistress as if she could have helped it. This time Miss Fosbrook authorized the leaving out of the spending the day, and suggested that S. would be enough without the whole Susanna, and she mercifully directed the cover to Miss Greville.|$|E
50|$|She {{joined the}} Internationalist Communist Party (PCI) {{and became the}} editor of its newspaper, La Verité. From <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 1946, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> aligned with Mathias Corvin, known for his generous {{attitude}} towards the Soviet Union.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, nay, we {{know not}} where she is; no word {{has come from}} her. Well, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> will <b>be</b> spared a dreadful sight. Have you any message for her ear? If so, give it swiftly ere the guard call me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Do {{you mean}} to fly {{in the face of}} the {{tradition}} of three centuries? John Eglinton's carping voice asked. Her ghost <b>at</b> <b>least</b> has been laid for ever. She died, for literature <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> before <b>she</b> <b>was</b> born.|$|R
