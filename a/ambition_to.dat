5|$|In 1582, Day's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} quickly. Though weakening, he raced to complete {{another edition of}} Actes and Monuments in 1583, printing it on at least four presses. It was unusual for books of this size and <b>ambition</b> <b>to</b> go beyond one or two printings. Holinshed's Chronicles, the only book of the time to rival the Book of Martyrs in scope and reputation, never went into a third edition.|$|E
5|$|Before {{becoming}} a draper, Pick's father {{had had an}} <b>ambition</b> <b>to</b> become a lawyer and he encouraged his son to follow this career. Pick attended St Peter's School in York on a scholarship, but failed to get a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford. Instead, he was articled to a York solicitor, George Crombie, in March 1897. He qualified in January 1902 and completed a law degree at the University of London in the same year, {{but he was not}} sufficiently interested in a legal career to apply to practice.|$|E

5|$|Britten {{was born}} in the fishing port of Lowestoft in Suffolk, on the east coast of England on 22 November 1913, the feast day of Saint Cecilia. He was the {{youngest}} of four children of Robert Victor Britten (1878–1934) and his wife Edith Rhoda, née Hockey (1874–1937). Robert Britten's youthful <b>ambition</b> <b>to</b> become a farmer had been thwarted by lack of capital, and he had instead trained as a dentist, a profession he practised successfully but without pleasure. While studying at Charing Cross Hospital in London he met Edith Hockey, the daughter of a junior Home Office official. They were married in September 1901 at St John's, Smith Square, London.|$|E
5|$|Giacomo Meyerbeer's {{early studies}} {{had been in}} Germany, but from 1816 to 1825 he worked in Italy. There he studied opera, then {{dominated}} by Gioachino Rossini, and wrote his own Italian operas, which were moderately successful and also had some performances in other European countries. The success of Il crociato in Egitto (1824) throughout Europe, including at Paris in 1825, persuaded Meyerbeer, who was already thirty-three years old, to fulfil at last his <b>ambition</b> <b>to</b> base himself in Paris, and to seek a suitable libretto for an opera to be launched there.|$|E

Peeling back the layers of myth, Joanne Vigor-Mungovin has looked into the early life of Merrick and his family in her hometown of Leicester, and presents for the first time, detailed information about Josephs family and his burning <b>ambition</b> <b>to</b> be self-sufficient rather than survive on the charity of others.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1870s, Willis {{divorced}} {{her husband and}} remarried.

5|$|Initially, Shaw {{refused to}} seek {{clerical}} employment in London. His mother {{allowed him to}} live free of charge in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage <b>ambition</b> <b>to</b> become a painter, and had no thought yet of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet. Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London. Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.|$|E

However, political scientists {{mentioned that}} PR would {{have a tough time}} getting support from rural areas, referring to the DAP's dismal performance in rural polling centres. Nevertheless, encouraged by the strong support from the urban Chinese community in the Sibu by-election, DAP is now aiming to win the four other Chinese-majority parliamentary seats (namely the Sarikei, Miri, Stampin and Lanang seats) and seven other State constituencies held by SUPP in Sarawak.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Brazil, now {{ascendant}} under Emperor Dom PedroII, provided {{support to}} the Uruguayan government that still held out in Montevideo, {{as well as to}} the ambitious Justo José de Urquiza, a caudillo in Entre Ríos who rebelled against Rosas. Once one of Rosas' most trusted lieutenants, Urquiza now claimed to fight for a constitutional government, although his <b>ambition</b> <b>to</b> become head of state was barely disguised. In retaliation, Rosas declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the Platine War. The army under Oribe in Uruguay surrendered to Urquiza in October. With arms and financial aid given by Brazil, Urquiza then marched through Argentine territory heading to Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|Morris—recently {{appointed}} co-captain of New South Wales—greatly impressed Australian captain Don Bradman, to {{the extent}} that Bradman made himself, Morris and vice-captain Lindsay Hassett the three on-tour selectors for the 1948 visit to England. Morris was a key part of Bradman's inner circle during the planning of the tour. Bradman had long harboured an <b>ambition</b> <b>to</b> tour England without losing a match; his team would become the first to achieve this feat, earning themselves the sobriquet, The Invincibles.|$|E

His parents could not afford to pay for years of musical education, and his rich uncles did not consider music a suitable profession; from the age of 13 Solti paid for his education by giving piano lessons.|$|E

Gusman was a strong supporter of Prokofiev's <b>ambition</b> <b>to</b> rehabilitate himself in the Soviet Union, and had negotiated with the Moscow orchestra for a series of concerts that would showcase the returned composer's talent.|$|E
5|$|The British had ceded {{some power}} in Egypt with the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1922 {{and more in}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936.

The treaty recognized Egyptian claims of sovereignty in Sudan in return for British rights in the Nile valley and the Suez Canal.
