500|$|Later in 1978, Johnston {{joined the}} United States Geological Survey (USGS), where he {{monitored}} volcanic emission {{levels in the}} Cascades and Aleutian Arc. There he helped to strengthen the theory that eruptions can be predicted, to some degree, by changes in the makeup of volcanic gases. Fellow volcanologist Wes Hildreth said of Johnston, [...] "I think Dave's dearest hope was that systematic monitoring of fumarolic emissions might permit detection of changes characteristically precursory to eruptions... Dave wanted to formulate a general model for the behavior of magmatic volatiles prior to explosive outbursts {{and to develop a}} corollary rationale for the evaluation of hazards." [...] During this time, Johnston continued to visit Mount Augustine every summer and also assessed the geothermal energy potential of the Azores and Portugal.

These span the food chain from autotrophs to heterotrophs and include organisms such as coccolithophores, corals, foraminifera, echinoderms, crustaceans and molluscs. As described above, under normal conditions, calcite and aragonite are stable in surface waters since the carbonate ion is at supersaturating concentrations. However, as ocean pH falls, the concentration of carbonate ions required for saturation to occur increases, and when carbonate becomes undersaturated, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution. Therefore, even if there is no change in the rate of calcification, the rate of dissolution of calcareous material increases. affects shell dissolution rate but not calcification rate in a marine snail |journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume = 277 |issue = 1693 |pages = 2553–2558 |pmc = 2894921 |doi = 10.1098/rspb.2010.0206 |pmid = 20392726 |ref = harv}} ...|$|E

Between 2000 and 2009 Beijing's urban extent quadrupled, which not only strongly increased the extent of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions,</b> but also changed the meteorological situation fundamentally, even if emissions of human society are not included. For example, surface albedo, wind speed and humidity near the surface were decreased, whereas ground and near-surface air temperatures, vertical air dilution and ozone levels were increased. Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of fossil fuel, Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems, which lead to health issues of many inhabitants. In 2013 heavy smog struck Beijing and most parts of northern China, in total 600 million people. After this [...] "pollution shock" [...] air pollution became an important economic and social concern in China. After that the government of Beijing announced measures to reduce air pollution, for example by lowering the share of coal from 24% in 2012 to 10% in 2017, while the national government ordered heavily polluting vehicles to be removed from 2015 to 2017 and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources.|$|E

2500|$|Stone monuments include tombstones, grave markers or as mausoleums. After being gangsawed {{into big}} deep (up to [...] wide and over 6 inches deep) slabs, smaller saws or {{guillotines}} (they break the granite {{and make the}} rough edges commonly seen on monuments) shape the monuments. The fronts and backs are usually polished. The individual monuments are then carved, shaped, and further defined by hand tools and sandblasting equipment. At this time, the stone for monuments is most commonly granite, sometimes marble (as in military cemeteries), and rarely others. Granite and quartz both demonstrate good durability, especially because rain is naturally acidic. [...] (This is a natural consequence of the carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere, which generates a weak solution of carbonic acid in rainfall; further acidification of rainfall arises from oxides of sulphur and nitrogen due to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions).</b> [...] Long-term durability of quartz monuments can be observed at the Harpers Ferry cemetery, where an old rose quartz tombstone stands. [...] (Limestone and sandstone were commonly chosen for monuments in the nineteenth century, but they are no widely longer used because of the rapid erosion rates due to dissolution of acid-vulnerable carbonates by acidic rainfall.) [...] The most common monument colors for granite are gray, black, and mahogany; for marble, white is most popular.

A statistical analysis of the data set until May 1996 consisting of 1670 individual TGM measurements shows a linear decrease of 0. 169 +/- 0. 009 ng Hg m(- 3) yr(- 1), i. e. about 7 per cent per year. The seasonal variation shows maximum TGM concentrations in March and minima in October-December. The frequency of occurrence of extremely high TGM concentrations and the amplitude of the seasonal variation decreased over the observation time. The observed decrease of the TGM concentration is in agreement with measurements in Scandinavia, indicating that the measurements at Wank are representative for the region of central and northern Europe. The decrease in TGM concentration of 23. 3 per cent between 1990 and 1994 was consistent with decreases of 20. 4 and 21. 2 per cent, respectively, observed by us over the northern and the southern Atlantic Ocean. This and t he observation of a decreasing trend in mercury wet deposition in the U. S. A. indicate the global significance of the TGM trends observed in Europe.
