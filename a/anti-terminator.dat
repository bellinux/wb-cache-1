50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the PyrG {{leader is}} a cis-regulatory RNA element {{found at the}} 5' of the PyrG mRNA. The PyrG gene encodes a CTP synthase, which is involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis. The PyrG leader regulates expression of PyrG, PyrG can form into two different hairpin structures, a terminator or an <b>anti-terminator.</b> Under low CTP conditions, guanine (G) residues are incorporated at a specific site within the PyrG leader, these allow base-pairing with a uracil (U)-rich region {{and the formation of}} an <b>anti-terminator</b> loop, this results in increased expression of PyrG. Under high CTP conditions the guanines are not added, the <b>anti-terminator</b> loop cannot form and instead a terminator loop is formed, preventing further PyrG expression.|$|E
5000|$|The {{formation}} of the <b>anti-terminator</b> requires the trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP protein) in species of Bacillus and related bacteria. This protein is encoded by the MtrB gene. [...] TRAP protein forms an oligomer of 11 subunits, {{in the presence of}} tryptophan this binds to section of RNA containing 11 (G/U)AG repeats. This sequence overlaps the <b>anti-terminator</b> loop, thus TRAP-binding preventing {{formation of}} the anti-termintor loop. When TRAP is bound the termintor loop forms and the operon is not transcribed.|$|E
5000|$|Viruses, {{despite having}} {{only a few}} genes, possess {{mechanisms}} to regulate their gene expression, typically into an early and late phase, using collinear systems regulated by <b>anti-terminators</b> (lambda phage) or splicing modulators (HIV).|$|R
5000|$|The SAM riboswitch (also {{known as}} the S-box leader and now also called the SAM-I riboswitch) is found {{upstream}} {{of a number of}} genes which code for proteins involved in methionine or cysteine biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. Two SAM riboswitches in Bacillus subtilis that were experimentally studied act at the level of transcription termination control. The predicted secondary structure consists of a complex stem-loop region followed by a single stem-loop terminator region. An alternative and mutually exclusive form involves bases in the 3' segment of helix 1 with those in the 5' region of helix 5 to form a structure termed the <b>anti-terminator</b> form. [...] When SAM is unbound, the <b>anti-terminator</b> sequence sequesters the terminator sequence so the terminator is unable to form, allowing the polymerase read-through the downstream gene. When the SAM is bound to the aptamer, the <b>anti-terminator</b> is sequestered by an anti-anti-terminator; the terminator forms and terminates the transcription. However, many SAM riboswitches are likely to regulate gene expression at the level of translation.|$|E
50|$|In this {{situation}} RNA polymerase {{is dependent on}} (lagging) ribosome activity; if the ribosome pauses due to insufficient charged tRNA then the <b>anti-terminator</b> structure is favoured. The canonical attenuator example of the trp operon uses this mechanism in E. coli.|$|E
50|$|PreQ1 {{mediated}} transcriptional attenuation {{is controlled}} by the dynamic switching of <b>anti-terminator</b> and terminator hairpin in the riboswitch. For preQ1 riboswitch from bacteria Bacillus subtilis (Bsu), the <b>anti-terminator</b> is predicted to be less stable than the terminator, as the addition of preQ1 shifts the equilibrium significantly towards the formation of terminator. In presence of preQ1, the 3’ end of the adenine rich tail domain pairs with the center of P1 hairpin loop to form an H-type pseudoknot. In the native mRNA structure, binding of preQ1 to the aptamer region in the riboswitch leads to the formation of a terminator hairpin which causes RNA polymerase to stop transcription, a process which is commonly known as OFF- regulation of genetic expression or transcription termination.|$|E
50|$|These {{elements}} {{are bound by}} specific uncharged tRNAs and modulate the expression of corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase operons. High levels of uncharged tRNA promote the <b>anti-terminator</b> sequence leading to increased concentrations of charged tRNA. These are considered {{by some to be}} a separate family of riboswitches but are significantly more complex than the previous class of attenuators.|$|E
50|$|Tryptophan RNA-binding {{attenuator}} protein {{inhibitory protein}} (Anti-TRAP protein or AT) {{is a short}} protein encoded by the rtpA in Bacillus. Synthesis of anti-TRAP is induced by uncharged tryptophan tRNA. Anti-TRAP binds to TRAP and inhibits its binding to the tryptophan operator leader. This causes the <b>anti-terminator</b> loop to form and the tryptophan operon to be transcribed.|$|E
50|$|HutP (Histidine {{utilizing}} Protein) {{is one of}} the <b>anti-terminator</b> proteins of Bacillus subtilis, {{which is}} responsible for regulating the expression of the hut structural genes of this organism in response to changes in the intracellular levels of L-histidine and divalent metal ions. In the hut operon, HutP is located just downstream from the promoter, while the five other subsequent structural genes, hutH, hutU, hutI, hutG and hutM, are positioned far downstream from the promoter. In the presence of L-histidine and divalent metal ions, HutP binds to the nascent hut mRNA leader transcript. This allows the <b>anti-terminator</b> to form, thereby preventing the formation of the terminator and permitting transcriptional read-through into the hut structural genes. In the absence of L-histidine and divalent metal ions or both, HutP does not bind to the hut mRNA, thus allowing the formation of a stem loop terminator structure within the nucleotide sequence located between the hutP and structural genes.|$|E
50|$|The Tryptophan operon {{leader is}} an RNA element {{found at the}} 5' of some {{bacterial}} tryptophan operons. The leader sequence can assume two different secondary structures known as the terminator and the <b>anti-terminator</b> structure. The leader also codes for very short peptide sequence that is rich in tryptophan. The terminator structure is recognised as a termination signal for RNA polymerase and the operon is not transcribed. This structure forms when the cell has an excess of tryptophan and ribosome movement over the leader transcript is not impeded. When there is a deficiency of the charged tryptophanyl tRNA the ribosome translating the leader peptide stalls and the antiterminator structure can form. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the operon.|$|E
50|$|The Leucine operon {{leader is}} an RNA element found {{upstream}} {{of the first}} gene in the Leucine biosynthetic operon. The leader sequence can assume two different secondary structures known as the terminator and the <b>anti-terminator</b> structure. The leader also codes for very short peptide sequence that is rich in leucine amino acid. The terminator structure is recognised as a termination signal for RNA polymerase and the operon is not transcribed. This structure forms when the cell has an excess of leucine and ribosome movement over the leader transcript is not impeded. When there is a deficiency of the charged leucyl tRNA the ribosome translating the leader peptide stalls and the antiterminator structure can form. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the operon. At least 6 amino acid operons {{are known to be}} regulated by attenuation.|$|E
50|$|Attenuation is a {{regulatory}} feature found throughout Archaea and Bacteria causing premature termination of transcription. Attenuators are 5'-cis acting regulatory regions which fold {{into one of}} two alternative RNA structures which determine the success of transcription. The folding is modulated by a sensing mechanism producing either a Rho-independent terminator, resulting in interrupted transcription and a non-functional RNA product; or an <b>anti-terminator</b> structure, resulting in a functional RNA transcript. There are now many equivalent examples where the translation, not transcription, is terminated by sequestering the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosomal binding site) in a hairpin-loop structure. While not meeting the previous definition of (transcriptional) attenuation, these are now considered to be variants of the same phenomena and are included in this article. Attenuation is an ancient regulatory system, prevalent in many bacterial species providing fast and sensitive regulation of gene operons and is commonly used to repress genes {{in the presence of}} their own product (or a downstream metabolite).|$|E
5000|$|The Histidine operon {{leader is}} an RNA element {{found in the}} {{bacterial}} histidine operon. At least 6 amino acid operons {{are known to be}} regulated by attenuation. [...] In each a leader sequence of 150-200 bp is found upstream of the first gene in the operon. This leader sequence can assume two different secondary structures known as the terminator and the <b>anti-terminator</b> structure. In each case the leader also codes for very short peptide sequence that is rich in the end product amino acid of the operon. The terminator structure is recognised as a termination signal for RNA polymerase and the operon is not transcribed. This structure forms when the cell has an excess of the regulatory amino acid and ribosome movement over the leader transcript is not impeded. When there is a deficiency of the charged tRNA of the regulatory amino acid the ribosome translating the leader peptide stalls and the antiterminator structure can form. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the operon.|$|E
5000|$|This leader {{sequence}} {{is very important}} for the regulation of histidine in [...] "E. coli". The his operon operates under a system of coordinated regulation where all the gene products will be repressed or depressed equally. The main factor in the repression or derepression of histidine synthesis is the concentration of histidine charged tRNAs. The regulation of histidine is actually quite simple considering the complexity of its biosynthesis pathway and, it closely resembles regulation of tryptophan. In this system the full {{leader sequence}} has 4 blocks of complementary strands that can form hairpin loops structures. Block one, shown above, is the key to regulation. When histidine charged tRNA levels are low in the cell the ribosome will stall at the string of His residues in block 1. This stalling of the ribosome will allow complementary strands 2 and 3 to form a hairpin loop. The loop formed by strands 2 and 3 forms an <b>anti-terminator</b> and translation of the his genes will continue and histidine will be produced. However, when histidine charged tRNA levels are high the ribosome will not stall at block 1, this will not allow strands 2 and 3 to form a hairpin. Instead strands 3 and 4 will form a hairpin loop further downstream of the ribosome. The hairpin loop formed by strands 3 and 4 is a terminating loop, when the ribosome comes into contact with the loop, it will be “knocked off” the transcript. When the ribosome is removed the his genes will not be translated and histidine will not be produced by the cell.|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} {{transcription}} termination by RNA-binding proteins that modulate RNA-structures {{is an important}} regulatory mechanism in bacteria. LicT and SacY from Bacillus subtilis prevent the pre-mature arrest of transcription by binding to an <b>anti-terminator</b> RNA hairpin that overlaps an intrin-sic terminator located in the 50 -mRNA leader region of the gene to be regulated. In order to investigate the molecular determinants of this anti-termination/ termination balance, we have developed a fluorescence-based nucleic acids system that mimics the competition between the LicT or SacY <b>anti-terminator</b> targets and the overlapping termin-ators. Using Förster Resonance Energy Transfer on single diffusing RNA hairpins, we could monitor directly their opening or closing state, and thus in-vestigate the effects on this equilibrium of the binding of anti-termination proteins or terminator-mimicking oligonucleotides. We show that the <b>anti-terminator</b> hairpins adopt spontaneously a closed structure and that their structural dynamics is mainly governed by the length of their basal stem. The induced stability of the <b>anti-terminator</b> hairpins determines both the affinity and specificity of the anti-termination protein binding. Finally, we show that stabilization of the <b>anti-terminator</b> hairpin, by an extended basal stem or anti-termination protein binding can efficiently counteract the competing effect of the terminator-mimic...|$|E
40|$|Each {{family of}} signal {{transduction}} systems requires specificity determinants that link individual {{signals to the}} correct regulatory output. In Bacillus subtilis, {{a family of four}} <b>anti-terminator</b> proteins controls the expression of genes for the utilisation of alternative sugars. These regulatory systems contain the <b>anti-terminator</b> proteins and a RNA structure, the RNA <b>anti-terminator</b> (RAT) that is bound by the <b>anti-terminator</b> proteins. We have studied three of these proteins (SacT, SacY, and LicT) to understand how they can transmit a specific signal in spite of their strong structural homology. A screen for random mutations that render SacT capable to bind a RNA structure recognized by LicT only revealed a substitution (P 26 S) at one of the few non-conserved residues that are in contact with the RNA. We have randomly modified this position in SacT together with another non-conserved RNA-contacting residue (Q 31). Surprisingly, the mutant proteins could bind all RAT structures that are present in B. subtilis. In a complementary approach, reciprocal amino acid exchanges have been introduced in LicT and SacY at non-conserved positions of the RNA-binding site. This analysis revealed the key role of an arginine side-chain for both the high affinity and specificity of LicT for its cognate RAT. Introduction of this Arg at the equivalent position of SacY (A 26) increased the RNA binding in vitro but also resulted in a relaxed specificity. Altogether our results suggest that this family of anti-termination proteins has evolved to reach a compromise between RNA binding efficacy and specific interaction with individual target sequences...|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} synthetic biology provides a new experimental approach to biological research by {{allowing for the}} design and implementation of novel genetic systems. In 2006, a joint effort by researchers from Davidson College and Missouri Western State University developed a bacterial system that uses the Salmonella Hin/hix DNA recombination mechanism to solve in vivo the two-spatula, burnt-pancake mathematical problem. The problem asks to calculate the least number of flips required to sort a given stack of pancakes with two spatulas, from largest to smallest and with all golden sides facing up, assuming that each pancake is burnt {{on one side and}} golden on the other. The system worked as a proof-of-concept for using bacteria to solve mathematical problems in vivo, but was limited to pancake stacks with 3 pancakes. A new system that uses transcription anti-terminators could potentially extend the size of the problem, allowing for many more pancakes per stack. I developed a way to use the naturally occurring E. coli trp operon <b>anti-terminator,</b> downstream of the pLac promoter, to control GFP gene expression in tryptophan-rich and tryptophan-poor conditions. RNA tertiary structure computer simulations were used to predict if the <b>anti-terminator</b> sequence could be modified to accommodate Hin-mediated flipping. The success of using an <b>anti-terminator</b> could enable synthetic biologists to design hundreds of anti-terminators that would allow bacteria to solve burnt-pancake problems that were exponentially more difficult...|$|E
40|$|The alpha subunit (alpha) of RNA {{polymerase}} (RNAP) {{is critical}} for assembly of polymerase and positive control of transcription initiation in Escherichia coli. Here, we report that alpha also {{plays a role in}} transcription elongation, and this involves a direct interaction between alpha and NusA factor. During in vitro transcription without NusA, alpha interacts with the nascent RNA, as revealed by photocrosslinking. When NusA is present, RNA crosslinks to NusA rather than to alpha. We show that this NusA-RNA interaction is diminished during transcription with an RNAP mutant that lacks the C-terminus of alpha beyond amino acid 235, including the so-called alpha CTD. The absence of alpha CTD also affects NusA's ability to enhance transcription pausing, termination at intrinsic terminators and anti-termination by the phage lambda Q <b>anti-terminator,</b> but not anti-termination by the lambda N <b>anti-terminator.</b> NusA functions are not recovered even when transcription with mutant RNAP is done with excess NusA, a condition which does restore NusA-RNA crosslinking. By affinity chromatography, we show that NusA interacts directly with alpha, and also with beta and beta', but not with mutant alpha. Hence, alpha-NusA interaction is vital for the control of transcript elongation and termination...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} test the effect of silent {{mutations}} on the regulation of gene expression, we monitored several steps of transcription and translation of the ompA gene in vivo, in which some or all codons between codons 6 and 14, frequently used in Escherichia coli, had been exchanged for infrequent synonymous codons. Northern blot analysis revealed an up to 4 -fold reduction in the half-life of the mutated messengers and a > 10 -fold reduction in their steady-state amounts. Western blot analysis showed a 10 -fold reduction {{in the amount of}} OmpA protein. Use of a system expressing a Rho-specific <b>anti-terminator</b> allowed us to detect a strong transcription polarity effect in the silent mutants. These results demonstrate that silent mutations can severely inhibit several steps of gene expression in E. coli and that code degeneracy is efficiently exploited in this species for setting signals for gene control and regulation...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) {{are capable}} of {{producing}} full-length transcripts {{in the absence of}} additional factors using in vitro assays. However, in vivo RNAP can become stalled during the elongation phase of transcription due to the presence of various sequence motifs. Subsequently, a host of elongation factors are required to modulate the activity of RNAP. NusA, the most intensively studied elongation factor, plays a role in increasing RNAP pausing and termination. Conversely, it is also important in transcription of rRNA where it functions as an anti-termination factor, helping to ensure only full-length transcripts are produced. Here we show that NusA is closely associated with RNAP within the bacterial nucleoid and that it is preferentially recruited to sites of rRNA synthesis. In vivo and in vitro analyses indicate this results in a change in stoichiometry of NusA:RNAP from 1 : 1 to approximately 2 : 1 at the subcellular sites of rRNA synthesis. A model is presented showing how the ratio of NusA:RNAP could affect the activity of the elongation complex so that it functions as an <b>anti-terminator</b> complex during rRNA synthesis.

40|$|To {{construct}} a regulatory {{map of the}} genome of the human pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we applied two complementary high-resolution approaches: strand-specific RNA-seq, to survey the global transcriptome, and ChIP-seq, to monitor the genome-wide dynamics of RNA polymerase (RNAP) and the <b>anti-terminator</b> NusA. Although NusA does not bind directly to DNA, but rather to RNAP and/or to the nascent transcript, we demonstrate that NusA interacts with RNAP ubiquitously throughout the chromosome, and that its profile mirrors RNAP distribution in both the exponential and stationary phases of growth. Generally, promoter-proximal peaks for RNAP and NusA were observed, followed by a decrease in signal strength reflecting transcriptional polarity. Differential binding of RNAP and NusA in the two growth conditions correlated with transcriptional activity as reflected by RNA abundance. Indeed, a significant association between expression levels {{and the presence of}} NusA throughout the gene body was detected, confirming the peculiar transcription-promoting role of NusA. Integration of the data sets pinpointed transcriptional units, mapped promoters and uncovered new anti-sense and non-coding transcripts. Highly expressed transcriptional units were situated mainly on the leading strand, despite the relatively unbiased distribution of genes throughout the genome, thus helping the replicative and transcriptional complexes to alig...|$|E
40|$|Sequence {{conservation}} and co-variation of base pairs are hallmarks of structured RNAs. For certain RNAs (e. g. riboswitches), a single sequence must adopt {{at least two}} alternative secondary structures to effectively regulate the message. If alternative secondary structures {{are important to the}} function of an RNA, we expect to observe evolutionary co-variation supporting multiple conformations. We set out to characterize the evolutionary co-variation supporting alternative conformations in riboswitches {{to determine the extent to}} which alternative secondary structures are conserved. We found strong co-variation support for the terminator, P 1, and <b>anti-terminator</b> stems in the purine riboswitch by extending alignments to include terminator sequences. When we performed Boltzmann suboptimal sampling on purine riboswitch sequences with terminators we found that these sequences appear to have evolved to favor specific alternative conformations. We extended our analysis of co-variation to classic alignments of group I/II introns, tRNA, and other classes of riboswitches. In a majority of these RNAs, we found evolutionary evidence for alternative conformations that are compatible with the Boltzmann suboptimal ensemble. Our analyses suggest that alternative conformations are selected for and thus likely play functional roles in even the most structured of RNAs...|$|E

However, the exact organization and function of these IBs remain unclear. In this study, we use conventional and super-resolution imaging to dissect the internal structure of IBs. We observe that newly synthetized viral mRNA and the viral transcription <b>anti-terminator</b> M 2 - 1 concentrate in IB sub-compartments, which we term "IB-associated granules" (IBAGs). In contrast, viral genomic RNA, the nucleoprotein, the L polymerase and its cofactor P are excluded from IBAGs. Live imaging reveals that IBAGs are highly dynamic structures. Our data show that IBs are the main site of viral RNA synthesis. They further suggest that shortly after synthesis in IBs, viral mRNAs and M 2 - 1 transiently concentrate in IBAGs before reaching the cytosol and suggest a novel post-transcriptional function for M 2 - 1. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induces formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) sheltering viral RNA synthesis. Here, Rincheval et al. identify highly dynamic IB-associated granules (IBAGs) that accumulate newly synthetized viral mRNA and the viral M 2 - 1 protein but exclude viral genomic RNA and RNA polymerase complexes...|$|E
40|$|The EnzymeIIhl of the phosphoenolpyruvate- (PEP-) {{dependent}} phosphotransferase system catalyses the uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of P-glucosides by Escherichia coli; it is {{specified by}} the gene bglC. The nucleotide sequence of a 3. 6 kb Hind 111 restriction fragment spanning bglC, cloned on a plasmid, was determined. DNA analysis strongly suggests that the published order of this and other genes involved in P-glucoside utilization, bgl C, S, B, is incorrect, and that the regulatory gene bgIS may be located upstream of the structural genes bglC and bglB. From the deduced amino acid sequence it is predicted that the membrane protein specified by bglC consists of 625 amino acid residues (66. 48 kDa). The protein has the hydropathic profile expected of an integral membrane protein (average hydropathy = 0. 62). Comparisons between the amino acid sequences deduced for the EnzymeIIbg ' and for the mannitol-specific EnzymeIImt ' show that these proteins are related, and a little direct homology is apparent. A 2. 3 kb AluI fragment spanning bgIC was subcloned into an expression vector which carries the ApL promoter and then transformed into a host strain which produces thermolabile cI 857 repressor and the <b>anti-terminator</b> N; thermoinduction resulted in the overproduction of a membrane protein {{and the appearance of}} Bgl activity...|$|E
40|$|RecG is a DNA {{translocase}} {{that helps}} to maintain genomic integrity. Initial studies suggested a role in promoting recombination, a possibility consistent with synergism between recG and ruv null alleles and reinforced when the protein was shown to unwind Holliday junctions. In this article we describe novel suppressors of recG and show that the pathology seen without RecG is suppressed on reducing or eliminating PriB, {{a component of the}} PriA system for replisome assembly and replication restart. Suppression is conditional, depending on additional mutations that modify ribosomal subunit S 6 or one of three subunits of RNA polymerase. The latter suppress phenotypes associated with deletion of priB, enabling the deletion to suppress recG. They include alleles likely to disrupt interactions with transcription <b>anti-terminator,</b> NusA. Deleting priB has a different effect in ruv strains. It provokes abortive recombination and compromises DNA repair {{in a manner consistent with}} PriB being required to limit exposure of recombinogenic ssDNA. This synergism is reduced by the RNA polymerase mutations identified. Taken together, the results reveal that RecG curbs a potentially negative effect of proteins that direct replication fork assembly at sites removed from the normal origin, a facility needed to resolve conflicts between replication and transcription...|$|E
40|$|Riboswitches are non-coding RNAs {{that control}} gene {{expression}} by sensing small molecules through changes in secondary structure. While secondary structure and ligand interactions {{are thought to}} control switching, the exact mechanism of control is unknown. Using a novel two-piece assay that competes the <b>anti-terminator</b> against the aptamer, we directly monitor the process of switching. We find that the stabilization of key tertiary contacts controls both aptamer domain collapse and the switching of the SAM-I riboswitch from the aptamer to the expression platform conformation. Our experiments demonstrate that SAM binding induces structural alterations that indirectly stabilize the aptamer domain, preventing switching toward the expression platform conformer. These results, combined {{with a variety of}} structural probing experiments performed in this study, show that the collapse and stabilization of the aptamer domain are cooperative, relying on the sum of key tertiary contacts and the bimodal stability of the kink-turn motif for function. Here, ligand binding serves to shift the equilibrium of aptamer domain structures from a more open toward a more stable collapsed form by stabilizing tertiary interactions. Our data show that the thermodynamic landscape for riboswitch operation is finely balanced to allow large conformational rearrangements to be controlled by small molecule interactions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRfaH protein {{functions}} as both transcription <b>anti-terminator</b> and translation enhancer in bacteria. Recent {{studies have shown}} that the C-terminal domain (CTD) is an α-helical hairpin (two-helix bundle) in full-length RfaH, despite the intrinsically favored β-barrel structure. Here, we carried out μs-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the wild-type (WT) RfaH, its E 48 S mutant and an established model without the intrinsically disordered region (IDR 1) linking the CTD and the N-terminal domain (NTD). Our simulations showed that the WT can be well stabilized by our RSFF 1 force field, while the E 48 S mutant and the model without IDR 1 undergo considerable structural change, which is in good agreement with experimental observations. The IDR 1 plays important roles in stabilizing the hydrophobic environment near the crucial E 48 –R 138 salt-bridge as well as in tethering α 4 helix in CTD to α 3 helix in NTD. In the absence of the IDR 1, destabilization of key interdomain contacts and unfolding of the CTD α 5 helix were observed in the simulation. In addition, the intrinsically disordered tail of the CTD (IDR 2) is also of great significance to stabilize the bound conformation of CTD. These findings provide important implications for consideration of simulations in revealing the functions of residues invisible in a crystal structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{approach}} of gene-fusion {{was used to}} analyse genetic control signals. Vectors carrying the trp/lac W 205 substitution were constructed to facilitate the fusion vitro of promoters, terminators and other control signals to the lacZ gene of E. coli. Two systems were developed using either a lambda or pBR 322 replicon. The plasmid system was developed further to provide probes for promoter and terminator sequences. Restriction analysis of these vectors added to the physical data on the trp/lac W 205 fusion. The lambda system was used to analyse transcriptional termination in the b 2 region of the phage. This central region was shown to contain terminators insensitive to the <b>anti-terminator</b> proteins specified by the lambda N and Q genes. Gene-fusions were {{used to examine the}} control of late gene expression of phage lambda. This expression was dependent on the activity of the gene product. This protein was unusual, being almost completely cis-specific. Transcription of the late genes is initiated in the " 6 S region" adjacent to the lambda Q gene. This region was cloned into a trp/lac plasmid and its effect was monitored by expression from the lacZ gene fused to this segment. Expression of lacZ from this promoter was limited by a strong terminator 194 base-pairs downstream. However, a weak positive effect was observed {{in the presence of the}} lambda Q gene product, mapping the site of Q action, Qat, in or near the 6 S region...|$|E

Thus, poliovirus protein 2 C, an RNA-binding protein, shares with Nef the sequence YXQQ [...] . MDD [...] . DXXD. In addition, both proteins contain an Arg-rich motif that, {{in the case of}} poliovirus 2 C, is involved in RNA-binding activity. Moreover, the RNA-binding, <b>anti-terminator</b> N proteins of λ,φ 21 and P 22 phages show sequence similarities with HIV Nef at the Arg-rich motif. To assess the significance of this motif, native and deletion variants of Nef protein were assayed for RNA-binding activity. The N-terminal 35 amino acids of HIV- 1 Nef that comprise the Arg-rich motif are sufficient for RNA binding. Point mutations engineered at the Arg-rich motif of HIV- 1 Nef revealed that basic amino acid residues are essential for RNA-binding activity. The Nef proteins from HIV- 2 and SIV can also interact with RNA, while the same proteins with the N-terminal Arg-rich domain truncated fail to interact with RNA. These findings indicate that all three Nef proteins from HIV- 1, HIV- 2 and simian immunodeficiency virus belong to the RNA-binding family of proteins. The three proteins contain an Arg-rich region at the N-terminus which is necessary to interact with RNA.

40|$|Expression of the Bacillus subtilis trpEDCFBA operon {{has been}} shown to be {{regulated}} by transcription attenuation in response to the availability of L-tryptophan. Regulation is mediated by the tryptophan-activated trp RNA-binding attenuation protein, TRAP, the product of mtrB. Formation of mutually exclusive RNA <b>anti-terminator</b> and terminator structures within trp leader RNA determines whether transcription will terminate in the leader region of the operon. Previous studies suggested that transcripts that escape termination are subject to translational regulation via the formation of a secondary structure that blocks ribosome access to the trpE ribosome-binding site. To assess the relative importance of these postulated events in trp operon regulation, we used site-directed mutagenesis to alter the putative elements involved in transcriptional and translational control. Using a trpE'-'lacZ reporter, we measured translational yield and specific mRNA levels with various leader constructs, in both mtrB+ and mtrB strains, during growth in the presence and absence of excess tryptophan. To verify that the altered regulatory regions behaved as expected, we carried out in vitro transcription assays with the wild-type and altered leader region templates and performed oligonucleotide competition assays with an oligonucleotide complementary to a segment of the transcription terminator. Our results establish that binding of TRAP to leader RNA regulates of transcription termination in the trp operon over about an 88 -fold range and regulates translation of trpE over about a 13 -fold range. The roles played by different trp leader RNA segments in mediating transcriptional and translational regulation are documented by our findings...|$|E

Here {{we identified}} and analyzed the direct targets of CsrA {{in the human}} pathogen Legionella pneumophila. Genome wide transcriptome, proteome and RNA-Co-immunoprecipitaion followed by deep sequencing of a wild type and a csrA mutant strain identified 479 RNAs with potential CsrA interaction sites located in the untranslated and/or coding regions of mRNAs or of known non-coding sRNAs. Further analyses revealed that CsrA exhibits a dual regulatory role in virulence as it affects {{the expression of the}} regulators FleQ, LqsR, LetE and RpoS but it also directly regulates the timely expression of over 40 Dot/Icm substrates. CsrA controls its own expression and the stringent response through a regulatory feedback loop as evidenced by its binding to RelA-mRNA and links it to quorum sensing and motility. CsrA is a central player in the carbon, amino acid, fatty acid metabolism and energy transfer and directly affects the biosynthesis of cofactors, vitamins and secondary metabolites. We describe the first L. pneumophila riboswitch, a thiamine pyrophosphate riboswitch whose regulatory impact is fine-tuned by CsrA, and identified a unique regulatory mode of CsrA, the active stabilization of RNA <b>anti-terminator</b> conformations inside a coding sequence preventing Rho-dependent termination of the gap operon through transcriptional polarity effects. This allows L. pneumophila to regulate the pentose phosphate pathway and the glycolysis combined or individually although they share genes in a single operon.

We have analysed the mechanism by which glucose exerts its inhibitory effect on bgl expression. Results: Our studies show that initiation of transcription from the bgl promoter is only marginally sensitive to glucose. Instead, glucose exerts a more significant inhibition on the elongation of transcription beyond the rho-independent terminator present within the leader sequence. Transcriptional analyses using plasmids that carry mutations in bglG or within the terminator, suggest that the target for glucose-mediated repression is the <b>anti-terminator</b> protein, BglG. Introduction of multiple copies of bglG or the presence of mutations that inhibit its phosphorylation by Enzyme II^B^g^l (BglF), result in loss of glucose repression. Studies using crp, cya and crr strains show that both CRP-cAMP and the Enzyme IIA^G^l^c (EIIA^G^l^c) are {{involved in}} the regulation. Although transcription initiation is normal in a crp, cya double mutant, no detectable transcription is seen downstream of the terminator, which is restored by a mutation within the terminator. Transcription past the terminator is also partly restored by the addition of exogenous cAMP to glucose-grown cultures of a crp(+) strain. Glucose repression is lost in the crr mutant strain. Conclusions: The results summarized above indicate that glucose repression in the bgl operon is mediated at the level of transcription anti-termination, and glucose affects the activity of BglG by altering its phosphorylation by BglF. The CRP-cAMP complex is also involved in this regulation. The results using the crr mutant suggest a negative role for EIIA^G^l^c in the catabolite repression of the bgl genes...|$|E
40|$|The carbon storage {{regulator}} protein CsrA regulates cellular processes post-transcriptionally by binding to target-RNAs altering translation efficiency and/or their stability. Here {{we identified}} and analyzed the direct targets of CsrA {{in the human}} pathogen Legionella pneumophila. Genome wide transcriptome, proteome and RNA co-immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing of a wild type and a csrA mutant strain identified 479 RNAs with potential CsrA interaction sites located in the untranslated and/or coding regions of mRNAs or of known non-coding sRNAs. Further analyses revealed that CsrA exhibits a dual regulatory role in virulence as it affects {{the expression of the}} regulators FleQ, LqsR, LetE and RpoS but it also directly regulates the timely expression of over 40 Dot/Icm substrates. CsrA controls its own expression and the stringent response through a regulatory feedback loop as evidenced by its binding to RelA-mRNA and links it to quorum sensing and motility. CsrA is a central player in the carbon, amino acid, fatty acid metabolism and energy transfer and directly affects the biosynthesis of cofactors, vitamins and secondary metabolites. We describe the first L. pneumophila riboswitch, a thiamine pyrophosphate riboswitch whose regulatory impact is fine-tuned by CsrA, and identified a unique regulatory mode of CsrA, the active stabilization of RNA <b>anti-terminator</b> conformations inside a coding sequence preventing Rho-dependent termination of the gap operon through transcriptional polarity effects. This allows L. pneumophila to regulate the pentose phosphate pathway and the glycolysis combined or individually although they share genes in a single operon. Thus the L. pneumophila genome has evolved to acclimate at least five different modes of regulation by CsrA giving it a truly unique position in its life cycle...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus subtilis {{transports}} -glucosides such as salicin by {{a dedicated}} phosphotransferase system (PTS). The {{expression of the}} -glucoside permease BglP is induced {{in the presence of}} the substrate salicin, and this induction requires the binding of the <b>anti-terminator</b> protein LicT to a specific RNA target in the 5 = region of the bglPmRNA to prevent the formation of a transcription terminator. LicT is composed of an N-terminal RNA-binding domain and two consecutive PTS regulation domains, PRD 1 and PRD 2. In the absence of salicin, LicT is phosphorylated on PRD 1 by BglP and thereby inactivated. In the presence of the inducer, the phosphate group from PRD 1 is transferred back to BglP and consequently to the incoming substrate, resulting in the activa-tion of LicT. In this study, we have investigated the intracellular localization of LicT. While the protein was evenly distributed in the cell in the absence of the inducer, we observed a subpolar localization of LicT if salicin was present in the medium. Upon ad-dition or removal of the inducer, LicT rapidly relocalized in the cells. This dynamic relocalization did not depend on the binding of LicT to its RNA target sites, since the localization pattern was not affected by deletion of all LicT binding sites. In contrast, experiments with mutants affected in the PTS components as well as mutations of the LicT phosphorylation sites revealed that phosphorylation of LicT by the PTS components plays a major role in the control of the subcellular localization of this RNA-binding transcription factor. The heterotrophic soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis lives in an en-vironment that strongly fluctuates with respect to nutrient availability. To cope with this challenge, B. subtilis is able to selec...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Shigella flexneri {{temperate}} bacteriophage Sf 6 is {{of interest}} in part because its prophage expresses the oac gene that alters the antigenic properties of the surface O-antigen polysaccharide of its host bacterium. We have determined the complete sequence of its 39, 044 bp genome. The sequence shows that Sf 6 {{is a member of}} the canonical lambdoid phage group, and like other phages of this type has a highly mosaic genome. It has chromosomal regions that encode proteins > 80 % identical with at least 15 different previously characterized lambdoid phages and prophages, but 43 % of the genome, including the virion assembly genes, is homologous to the genome of one phage, HK 620. An analysis of the nucleotide differences between Sf 6 and HK 620 indicates that even these similar regions are highly mosaic. This mosaicism suggests ways in which the virion structural proteins might interact with each other. The Sf 6 early operons are arranged like a typical lambdoid phage, with “boundary sequences” often found between functional modules in the “metabolic” genome domain. By virtue of high degree of similarity in the encoding genes and their DNA target sites, we predict that the integrase, early transcription <b>anti-terminator,</b> CI and Cro repressors, and CII protein of Sf 6 have DNA binding specificities very similar to the homologous proteins encoded by phages HK 620, λ, 434 and P 22, respectively. The late operon contains two tRNA genes. The Sf 6 terminase genes are unusual. Analysis of in vivo initiation of the DNA packaging series showed that the Sf 6 apparatus that recognizes DNA for packaging appears to cleave DNA for initiation of packaging series at many sites within a large region of about 1800 bp that includes a possible pac site. This is unlike previously characterized phage packaging mechanisms. Sherwood Casjens, Danella A. Winn-Stapley, Eddie B. Gilcrease, Renato Morona, Christiane Kühlewein, James E. H. Chua, Paul A.
