A typical modern microcontroller has many three-state general-purpose input/output pins that can be programmed to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> any {{of those kinds of}} pins.|$|R

50|$|The E384 residue {{was found}} to have a dual function. First it <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> general base to {{activate}} water <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nucleophile. Then it <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> general acid to cleave the C-N bond.|$|R
50|$|The {{essence of}} Brønsted-Lowry {{theory is that}} an acid only exists as such in {{relation}} to a base, and vice versa. Water is amphoteric <b>as</b> it can <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> acid or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> base. In the image shown at the right one molecule of H2O <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> base and gains H+ to become H3O+while the other <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> acid and loses H+ to become OH−.|$|R
