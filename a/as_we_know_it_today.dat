5|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that the Solar System <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today</b> will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase.

Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.|$|E

5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today</b> until the {{hydrogen}} {{in the core}} of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.|$|E

25|$|The Arabic script <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today</b> {{was unknown}} in Muhammad’s time (as Arabic writing styles have progressed through time) and the Quran was {{preserved}} through memorization and written references on different materials. As Arab society started to evolve into using writing more regularly, writing skills evolved accordingly. Early Quranic Arabic lacked precision because distinguishing between consonants was impossible {{due to the}} absence of diacritical marks (a’jam). Vowelling marks (tashkil) to indicate prolongation or vowels were absent as well. Due to this there were endless possibilities for the mispronunciation of the word. The Arabic script <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today,</b> the scripta plena, which has pointed texts and is fully vowelled was not perfected until the middle of the 9th century.|$|E
