50|$|The method {{relies on}} a DNA-based probe with a {{fluorescent}} reporter {{at one end and}} <b>a</b> <b>quencher</b> of fluorescence {{at the opposite end of}} the probe. The close proximity of the reporter to the quencher prevents detection of its fluorescence; breakdown of the probe by the 5' to 3' exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase breaks the reporter-quencher proximity and thus allows unquenched emission of fluorescence, which can be detected after excitation with a laser. An increase in the product targeted by the reporter probe at each PCR cycle therefore causes a proportional increase in fluorescence due to the breakdown of the probe and release of the reporter.|$|E

Several different fluorophores (e.g. 6-carboxyfluorescein, acronym: FAM, or tetrachlorofluorescein, acronym: TET) and quenchers (e.g. tetramethylrhodamine, acronym: TAMRA) are available. The quencher molecule quenches the fluorescence emitted by the fluorophore when excited by the cycler’s light source via FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer). As long as the fluorophore and the quencher are in proximity, quenching inhibits any fluorescence signals (Figure 1).|$|E

However, whereas the TaqMan fluorescent probes are cleaved during amplification, Molecular Beacon probes remain intact and rebind to a new target during each reaction cycle. When free in solution, the close proximity of the fluorescent probe and the quencher molecule prevents fluorescence through FRET. However, when Molecular Beacon probes hybridize to a target, the fluorescent dye and the quencher are separated resulting in the emittance of light upon excitation. As is with the TaqMan probes, Molecular Beacons are expensive to synthesize and require separate probes for each RNA target.|$|E
50|$|The {{emergence}} of novel fluorescent DNA labeling techniques {{in the past}} few years have enabled the analysis and detection of PCR products in real-time and has consequently led to the widespread adoption of real-time RT-PCR for the analysis of gene expression. Not only is real-time RT-PCR now the method of choice for quantification of gene expression, it is also the preferred method of obtaining results from array analyses and gene expressions on a global scale. Currently, there are four different fluorescent DNA probes available for the real-time RT-PCR detection of PCR products: SYBR Green, TaqMan, Molecular Beacons, and Scorpions. All of these probes allow the detection of PCR products by generating a fluorescent signal. While the SYBR Green dye emits its fluorescent signal simply by binding to the double-stranded DNA in solution, the TaqMan probes, Molecular Beacons and Scorpions generation of fluorescence depend on Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) coupling of the dye molecule and <b>a</b> <b>quencher</b> moiety to the oligonucleotide substrates.|$|E

Selenate, thus, {{seemed to be}} operating as <b>a</b> ROS <b>quencher,</b> since N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant com-pound, also stimulated largely the growth of Al-inhibited seedlings. At a higher concentra-tion (0. 1 mM), however, selenate inhibited seed-ling growth and elongation was recovered by NAC. Ethylene production by selenate plus NAC-treated seedlings was very higher and thus the gaseous hormone was {{not responsible for the}} seedling growth inhibition caused by sele-nate.

50|$|Taq DNA polymerase’s 5’-nuclease {{activity}} {{is used in}} the TaqMan assay for SNP genotyping. The TaqMan assay is performed concurrently with a PCR reaction and the results can be read in real-time as the PCR reaction proceeds (McGuigan & Ralston 2002). The assay requires forward and reverse PCR primers that will amplify a region that includes the SNP polymorphic site. Allele discrimination is achieved using FRET combined with one or two allele-specific probes that hybridize to the SNP polymorphic site. The probes will have a fluorophore linked to their 5’ end and <b>a</b> <b>quencher</b> molecule linked to their 3’ end. While the probe is intact, the quencher will remain in close proximity to the fluorophore, eliminating the fluorophore’s signal. During the PCR amplification step, if the allele-specific probe is perfectly complementary to the SNP allele, it will bind to the target DNA strand and then get degraded by 5’-nuclease activity of the Taq polymerase as it extends the DNA from the PCR primers. The degradation of the probe results in the separation of the fluorophore from the quencher molecule, generating a detectable signal. If the allele-specific probe is not perfectly complementary, it will have lower melting temperature and not bind as efficiently. This prevents the nuclease from acting on the probe (McGuigan & Ralston 2002).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the basic}} Invader assay, a FEN called {{cleavase}} {{is combined with}} two specific oligonucleotide probes, that together with the target DNA, can form a tripartite structure recognized by cleavase. [...] The first probe, called the Invader oligonucleotide is complementary to the 3’ end of the target DNA. The last base of the Invader oligonucleotide is a non-matching base that overlaps the SNP nucleotide in the target DNA. The second probe is an allele-specific probe which is complementary to the 5’ end of the target DNA, but also extends past the 3’ side of the SNP nucleotide. The allele-specific probe will contain a base complementary to the SNP nucleotide. If the target DNA contains the desired allele, the Invader and allele-specific probes will bind to the target DNA forming the tripartite structure. This structure is recognized by cleavase, which will cleave and release the 3’ end of the allele-specific probe. If the SNP nucleotide in the target DNA is not complementary allele-specific probe, the correct tripartite structure is not formed and no cleavage occurs. The Invader assay is usually coupled with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system to detect the cleavage event. In this setup, <b>a</b> <b>quencher</b> molecule {{is attached to the}} 3’ end and a fluorophore is attached to the 5’ end of the allele-specific probe. If cleavage occurs, the fluorophore will be separated from the quencher molecule generating a detectable signal.|$|E
5000|$|SYBR Green: [...] When the SYBR Green binds to the {{double-stranded}} DNA of the PCR products, it will emit light upon excitation. The {{intensity of}} the fluorescence increases as the PCR products accumulate. This technique is easy to use since designing of probes is not necessary given lack of specificity of its binding. However, since the dye does not discriminate the double-stranded DNA from the PCR products and those from the primer-dimers, overestimation of the target concentration is a common problem. Where accurate quantification is an absolute necessity, further assay for the validation of results must be performed. Nevertheless, amongst the real-time RT-PCR product detection methods, SYBR Green is the most economical and easiest to use. TaqMan Probes: [...] TaqMan probes are oligonucleotides that have a fluorescent probe attached to the 5' end and <b>a</b> <b>quencher</b> to the 3' end. During PCR amplification, these probes will hybridize to the target sequences located in the amplicon and as polymerase replicates the template with TaqMan bound, it also cleaves the fluorescent probe due to polymerase 5'- nuclease activity. Because the close proximity between the quench molecule and the fluorescent probe normally prevents fluorescence from being detected through FRET, the decoupling results in the increase of intensity of fluorescence proportional {{to the number of}} the probe cleavage cycles. Although well-designed TaqMan probes produce accurate real-time RT-PCR results, it is expensive and time-consuming to synthesize when separate probes must be made for each mRNA target analyzed.|$|E

40|$|Cyanobacteria have {{developed}} a photoprotective mechanism that decreases the energy arriving at the photosynthetic reaction centers under high-light conditions. The photoactive orange carotenoid protein (OCP) is essential in this mechanism as a light sensor and energy quencher. When OCP is photoactivated by strong blue-green light, {{it is able to}} dissipate excess energy as heat by interacting with phycobilisomes. As a consequence, charge separation and recombination leading to the formation of singlet oxygen diminishes. Here, we demonstrate that OCP has another essential role. We observed that OCP also protects Synechocystis cells from strong orange-red light, a condition in which OCP is not photoactivated. We first showed that this photoprotection is related to a decrease of singlet oxygen concentration due to OCP action. Then, we demonstrated that, in vitro, OCP is a very good singlet oxygen quencher. By contrast, another carotenoid protein having a high similarity with the N-terminal domain of OCP is not more efficient as <b>a</b> singlet oxygen <b>quencher</b> than <b>a</b> protein without carotenoid. Although OCP is a soluble protein, it is able to quench the singlet oxygen generated in the thylakoid membranes.
