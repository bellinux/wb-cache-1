5|$|Although {{the ontological}} {{argument}} {{may have been}} implicit {{in the works of}} Greek philosophers such as Plato and the Neoplatonists, the mainstream view is that the ontological argument was first clearly stated and developed by Anselm of Canterbury. Some scholars argued that the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina) developed <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>kind</b> of ontological argument before Anselm, but other scholars have doubted this position. Daniel Dombrowski marked three major stages {{in the development of the}} argument: Anselm's initial explicit formulation; the eighteenth century criticisms of Kant and Hume; and the identification of a second ontological argument in Anselm's Proslogion by twentieth century philosophers.|$|E

5|$|In a {{paper from}} 1998, Alain Connes, Michael R.

5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles. Choosing an orientation for a forest produces <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>kind</b> of {{directed acyclic graph}} called a polytree. However {{there are many other}} kinds of directed acyclic graph that are not formed by orienting the edges of an undirected acyclic graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of a direction for its edges that makes it into a directed acyclic graph. To emphasize that DAGs are {{not the same thing as}} directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs, some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.|$|E
5|$|Typically, such {{models are}} based on the idea of compactification. Starting with the ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime of string or M-theory, {{physicists}} postulate a shape for the extra dimensions. By choosing this shape appropriately, they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics, together with additional undiscovered particles, usually supersymmetric partners to analogues of known particles. One popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is to start with the heterotic theory in ten dimensions and assume that the six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold. This is <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>kind</b> of geometric object named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau. Calabi–Yau manifolds offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory. Other similar methods can be used to construct models with physics resembling to some extent that of our four-dimensional world based on M-theory.|$|E

5|$|While parody {{sometimes}} {{served as}} <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>kind</b> of translation, some translations returned the compliment {{by providing a}} parodic version of the Elegy in their endeavour to accord to the current poetic style in the host language.

In place of the plain English of Gray’s “And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave”, he substituted the Parnassian Tous les dons de Plutus, tous les dons de Cythère (All the gifts of Plutus and of Cytherea) and kept this up throughout the poem in a performance that its English reviewer noted as bearing only the thinnest relation to the original.|$|E
5|$|Each Civilization in The Age of Kings has {{one or two}} special {{units that}} are {{exclusive}} to that Civilization. For instance, the Britons have access to longbowmen, an archery unit with increased range. These Civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but still follow the basic rock-paper-scissors model. The monk is <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>kind</b> of military unit that {{has the ability to}} convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units. Monks are also used to collect relics; relics accumulate gold once held in the player's monastery—the more relics are captured, the faster the gold is accumulated. Collecting all relics on the map is one method by which a player can win a random map game, depending on the victory setting. Once a player has all in their monasteries, a timer is shown to all players. If an opposing player does not destroy a monastery holding a relic after the set time, then that player wins.|$|E

In the , written in 1849, the author describes the customs of the wood-cutters of Mino Province, who used a sort of rice cake called kuhin-mochi to placate the tengu, who would otherwise perpetrate all sorts of mischief.
