5|$|The {{equivalence}} between inertia {{and gravity}} cannot explain tidal effects– it cannot explain {{variations in the}} gravitational field.

5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit <b>around</b> <b>it.</b> This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E
5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} components {{are covered with}} either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted <b>around</b> <b>it.</b> A cover screw is {{flush with the surface}} of the dental implant, and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E

5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles <b>around</b> <b>it</b> for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E

After their eggs hatch, the parents keep the larvae clean of fungus and bacteria and help the larvae feed by regurgitating food for them.|$|E

Nearly one thousand monks, accompanied by laypeople, returned to the cremation site. The police lingered nearby. At around 6:00 pm, thirty nuns and six monks were arrested for holding a prayer meeting on the street outside Xá Lợi. The police encircled the pagoda, blocking public passage and giving observers the impression that an armed siege was imminent by donning riot gear.|$|E

Naughty Dog also redesigned her appearance during the game's development to more closely resemble Johnson. Her appearance has also been compared to that of actress Ellen Page.|$|E
