5|$|Elite Force {{includes}} <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> <b>of</b> Star Trek–themed weapons, such as phasers and disruptors. The weapons vary in power, ammunition {{consumption and}} effectiveness in given situations. Usually, the player {{is equipped with}} a hand phaser, a low-damage weapon that automatically recharges ammunition, and a phaser compression rifle, a more powerful weapon with an optional sniper mode for long distance kills. Other weapons, acquired as the game progresses, include grenade launchers, stasis weaponry and pulse energy weapons. The player can restock on ammunition by using wall-mounted terminals that dispense weapon energy, or by picking up certain items in the game environment.|$|E
5|$|Swiss Hunters were {{operated}} as interceptors, with {{a secondary}} ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> <b>of</b> conventional iron bombs, {{a number of}} compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by the Hunters. In the interceptor role, the Hunters were supplemented by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound. In case of unservicable airstrips, Swiss Air Force Jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.|$|E

5|$|STRIKE's {{victory in}} the Black Sea leads them to the Caucasus, where Sadissa Savak, leader of the fictional state of Irek, begins {{aggressive}} overtures against local fighters. In the mission (which is supposedly north of the main battle area where Desert Strike took place), the player and Amad join forces with a militia run by Amad's relatives in stopping Ireki troops from capturing an ex-Soviet chemical weapons plant. With STRIKE killing Savak (and passed off as {{the victim of a}} car crash), the group goes to a heavily irradiated Transylvania to rescue Nick once more, this time from Dr Grymyenko Ukrainian, who wields <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> <b>of</b> ballistic missiles. The player is also tasked to kill the Shadowman's lead armor commander, Vila, who operates a special red-turreted T-80, and aid in the destruction of an abandoned nuclear reactor the Shadowman is planning to use.|$|E
5|$|Imam Ahmad bin Yahya {{inherited}} the Yemeni throne in 1948. In 1955, Iraq-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against him. A {{group of soldiers}} under his command surrounded the royal palace of Al Urdhi at Taiz, a fortified stronghold where the Imam lived with his harem, the royal treasure, <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> <b>of</b> modern weapons, and a 150 strong palace-guard, and demanded Ahmad's abdication. Ahmad agreed, but demanded that his son, Muhammad al-Badr succeed him. Thalaya refused, preferring the king's half brother, the Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48-year-old Foreign Minister. While Abdullah began forming a new government, Ahmad opened the treasury coffers and secretly began buying off the besieging soldiers. After five days, the number of besiegers was reduced from 600 to 40. Ahmad then {{came out of the}} palace, wearing a devil's mask and wielding a long scimitar, terrifying the besiegers. He slashed two sentries dead before exchanging the sword for a sub-machine gun and leading his 150 guards onto the roof of the palace to begin a direct attack on the rebels. After 28 hours, 23 rebels and one palace guard were dead and Thalaya gave up. Abdullah was later reported executed, and Thalaya was publicly decapitated.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{international}} pressure Turkey was ostensibly restricted to providing economic support to Azerbaijan. Nonetheless, the Turkish army and intelligence services launched undercover operations to supply Azerbaijan with arms and military personnel. According to Turkish sources, over 350 high-ranking officers {{and thousands of}} volunteers from Turkey participated in the warfare on the Azerbaijani side. Western authors reported several major shipments of weapons from Turkey, including bringing <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> <b>of</b> Soviet-made arms from the former East Germany.|$|E

25|$|The MRHA, the Sedition Act, section 298A of the Penal Code and the ISA {{all share}} an {{underlying}} objective: to maintain public order. The greatest {{disparity between the}} MRHA and the other pieces of legislation {{lies in the fact}} that the former provides for a much more benign resolution of issues. One commentator has said that there seems to be no apparent purpose for having a wide array of outcomes to choose from when dealing with the same mischief – religious disharmony. On the other hand, it might be argued that given a highly sensitive topic like religion, which incites deep feelings, <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> <b>of</b> options is vital so that an outcome best suiting the scenario can be tailored. Nevertheless, the MRHA, despite having the least severe consequences, has not yet been invoked.|$|E
25|$|On May 31, Xu Hai's raiders laid siege to Tongxiang with <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> <b>of</b> siege engines {{at their}} disposal, {{including}} siege towers mounted on boats, wheeled battering rams, and Portuguese breech-loading swivel guns. However, Tongxiang {{was protected by}} a new wall that was completed in 1553 and competent defenders who withstood the siege. The attackers eventually lost interest in costly assaults and settled with trying to starve out the defenders. Ruan E sent out strongly worded calls for help in which he denounced Hu Zongxian's policy of appeasement and urged quick action, but Hu Zongxian did not {{make an effort to}} relieve the siege other than making a show of force since his men suffered from low morale after the defeat at Zaolin. Instead, Hu withdrew to his headquarters at Hangzhou and tried to negotiate with Xu Hai through intermediaries while he waited for reinforcements.|$|E
25|$|Doom’s armor augments {{his natural}} {{physical}} strength to superhuman levels, {{to the point}} where he is able to overpower normal humans and hold his own against superhuman foes Spider-Man, the Hulk and the Thing in hand-to-hand combat, although he tends to rely on long-range tactics when engaging physically stronger foes. It is also nigh-indestructible, capable of taking hits from most superhuman foes to some cosmic level beings and protecting Doom from matter manipulation, reality warping and psychic assaults. The armor has <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> <b>of</b> high tech weaponry and gadgets hidden within it, energy manipulation, absorption and projection, is capable of generating a defensive force field and a lethal electric shock stunning or killing anyone who might come in contact with Doctor Doom. The armor is self-supporting, equipped with internal stores and recycling systems for air, food, water, and energy, allowing the wearer to survive lengthy periods of exposure underwater or in outer space.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Star Sapphire's {{powers are}} vast. She {{is equipped with}} <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> <b>of</b> weapons, including a replicate Zamaron star sapphire, of unknown origin. She also {{has a variety of}} personal powers, though whether they stem from herself or her personal armament is unclear. She is also able to access the memories of the Zamorans regarding the Star Sapphire gem, such as the experiences of other wearers. As with the powers of the woman bearing the title of Star Sapphire, the limitations of the Star Sapphire gem are also unclear. Psychologically, the women serving as Star Sapphire have displayed a bizarre preoccupation with gender, suspected of reflecting a pathological fear of men. They also have had a less than accurate grasp of the variations in physics between dimensions. They are sometimes foiled primarily due to their own overconfidence. The Star Sapphire gems used to power the original incarnations of Star Sapphire were used by the Zamarons to create the main violet Power Battery.|$|E
25|$|Todd McFarlane's Spawn: The Video Game is an action-style side-scrolling beat 'em up {{video game}} with some {{platforming}} elements. The player controls the main character, named Al, who can walk, run, duck and jump throughout the seventeen {{levels of the}} game. In combat, Al can punch and kick in order to attack enemies. In addition to the melee attacks available, the main character has access to <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> <b>of</b> special powers that requires the input of a special button combination on the controller. Using a special power will drain his life force meter, and different special powers use different amounts of energy. Several of Al's special powers will fire projectiles, but the main character can also teleport as well as use a special power that completely refills his life force meter. Also, the main character's health can be replenished by collecting a special item dropped {{by one of the}} end-of-level bosses when defeated. The game is over when the life meter is fully depleted, or the in-game timer runs out.|$|E
25|$|Artemus {{is held by}} {{officials}} of an unnamed government (the nation had <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> <b>of</b> Cruise Missiles and Minutemen, though the United States is not directly named) who fear his powers yet want to use them militarily. As part of this plan, they persuade him to construct the Zone, and they present him to the people as an inspiring nationalistic symbol. Once the Zone is completed, the government launches a first strike nuclear attack against an unnamed foe. From that point on, life for the survivors in the Zone becomes distinctly Orwellian, revolving around {{the will of the}} omnipresent Artemus, who is accepted by the people as a benevolent messianic figure. The boy can read the thoughts of anyone in the Zone, and the people find that comforting. He has absolute power, though he is influenced by flattery to enforce the will of the government officials. Throughout much of the story, Artemus is confused and unsure of what he should do, which adds to his vulnerability to official leadership.|$|E
