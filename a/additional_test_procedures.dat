40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} some <b>testing</b> <b>procedures,</b> both in time/frequency framework, useful to test for significant cycles in insurance data. The US underwriting cycle is measured using the growth rates of real premiums. Design/methodology/approach – In addition to the traditional AR(2) model, two new approaches are suggested: testing for a significant peak in the periodogram using Fisher g test and a nonparametric version of it, and testing for unit root cycles in insurance data. Findings – All approaches find empirical evidence for a cyclical behaviour of the growth rates of property-liability real premiums. Results on the length of dominant cycle still diverge, according to the approach (time/frequency domain). Originality/value – Compared to the existing literature, the present study innovates in that it highlights <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedures,</b> helpful to detect significant cycles in insurance time series.

This report discusses testing that was performed for analyzing the alkali-silica reactivity of ULHS in cement slurries. Laboratory testing during the eleventh quarter focused on evaluation of the alkali-silica reaction of eight different cement compositions, four of which contain ULHS. This report provides a progress summary of ASR testing. The original laboratory procedure for measuring set cement expansion resulted in unacceptable erosion of the test specimens. In subsequent tests, a different expansion procedure was implemented and an alternate curing method for cements formulated with TXI Lightweight cement was employed to prevent sample failure caused by thermal shock.

40|$|The use of test-coverage {{measures}} (e. g., block-coverage {{to control}} the software test process has become an increasingly common practice. This is justified by the assumption that higher test-coverage helps achieve higher defect-coverage and therefore improves software quality. In practice, data often show that defect-coverage and test-coverage grow over time, as <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> is performed. However, {{it is unclear whether}} this phenomenon of concurrent growth can be attributed to a causal dependency, or if it is coincidental, simply due to the cumulative nature of both measures.

40|$|Analysis of viral strand {{sequence}} {{data and}} viral replication capacity could potentially lead to biological insights regarding the replication ability of HIV- 1. Determining specific target codons on the viral strand will facilitate the manufacturing of target specific antiretrovirals. Various algorithmic and analysis techniques {{can be applied}} to this application. We propose using multiple testing to find codons which have significant univariate associations with replication capacity of the virus. We also propose using a data adaptive multiple regression algorithm to obtain multiple predictions of viral replication capacity based on an entire mutant/non-mutant sequence profile. The data set to which these techniques were applied consists of 317 patients, each with 282 sequenced protease and reverse transcriptase codons. Initially, the multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> (Pollard and van der Laan, 2003) was applied to the individual specific viral sequence data. A single-step multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> method was used to control the family wise error rate (FWER) at the five percent alpha level. <b>Additional</b> augmentation multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> were applied to control the generalized family wise error (gFWER) or the tail probability of the proportion of false positives (TPPFP). Finally, the loss-based, cross-validated Deletion/Substitution/Addition regression algorithm (Sinisi and van der Laan, 2004) was applied to the dataset separately. This algorithm builds candidate estimators in the prediction of a univariate outcome by minimizing an empirical risk, and it uses cross-validation to select fine-tuning parameters such as: size of the regression model, maximum allowed order of interaction of terms in the regression model, and the dimension of the vector of covariates. This algorithm also is used to measure variable importance of the codons. Findings from these multiple analyses are consistent with biological findings and could possibly lead to further biological knowledge regarding HIV- 1 viral data.

Hospital libraries face a particular challenge because {{the goals of the}} health care system demand that the relevance of library services to patient care be determined. The hospital librarians in Rochester, New York, responded to this challenge by developing a research project that explored the impact of library services on clinical decision making. A systematically sampled group of 448 physicians in the Rochester area agreed to participate in the study between September 1990 and March 1991. The physicians were asked to request some information related to a current clinical case and then to evaluate its impact on the care of their patients. Senior medical staff or administrators acted as study facilitators in each of the fifteen participating hospitals. As a result of the information provided by the library, 80 % of the 208 physicians who returned their questionnaires said that they probably or definitely handled some aspect of patient care differently than they would have handled it otherwise. Changes in the following specific aspects of care were reported by the physicians: diagnosis (29 %), choice of tests (51 %), choice of drugs (45 %), reduced length of hospital stay (19 %), and advice given to the patient (72 %).
