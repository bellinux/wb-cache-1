40|$|Fatigue {{properties}} in the very high cycle (VHCF) regime have been studied for Alclad 2024 -T 351 thin sheets. Furthermore, {{the influence of a}} riblet-like surface structure has been evaluated. For this we used a rolling technique to form a riblet structure into the <b>Al</b> <b>clad</b> layer. Fatigue testing was performed at ultrasonic frequencies of 20 kHz, in order to ensure a reasonable runtime of the experiments, with fully reversed axial loading (R = − 1). The clad material shows a sharp transition from early failure at some 106 cycles to run-outs at ⩾⩾ 2 × 109 cycles. The corresponding threshold is higher for the structured samples, due to a modified stress distribution near the interface between Al cladding and Al 2024 substrate as well as due to a shorter crack length of the fatigue cracks formed in the cladding. Fatigue cracks are initiated at the surface of the clad layer and grow easily to the interface (cladding/substrate). The fatigue threshold for this compound material {{can be attributed to the}} threshold for further crack growth into the substrat...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic heavy {{wire bonding}} {{is one of}} the most {{relevant}} interconnection technologies in automotive and power electric devices. The reliability of electronic components in these fields is mainly determined by the interconnection lifetime during application and, thus by the strength and fatigue characteristics of the mechanically and thermo-mechanically loaded bonding wire materials. In the current paper, mechanical and micro structure properties of different heavy bonding wire materials including Al-, Cu- and Al-clad Cu wires are analyzed in their initial state prior to bonding. Fatigue properties were estimated in the form of the Coffin-Manson equation for the wires loaded in uniaxial cyclic testing. In addition, corresponding microstructure properties were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD). The applied approach aims at an improved understanding of basic material properties governing the general reliabi lity behavior of the wires independently from any specific application. The results obtained, enable a more detailed understanding of the material aspects governing the low cycle fatigue behavior of different heavy bonding wires. In particular, they provide an explanation for the superior life time behavior of Cu- and <b>Al</b> <b>clad</b> Cu wires compared to Al wires.

40|$|Interaction between U-Mo {{fuel and}} Al {{has proven to}} {{dramatically}} impact the overall irradiation performance of RERTR dispersion fuels. It is of interest to better understand how similar interactions may affect the performance of monolithic fuel plates, where a uranium alloy fuel is sandwiched between aluminum alloy cladding. The monolithic fuel plate removes the fuel matrix entirely, which reduces the total surface area of the fuel that is available to react with the aluminum and moves the interface between the fuel and cladding to a colder region of the fuel plate. One of the major fabrication techniques for producing monolithic fuel plates is friction stir welding. This paper will discuss the interactions that can occur between the U-Mo foil and 6061 <b>Al</b> <b>cladding</b> when applying this fabrication technique. It has been determined that the time at high temperatures should be limited as much as is possible during fabrication or any post-fabrication treatment to reduce {{as much as possible}} the interactions between the foil and cladding.

40|$|Aluminum (Al) is a {{commonly}} used matrix for research reactor fuel plates. It {{has been found}} that a reaction between the fuel and the aluminum matrix may reduce or increase the irradiation stability of the fuel. To further understand the contribution of the reaction to the irradiation stability, experiments to develop a non-reacting matrix were performed. The work focused on magnesium (Mg), which is an excellent non-reacting matrix candidate and has a neutron absorption coefficient similar to Al. To avoid the formation of a liquid Al/Mg phase, improvements were made to the roll bonding process to achieve acceptable bonding at 415 C. After these methods were developed, fuel plates were produced with two fuels, uranium (U) - 2 w/o molybdenum (Mo) and U- 10 -w/o Mo with two matrices, Al and Mg. A reaction between the magnesium and the 6061 <b>Al</b> <b>cladding</b> was discovered to take place during the processing at 415 C.

Multi-layered samples were produced, with artificially implanted defects of different sizes between the <b>clad</b> <b>Al</b> and steel layer to determine {{the sensitivity of the}} guided wave modes to qualitatively indicate the occurrence of defects based on signal attenuation caused by defects. Electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) were used to generate and detect the guided waves in the pitch and catch technique.

Results show very good sensitivity of the S 0 wave mode for delamination and embedded steel debris detection and a relation between attenuation, defect type, size and annealing state. However, detection of the presence of a brittle intermetallic Al-Fe diffusion layer was not possible due to the strong sensitivity to the material properties and thicknesses of the <b>clad</b> <b>Al</b> and steel materials.

To continue {{the investigation of the}} irradiation performance of Si-rich fuel/matrix interaction layers, RERTR- 6 fuel plate V 1 R 010 (U- 10 Mo/ 6061 Al) was characterized using scanning electron microscopy. This fuel plate was of particular interest because of its similarities to fuel plate R 1 R 010, which had U- 7 Mo particles dispersed in 6061 Al. Both fuel plates were irradiated as part of the RERTR- 6 experiment and saw very similar irradiation conditions. R 1 R 010 was characterized in another study and was observed to form relatively uniform Si-rich layers during fabrication that remained stable during irradiation. Since U- 10 Mo does not interact as much with 6061 Al at high temperatures to form layers, it was of interest to characterize a fuel plate with these particles since it would allow for a comparison of fuel plates with different amounts of preirradiation interaction zone formation, which were then exposed to similar irradiation conditions.

U–Mo alloys in contact with Al and Al alloys can undergo diffusional interactions that can result {{in the development of}} interdiffusion zones with complex fine-grained microstructures composed of multiple phases. A monolithic fuel currently being developed by the RERTR program has local regions where the U–Mo fuel plate is in contact with the <b>Al</b> 6061 <b>cladding</b> and, as a result, the program finds information about interdiffusion zone development at high temperatures of interest. In this study, the microstructural development of diffusion couples consisting of U- 7 wt. %Mo, U- 10 wt. %Mo, and U- 12 wt. %Mo vs. Al 6061 (or 6061 aluminum) cladding, annealed at 500, 550, 600 degrees C for 1, 5, 20, 24, or 132 hours, was analyzed by backscatter electron microscopy and x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy on a scanning electron microscope. Concentration profiles were determined by standardized wavelength dispersive spectroscopy and standardless x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy. The results of this work shows that the presence of surface layers at the U–Mo/Al 6061 interface can dramatically impact the overall interdiffusion behavior in terms of rate of interaction and uniformity of the developed interdiffusion zones. It further reveals that relatively uniform interaction layers with higher Si concentrations can develop in U–Mo/Al 6061 couples annealed at shorter times and that longer times at temperature result in the development of more non-uniform interaction layers with more areas that are enriched in Al. At longer annealing times and relatively high temperatures, U–Mo/Al 6061 couples can exhibit more interaction compared to U–Mo/pure Al couples. The minor alloying constituents in <b>Al</b> 6061 <b>cladding</b> can result in the development of many complex phases in the interaction layer of U–Mo/Al– 6061 cladding couples, and some phases in the interdiffusion zones of U–Mo/Al– 6061 cladding couples are likely similar to those observed for U–Mo/pure Al couples...|$|R

New inexpensive materials, that are corrosion resistant and able to withstand high thermally induced static and cyclic loads, are of high interests in the high-enthalpy geothermal industry (Kaldal et al. 2015, 2016).

Developmental testing of this fuel system indicates that it meets core criteria for fuel qualification, including stable and predictable swelling behavior, mechanical integrity to high burnup, and geometric stability. In addition, the fuel exhibits robust behavior during power-cooling mismatch events under irradiation at high power...|$|R
30|$|In {{recent years}} {{due to the}} {{advancement}} of technology the PCFs are used for sensing of toxic and harmful gases (Morshed et al. 2015 a, b, c), chemicals (Ademgil 2014; Park et al. 2011) and biomedical (Jensen et al. 2005; Dinish et al. 2012) applications. The sensing mechanism takes place by detecting the analytes filled holes in the core region with the evanescent field through the interaction of lights. The interactive features of PCF enable to observe the guiding properties like birefringence (Habib et al. 2013), dispersion (Begum et al. 2009) and nonlinearity (Habib et al. 2014). The first designed PCF was hexagonal (Knight et al. 1996) shaped but due to the autonomous geometrical structures and the advancement of technology numerous PCFs have been designed. By applying different geometrical structure like octagonal (Ademgil 2014), decagonal (Razzak et al. 2007), elliptical (Hao et al. 2013), honey comb <b>cladding</b> (Hou et <b>al.</b> 2013), hybrid <b>cladding</b> (Morshed et <b>al.</b> 2015 a) better guiding properties have been achieved.|$|R

40|$|Compared to {{conventional}} arc-welding processes {{commonly used to}} repair aluminium (<b>Al)</b> components, laser <b>cladding</b> involves lower overall heat input, less part distortion and narrow heat affected zones (HAZ). With the development of high power lasers, {{it has become an}} attractive technology for the refurbishment of high value-added structural airframe components in commercial and military aircrafts, especially those made of hard-to-weld heat treatable Al alloys. A series of cladding trials was performed on Al 7075 -T 6 alloy substrates using an Al- 12 Si alloy powder as the filler repair material because of its high corrosion resistance and a high power Nd:YAG laser. The effects of laser operating parameters such as laser power, substrate scan rate, powder feed rate and increment between cladding tracks on the clad characteristics, e. g. height, depth and dilution, were investigated. Results are described, showing how the process conditions were optimized to reduce the clad depth, dilution and HAZ, while minimizing the formation of porosity in the clad during solidification. Clad samples were produced without liquation cracks in the HAZ, and despite the unavoidable formation of decorated grain boundaries near the fusion zone, the tensile strength of selected claddings was acceptable, within 5 % of that of the parent metal, while ductility was low but similar to the parent metal...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} our {{fabrication}} and characterization of Al 2 O 3 /Si composite nanodome (CND) structures, which {{is composed of}} Si nanodome structures with a conformal <b>cladding</b> <b>Al</b> 2 O 3 layer to evaluate its optical and electrical performance when it is applied to thin film solar cells. It has been observed that by application of Al 2 O 3 thin film coating using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to the Si nanodome structures, both optical and electrical performances are greatly improved. The reflectivity of less than 3 % over the wavelength range of from 200 nm to 2000 nm at an incident angle from 0 ° to 45 ° is achieved when the Al 2 O 3 film is 90 nm thick. The ultimate efficiency of around 27 % is obtained on the CND textured 2 μm-thick Si solar cells, which is compared to the efficiency of around 25. 75 % and 15 % for the 2 μm-thick Si nanodome surface-decorated and planar samples respectively. Electrical characterization was made by using CND-decorated MOS devices to measure device’s leakage current and capacitance dispersion. It is found the electrical performance is sensitive to {{the thickness of the}} Al 2 O 3 film, and the performance is remarkably improved when the dielectric layer thickness is 90 nm thick. The leakage current, which is less than 4 x 10 − 9 A/cm 2 over voltage range of from - 3 V to 3 V, is reduced by several orders of magnitude. C-V measurements also shows as small as 0. 3 % of variation in the capacitance over the frequency range from 10 kHz to 500 kHz, which is a strong indication of surface states being fully passivated. TEM examination of CND-decorated samples also reveals the occurrence of SiOx layer formed between the interface of Si and the Al 2 O 3 film, which is thin enough that ensures the presence of field-effect passivation, From our theoretical and experimental study, we believe Al 2 O 3 coated CND structures is a truly viable approach to achieving higher device efficiency...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{parameters}} affecting {{the size and}} behavior of aluminum (Al) droplets on and near the burning surface of composite solid propellants. Multiple points of view are studied in the current investigation. The first is {{in the development of}} a Statistical Image Correlation Velocimeter (SICV) to analyze the velocity of exhaust particles and gases leaving the burning surface. Many of the analysis techniques used in the validation of the SICV software are then used to conduct further analysis including additional propellants. The next portion of the study looks at the effect of changing two of the formulation parameters in the propellant: the metal fuel content, and the polymer binder composition. Al/Nickel (Ni) clad particles are used as an additive to the conventional Al powder. Titanium-Boron (Ti-B) is also studied as another potential intermetallic additive. The nature of the binder is studied by examining the differences between propellants made with hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) binders. Strand burns are conducted in the open atmosphere as well as in a windowed combustion vessel at pressures ranging from atmospheric to 700 psig. The burning surface linear regression rate, as well as size of the agglomerated metal fuel particles leaving the surface is measured using macro- and microscopic high speed imaging followed by video analysis using modeling tools and digital particle sizing algorithms. It is shown that the partial replacement of <b>Al</b> with Al/Ni <b>clad</b> particles decreases the average size of the agglomerated particles and increases the propellant burning rate. An optimum fraction likely exists. It is also shown that ball milling, or mechanical activation, of the Al/Ni particles leads to a further increase in the burning rate of the propellant. This is likely due to a decrease in the ignition temperature of the material after it has undergone mechanical activation. Analysis of binder-specific samples reveals that the addition of a DCPD-based binder instead of an HTPB binder increases the linear burning rate, but the average diameter of the agglomerated aluminum particles leaving the surface also increases. A hypothesis is also formed for the poor performance of a Ti-B propellant mixed with HTPB as the binder. ...|$|R
