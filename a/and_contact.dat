40|$|Background rVSV-ZEBOV is a recombinant, {{replication}} competent {{vesicular stomatitis}} virus-based candidate vaccine expressing a surface glycoprotein of Zaire Ebolavirus. We tested {{the effect of}} rVSV-ZEBOV in preventing Ebola virus disease in <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts of recently confirmed cases in Guinea, west Africa. Findings In the randomised part of the trial we identified 4539 <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts in 51 clusters randomly assigned to immediate vaccination (of whom 3232 were eligible, 2151 consented, and 2119 were immediately vaccinated) <b>and</b> 4557 <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts in 47 clusters randomly assigned to delayed vaccination (of whom 3096 were eligible, 2539 consented, and 2041 were vaccinated 21 days after randomisation). No cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 days or more after randomisation among randomly assigned <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts vaccinated in immediate clusters versus 16 cases (7 clusters affected) among all eligible individuals in delayed clusters. Vaccine efficacy was 100 % (95 % CI 68 · 9 – 100 · 0, p= 0 · 0045), and the calculated intraclass correlation coefficient was 0 · 035. Additionally, we defined 19 non-randomised clusters in which we enumerated 2745 <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts, 2006 of whom were eligible and 1677 were immediately vaccinated, including 194 children. The evidence from all 117 clusters showed that no cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 days or more after randomisation among all immediately vaccinated <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts versus 23 cases (11 clusters affected) among all eligible <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts in delayed plus all eligible <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts never vaccinated in immediate clusters. The estimated vaccine efficacy here was 100 % (95 % CI 79 · 3 – 100 · 0, p= 0 · 0033). 52 % of <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts assigned to immediate vaccination and in non-randomised clusters received the vaccine immediately; vaccination protected both vaccinated and unvaccinated people in those clusters. 5837 individuals in total received the vaccine (5643 adults and 194 children), and all vaccinees were followed up for 84 days. 3149 (53 · 9 %) of 5837 individuals reported at least one adverse event in the 14 days after vaccination; these were typically mild (87 · 5 % of all 7211 adverse events). Headache (1832 [25 · 4 %]), fatigue (1361 [18 · 9 %]), and muscle pain (942 [13 · 1 %]) were the most commonly reported adverse events in this period across all age groups. 80 serious adverse events were identified, of which two were judged {{to be related to}} vaccination (one febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one possibly related (influenza-like illness); all three recovered without sequelae...|$|R

Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E

A study published in 2012 showed that four distinct lineages were genetically isolated from each other and could represent different species, recognizable by morphology and song. A molecular phylogeny published in 2014 and including all main species' lineages within nuthatches concluded that the white-breasted nuthatch was more closely related to the giant nuthatch (S. magna) than to S. przewalskii, formerly regarded as possibly conspecific with it; S. przewalskii turned out to be basal in the family.|$|E

5|$|At {{the drop}} zone the pathfinders and Royal Engineers were {{removing}} anti-glider poles {{so that the}} brigade's glider force could land. The gliders, except for those carrying the anti-tank battery, which were unable to locate the site in the heavy mist and had returned to Italy, landed successfully at 09:20. The other gliders and towing aircraft had circled until the mist cleared. It was {{the sight of the}} gliders landing that persuaded the Germans at Clastron to surrender. By 10:15 the brigade had achieved all its objectives apart from capturing Le Muy, which had been allocated to the 5th (Scottish) Battalion.

5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence <b>and</b> <b>contact</b> disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis.

Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie <b>and</b> <b>contact</b> lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E
