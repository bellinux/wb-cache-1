Two days after the game, Tregubov and his team would {{complain}} to arbiters about his suspect strong play, and his frequent toilet breaks. On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an <b>analysis</b> <b>program</b> on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to hand it over, saying that there was private information on the phone, and he was forfeited the game.|$|E

25|$|Residents were {{suspicious}} of black fluid that flowed {{out of the}} Love Canal. For years, residents had complained about odors and substances on their yards or the public playgrounds. Finally the city acted and hired a consultant, Calspan Corporation, to do a massive study. In 1977, a harsh winter storm dumped 33-45 inches of snow, significantly raising the water table. The excess water got into the ground water and raised the elevation of the dioxins, which began erupting in residents' backyards. In the spring of 1977, the State Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation launched an intensive air, soil, and groundwater sampling and <b>analysis</b> <b>program</b> following qualitative identification {{of a number of}} organic compounds in the basements of 11 homes adjacent to the Love Canal.

40|$|<b>Program</b> <b>analysis</b> {{techniques}} {{are used by}} software engineers to deduce and infer characteristics of programs for software-engineering-related tasks. Recently, some <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques {{have been designed to}} leverage characteristics of traditional experimentation. An examination of these techniques suggests that a new form of <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> technique can be created by incorporating characteristics of experimentation. To date, however, there has been little formal recognition by the software engineering community of this form of <b>program</b> <b>analysis,</b> or the implications of using it. ^ This dissertation presents experimental <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> as a unique paradigm for conducting <b>program</b> <b>analysis.</b> We define this paradigm by building on principles and methodologies underlying the use of experimentation in other fields. This work offers four primary contributions. First, we provide definitions of experimental <b>program</b> <b>analysis,</b> illustrate them by example, and describe several intriguing differences between experimental <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> and the use of experimentation in other research fields. Second, we survey the research literature for experimental <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques to offer insights into their existence and diversity—both in terms of the techniques themselves and the problem domains in which they operate. Third, we explore the applicability of experimental <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> in three software engineering problem domains to provide a formative assessment of the capabilities of these techniques, and how they compare—in terms of cost-effectiveness, utility, and capabilities—to non-experimental baseline techniques. Fourth, we explore the use of experimental <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> in a large software development setting, and present a case study to investigate the use of experimental <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> in that setting. ^ The contributions from the foregoing work support the conjecture that the applicability of experimental <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> could be substantial. In particular, we expect that this work will expose the research community to use of experimental <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques, identify domains in which experimental <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> might be useful, suggest many opportunities for improvements to existing techniques, and promote the use of experimentation in <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> in order to confront <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>programs</b> in new and innovative ways. Accordingly, we believe that the experimental <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> paradigm offers a promising new direction for <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> research. ...|$|R

The main applications of <b>program</b> <b>analysis</b> are <b>program</b> optimization and program correctness.
