On the top was an air intake then four layers of four cylinders each. Each cylinder had a 6 in bore and a 6+1/2 in stroke. On the bottom of the crank shaft was an Elliot generator which developed 817 kW at a maximum of 710 volts DC. This proved problematic as the engine fluids ran down into the generator. The whole engine weighed just over eight tons. Being 4 feet wide it allowed for four engines in an engine room only 22 ft long and also allowed design engineers to eliminate a submarine engine room.

40|$|Abstract Background Military members, {{injured in}} Afghanistan or Iraq, have {{returned}} home with multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections. The source of these infections is unknown. Methods Retrospective study of all Canadian {{soldiers who were}} injured in Afghanistan and who required mechanical ventilation from January 1 2006 to September 1 2006. Patients who developed A. baumannii ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) were identified. All A. baumannii isolates were retrieved for study patients and compared with A. baumannii isolates from environmental sources from the Kandahar military hospital using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results During the study period, six Canadian Forces (CF) soldiers were injured in Afghanistan, required mechanical ventilation and were repatriated to Canadian hospitals. Four of these patients developed A. baumannii VAP. A. baumannii was also isolated from one environmental source in Kandahar – a ventilator <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>filter.</b> Patient isolates were genetically indistinguishable {{from each other and}} from the isolates cultured from the ventilator filter. These isolates were resistant to numerous classes of antimicrobials including the carbapenems. Conclusion These results suggest that the source of A. baumannii infection for these four patients was an environmental source in the military field hospital in Kandahar. A causal linkage, however, was not established with the ventilator. This study suggests that infection control efforts and further research should be focused on the military field hospital environment to prevent further multi-drug resistant A. baumannii infections in injured soldiers. </p...|$|E

40|$|The US {{space shuttle}} fleet has been flying for over 20 years. Although the shuttle {{operates}} {{in a unique}} exterior environment, the interior is intentionally made to be {{as close to the}} "normal" human environment as possible. The filtration needs of the shuttle are not substantially different from those of a large mobile home or camper, supporting the needs of a family of seven for up to two weeks. Therefore, most of the materials that are used to filter the air, water, and other fluids on the Shuttle are similar or identical to those employed in other sectors of the transportation industry. The only significantly different feature of the space environment is the unique "three-phase" nature of the air (with suspended liquids and solids ranging in size from aerosol droplets to binoculars). Such suspended debris contributes to the air filtration and waste management problem. Careful flow management and cleanliness practices help to mitigate the effect of debris, and liquid spills are rare, seldom making it to the filters. (It has been common on all spacecraft to look first for lost items on the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>filters,</b> since all objects ultimately migrate there in the flow. Liquids tend to seep rather than "spill", and so tend to aggregate in a ball near the source.) In addition to the basic fluids of the interior environment (water and water wastes, air, and its constituent supply gasses) the shuttle also has unfiltered fluid systems for Freon, hydrogen, helium, ammonia, hydraulic fluid, and propellants. Only the propellant system, owing to its uncommon chemistry, represents a fluid system that is not typical of household or medical applications.
