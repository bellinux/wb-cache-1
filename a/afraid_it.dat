After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.|$|E
5|$|During the 1959-60 season, Plante wore a goaltender mask for {{the first}} time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in {{practice}} since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a sinusitis operation, head coach Toe Blake was <b>afraid</b> <b>it</b> would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3–1. During the following days Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3–0, and the mask returned for good the next night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.|$|E

25|$|The now extinct Hare Indian dog of {{northern}} Canada {{was not known}} to bark in its native homeland, though puppies born in Europe learned how to imitate the barking of other dogs. When hurt or <b>afraid,</b> <b>it</b> howled like a wolf, and when curious, it made a sound described as a growl building up to a howl.|$|E

25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} the NSW men are {{improving}} a good deal... They cannot be blamed for the farce, for it was nothing else. If the Australian team depends on Queenslanders to strengthen it, one is <b>afraid</b> <b>it</b> will be found wanting. They are quite the weakest lot of footballers I have even seen come down from Queensland. The play needs no detailed description as it was simply a practice match for NSW, and certainly did not advantageously advertise the new game.|$|E

500|$|Many reviews {{criticized the}} Andy-Erin plot. White wrote that, [...] "If the Andy and Erin scenes in this episode were {{supposed}} to make me root for them, I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>it</b> didn't quite work." [...] Dougherty wrote, [...] "Was anyone else rooting for Erin to just stay down there? I certainly was." [...] McNutt bluntly wrote, [...] "I'm not buying this relationship." [...] The WHTC review noted that the arc was [...] "a total carbon copy of the Jim/Pam version that sucked us all in years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1903, {{following}} a disagreement {{with his brother}} Maurice over the religious upbringing of his nephews, Moore declared himself to be Protestant. His conversion was announced {{in a letter to}} the Irish Times newspaper. Moore remained in Dublin until 1911. In 1914, he published a gossipy, three-volume memoir of his time there under the collective title Hail and Farewell, which entertained its readers but infuriated former friends. Moore himself said of these memoirs, [...] "Dublin is now divided into two sets; one half is <b>afraid</b> <b>it</b> will be in the book, and the other is afraid that it won't".|$|E
500|$|The {{neighborhood}} where the North Shore Towers were built was a rural, unnamed section of Flushing, {{part of a}} [...] land grant to Massachusetts settlers. [...] In 1923, the Glen Oaks Golf Club was built, created on [...] purchased from William K. Vanderbilt II's country estate. [...] By 1971, the golf course {{was replaced by the}} North Shore Towers. The North Shore Towers were constructed in Glen Oaks because of Queens's lax zoning rules, which are less restrictive than those in Nassau and Suffolk Counties in Long Island. Some Glen Oaks residents, mostly single-home dwellers, protested the construction of the North Shore Towers because they were <b>afraid</b> <b>it</b> would dominate the horizon. [...] However, it was a highly anticipated [...] "big Queens project" [...] for most New Yorkers.|$|E

500|$|Director Rob Bowman {{was worried}} that the episode's monster would not appear [...] "scary" [...] and that the story would not be [...] "compelling". By {{utilizing}} unique camera angles and quick action Bowman {{was able to make}} the episode feel [...] "a hell of a lot better than [...] was <b>afraid</b> <b>it</b> might". The monster was created by special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich, a task he considered [...] "the single most difficult thing [...] did all season". The tentacles were created out of a combination of silicone and urethane to make them translucent, but give them a flexible feel. The [...] "octopus bite marks" [...] numbered in the hundreds and required 90 minutes to apply. The episode's title, [...] "Agua Mala", means bad water in Spanish. [...] Aguamala is also the slang name for the Portuguese Man o' War, a venomous jellyfish similar in form to the episode's primary antagonist.|$|E
500|$|One notable {{advocate}} for the fledgling movement was Mark Twain. Manipulative treatments had purportedly alleviated the symptoms of his daughter Jean's epilepsy as well as Twain's own chronic bronchitis. In 1909, he spoke before the New York State Assembly at a hearing regarding the practice of osteopathy in the state. [...] "I don't know as I cared much about these osteopaths until I heard {{you were going to}} drive them out of the state, but since I heard that I haven't been able to sleep." [...] Philosophically opposed to the American Medical Association's stance that its own type of medical practice was the only legitimate one, he spoke in favor of licensing for osteopaths. Physicians from the New York County Medical Society responded with a vigorous attack on Twain, who retorted with [...] "he physicians think they are moved by regard for {{the best interests of the}} public. Isn't there a little touch of self-interest back of it all?" [...] "...The objection is, people are curing people without a license and you are <b>afraid</b> <b>it</b> will bust up business." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i think would be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was <b>afraid</b> <b>it</b> was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E

500|$|Continuing {{negotiations}} between the Germans and Partisan headquarters resulted in a further prisoner exchange on 17 November 1942. The second of these was negotiated by Stilinović and Vladimir Velebit, {{also a member of}} the Partisan Supreme Headquarters, and Ott was involved on the German side. On the day of the second prisoner exchange, the Partisans delivered a letter addressed to Glaise-Horstenau which apparently explained that the Partisans were [...] "an independent armed force with military discipline and not an agglomeration of bands", and [...] "proposed mutual application of the rules of international law, especially in regard to prisoners and wounded, a regular exchange of prisoners, and a sort of armistice between the two sides". Glaise-Horstenau, Kasche and others wanted to continue exchanging prisoners as a means of obtaining intelligence, and also wanted a modus vivendi with the Partisans to allow the Germans to exploit the mineral resources of the NDH without disruption. In particular, they wanted to minimise disruption in the NDH south of the Sava river and on the Zagreb–Belgrade railway line. Adolf Hitler and Reich Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop were opposed to a modus vivendi, as they were <b>afraid</b> <b>it</b> would give the Partisans the status of a regular belligerent. As a result of Hitler's opposition, this Partisan proposal was not answered.|$|E
500|$|Steven Rosen of The Denver Post wrote [...] "DreamWorks Pictures again proves a name {{to trust}} for imaginative, funny {{animated}} movies that delight kids and adults equally." [...] Susan Stark of The Detroit News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Swift, sweet, irreverent, rangy and as spirited in the writing and voice work as it is splendid in design." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A fat green ogre with a grouchy disposition and worse manners, Shrek {{is the sort of}} unlikely hero that nobody could love -- except just about everyone who sees this hip and hilarious animated delight." [...] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make Shrek an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication." [...] Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars, calling it [...] "a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass". Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it's just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of Shrek." [...] William Steig, the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating [...] "We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, 'What has Hollywood done to it?' But we loved it. We were <b>afraid</b> <b>it</b> would be too sickeningly cute and, instead, Bill just thought they did a wonderful, witty job of it." ...|$|E
