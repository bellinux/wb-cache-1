It seems that your gifts arrive just in time as I have always received the cigaretts when I {{have run out of}} those I have purchased. When I read your letter I feel the urge more and more to return to the College again, but I do not have the time at the present time and I cannot see the time coming in the very near future. However, the time will come some time. I noticed that you made mention to Nick Coracci in your letter. As some of you might know, I lived with Nick during my last year at Bryant, but since his induction into the Army, I have lost contact with him. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> would not be asking too much of your Organization, I would <b>appreciate</b> <b>it</b> very much <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would sent [sic] me his address, so that once again I could get in touch with him.
