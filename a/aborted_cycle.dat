40|$|This {{second part}} of the LHC beam dump design study is devoted to {{transient}} and steady state nonlinear heat transfer analysis. Heat generation loads are imported from Part - I: simulation of energy deposition in the graphite by particle cascades induced by the LHC primary protons, and superposition of identical energy distribution from each bunch along positions defined by the beam sweep profile on the upstream face of the core. A parametric finite element model of the dump including graphite core, aluminium frame, base plate with cooling channels, and shielding blocks, is elaborated and resolved by means of the ANSYS Engineering System, providing the transient evolution of internal temperature fields. Steady state analysis is then performed, by means of numerical approximations using a limited number of ANSYS results as an interpolation [...] extrapolation base. Only periodic aborts are considered. The first conclusion is that the dump requires several hours of cooling after each beam abort. Influence of natural cooling and thermal contact, and performance of a proposed water cooling system, are considered for single and repetitive beam dumping. At the ultimate intensity of 4. 8 10 ^ 14] protons per beam, the dump assembly needs necessarily to be cooled to permit <b>abort</b> <b>cycles</b> as short as 13 h. At the nominal intensity of 3 10 ^ 14] protons, periodic aborts once per 5 h can be achieved without cooling. At any intensity, however, water cooling reduces the safe abort period by at least a factor 2. A third part of this study will concern mechanical analyses leading to graphite material specification...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} detected {{variations in}} extreme ultraviolet intensity in coronal loops repeating with periods of several hours. Models of loops including stratified and quasi-steady heating predict {{the development of}} a state of thermal non-equilibrium (TNE) : cycles of evaporative upflows at the footpoints followed by falling condensations at the apex. Based on Fourier and wavelet analysis, we demonstrate that the observed periodic signals are indeed not signatures of vibrational modes. Instead, superimposed on the power law expected from the stochastic background emission, the power spectra of the time series exhibit the discrete harmonics and continua expected from periodic trains of pulses of random amplitudes. These characteristics reinforce our earlier interpretation of these pulsations as being <b>aborted</b> TNE <b>cycles...</b>|$|R
50|$|Cycles of {{committed}} transactions can {{be prevented}} by aborting an undecided (neither committed, nor aborted) transaction on each cycle in the precedence graph of all the transactions, which can otherwise turn into a cycle of committed transactions (and a committed transaction cannot be aborted). One transaction <b>aborted</b> per <b>cycle</b> is both required and sufficient number to break and eliminate the <b>cycle</b> (more <b>aborts</b> are possible, and can happen in some mechanisms, but unnecessary for serializability). The probability of cycle generation is typically low, but nevertheless, such a situation is carefully handled, typically with a considerable overhead, since correctness is involved. Transactions aborted due to serializability violation prevention are restarted and executed again immediately.|$|R
40|$|Peritoneal macrophages {{were used}} to analyse host genetic ontrol of mouse {{hepatitis}} virus type 4 (MHV- 4) infection. Both infectious centre and immunofluorescence assays indicated that only a subset of macrophages from either susceptible (BALB, C 3 H or C 57 BL/ 6 J) or resistant (SJL/J) mice were initially infected with MHV- 4 during the first cycle of infection. However, compared to macrophages from susceptible mice, three- to sixfold fewer SJL/J macrophages were infected, {{and there was no}} amplification of virus replication by involvement ofadjacent cells during the second cycle of infection. Treat-ment of macrophages from susceptible mice with interferon beta could not duplicate the <b>aborted</b> second <b>cycle</b> of infection that occurred in macrophages from resistant mice...|$|R

If the byte enables request data not within the address range supported by the PCI device (e.g. a 4-byte read from a device which only supports 2 bytes of I/O address space), it must be terminated with a target <b>abort.</b> Multiple data <b>cycles</b> are permitted, using linear (simple incrementing) burst ordering.|$|R
40|$|Conjugating Tetrahymena can <b>abort</b> {{the sexual}} <b>cycle</b> before the {{production}} of progeny somatic (macro-) nuclei and return to vegetative growth. We have analyzed the germinal (micronuclear) genotypes of these cells {{in order to determine}} the stage at which they aborted conjugation. Our data demonstrate that nearly all of these cells attempt meiosis, but that very few reach the successful completion of cross-fertilization. The resulting micronuclear genotypes suggest that either germinal chromosomes or entire nuclei are lost during an unsuccessful attempt at meiosis or cross-fertilization. We conclude that the decision to develop progeny macronuclei is made during meiosis and is dependent on the completion of some step necessary for successful cross-fertilization...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe global {{transcriptional}} regulator CtrA controls multiple {{events in}} the Caulobacter cell cycle, including the initiation of DNA replication, DNA methylation, cell division, and flagellar biogenesis. CtrA {{is a member of}} the response regulator family of two component signal transduction systems and is activated by phosphorylation. We report here that this phosphorylation signal enters the cell cycle at mid S phase. In addition, CtrA function is modulated by temporally and spatially controlled proteolysis. When an active CtrA protein is present at the wrong time in the cell cycle, owing to expression of a mutant CtrA derivative that is active in the absence of phosphorylation and is not turned over during the cell cycle, the G 1 -to-S transition is blocked and the cell <b>cycle</b> <b>aborts.</b> Thus, both phosphorylation and proteolysis are critical determinants of bacterial cell cycle control in a manner that is analogous to the control of the eukaryotic cell cycle...|$|R
40|$|After {{chemical}} synthesis, the oligonucleotide preparation {{contains the}} desired full-length oligonucleotide but also {{all of the}} DNA molecules that were <b>aborted</b> during each <b>cycle</b> in the synthesis, and the by-products generated during the chemical reactions. The purification of oligonucleotides is a critical step for demanding applications where the exact length or sequence of the oligonucleotide is important, or for oligonucleotides longer than 50 bases. There are several methods of increasing oligonucleotide purity, the choice of which will depend on modifications of the oligonucleotides and their intended use. Polyacrylamide gel purification (PAGE purification) is the method of choice when {{the highest percentage of}} full-length oligonucleotide is desired. This chapter describes a protocol for oligonucleotide purification using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and includes oligonucleotide preparation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and purification from the gel slice by two different methods: by diffusion or by electroelution. This chapter also includes recommendations as well as protocol advice. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Human needs for freshwater however have altered hydrology of many riverine systems worldwide, threatening fish population sustainability. To understand and predict how spatiotemporal dynamics of flow regimes influence reproductive and recruitment variability, and ultimately population sustainability of shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus platorynchus), we develop a spatially explicit (1 D) individual-based population model that mechanistically (via energetics-based processes) simulates daily activities (dispersal, spawning, foraging, growth, and survival). With field observations of sturgeon and habitat conditions in a major tributary of the Missouri River system (USA), we calibrate and evaluate the model via pattern-oriented modeling. Model simulation experiments using 17 -year environmental time series data showed that seasonal and interannual variation in hydrological conditions {{plays a major role in}} timing, location, and magnitude of spawning and recruitment success of sturgeon. During droughts, consecutive weak year-classes resulted in a steady population decline. While low flow and subsequent low prey production limited foraging opportunities and slowed gonad development, these conditions were not severe enough for adults to <b>abort</b> the reproductive <b>cycle.</b> Post-settlement larval sturgeon were however unable to feed efficiently to grow out of a size-dependent ‘predation window’, resulting in high mortality. Slow growth and low survival of larval sturgeon thus likely play a larger role in recruitment failures during droughts than low or lack of spawning events...|$|R
40|$|The J- 2 X is an {{expendable}} {{liquid hydrogen}} (LH 2) /liquid oxygen (LOX) gas generator cycle rocket engine {{that is currently}} being designed as the primary upper stage propulsion element for the new NASA Ares vehicle family. The J- 2 X engine will contain abort logic that functions as an integral component of the Ares vehicle abort system. This system is responsible for detecting and responding to conditions indicative of impending Loss of Mission (LOM), Loss of Vehicle (LOV), and/or catastrophic Loss of Crew (LOC) failure events. As an earth orbit ascent phase engine, the J- 2 X is a high power density propulsion element with non-negligible risk of fast propagation rate failures that can quickly lead to LOM, LOV, and/or LOC events. Aggressive reliability requirements for manned Ares missions {{and the risk of}} fast propagating J- 2 X failures dictate the need for on-engine abort condition monitoring and autonomous response capability as well as traditional abort agents such as the vehicle computer, flight crew, and ground control not located on the engine. This paper describes the baseline J- 2 X abort subsystem concept of operations, as well as the development process for this subsystem. A strategy that leverages heritage system experience and responds to an evolving engine design as well as J- 2 X specific test data to support abort system development is described. The utilization of performance and failure simulation models to support abort system sensor selection, failure detectability and discrimination studies, decision threshold definition, and abort system performance verification and validation is outlined. The basis for abort false positive and false negative performance constraints is described. Development challenges associated with information shortfalls in the design <b>cycle,</b> <b>abort</b> condition coverage and response assessment, engine-vehicle interface definition, and abort system performance verification and validation are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a model to {{describe}} the response of a subject feeding items into a machine. Analysis of a set of data produced afirst order servo system with a corner frequency of <b>abort</b> I 10 <b>cycles</b> per minute. At low frequencies the gain of the system approached oire and at high frequencies it decreased at a rate which approached- 6 db per octavp. An additional analysis based on the distribu-tion of the time periods required to handle the items gave a response curve very closely fitting the first order servo system and the experimental data. In recent years the idea that man functions as a servomechanism has gained some measure of ac-ceptance. This appears to be due to a better under-standing of the physiological processes involved and to the fact that some of the mathematical models from servo theory fit certain human re-sponses quite well. Notable examples are the pupillary work of Baker (1962), the eye tracking work of Young, (1962) and the hand tracking work of Houk et a!., (1 962). In general, the techniques used to study these human systems consist of exposing the system to periodic signals and measuring its “gain ” or am-plitude ratio and “phase. ” Gain is the output or response of the system per unit of input signal. For example, in a tracking test if the hand or eye tracks a target perfectly, the gain or output per unit of input is one. The gain is greater than one if overshoot occurs and less than one if the system fails to move as far as the target. Phase is the amount by which the output lags or leads the in-put. BY varying the frequency of the input signal, or if the signal is random, by varying its frequenc...|$|R
