5|$|In 2002 LeMond {{joined with}} his parents-in-law David and Sacia Morris, friend Michael Snow and J.P. Morgan & Co. fund manager Jorge Jasson {{to invest in}} the {{exclusive}} Yellowstone Club, a Big Sky, Montana private ski and golf community founded by timber baron Tim Blixseth and his wife Edra. Each of the five partners paid Blixseth $750,000 for one percent shares in the exclusive resort. LeMond also purchased several building lots and maintained a property at the resort. Four years later LeMond <b>and</b> <b>partners</b> sued Blixseth in 2006 following reports of a Credit Suisse loan to the resort of $375million from which Blixseth reportedly took $209million in a disputed partial payout for his ownership stake. The Credit Suisse loan was based on a $1.16billion Cushman & Wakefield valuation of the resort, for which LeMond <b>and</b> <b>partners</b> each sought $11.6million for their one-percent shares. In 2007, LeMond settled his suit with the Blixseths for $39million; however, he and his partners remained creditors as the Blixseths defaulted on a $20million payment (after having already paid the group $18 million), followed by their divorce and the bankruptcy of the Club in 2009.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of firm <b>and</b> <b>partner</b> tenure on audit quality, where audit quality is proxied by {{discretionary}} accruals. We study a sample of Spanish listed companies between 2005 and 2011 and address both {{the individual and the}} interaction effects of firm <b>and</b> <b>partner</b> tenure. Our study is motivated by the current debate, particularly intense at the EU level, on {{the impact of}} the auditor rotation regime on the quality of auditing. We find that, without considering the interaction effects, firm <b>and</b> <b>partner</b> tenure do not seem to play a relevant role as determinants of audit quality. Importantly, the interaction of firm <b>and</b> <b>partner</b> tenure shows stronger effects on audit quality than both forms of tenure separately considered. Finally, our analysis suggests that audit quality is maximized when medium firm <b>and</b> <b>partner</b> tenures interact. However, results for the interaction variables are sensitive to the accruals estimation method...|$|R

5|$|During the Second World War {{the running}} of Gibb <b>and</b> <b>Partners</b> fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown. Gibb <b>and</b> <b>Partners</b> gained {{a large number of}} {{government}} contracts and within a few weeks of {{the start of the war}} in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000. Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an iron and steel works there. Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles. The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece. Paton made his way back to Britain via Greece, Italy and France and arrived home two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940. He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of Magnesium Hydroxide from the sea, a turbine factory for British Thomson-Houston Company and a £7 million underground aircraft engine factory. From 1943-44 Paton supervised the construction, in London Docks, of the precast concrete caissons required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings. From 1944-45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V-2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} phase of work, {{four types of}} lake margin were constructed. On the southern side of the Central Basin, low reinforced concrete retaining walls were used, while on the eastern side, grouted rock wall can be seen near Commonwealth Park, as well {{as much of the}} East Basin. Sand and gravel beaches were built to cater for lakeside recreational pursuits. These are mostly prevalent on the western half of the lake complex. Rocky outcrops, steeply sloping stable shores with water vegetation such as bullrushes were also used. This treatment is evident in the West Lake in Yarralumla. William Holford <b>and</b> <b>Partners</b> were responsible for the foreshore landscaping, and over 55,000 trees were planted in accordance with a detailed scheme. Eucalypts were preferred so as to maintain the natural colour of the city landscape.|$|E

The new buildings were named Embankment Place, a postmodern office and shopping complex designed by Terry Farrell <b>and</b> <b>Partners.</b> This development led to the replacement of almost the whole of the 1906 roof. The rear two spans of this structure – immediately adjacent to the existing concourse roof – were retained as part of an enlarged waiting area. In addition the original retaining side walls of the station which once supported it remain in near complete condition. The works were completed in November 1990.

5|$|In 1999, Ove Arup <b>and</b> <b>Partners</b> {{engineering}} {{undertook a}} feasibility study for a bridge downstream from the Monnow bridge, but the scheme was not progressed at that time. Both the County and Town Councils remained {{committed to the}} construction of a new crossing to support the economic development of the town, and in 2003 local authority funding of £1.3M was secured and construction commenced. The new bridge opened on 15 March 2004 for local traffic, allowing the old bridge to become pedestrianised. The closure to traffic also enabled a significant repair programme to be undertaken, in part funded by the Welsh Government and the European Union. After further conservation and repair, the gatehouse was formally re-opened in 2014, allowing public access on one day per week.|$|E

In 1995, this too was Grade II listed as a fine example of 1960s architecture.

40|$|Concerning the {{interdependence}} of married couples, the strengths of not only actors but also of partners might improve aging successfully. This study aimed to examine the actor <b>and</b> <b>partner</b> effects of resilience on well-being in Chinese older couples and the potential mediating role of spousal exchanges at the actor <b>and</b> <b>partner</b> levels. Using a 2 -wave longitudinal design, a total of 158 Chinese couples (age range 60 - 97 years) completed measures of resilience, perceived spousal exchanges (spousal support and negative exchanges), and well-being. The results showed that (a) the dyad had significant congruence in resilience and well-being, respectively; (b) resilience had significant actor <b>and</b> <b>partner</b> effects on well-being within the dyad; and (c) negative spousal exchanges could not mediate the actor <b>and</b> <b>partner</b> effects of resilience on well-being, and a gender difference emerged for the mediation role of spousal support: Actor <b>and</b> <b>partner</b> effects of husbands&# 39; resilience on well-being were mediated by both partners&# 39; perceived spousal support, whereas the actor <b>and</b> <b>partner</b> effects of wives&# 39; resilience on well-being were not mediated by perceived spousal support. Focusing on couples&# 39; interdependence, this study highlighted the role of spousal resilience and support on successful aging. Interventions should focus on enhancing both partners&# 39; resilience and promoting mutual support within the couple. </p...|$|R
