500|$|Belenggu uses ellipses and {{internal}} monologues heavily {{to represent the}} main characters' turmoil; the Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw calls it a [...] "three-pronged interior monologue", noting that the novel has minimal use of descriptive passages and dialogue. Unlike works published by Balai Pustaka, Belenggu does not provide full exposition; instead, it only explicitly states key points and leaves the rest for the reader to interpret, thus inviting more active participation. Siregar notes that the characters are introduced one at a time, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> novel were a film; he writes that, as a result, at times the transition between characters is unclear.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{combined}} {{his knowledge}} from {{his years in}} television to direct his first feature. He credited his time working on Family Dog as essential to team-building, and his tenure on The Simpsons {{as an example of}} working under strict deadlines. He was open to others on his staff to help develop the film; he would often ask crew members their opinions on scenes and change things accordingly. One of his priorities was to emphasize softer, character-based moments, as opposed to more frenetic scenes—something Bird thought was a problem with modern filmmaking. [...] "There has to be activity or sound effects or cuts or music blaring. It's <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> audience has the remote and they're going to change channels," [...] he commented at the time. Storyboard artist Teddy Newton {{played an important role in}} shaping the film's story. Newton's first assignment on staff involved being asked by Bird to create a film within a film to reflect the [...] "hygiene-type movies that everyone saw when the bomb scare was happening." [...] Newton came to the conclusion that a musical number would be the catchiest alternative, and the [...] "Duck and Cover sequence" [...] came to become one of the crew members' favorites of the film. Nicknamed [...] "The X-Factor" [...] by story department head Jeffery Lynch, the producers gave him artistic freedom on various pieces of the film's script.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{thought that}} the episode [...] "was 30 Rocks best episode of the season , if not the best episode ever from this young series." [...] Canning also said that [...] "this was just a fantastic, funny episode of 30 Rock. It was also an episode that once again proved the {{character}} of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), who was completely absent from this half-hour, simply isn't necessary when you've got Tracy Jordan talking to a pigeon on a trash can." [...] Canning rated this episode [...] "9.5 out of 10." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that [...] "it's not surprising that – in my opinion, at least – it fell juuuuuuust a bit short. It's <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> funniest parts of the Edie Falco story were played by [...] Wiig in the Lifetime movie." [...] He thought that [...] "the 'Liz suspects the neighbor is a terrorist' story played out rather well." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Overall, [...] another splendid [...] My only beef was with the Verizon bit. 30 Rock normally does a splendid job of balancing the corporate elements of television, often utilizing it for comic fodder. But the winking cell phone banter lacked subtlety, {{and it seemed to}} me like the show was trying to have its cake and eat it, too." ...|$|E

60|$|Certainly my offer {{does not}} sound very magnificent, {{but it was}} great to me, for at his words a wave of covetousness had swept over my heart, and I <b>almost</b> felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> seventy-nine camels that were left were nothing in comparison.|$|R
500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2It.com {{praised the}} writing of the episode, as well as the acting of Mindy Kaling and Jenna Fischer. [...] Porter also praised the final scene of the episode, when Jan and Michael drive home after the day. [...] Porter stated [...] "I don't know whether to laugh or turn away in shame from that final scene, though, as they bicker about what to eat while they're driving home. It was like {{watching}} two friends fight – fascinating and incredibly uncomfortable at the same time." [...] Christine Fenno, of Entertainment Weekly, stated The Deposition' was a simmering slow cooker of corporate intrigue, flavored by Michael Scott's ridiculousness, with spicy smack talk on the side." [...] Fenno, like Porter, also praised the acting of Jenna Fischer, saying that she [...] "stole the low-key opening scenes". [...] Travis Fickett, of IGN, stated that [...] "this happens to be the best episode of the season {{and one of the best}} episodes of the series. It's <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> writers planned it this way – to emphasize their importance and remind us how much we'll miss them when they're gone." [...] Fickett went on to praise the acting between Steve Carell (Michael) and Paul Lieberstein (Toby). [...] BuddyTV Senior Writer Oscar Dahl stated that the episode was an oddity among the series, saying [...] "The Deposition" [...] was an atypical episode of The Office, one that basically put the character of Michael Scott on trial and humiliated him over and over again." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{formative}} {{experience was}} hearing Serge Koussevitsky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra playing Maurice Ravel's Boléro. Riddle said later: [...] "...I've never forgotten it.

5000|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{contents}} of Pensieri are derived from the Zibaldone. The tone is sharply argumentative with respect to humanity, which Leopardi judges to be malevolent and it <b>almost</b> seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> poet wants to take his final revenge on the world.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} it <b>almost</b> seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> pair {{of them would have}} fallen a-quarrelling. Their words grew more heated, and then, while they were still wrangling, the executioner came forward to solve matters with the news that the {{secretary}} had expired. To Bellecour this proved a very welcome conclusion.|$|R

2500|$|Following the {{incident}} involving the diplomats, Biti {{said at the}} World Economic Forum conference on 6 June that [...] "it is <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> regime is sending out {{a message to the}} region, to the international community that it doesn't care, that it has no respect for life, it has no respect for the rule of law." [...] On the same day, the US embassy said that McGee would formally complain to the Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry. Meanwhile, Bvudzijena said that the diplomats had brought the problem on themselves by failing to identify themselves to the police.|$|E
2500|$|Solomon Northup's Odyssey first {{aired on}} PBS on , 1984. It aired again {{as part of}} the PBS {{anthology}} television series American Playhouse on , 1985. The film was released on video in 1985 as Half Slave, Half Free. Ebony said the film had the second-largest [...] "Black viewership of any PBS show", following Denmark Vesey's Rebellion. The magazine said Solomon Northup's Odyssey at the time of airing [...] "has been praised by critics who are calling for a theater release as well". John Corry of The New York Times said of the film, [...] "It gives us an earnest and intelligent depiction, although its real subject—the moral effect of slavery—stays just out of reach. It is <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> drama's good taste is keeping it at bay." [...] Corry said the direction obeying the [...] "fidelity of history" [...] made the setting and the society less harsh: [...] "It is not meant this way, but an intolerable institution is made to look almost benign." [...] He commended the performances of Brooks, Green, Saxon, and Seneca and concluded, [...] "'Solomon Northrup's Odyssey' [...] is informative, but whatever else it is, it is not dull." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the Guardians summary shows, {{even after}} the first 2012 release of Tony Badger's review, the FCO {{continued}} to deny the existence of documentation on the repeated British subversion of democracy in British Guiana in the 1950s and 1960s, though Richard Drayton, Rhodes Professor of Imperial History at King's College London, said this was simply not credible: [...] "When Kenyan historians requested documents in the past, they were told repeatedly by the FCO {{that they had been}} destroyed, only for the FCO, under judicial pressure, to yield them. It is to be hoped that the FCO will at some point 'discover' its British Guiana archive. Already, under my pressure, having asserted that it held no British Guiana materials whatsoever, the FCO has found one document which describes 'a formidable schedule of documents which the Governor of British Guiana sent home in April 1966 showing how the accountable documents in his custody were disposed of'." [...] Elkins agreed that it was [...] "frankly impossible, given that there were well-established procedures for handling archives at decolonisation by the 1960s. Warning bells should be going off." [...] Drayton also noted that the FCO [...] "refuses to make public the full inventory of the Hanslope Park archive. While we have full confidence in Professor Badger, many historians now wonder if he was not handed an archive which, once again, had been screened and culled." [...] Drayton further mused that [...] "it was <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> material now made public had also been screened according to the same criteria applied c.1960—preventing potential prosecutions, protecting collaborators, and protecting the reputation of Britain." ...|$|E

60|$|Something {{made the}} girl look at Treherne. He stood gazing, {{his head a}} little bent, {{and one of his}} black elf-locks had fallen forward over his forehead.

6000|$|... "You were Roland Marleigh's friend?" [...] gasped Gregory. He {{was very}} white now, {{and there was}} a sheen of {{moisture}} on his face.

60|$|Thus sped {{another week}} in which I had not the courage again to {{approach}} Bianca after what had passed between us at our single interview.

60|$|Garnache {{sat back}} in his chair and {{surveyed}} the man, smiling. Quick though his temper usually might be, it was checked at present by amusement. He had seen in his time many quarrels spring from the flimsiest of motives, but surely never had he seen one quite so self-begotten. It was <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> fellow had come there of set purpose to pick it with him.|$|E
6000|$|Look back to Section 175 in [...] "Aratra Pentelici," [...] giving {{statement}} of the four kinds of relief in sculpture.
