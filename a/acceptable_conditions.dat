He added: [...] "We are in some danger of resting our position too exclusively upon the existence, the nature and {{the wishes of the}} inhabitants of the Falkland Islands... if the population of the Falkland Islands did not desire to be British, the principle that the Queen wishes no unwilling subjects would long ago have prevailed; but we should create great difficulties for ourselves in other contexts, as well as in this context, if we rested our action purely and exclusively on the notion of restoring tolerable, <b>acceptable</b> <b>conditions</b> and self-determination to our fellow Britons on the Falkland Islands.... I do not think that we need be too nice about saying that we defend our territory as well as our people. There is nothing irrational, nothing to be ashamed of, in doing that.

The {{principal}} objective and scope of this work was the reliable and robust identification of Acceptable / Not <b>Acceptable</b> process <b>conditions</b> for such materials. Decision making on process conditions acceptability is performed using supervised neural network approaches applied to single cutting force component signal specimens and sensor fusion of cutting force signal data. The quality parameters utilised for Acceptable / Not <b>Acceptable</b> process <b>conditions</b> classification were the vibration level during machining {{and the type of}} chip generated ranked between 1 (good) and 5 (bad) on the basis of expert turning operator knowledge. The rule-of-the- thumb to classify process <b>conditions</b> as <b>Acceptable</b> or Not Acceptable is the following: whenever a 4 or 5 classification is verified either for Vibration Level or Chip Type, process condition are deemed Not Acceptable. The obtained results showed that the NN SR (Success Rate) for <b>Acceptable</b> process <b>conditions</b> identification are always significantly higher than for Not <b>Acceptable</b> process <b>conditions.</b> By resorting to sensor fusion of the 3 cutting force components (Fx + Fy + Fz) instead of using single cutting force components (Fx, Fy, Fz), the NN SR tend to increase also for Not <b>Acceptable</b> process <b>conditions</b> identification.
