5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> migratory species, they inhabit {{a wide range of}} habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young sea turtles, they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these issues}} with {{censorship}} obscured and truncated the film {{for many years}} following its release, the film was soon recognized by many western critics and film directors <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> original and accomplished work.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> popular {{video game}} series {{with a large}} and active fan base, the Halo trilogy {{has given rise to}} an array of video {{productions}} in an emerging entertainment medium, machinima. Virtually all machinima footage based around the Halo games is taken from the multiplayer modes of the main trilogy games. Most productions are set outside Halo canon, while others are based on fan fiction closely relating to the official story. Halo 3 includes a saved film function that allows camera angles not possible in previous games, and other features that simplify production. The game {{has become one of the}} most popular tools for generating machinima, and Microsoft updated its user license agreement to allow noncommercial distribution of such films.|$|E
5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, {{it is assumed that}} francium would appear <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.|$|E

5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E
5|$|Later {{combined}} into the Australian Corps in 1917, the AIF divisions in France and Belgium were {{often used to}} spearhead operations, playing {{a significant role in}} the defeat of the German Army in 1918. By the end of the war the AIF had gained a reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> effective military force. Following the armistice on 11 November 1918, a process of demobilisation began, with the last Australian personnel being repatriated in late 1919. In all, 416,809 Australians enlisted during the war and 334,000 served overseas. The AIF sustained approximately 210,000 casualties, of which 61,519 were killed or died of wounds, a casualty rate among the highest of any belligerent for the war.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} alkali metals, lithium {{has a single}} valence {{electron}} that is easily given up to form a cation. Because of this, lithium is a good conductor of heat and electricity as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> reactive element, though it is the least reactive of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity {{is due to the}} proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital, much lower in energy, and do not participate in chemical bonds).|$|E

5|$|On December 23, 2009, Duhalde {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run for the presidency in the 2011 presidential elections. Néstor Kirchner had been succeeded by Cristina Kirchner in the presidency, staying <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> influential figure, and it was still unclear which of the Kirchners would run in 2011. Many mayors of the Buenos Aires province were unsure whether to support Duhalde or the Kirchners. Duhalde organized the Federal Peronism faction, with members of the PJ opposing the Kirchners. Néstor Kirchner died in October 2010; the subsequent state funeral halted the campaign for a few months.|$|E
5|$|Opposing the {{decentralisation}} stance {{taken in}} the treaty, Pavlov {{was one of the}} key players in the establishment of the State Committee for the State of Emergency in August 1991.
