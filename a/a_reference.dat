50|$|In some implementations, weak {{references}} {{are divided into}} subcategories. For example, the Java Virtual Machine provides three forms of weak references, namely soft references, phantom references, and regular weak <b>references.</b> <b>A</b> softly <b>referenced</b> object is only eligible for reclamation, if the garbage collector decides that the program is low on memory. Unlike <b>a</b> soft <b>reference</b> or <b>a</b> regular weak <b>reference,</b> <b>a</b> phantom <b>reference</b> does not provide access to the object that it <b>references.</b> Instead, <b>a</b> phantom <b>reference</b> is <b>a</b> mechanism that allows the garbage collector to notify the program when the referenced object has become phantom reachable. An object is phantom reachable, if it still resides in memory and it is <b>referenced</b> by <b>a</b> phantom <b>reference,</b> but its finalizer has already executed. Similarly, Microsoft.NET provides two subcategories of weak references, namely long weak references (tracks resurrection) and short weak references.|$|R
5000|$|In C++, it is {{possible}} to have a dangling pointer, <b>a</b> stale <b>reference</b> to <b>an</b> object that has already been deallocated.
