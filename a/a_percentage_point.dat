5|$|Later in June, Fox News did {{a report}} on the {{families}} of the candidates running for President. Jim Gilmore's family was described as being busy with school and employment, limiting them from full-time campaigning. Two of the candidate's sons, Ashton and Jay were examined for the report. Ashton Gilmore worked full-time for his father's campaign headquarters, and Jay Gilmore worked in Washington and was only able to campaign as his schedule allowed. In election polling, unpromising results surfaced for the Gilmore campaign. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, Gilmore failed to register half <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> among Republican voters. A grimmer portrait was painted for the campaign when end of the month finances revealed it was nearly broke with only $61,765 cash on hand from the $391,693 that had been raised overall.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1969, {{during the}} Vietnam War, the {{university}} {{did not allow}} the U.S. military to have Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs on campus, though Columbia students could participate in ROTC programs at other local colleges and universities. At a forum at the university during the 2008 presidential election campaign, both John McCain and Barack Obama said that the university should consider reinstating ROTC on campus. After the debate, the President of the University, Lee C. Bollinger, stated {{that he did not}} favor reinstating Columbia's ROTC program, because of the military's anti-gay policies. In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum {{on the question of whether}} or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue. ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by a fraction of <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

25|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{candidates}} ran in the Portland race, but {{news outlets}} called Dozono the only candidate to provide a serious challenge to front-runner Sam Adams. An automated telephone poll of approximately 600 Portland residents in early April suggested that Dozono was within <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> of Adams in supporters. In the official results of the vote, Dozono garnered the second most votes of any candidate, around 34%, while Adams won with over 50%. Winning over 50% ensures that no run off vote is required in November to confirm the result. According to Dozono's campaign manager, it is not expected that he will run for office again.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{esterification}} {{that takes}} place in wines and other alcoholic beverages during the aging process is an example of acid-catalysed esterification. Over time, the acidity of the acetic acid and tannins in an aging wine will catalytically protonate other organic acids (including acetic acid itself), encouraging ethanol to react as a nucleophile. As a result, ethyl acetate – the ester of ethanol and acetic acid—is the most abundant ester in wines. Other combinations of organic alcohols (such as phenol-containing compounds) and organic acids lead to a variety of different esters in wines, contributing to their different flavours, smells and tastes. Of course, when compared to sulfuric acid conditions, the acid conditions in a wine are mild, so yield is low (often in tenths or hundredths of <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> by volume) and take years for ester to accumulate.|$|E

The study found no statistically significant impact of Medicaid coverage {{on any of the}} four physical measures. However, there were statistically insignificant improvements associated with Medicaid coverage in every single category, with <b>a</b> 1.33 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> (8%) decrease in high blood pressure incidence, <b>a</b> 2.43 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> (17%) decrease in high cholesterol incidence, <b>a</b> [...]93 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> (18%) decrease in high glycated hemoglobin incidence, and <b>a</b> 0.21 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> (2.5%) decrease in Framingham risk score.

The study found that Medicaid increased the rates of being diagnosed with diabetes and of using medication for diabetes. The researchers could not reject the decrease in blood sugar that would be expected to result from the increased use of diabetes medication, based on the clinical literature. The study reported that Medicaid coverage was associated with significantly lower rates of screening positive for depression (<b>a</b> 9 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> decline) despite the fact that there [...] "was no significant increase in the use of medication for depression." ...|$|R

500|$|McDonald's {{initially}} {{downplayed the}} new sandwich, with a spokesman stating {{that there was}} only one place to get the real Big Mac. Despite McDonald's claims that the sandwich was not a major issue for the company, its highly promoted Arch Deluxe sandwich was not a success and its [...] "Campaign 55" [...] promotion, which reduced the price of certain sandwiches to 55¢ (USD), was eliminated after franchisees complained that it had failed to boost sales. Against McDonald's struggles, Burger King's successful introduction of the Big King was later paired with a newly introduced, improved type of french fry in November of the same year. Along with these two product introductions, the company began a massive financial investment in product development across all parts of its menu which, in total, provided a boost in the chain's market performance. The mirrored failure and success for the two companies showed itself in the market share of the United States fast-food market: Burger King's share rose <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>point,</b> to 19.2%, while McDonald's share slipped 0.4 points, to 41.9% by the end of 1997.

By contrast, for African-Americans in integrated, non-Hispanic-dominated occupations, <b>a</b> 1 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> {{increase in}} the share of Mexican immigrants in the PUMA corresponds to a stronger decrease in wages of 3.8  %. Similarly, for African-Americans in “Hispanic occupations”, <b>a</b> 1 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> {{increase in the}} density of Hispanic immigrants in those occupations corresponds to a decrease in wages for African-Americans of 2.9  %. For African-Americans in more integrated occupations, <b>a</b> 1 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase in the density of Hispanic immigrants in those occupations is associated with an 8.2  % decrease in wages. These results suggest that, contrary to what intuition might dictate, there is stronger pressure on wages of African-Americans in the more integrated occupations than there is in occupations with a strong Hispanic immigrant niche. In other words, African-Americans compete, to a lesser degree, in “Hispanic occupations” with strong market segmentation, while the more relevant “competition” between African-Americans and Hispanic immigrants may be in more integrated, possibly semi-skilled occupations, such as production and transportation, or even more-skilled professional occupations.|$|R

30|$|My {{findings}} suggest that leaving school in an economic downturn depresses {{the probability that a}} worker will have access to employer-sponsored health insurance and this effect is persistent. The effects are stronger for men than women in terms of both their magnitude and statistical significance. This pattern of results is consistent with much of the previous literature on the career effects of leaving school in an economic downturn. In particular, among men <b>a</b> 1 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase in the school-leaving state unemployment rate leads to <b>a</b> 1.3 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> (1.7 %) reduction in the probability of having access to employer-sponsored health insurance. Considering the interaction term, which is positive in sign and statistically significant (p[*]≤[*] 0.01), the effect dissipates over time but remains statistically distinguishable from zero for roughly 22  years after school-leaving (p[*]≤[*] 0.01). At the sample mean number of years since school-leaving (14.0) <b>a</b> 1 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase in the school-leaving state unemployment rate leads to <b>a</b> 0.41 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> (0.55 %) reduction in the probability of access to employer-sponsored health insurance (p[*]≤[*] 0.50).
