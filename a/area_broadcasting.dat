25|$|In OFDM based wide <b>area</b> <b>broadcasting,</b> {{receivers}} {{can benefit}} from receiving signals from several spatially dispersed transmitters simultaneously, since transmitters will only destructively interfere with each other on {{a limited number of}} sub-carriers, whereas in general they will actually reinforce coverage over a wide area. This is very beneficial in many countries, as it permits the operation of national single-frequency networks (SFN), where many transmitters send the same signal simultaneously over the same channel frequency. SFNs utilise the available spectrum more effectively than conventional multi-frequency broadcast networks (MFN), where program content is replicated on different carrier frequencies. SFNs also result in a diversity gain in receivers situated midway between the transmitters. The coverage area is increased and the outage probability decreased in comparison to an MFN, due to increased received signal strength averaged over all sub-carriers.|$|E
