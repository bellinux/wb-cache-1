25|$|The {{population}} of the <b>American</b> <b>woodcock</b> has fallen {{by an average of}} slightly more than 1% annually since the 1960s. Most authorities attribute this decline to a loss of habitat caused by forest maturation and urban development.|$|E
25|$|Since 1970, {{reduction}} of farmland {{has resulted in}} reduced environment for, and reduced numbers of various shrubland birds including the <b>American</b> <b>woodcock,</b> brown thrasher, eastern towhee, willow flycatcher, golden-winged warbler, blue-winged warbler, field sparrow, and Baltimore oriole.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{wildlife}} {{biologists and}} conservationists released an <b>American</b> <b>Woodcock</b> Conservation Plan presenting {{figures for the}} acreage of early successional habitat that must be created and maintained in the U.S. and Canada to stabilize the woodcock population at current levels, and to return it to 1970s densities.|$|E
50|$|BirdsThanks to its {{proximity}} to the Atlantic Ocean, the North River Wildlife Sanctuary offers {{a wide variety of}} bird sightings. Along the river’s edge, several species of gulls can be seen in season, including great black-backed, herring, ring-billed and Bonaparte’s gulls. Egrets and herons feed in the marshy edges of the river. Red-tailed hawks hunt in the open field, while sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks prey on the smaller birds that inhabit the area. A wide variety of birds breed on the property, including <b>American</b> <b>woodcocks,</b> red-bellied woodpeckers, tree swallows, eastern phoebes, Baltimore orioles, scarlet tanagers, eastern towhees, and more. Historically, a purple martin colony has nested in the open field.|$|R

25|$|Creating young-forest {{habitat for}} <b>American</b> <b>woodcock</b> helps more than 50 {{other species of}} {{wildlife}} that need early successional habitat during part or all of their life cycles. These include relatively common animals such as white-tailed deer, snowshoe hare, moose, bobcat, wild turkey, and ruffed grouse, and animals whose populations have also declined in recent decades, such as the golden-winged warbler, whip-poor-will, willow flycatcher, indigo bunting, and New England cottontail.|$|E

40|$|Although {{migrants}} were hoped for, {{and even}} expected, migration {{seemed to be}} on the wane during the NOU spring Meeting held in Niobrara, NE on May 20 - 22. Among the 138 species recorded, few were warblers or shorebirds. Several of the warbler species seen were represented by only one individual, so few birders were lucky enough to see them. However, with the area 2 ̆ 7 s rich diversity in habitats, unique geographic attributes, and the able assistance of the hosting Leuschen 2 ̆ 7 s birders, we saw many of the area 2 ̆ 7 s breeding species, some of which were at the edge of their breeding range. The extensive Bazile Creek Marsh yielded Virginia Rails, a Western Grebe, and a late-reported King Rail. The Niobrara and Missouri Rivers 2 ̆ 7 sand bars and banks hosted Least Terns, a Little Blue Heron, a Blackburnian Warbler, and an extralimital Rock Wren pair, which liked the rock and timber riprap at the abandoned railroad bridge. The Bohemia Prairie trips yielded a Common Poorwill, nuptial <b>American</b> <b>Woodcocks,</b> and a Barred Owl. Scarlet Tanagers, Yellow-throated Vireos, and American Redstarts inhabited the mature, riparian woodlands. The addition of the Boyd County Sharp-tailed Grouse and Greater Prairie Chicken leks made this {{one of the few places}} in the country where six species of gallinaceous birds could be seen in one morning. The others were Northern Bobwhite, Wild Turkey, Ring-necked Pheasant, and Gray Partridge. Other notables included a Northern Mockingbird and Lark Buntings...|$|R
25|$|Early on 5 April 1932, the horse's {{strapper}} for the North <b>American</b> visit, Tommy <b>Woodcock,</b> {{found him}} in severe pain and with a high temperature. Within a few hours, Phar Lap haemorrhaged to death. An autopsy revealed that the horse's stomach and intestines were inflamed, leading many to believe the horse had been deliberately poisoned. There have been alternative theories, including accidental poisoning from lead insecticide and a stomach condition. It {{was not until the}} 1980s that the infection could be formally identified.|$|R
25|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads have a wide visual field, useful for detecting predators, while those with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate distances when hunting. The <b>American</b> <b>woodcock</b> probably has the largest visual field of any bird, 360° in the horizontal plane, and 180° in the vertical plane.|$|E

500|$|In some species, for example, either remiges or rectrices {{make a sound}} during flight. [...] These {{sounds are}} most often {{associated}} with courtship or territorial displays. The outer primaries of male broad-tailed hummingbirds produce a distinctive high-pitched trill, both in direct flight and in power-dives during courtship displays; this trill is diminished when the outer primaries are worn, and absent when those feathers have been moulted. [...] During the northern lapwing's zigzagging display flight, the bird's outer primaries produce a humming sound. [...] The outer primaries of the male <b>American</b> <b>woodcock</b> are shorter and slightly narrower {{than those of the}} female, and are likely the source of the whistling and twittering sounds made during his courtship display flights. [...] Male club-winged manakins use modified secondaries to make a clear trilling courtship call. [...] A curve-tipped secondary on each wing is dragged against an adjacent ridged secondary at high speeds (as many as 110 times per second—slightly faster than a hummingbird's wingbeat) to create a stridulation much like that produced by some insects. Both Wilson's and common snipe have modified outer tail feathers which make noise when they are spread during the birds' roller coaster display flights; as the bird dives, wind flows through the modified feathers and creates a series of rising and falling notes, which is known as [...] "winnowing". [...] Differences between the sounds produced by these two former conspecific subspecies—and the fact that the outer two pairs of rectrices in Wilson's snipe are modified, while only the single outermost pair are modified in common snipe—were among the characteristics used to justify their splitting into two distinct and separate species.|$|E
50|$|During the {{breeding}} season, large insects are favored in their diet, with invertebrates often comprising {{more than half}} of the owls' diet. Some regularly eaten insects include beetles, moths, crickets, grasshoppers and cicadas, although they will likely consume any commonly available flying insect. Also taken are crayfish, snails, spiders, earthworms, scorpions, leeches, millipedes and centipedes. Small mammals, ranging in size from shrews to young rabbits (Sylvilagus ssp.), are regular prey and almost always become the owl's primary food during winter. Small rodents such as microtine rodents and mice comprise about 67% of mammals taken, although rodents of a similar weight to the owl, such as rats and squirrels (especially the red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus)) are also taken. Jumping mice (Zapus ssp.), chipmunks, moles and bats (especially the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus)) may be taken occasionally. Small birds such as chickadees (Poecile ssp.), swallows, sparrows and warblers are the most common avian prey and such species are normally caught directly off of their nocturnal perches or during nocturnal migration. In Ohio, the most commonly reported avian prey species, and most common stored food items behind meadow voles, were yellow-rumped warblers (Setophaga coronata) and white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichus albicollis). Abundant mid-sized avian or largish passerine prey are also not uncommon foods, such as mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), downy woodpeckers (Picoides pubescens), northern flickers, blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata), American robins (Turdus migratorius), European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula). However, larger avian prey are sometimes caught, including northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and <b>American</b> <b>woodcocks</b> (Scolopax minor) and even rock pigeons and ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), most likely young or fledgling aged birds but all of which are likely to be heavier than the screech owls themselves. All told, more than 100 species of bird have been hunted by eastern screech owls. Irregularly, small fish, small snakes (i.e. Heterodon ssp.), lizards, baby soft-shelled turtles (Apalone ssp.), small frogs (i.e. tree frogs and northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens)), toads, newts and salamanders are also preyed upon. They have even been observed hunting for fish at fishing holes made by people or cracks in ice at bodies of water during winter. The most commonly reported fish prey in Ohio were American gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) and green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus). Brown bullheads (Ameiurus nebulosus) have been captured by eastern screech owls along coastal areas during winter.|$|R
