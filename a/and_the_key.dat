5|$|For {{the feast}} of Visitation of 1733, Bach {{produced}} {{a new version of}} his Latin Magnificat, without the Christmas hymns: instrumentation of some movements was altered or expanded, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> changed from E-flat major to D major, for performance reasons of the trumpet parts. This version of Bach's Magnificat is known as BWV 243.|$|E
5|$|Building on his progress, Champollion now {{began to}} study other texts in {{addition}} to the Rosetta stone, studying a series of much older inscriptions from Abu Simbel. During 1823, he succeeded in identifying the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches in these ancient texts. With the help of a new acquaintance the Duke de Blacas in 1824, Champollion finally published the Précis du système hiéroglyphique des anciens Égyptiens dedicated to and funded by King Louis XVIII. Here he presented the first correct translation of the hieroglyphs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to the Egyptian grammatical system.|$|E

5|$|Dynamite Headdy is an action-platform game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} Headdy, a puppet with a detachable head. The story follows Headdy in his adventures to save his world from the evil puppet King Dark Demon, who is transforming all the puppets of the world into his evil minions. To succeed, Headdy must overcome the King's army, which features the likes of Trouble Bruin <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> masters which serve as stage bosses. Headdy can jump and throw his head in any direction to attack enemies. His head {{can also be used}} to grab hooks and pull himself up to other platforms. Headdy's health is represented by a spotlight in the corner of the screen which changes colors. If the player does not pick up restorative items to heal themselves after suffering damage from enemies, they will lose a life.|$|E
5|$|He {{was highly}} {{regarded}} as a scientist by the British, who wanted {{him to return to}} the United Kingdom to work on Britain's post-war nuclear weapons program; he returned in August 1946 and became the head of the Theoretical Physics Division at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. From late 1947 to May 1949 he gave Alexander Feklisov, his Soviet case officer, the principal theoretical outline for creating a hydrogen bomb and the initial drafts for its development as the work progressed in England and America. Meeting with Feklisov six times, he provided the results of the test at Eniwetok Atoll of uranium and plutonium bombs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> data on production of uranium-235.|$|E
5|$|Maxinquaye was {{released}} on 20 February 1995 and reached number three on the United Kingdom's albums chart while selling over 100,000 copies in its first few months. 4th & B'way marketed the album by relying on independent record promoters and Tricky's appearances in media, including publicity photographs and music videos that portrayed him and Topley-Bird in gender-bending fashion. A widespread critical success, Maxinquaye was cited by many journalists as the year's best record <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> release of a musical style known as trip hop. Since then, it has sold 500,000 copies worldwide and ranked frequently on all-time lists of the greatest albums, being viewed as a significant influence on electronica, underground, and British hip hop.|$|E

5|$|Pipes are {{arranged}} by timbre and pitch into ranks. A rank {{is a set}} of pipes of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The stop mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, the stop governing the pipe's rank must be engaged, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E
5|$|The Attack on Pearl Harbor and {{the entry}} of the United States into World War II stopped all work on the {{causeway}} {{and the development of}} Virginia Key. After the war, Crandon pushed on with the development project. He got financier Ed Ball to buy six million (U.S.) dollars worth of bonds financing construction of the causeway. The causeway was named for Eddie Rickenbacker, World War I flying ace, and {{founder and president of the}} Miami-based Eastern Air Lines. Starting in 1951, the Mackle Construction Company offered new homes on the island for US$9,540, with just US$500 down. A U.S. Post Office contract branch was opened, the Community Church started holding services, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne Elementary School opened in 1952.|$|E

Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators. Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records.|$|E

5|$|There {{was much}} {{discussion}} across the British empire {{about how the}} IWGC should commemorate the war dead. The construction of war cemeteries was a clear priority, {{but there was an}} ambition to produce a ground-breaking series of memorials to the fallen soldiers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> battles along the Western front, while in the east there was an urgent political requirement to construct memorials to reinforce Britain's inter-war claims to influence and territories across the region. The Dominions also wanted to have their own national monuments as part of the programme of work. Initially twelve major memorials were planned, each of which would combine a memorial to a key battlefield, a cemetery and a monument to a specific Dominion, but the French government raised concerns over the considerable number and size of these memorials, leading to the plans being halved in scale.|$|E
5|$|Georgian forces, {{among them}} special {{forces of the}} Ministry of Internal Affairs, entered Tskhinvali after taking the heights near the town. The {{centre of the town}} was reached by 1,500 men of Georgian {{infantry}} by 10:00. The Russian air force began bombing targets inside South Ossetia and Georgia proper after 10:00 on 8 August. According to Russia, it suffered its first casualties at around 12:00 when two servicemen were killed and five wounded following an attempt by the Georgian troops to storm the northern peacekeeping base in Tskhinvali. Georgia has stated that it only targeted Russian peacekeepers in self-defence, after coming under fire from them. Most of Tskhinvali and several villages had been secured by Georgian forces by the afternoon; however, they failed to achieve their objective of blocking the Gupta bridge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> roads linking Tshkinvali with the Roki Tunnel and the Russian military base in Java. One Georgian diplomat told Kommersant {{on the same day that}} by taking control of Tskhinvali, Tbilisi wanted to demonstrate that Georgia wouldn't tolerate killing of Georgian citizens.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, Cunningham led British {{naval forces}} {{to victory in}} several {{critical}} Mediterranean naval battles. These included the attack on Taranto in 1940, the first completely all-aircraft naval attack in history, and the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941. Cunningham controlled the defence of the Mediterranean supply lines through Alexandria, Gibraltar, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> chokepoint of Malta. He also directed naval support for the various major Allied landings in the Western Mediterranean littoral. In 1943, Cunningham was promoted to First Sea Lord, the professional head of the Royal Navy, a position he held {{until his retirement in}} 1946. He was ennobled as Baron Cunningham of Hyndhope in 1945 and made Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope the following year. After his retirement, Cunningham enjoyed several ceremonial positions, including Lord High Steward at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. He died on 12 June 1963, aged 80.|$|E

As late as 1997, he was still receiving awards for his marksmanship, winning the Outstanding American Handgunner of the Year. Until 2000 {{he served as a}} coach for the Olympic shooting team, able to see without the aid of glasses even at the age of 92. At the age of 100 he was present at a re-enactment of the Al Brady shoot out in Bangor, Maine. At this event, he was presented with a plaque <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to the city. At the age of 101, he was the FBI's oldest living former agent and was in excellent physical shape, aside from some hearing and memory loss. He credited his longevity to luck, listening to his parents and blessings from God. At the 100th anniversary celebration of the FBI, it was noted that Walsh was older than the agency itself. In March 2013, at the age of 105, he surpassed American gymnast Rudolf Schrader to become the longest-lived Olympic competitor. He died at his home in Arlington, Virginia in April 2014, less than a week prior to his 107th birthday.|$|E
