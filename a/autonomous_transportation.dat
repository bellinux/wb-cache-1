40|$|Given recent advancements of {{autonomous}} systems, {{the integration of}} <b>autonomous</b> vehicles into <b>transportation</b> systems is an inevitable situation that has implications that are not yet fully understood. Without additional research regarding large-scale deployments {{of autonomous}} vehicles, these advanced transportation systems may be deployed without sufficient planning and management in a sub-optimal manner. Under the continuous guidance of A/Prof. Dr. Jayantha Katupitiya, this thesis is aimed at studying and optimizing {{the widespread use of}} autonomous vehicles in a bus-based <b>autonomous</b> public <b>transportation</b> application. Difficulties in studying large-scale deployments of autonomous vehicles in experiments and simulation are discussed. As there are no adequately suitable simulation software for a large-scale study, a new high-performance software platform is developed in this thesis. To drive the simulation platform, a problem setting including a transit network, passenger demand model and an autonomous vehicle model with related controllers is presented. The design focus and architecture, {{as well as a number}} of key features, of the simulation platform are also covered. The developed simulation platform and models are then simulated and improved using new autonomous vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure systems designed for autonomous vehicle use. A high-level vehicle management problem relating to vehicle dispatching is considered, studied and optimized. Cooperative vehicle maneuver generation using an event-based framework is presented for handling both common and exceptional situations such as lane changes and hazard avoidance. A priority-sensitive variant of autonomous intersection management is developed. Simulation results of various bus-based <b>autonomous</b> public <b>transportation</b> systems deployments in multiple cities of differing sizes are used to validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology presented for studying large-scale deployments of autonomous vehicles. The measured performance showed that 1) overall benefits from the widespread use of autonomous systems over their traditional counterparts was obtained, and that 2) each deployment was affected by local factors such as topography, road network design, population dispersion and city size.

By using logistic regression analysis to fit data to logistic curves, the classifier model is generated.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a multilevel planning approach {{for the use}} in complex self-optimizing mechatronic systems. The approach has been designed for the RailCab system, which is an <b>autonomous</b> railbound <b>transportation</b> system. The term multilevel planning denotes planning on different levels of abstraction where each level involves different aspects and thus raises different planning tasks to solve. These planning tasks are not independent of each other. Plans for the higher level planning tasks involve re-configurations of the system’s software architecture and influence parameters used by the lower level planner to compute Pareto optimal behavior. Additionally, the higher level planner relies on plans computed by the lower level planner {{in order to meet}} the execution times (of system reconfigurations) that it assumed. To actually assure that the lower level planner computes Pareto optimal plans and takes multiple objectives (which are conflictive) into account, it is based on multi-objective optimization (with Pareto fronts as output).

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} it is {{possible}} to extend a mobile indoor service robot, making it capable of performing <b>autonomous</b> <b>transportation</b> tasks in outdoor environments. While the higher-level software (like planners, schedulers and collision avoidance) is no dierent than that used in indoor vehicles and therefore both well known and reliable, the sensor fusion layer is the challenging part due to the extreme ambiguity of sensor data outside most buildings. Therefore we focus on the self-localization aspect of the system, showing {{that it is possible}} to predict the robot's position with such low uncertainty that a typical transportation task in an industrial outdoor environment can be performed quickly, safely and robustly. We rely only on low cost o-the-shelf sensors (optical encoder, ber-optical gyroscope and a laser range nder), without adjusting the robot's environment (e. g. by way of addition of articial landmarks), making the system aordable and easy to maintain. We prove the usability of our approach through extensive tests with a real robot around our institute campus.

Technology for autonomous vehicles {{is a very}} active field right now. The University of Cincinnati’s Bearcat robot is a test bed for research in various technologies related to autonomous vehicle navigation. One of the challenges is to steer the robot autonomously to follow a moving vehicle over an unmapped area at a specified distance. A single rotating sonar sensor is used with a restricted angle of sweep to obtain readings to develop a range map to plan an unobstructed path for an autonomous guided vehicle. The new rotating sonar system is certainly an improvement over the old stationary system in terms of better obstacle avoidance as well as reduced use of resources. Tuning of the motor and the installation of a new gearbox has helped in achieving better results. The laser further improves the object detection by providing us with more accurate data, larger range and the exact profile of the object.

Our research focus is to develop computationally efficient algorithm for accurate de- tection of the road boundaries and potential obstacles ba ed on prior knowledge of the highway and urban environments. In this thesis, a novel lane feature extrac- tion algorithm is introduced. It incorporates the global lane shape information to accurately extract feature points that overlap with the lane boundaries. It can be used a a general framework to improve or refine the feature map obtained with a diverse range of local feature extractors. At the lane tracking stage, the performance of the Gaussian Particle Filter (GPF), Gaussian Sum Particle Filter (GSPF) and Sampling Importance Resampling (SIR) particle filter are compared. The GSPF shows a preferable characteristic which is suitable for the lane track- ing application and leads to the best results. For motion-based obstacle detec- tion, we propose a computationally efficient image warping algorithm for motion compensation. This algorithm achieves higher efficiency as well as identical re- sults to perspective mapping based approaches. Furthermore, we investigated stereo vision based obstacle detection and developed a disparity calculation algo- rithm using multi-pass aggregation and local optimisation which utilises the prior knowledge of the traffic scene. This algorithm achieves comparable results to the global optimisation based algorithms with lower computational complexity. Dur- ing the obstacle detection stage, the G-Disparity image. which encloses disparity gradient information, is proposed. Using G-Disparity in conjunction with the -V-Di parity images allows more efficient obstacle extraction with performance improvement over the conventional U- V-Disparity based approaches.
