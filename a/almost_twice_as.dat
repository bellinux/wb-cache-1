They were both experimental and not expected to be competitive with coal and oil, but later became more so due to inflation and large increases in coal and oil prices.

5|$|No part of M-134 {{is listed}} on the National Highway System, a system of roadways {{important}} to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In 2009, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) conducted a survey to determine the traffic volume along the highway, reported using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). The department determined that the highest count was the 3,595vehicles a day that used the highway west of the M-129 junction in Cedarville; the lowest counts were 608vehicles daily between the M-48 junction and the De Tour village limits. On the island, 667vehicles use M-134 daily.

There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching punch and turnaround kick are added, low and high kicks have greater differentiation (be they crouching or standing up), the roundhouse kick are made more powerful (knocking an opponent across the screen, like the game's uppercut), and {{it is easier to}} perform a combo due to reduced recovery times for attacks. Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some to be used in mid-air, and the game plays <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> fast as the original.

5|$|By mid-September 2015, {{the global}} stock of highway legal plug-in {{electric}} passenger cars and utility vans reached the one million sales milestone. Sales of plug-in electric vehicles achieved the one million milestone <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> fast as hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). While {{it took four}} years and 10 months to reach one-million PEV sales, {{it took more than}} around nine years and a few months for HEVs to reach its first million sales. The global ratio between all-electrics (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) has consistently been 60:40 between 2014 and the first half of 2016, mainly due to the large all-electric market in China. In the U.S. and Europe, the ratio is approaching a 50:50 split. All-electric cars have oversold plug-in hybrids, with pure electrics representing about 61% of the global stock of over 2million plug-ins on the world's roads by the end of 2016, up from 58.9% at the end of 2015. Cumulative global sales of highway-capable light-duty pure electric vehicles since 2010 achieved the one million unit milestone in September 2016.

During her fitting-out in early March 1894, the ship undertook a preliminary sea trial to test her speed and machinery. At this point her side armor, guns, turrets and conning tower had not yet been fitted, and her official trials would not take place until October 1895 due to the delays in armor deliveries.|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose. The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the costs incurred on the average length of stay (ALOS) on patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) related illnesses admitted in hospital and whether there are any other significant costs involved. Method. A quantitative approach was used to collect data; analysed; interpretation and report writing. Purposive sampling and data collection was done using data collection sheet. This was a retrospective cost analysis data from in-patients records (record review) of ages from 15 years to 49 years both gender. Data analysis and presentation of information was presented by the use of tables; different types of graphs and the interpretation thereof. Results. The study found that males (63 %) with HIV Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) related illnesses had longer average length of stay in a hospital compared to females. However, females illustrated higher in-patient costs but majority of patients had costs of between R 0 –R 17 500. Patients with longer hospital stay (> 3 days of hospitalisation) had higher in-patient costs. Conclusion. The findings also showed that in-patient care costs were directly proportional to length of stay with higher costs for HIV and AIDS patient management care. Our findings are consistent with other studies regarding higher economic implications of care for HIV infected persons being <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> people who are HIV negative due to longer periods of hospitalisation.
