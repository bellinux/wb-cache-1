5|$|While the BPC was {{primarily}} political, Black Consciousness activists also established the Black Community Programmes (BCPs) {{to focus on}} improving healthcare and education and fostering black economic self-reliance. The BCPs had strong ecumenical links, being part-funded by <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>on</b> Christian action, established by the Christian Institute of Southern Africa and the South African Council of Churches. Additional funds came from the Anglo-American Corporation, the International University Exchange Fund, and Scandinavian churches. In 1972, the BCP hired Biko and Bokwe Mafuna, allowing Biko to continue his political and community work. In September 1972, Biko visited Kimberley, where he met the PAC founder and anti-apartheid activist Robert Sobukwe.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman {{began his}} career at Harvard University as a social {{relations}} and psychology lecturer. This non-tenure-track position ended after three years. Then he worked with researcher James Shields at the Maudsley–Bethlem hospital complex in London, using its twin registry to analyze traits of identical and fraternal twins at the lab of Eliot Slater, whom Gottesman met in Rome at the Second International Congress on Human Genetics in 1961. After {{his return to the}} University of Minnesota in 1966, Gottesman created <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>on</b> behavioral genetics, the first in the U.S. In 1972–1973 he received a Guggenheim fellowship to work with K.O. Christiansen in Denmark. In 1980 he left to join the Washington University School of Medicine, then moved to the University of Virginia in 1985, where he started the clinical psychology training program. Gottesman continued vising London and collaborating with Shields, with whom he co-wrote a series of books.After spending 16 years at the University of Virginia, Gottesman retired from an active role after 41 years of research, but continues research part-time in psychology and psychiatry.|$|E

A daemon, being a user program, can in turn access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the operating system kernel.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{out as an}} {{independent}} filmmaker, Rolfe intended for his earliest videos of the Nerd character to be a joke privately shown to his friends.

In 2006, Matei persuaded Rolfe to put his work on YouTube, where it got popular. In 2007, the series became <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>on</b> ScrewAttack and GameTrailers, where it was renamed The Angry Video Game Nerd to prevent trademark issues with Nintendo, and to allow Rolfe to also review games from non-Nintendo consoles.|$|E
25|$|From 1948, 615 {{episodes of}} Mame-loshn (“Native Language”) aired, a program {{dedicated}} to the Yiddish tongue. Stutchkoff reminded his listeners of the rich Yiddish lexicon in countless anecdotes and dramatic scenes. The show was Stutchkoff’s answer {{to the destruction of}} the European Jewry – Yiddish lost his ‘father and mother’ in the Holocaust; American Jewry was to take in the orphan. Another purpose of the show was the promotion of his Oytser (Thesaurus; see below). Finally, in 1951 Stutchkoff started <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>on</b> family drama A velt mit veltelekh (“A World With Small Worlds”). Stutchkoff worked in radio until 1958 or 1959.|$|E

25|$|Because the ENIAC was a {{classified}} project, the programmers {{were not at}} first allowed into the room to see the machine, but they were given access to blueprints from which to work out programs in an adjacent room. Programming the ENIAC involved discretising the differential equations involved in a trajectory problem to the precision allowed by the ENIAC and calculating the route to the appropriate bank of electronics in parallel progression, with each instruction having to reach the correct location in time to within 1/5,000th of a second. Having devised <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>on</b> paper, the women were allowed into the ENIAC room to physically program the machine.|$|E
25|$|ENIAC {{could be}} {{programmed}} to perform complex sequences of operations, including loops, branches, and subroutines. However, instead of the stored program computers that exist today, ENIAC was just a large collection of arithmetic machines, which had programs hard coded into the machines with function tables that each contained 1200 ten way switches. The task of taking a problem and mapping it onto the machine was complex, and usually took weeks. Due {{to the complexity of}} mapping programs onto the machine, programs were only changed after huge numbers of tests of the current program. After the program was figured out on paper, the process of getting the program into ENIAC by manipulating its switches and cables could take days. This was followed by a period of verification and debugging, aided by the ability to execute the program step by step. A programming tutorial for the modulo function using an ENIAC simulator gives an impression of what <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>on</b> the ENIAC looked like.|$|E
25|$|In August 1998 {{taxi driver}} John Shaw, from Hyde, {{contacted}} the police, informing {{them that he}} suspected Shipman of murdering 21 of his patients. Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother. There were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded her and her children, but left £386,000 to Shipman. Burgess told Woodruff to report it, {{and she went to}} the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed, and when examined was found to contain traces of diamorphine, often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman claimed that she was an addict and showed them comments in his compuerised medical journal, but <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>on</b> his computer showed they were written after her death. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a typewriter of the kind used to make the forged will.|$|E

500|$|<b>A</b> <b>program</b> <b>on</b> British {{television}} described {{that the}} drilling revealed, from top down: thick Cenozoic limestone; a graded sediment deposit from one tsunami, over 100 meters thick; the impact melted basement granite from the Earth's midcrust and shocked quartz. The peak ring itself {{did not contain}} the calcium sulphate that the rocks {{in the area around}} contain, leading the program makers to conclude that all the calcium sulphate in the crater area had been vaporized into the atmosphere and had become a dense sulphur dioxide veil stopping the sunlight. As additional clues of the resulting megatsunami represented in a New Jersey quarry, a dense marine bone bed was found on the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary containing a mixture of dead sea animals with little or no damage from scavengers or predators.
