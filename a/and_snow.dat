Minnesota is the only U.S. state where bandy is played.|$|E

60|$|The lonely day wore on, and I dozed it out, as {{a lonely}} {{traveller}} does. I {{was warm and}} valiant after eating and drinking,--particularly after dinner; cold and depressed at all other times. I was always bewildered as to time and place, and always more or less out of my senses. The coach and horses seemed to execute in chorus Auld Lang Syne, without a moment's intermission. They kept the time and tune with the greatest regularity, and rose into the swell {{at the beginning of}} the Refrain, with a precision that worried me to death. While we changed horses, the guard and coachman went stumping up and down the road, printing off their shoes in the <b>snow,</b> <b>and</b> poured so much liquid consolation into themselves without being any the worse for it, that I began to confound them, as it darkened again, with two great white casks standing on end. Our horses tumbled down in solitary places, and we got them up,--which was the pleasantest variety I had, for it warmed me. <b>And</b> it <b>snowed</b> <b>and</b> <b>snowed,</b> <b>and</b> still it <b>snowed,</b> <b>and</b> never left off snowing. All night long we went on in this manner. Thus we came round the clock, upon the Great North Road, to the performance of Auld Lang Syne by day again. <b>And</b> it <b>snowed</b> <b>and</b> <b>snowed,</b> <b>and</b> still it <b>snowed,</b> <b>and</b> never left off snowing.|$|R

5|$|Aloe vera {{has been}} widely grown as an {{ornamental}} plant. The species is popular with modern gardeners as a putatively medicinal plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. The species is hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> The species is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
