2500|$|Mousey (voiced by Jane Bassett) - Mousey is an {{anthropomorphic}} talking mouse {{who lives}} under the floorboards {{of the flat}} that Bodger rents from Series 5-7. She and Badger are great friends, both constantly getting up to mischief. Mousey's presence is only known by Bodger in the first episode of Series 5 when he sets traps to try to catch her. After Badger makes friends with Mousey, he deceives Simon into believing Mousey has gone from the house. When Bodger and Badger move to Puddleford to run their hotel in Series 8, Mousey moves with them and takes up residence in the <b>airing</b> <b>cupboard</b> rather than under the floorboards. Even though Badger is known to several of the human characters, Mousey is kept a secret from everyone, although Mrs Dribelle spots her on two occasions in Bodger's flat and Mrs Melly on one occasion who tried to capture {{her when she was}} disguised as a rare bird to fool Miss Piper. She appears to be a fan of royalty, especially in the episode [...] "Mrs. Dribelle and The Queen" [...] where she thinks she's going to live in Buckingham Palace with the Queen unaware that it is Mrs. Dribelle in disguise. When Mousey speaks, it is clear Badger understands her perfectly, however in episode 1 of series 5 it is implied Bodger can only interpret her language as the normal squeaking of a field mouse or house mouse.|$|E

5000|$|Troy (Tony Burgess, also co-writer): Mozs half-brother. In {{the first}} series it is {{revealed}} {{that he has been}} living in Mozs <b>airing</b> <b>cupboard</b> after separating from his wife. Troy loves late 1980s/early 1990s club music and is also a poor-quality DJ. For a while he runs a pirate radio station ("Troy FM") from the <b>airing</b> <b>cupboard</b> but the bad wiring causes him continual problems, finally culminating in an explosion. It is strongly implied that Troy suffers from mental illness; several references are made to him having been sectioned under the Mental Health Act. He is very touchy about the topic of his wife and becomes upset when people talk to him about it. In one episode he moves out of Mozs flat to go back to her, only to return in the next episode with bruises and a fork wound to the neck. He is a complete contrast to Moz; loud, not very conscientious, egotistic and most notably a lot smaller than his brother. Moz sees him as a pest at times yet sometimes betrays fraternal affection. It was Troy who accidentally shot Stemroach in 1993 and caused him to lose his voice - if it wasnt for Moz stepping in front of the gun Stemroach was aiming at Troy, Troy would have been killed.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>airing</b> <b>cupboard</b> is {{a storage}} space, {{sometimes}} of walk-in dimensions, containing a water heater; either an immersion heater for hot running water or a boiler for central heating water. Shelves, usually slatted {{to allow for}} circulation of heat, are positioned above or around the heater to provide storage for clothing, typically linen and towelling. The purpose is to allow air to circulate around the stored fabrics to prevent damp forming. A shelf {{can also be used}} to fully remove traces of damp from dried clothing before it is put away in drawers and wardrobes. Other names include [...] "boiler cupboard", or (in Ireland) [...] "hot press". Airing cupboards are mostly built-in (see below).|$|E

5000|$|Black Sabbath {{music and}} lyrics were quite dark for the time. The opening track is based {{almost entirely on}} a tritone {{interval}} played at slow tempo on the electric guitar. In the 2010 Classic Albums documentary on {{the making of the}} band's second album Paranoid, Geezer Butler claims the riff was inspired by [...] "Mars, the Bringer of War", a movement in Gustav Holst's The Planets. Iommi reinterpreted the riff slightly and redefined the band's direction. Ward told Classic Albums, [...] "When Oz sang 'What is this that stands before me?' it became completely different...this was a different lyric now, this was a different feel. I was playing drums to the words." [...] The song's lyrics concern a [...] "figure in black" [...] which bassist Geezer Butler claims to have seen after waking up from a nightmare. [...] In the liner notes to the band's 1998 live album Reunion the bassist remembers: [...] I'd been raised a Catholic so I totally believed in the Devil. There was a weekly magazine called Man, Myth and Magic that I started reading which was all about Satan and stuff. That and books by Aleister Crowley and Denis Wheatley, especially The Devil Rides Out ... I'd moved into this flat I'd painted black with inverted crosses everywhere. Ozzy gave me this 16th Century book about magic that he'd stolen from somewhere. I put it in the <b>airing</b> <b>cupboard</b> because I wasn't sure about it. Later that night I woke up and saw this black shadow {{at the end of the}} bed. It was a horrible presence that frightened the life out of me! I ran to the <b>airing</b> <b>cupboard</b> to throw the book out, but the book had disappeared. After that I gave up all that stuff. It scared me shitless.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{changes in}} the {{intensity}} of biological processes in the vegetation and productivity of forage grasses depending {{on the degree of}} soil salinity of the North-West Caspian Lowland were studied. Salination factors are specific. They are formed because of their adaptive nature, providing for species the opportunity to get the certain position in the relevant biocenosis. As a result each species produces its own strategy of life. Development of saline processes of soil in the growth and development of the plant mass, biological and agronomic salt resistance is clearly seen. Biological salt resistance is characterized by the ability to maintain the viability of the plant body at the upper limit of salinity. Agronomical salt resistance is determined by the value of crop and productivity. Adaptive possibilities of different plant species with different biological characteristics were also examined. Subject, objective of the work. Productivity of vegetation of semidesert ecosystems and dynamics under the influence of salinity forage grass pasture phytocenoses of the North-West Caspian Lowland were studied. Test method. We studied fodder crops: wheat grass long (Elytrigia elongata), ctenoid wheatgrass (Agropirum cristatum) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa). The crop from each significant area was weighed; it was taken from the average sample weighed in at 1 kg in a gauze bag for drying at a temperature of 60 – 65 °C in <b>airing</b> <b>cupboard</b> where brought to constant weight. Accounting for phytomass was carried by laying mowing area 8 – 10 times. Dimensions of mowing fields are 0. 25 m 2, that ensured coverage of all dominant plants. Results. At mid-saline meadow-chestnut soil of the North-West Caspian Lowland wheatgrass long gives the highest yield of green mass – 18, 1 tons per hectare of dry weight average for 2003 – 2010. Alfalfa crop is in the second place, that is less than bluegrass by 18. 0 % (2. 9 tons per hectare). The least yield of these crops is ctenoid wheatgrass, which is less than other grasses by 4. 8 tons per hectare (26. 1 %) and 1. 7 tons per hectare (11. 3 %). Therefore, wheatgrass long is hardier to mid-saline soil than other species. High yield of alfalfa depends on frequent mowing of this grass. In the sowing year there were three hay crops, the second and subsequent years - 4 mowing. The share of the first mowing in the sowing year alfalfa has 33. 0 %, the second 42. 3 %, the third 24. 7 %. In the second and subsequent years the share of the first mowing in the total yield of green mass increases up to 28, 3 – 28, 8, the third to 19, 0 – 20, 6, the fourth to 8, 8 – 10, 7 %. Area of application. The research results can be used by the economic organizations and enterprises for the phytomelioration of saline soils. The obtained data can be used to enhance and achieve high productivity of forage grasses and to restore the productivity of saline lands and use them for agricultural purposes. Conclusions. Adaptability to the saline soil and the productivity of forage grasses differ according to biological characteristics and extent soil salinity and ecological conditions. </p...|$|E
