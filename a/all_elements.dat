5|$|Dubnium {{with its}} atomic number 105 is a superheavy element; like <b>all</b> <b>elements</b> of such high atomic number, {{it is highly}} unstable. The most stable known isotope of dubnium, 268Db, has a {{half-life}} of around a day. Thus, {{even if it had}} once existed on Earth, it would have decayed completely long ago and can only be obtained by artificial production.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>elements</b> in {{this group}} are metals. The {{similarity}} of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend {{in this group}} is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|All heavier {{elements}} (including those {{necessary for}} rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were {{hot enough to}} fuse helium itself. <b>All</b> <b>elements</b> other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% {{of the mass of}} atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>all</b> <b>elements</b> up to {{oganesson}} {{have been}} discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
5|$|Exclusion of <b>all</b> <b>elements</b> {{is based}} on {{properties}} of earlier actinides, which show a much wider variety of chemistry (for instance, in range of oxidation states) within their series than the lanthanides, and comparisons to scandium and yttrium are even less useful. However, these elements are destabilized, {{and if they were}} stabilized to more closely match chemistry laws, they would be similar to lanthanides as well. Also, the later actinides from californium onwards behave more like the corresponding lanthanides, with only the valence +3 (and sometimes +2) shown.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine's first {{ionization}} energy is third-highest among <b>all</b> <b>elements,</b> behind helium and neon, which complicates {{the removal of}} electrons from neutral fluorine atoms. It also has a high electron affinity, second only to chlorine, and tends to capture an electron to become isoelectronic with the noble gas neon; it has the highest electronegativity of any element. Fluorine atoms have a small covalent radius of around 60picometers, {{similar to those of}} its period neighbors oxygen and neon.|$|E

5|$|For 80 of the {{chemical}} elements, at least one stable isotope exists. As a rule, {{there is only a}} handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin. Elements 43, 61, and <b>all</b> <b>elements</b> numbered 83 or higher have no stable isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the second}} least {{reactive}} noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of <b>all</b> <b>elements.</b> It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and {{the small size of}} helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E

The exact number is unknown as, at the time, Hispanics were not tabulated separately, but were generally included in the general white population census count. Separate statistics were kept for African Americans and Asian Americans.|$|E
50|$|For example, the {{stability}} and low energy of the electron cloud of helium causes heliums chemical inertness (the most extreme of <b>all</b> the <b>elements),</b> and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other (producing the lowest melting and boiling points of <b>all</b> the <b>elements).</b>|$|R

5|$|Nearly <b>all</b> <b>elements</b> in the {{periodic}} table form binary bromides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the noble gases, {{with the exception of}} xenon in the very unstable XeBr2); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond bismuth); and having an electronegativity higher than bromine's (oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not bromides but rather oxides, fluorides, or chlorides of bromine.|$|E

We also prove that if R is a semiexchange ring in which <b>all</b> invertible <b>elements</b> com-mute with one another, and R has no factor ring with two elements, then R is commutative.
