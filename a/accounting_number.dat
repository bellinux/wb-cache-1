40|$|The {{numbers from}} {{financial}} statements {{are presented as}} a picture of company´s condition in a particular period. Those numbers are raw financial information {{and need to be}} analyzed before they are used as a basic of decision making. This study tries to explain the usage of financial ratios for helping users to understand the meaning of accounting numbers better. The objed of study is five mining companies listed in BEJ for the period of 2000 - 2004. Every ratio brings different information to the users. Those ratios will tell more about companies´ performance and sometime can be used to reveal unusual condition that may convey the symptoms of financial distress. For that reason, the knowledge of financial statement analysis is extremely recommended for those who use financial statements as a basic of decision making.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the impact of beating analysts’ {{forecasts}} and the impact of analysts’ forecast dispersion on the pricing of firms’ credit default swaps (CDSs). CDS premium is the compensation required by investors for bearing firms’ credit default risk. Sell-side analysts collect market, industry and firm information and provide important information in the form of stock recommendations, stock price targets and <b>accounting</b> <b>number</b> forecasts. For that reason, the information contained in their forecasts may provide additional information to investors to price CDSs. My results show that firms that beat analysts’ earnings and revenue forecasts, and firms with less dispersed analysts’ earnings and revenue forecasts have on average a reduction in their CDS premia around the earnings announcement date. These effects are stronger for firm that jointly beat the two forecasts and for firms with high risk of default. I also document that the effect of beating analysts’ earnings (revenue) forecasts is stronger for firms with more (less) earnings quality...|$|E

40|$|The {{surge of}} new {{industries}} in the economy has made commonplace a situation where firms are trading at prices greatly superior to their financial performance. In such conditions doubts may arise {{regarding the use of}} traditional valuation models to estimate the value of high price to performance firms. This dissertation has as its main goal to determine if there is a variation in terms of performance by traditional valuation models when applied to high and low price to performance firms. Furthermore, the representation of performance by an <b>accounting</b> <b>number</b> is also studied in order to determine if such classification results in significant differences across firms. It is found that when price to operating income before depreciation (P/OI) is used to separate firms into high and low P/OI sub-­‐samples more significant differences between sub-­‐samples arise than when price to net income (P/NI) is used. Moreover, valuation models are found to be less biased and more accurate, although explaining price worse, when applied to high P/OI firms. Finally, relevant differences are discovered regarding the use of nonfinancial information to represent firm performance by analysts and firms...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{the value}} {{relevance}} of <b>accounting</b> <b>number</b> in capital market research {{are consistent with the}} simple view that, in equilibrium, book values are equal to or have some long-term relationship with market values, and that market returns are related to book returns. This dissertation examines the value relevance of annually-reported book values of net assets, earnings and dividends to the year-end market values of five Japanese firms between 1950 and 2004 (a period of 54 years). Econometric techniques are used to develop dynamic models of the relationship between markets, book values and a number of macro-economic variables. In constructing the models, the focus is to provide an accurate statistical description of the underlying relationships between market and book value. It is expected that such research will add to the body of knowledge on factors that are influential to Japanese stock prices. The significant findings of the study are as follows: 1) well-specified models of the data generating process for market value based on the information set used to derive the models are log-linear in form. Additive, linear models in untransformed variables are not well-specified and forecast badly out of sample; 2) the book value of net assets has relevance for market value in the five Japanese firms examined, in the long run...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} ability of {{accounting}} numbers to summarize information which affects share prices in Italy {{before and after the}} adoption of IFRS. The research focus is on Value Relevance, which expresses {{the ability of}} accounting information to reflect changes in stock prices. An <b>accounting</b> <b>number</b> is "value relevant" if it is useful for investment decisions of financial statement users. Value relevance is hereby operationalized by a regression model measuring the strength of the linear relationship between share prices and book value per share plus earnings per share. The analysis involves a sample of 160 Italian firms whose shares were listed in the Milan Stock Exchange from 2002 to 2007. It is carried out by contrasting data related to the pre-adoption period (2002 - 2004) with that concerning the post-adoption one (2005 - 2007) in order to asses, through suitable statistical tests, whether possible changes in Value Relevance between the two periods are systematic. The investigation is mainly motivated by the different goals of financial reporting based on Italian accounting standards compared to IFRS-based financial reporting. Besides the analysis of the whole set of sampling firms, a sectoral analysis is also performed to check whether possible changes in Value Relevance differ with respect to the industry sector of each firm. Empirical evidence documents that Value Relevance consistently increases following the IFRS adoption, and that such an increase is particularly marked for firms operating in the Finance and Services sectors...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} reports on {{an investigation into}} the utility of published accounting information to the most sophisticated user the investor. The approach adopted is to paramorphically represent the investor's decision making process by seeking to establish a set of causal relationships between <b>accounting</b> <b>number</b> based inputs to this process, and the outputs, viz relative share prices. Unlike previous studies in this area, this research explicitly recognises the configural nature of human information processing activity. Application of an appropriate methodology to uncover and explore these configural relationships, Automatic Interaction Detector (AID), offers original insights into the share price fixing mechanism. More specifically the results obtained provide evidence on: 1) the degree of association between published accounting data and share prices and thus a measure of the value of accounting information to investors, 2) the complexity of the investor's decision making process and 3) the validity of certain established theories in finance. Whilst analysis highlights the strong relationship between historic accounting information and relative share values the evidence presented is consistent with the thesis that only a limited set of measureable accounts-based variables may be used in the assessment process, viz earnings, dividends, short-term liquidity and marketability. Moreover, the complex set of interactions identified between these variables confirms a priori expectations on the configural nature of the investor's decision making process. A close examination of these interactions reveals that although earnings and dividends may dominate relative share values, the extent of their influence varies with the underlying quality of earnings. These findings have implications for the theory of share valuation, the dividends versus earnings controversy and the role of investment risk in the U. K. stock market. Empirical evidence relating to to the capital structure debate is also provided. Other areas of investigation encompass an examination of the most appropriate measures of relative share valuation for this type of research, a comparison of the merits of linear additive and configural analytical techniques, and the dimensionality and normality of financial ratios. The operational utility of the 'decision-usefulness' criterion in the evaluation of accounting numbers and the use of pragmatic empiricism in the application of this criterion are also critically appraised...|$|E
