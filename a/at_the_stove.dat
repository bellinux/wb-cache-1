2500|$|According to {{longtime}} Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks, Bulger's {{murder of}} Paul McGonagle's brother {{led directly to}} the Mullin Gang's assassination of his mentor. According to Weeks,"One day while the gang war was still going on, Jimmy was driving down Seventh Street in South Boston when he saw Paulie driving toward him. Jimmy pulled up beside him, window to window, nose to nose, and called his name. As Paulie looked over, Jimmy shot him right between the eyes. Only at that moment, just as he pulled the trigger, Jimmy realized it wasn't Paulie. It was Donald, the most likable of the McGonagle brothers, {{the only one who}} wasn't involved in anything. Jimmy drove straight to Billy O'Sullivan's house on Savin Hill Avenue and told Billy O, who was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> cooking, 'I shot the wrong one. I shot Donald.' Billy looked up from the stove and said, 'Don't worry about it. He wasn't healthy anyway. He smoked. He would have gotten lung cancer. How do you want your pork chops?'" ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{kerosene}} burning Primus stoves {{and their}} imitators {{were made of}} brass and were a significant advance over previous designs, which had used a wick to supply liquid fuel to the burner by capillary action. The Primus burner vaporized the fuel in a loop of pipe which rose up from <b>the</b> fuel tank <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove's</b> base, and which was pre-heated with alcohol (or [...] "methylated spirits") before being combusted in the burner. Initial pressure is provided by a small, hand operated pump integrated into <b>the</b> <b>stove's</b> fuel tank. <b>The</b> flame on a Primus stove is adjusted by using the pump to increase the pressure in the tank to make the flame larger, or by venting the tank to reduce the pressure and make the flame smaller. Later models used a separate valve to adjust <b>the</b> flame.

40|$|Fire {{safety in}} kitchens of Chinese {{restaurants}} {{will be discussed}} in this article. The licensing requirements and legislation aspects are outlined first with the past fire records briefly discussed. As identified, most kitchen fires in Chinese restaurants started from "cooking woks" <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stoves.</b> For assessing <b>the</b> thermal environment in a kitchen, heat release rates in burning such "woks" in accidental fires should be measured. Two scenarios of burning woks with cooking oil were identified. The first scenario is a stove arrangement with only two woks. The second one is with six woks for serving banquet. Full-scale burning tests on those two identified scenarios were carried out at a remote area in Northeast China. The heat release rate was measured by the oxygen consumption method. As sprinklers and water mist systems are commonly installed, the action of the sprinkler and water mist system on the cooking wok fires were also studied. The times of fire extinguishment upon discharging the water mist were also reported in evaluating the protection system. These experimental results would provide useful information for future designs of fire safety provisions in kitchens of large hotel groups in the Far East.

But the heat from the fire made the cans joints made of tin melting, this made it possible to bang out the cans into flat pieces that were 15-20 cm high, then bowed to the edges so that it could engage in the next piece, a large scissors was also used to cut the metal pieces, and then got to what looked like a bucket that was open <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top. <b>The</b> <b>stove</b> and <b>the</b> seams were sealed with clay.
