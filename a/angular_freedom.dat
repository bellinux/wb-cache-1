50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, angle cut side cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope ring discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The closing force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each closing rope in the two girders. The closing rope is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some <b>angular</b> <b>freedom.</b> Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on chain pulleys are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of increasing turbine rotor diameters {{and the desire}} to achieve long lifetimes has placed increased emphasis on understanding the response of flexible turbine structures in a turbulent inflow environment. One approach to increase fatigue lifetimes has been to design structures that can either shed or adequately absorb turbulent loads through the use of flexible rotors and support towers, and hubs and nacelles that exhibit multiple degrees of <b>angular</b> <b>freedom.</b> The inevitable result in such designs is a substantial increase in dynamic complexity. In order to develop a sufficient knowledge of such concepts, extensive measurements coupled with detailed analytical simulations of a flexible turbine design are required. The Wind Eagle 300 turbine, with its lightweight flexible rotor and hub, meets these criteria and is currently being investigated. In this paper we discuss a few early results from our recently completed field measurement effort. We found that the turbine rotor response was dominated by a once-per-revolution oscillation that was responsible for large cyclic variations in the output power. The available evidence points to a rotor imbalance related to structural differences in one of the blades and misalignment of the pitch angles. We also compared the variation in mean out-of-plane bending loads with wind speed with a conventional rigid hub design...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{alternative}} Eulerian hydrodynamic {{model for the}} electromagnetic field in which the discrete vector indices in Maxwell equations are replaced by continuous <b>angular</b> <b>freedoms,</b> and develop the corresponding Lagrangian picture in which the fluid particles have rotational and translational freedoms. This enables us to extend to the electromagnetic field the exact method of state construction proposed previously for spin 0 systems, in which the time-dependent wavefunction is computed from a single-valued continuum of deterministic trajectories where two spacetime points are linked by at most a single orbit. The deduction of Maxwell equations from continuum mechanics is achieved by generalizing the spin 0 theory to a general Riemannian manifold from which the electromagnetic construction is extracted as a special case. In particular, the flat-space Maxwell equations are represented as a curved-space Schrödinger equation for a massive system. The Lorentz covariance of the Eulerian field theory is obtained from the non-covariant Lagrangian-coordinate model {{as a kind of}} collective effect. The method makes manifest the electromagnetic analogue of the quantum potential that is tacit in Maxwell equations. This implies a novel definition of the limit of Maxwell equations that differs from geometrical optics. It is shown that Maxwell equations may be obtained by canonical quantization of the classical model. Using the classical trajectories a novel expression is derived for the propagator of the electromagnetic field in the Eulerian picture. The trajectory and propagator methods of solution are illustrated for the case of a light wave. Comment: 21 page...|$|R

40|$|As MRI guided {{interventions}} {{are becoming more}} widely practiced, {{the goal of this}} thesis was to design an instrument guidance device for MRI-guided percutaneous interventions in closed bore systems, namely cryoablation procedures where multiple probes need to be placed to treat a tumor. Multiple meetings with researchers and clinicians the Brigham and Women's Hospital were conducted to understand the challenges currently faced by interventionists, to set functional requirements for the design of a system to overcome them, and to help select a clinically viable strategy. The strategy selected involved making a device that had two degrees of <b>angular</b> <b>freedom</b> about a remote center of motion located at the probe entry point on the skin. This device is designed to be incorporated with a custom built MR coil. Structural and finite element analysis was conducted for a number of different mechanism concepts to examine their stiffness and the effect of structural displacements on the end-point probe placement accuracy. The selected concept was a curved arm piece that travels around the pivot point on a circular base, and an additional needle holder that travels along the curved arm. The sliding parts were designed with five points of constraint so that only sliding motion was possible. Thumb screws were used for preload and locking so that the probe guide could be locked along a specific trajectory. The device was prototyped via stereolithography as a proof of concept. It was found that sanding was required to fit the parts together because of overbuild in the stereolithography process. The parts functioned as designed and demonstrated that a probe could be angled about a remote pivot point. However, wear of the plastic parts eventually caused increased play between the plastic parts. Further testing and optimization of the device is planned. by Xuefeng Chen. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{fundamental}} electromagnetic phenomenon is the behaviour of light at the interface between dissimilar materials. In fact, the entire field of Optics follows from this single key concept. The reflection and refraction properties of a plane wave incident on the uniform boundary between two linear dielectric materials is an elementary configuration covered in standard textbooks on electromagnetism (see, e. g. Ref. [1]). In contrast, the behaviour of a beam with a finite transverse cross-section is much more complicated affair, and one must often resort to wholly-numerical calculations. Relatively {{little is known about}} light-interface interactions when nonlinear components are thrown into the mix – for instance, where the refractive index (of one or both materials) depends in some way on incident light intensity. The problem of fully-nonlinear interfaces was first attacked in a pair of seminal papers some two decades ago by Aceves and coworkers [2, 3]. Their classic approach considered scalar spatial optical solitons (self-collimated, self-stabilizing light beams with a stationary intensity profile) incident on the boundary between two dissimilar Kerr-type media (i. e., materials whose refractive index varies proportionally with local light intensity I). While highly instructive, these early analyses were based upon a governing equation whose central tenet was that angles of incidence, reflection and refraction (with respect to the interface) must be negligibly small. In practice, the “small angles” approximation is not entirely satisfactory. In the laboratory, one generally has complete freedom to choose any incidence angle; ideally, one would like any theoretical model to possess the same <b>angular</b> <b>freedom.</b> To this end, we have recently developed a theoretical framework that allows us to predict, for the first time, the refraction of soliton beams incident at any angle on a Kerr-type interface [4, 5]. Our latest efforts have been to extend these preliminary analyses to much wider classes of power-law materials [6], whose refractive index varies with light intensity according to Ip (where 0 < p < 2 – the Kerr nonlinearity thus corresponds to the particular case of p = 1). By a curious twist of fate, {{it turns out that the}} full nonlinear beams configuration can be described by a simple generalization of the trivially-familiar Snell’s law for plane waves...|$|E
40|$|In {{most parts}} of the body, nerves {{regenerate}} after injury. However, in the brain and spinal cord regeneration is very limited. One of the causes for this lack of regeneration is the presence of myelin proteins that inhibit outgrowth of neuronal projections. Three myelin-associated inhibitors of regeneration (MAIs) have been identified; myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), Nogo and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein. These MAIs signal to neurons via receptor complexes on the neuronal cell surface. In this dissertation, molecular mechanisms of MAI signaling are described, focusing on the initial signaling events that happen at the plasma membrane. Three proteins were studied by structural biology techniques: the MAI ligand MAG, the neuronal Nogo Receptor (NgR) and an antagonist of MAG signaling via NgR; Olfactomedin- 1 (Olfm 1). Apart from their role in MAI signaling, these proteins also serve various physiological functions in the nervous system. MAG is recognized as a cell adhesion molecule at the myelin-axon interface along the internode. MAG is involved in myelin formation and required for stability of myelin and axon. Moreover, it maintains the correct spacing between myelin and neuronal membranes and is engaged in axon-to-myelin signaling. NgR is a receptor for diverse plasticity-inhibiting ligands and functions in consolidating neuronal circuitry and memory. Olfm 1 is a secreted protein vital for proper brain development and function. The crystal structure of the extracellular segment of MAG is described. Structures of MAG-oligosaccharide complexes and biophysical techniques combined with site-directed mutagenesis reveal how MAG recognizes neuronal gangliosides (glycolipids). Dimers of MAG, formed by association between immunoglobulin domains four and five, were observed in different crystal forms. Site-directed mutagenesis and different solution-state techniques were used to validate this interface. Neurite outgrowth assays evaluated the role of MAG dimerization and ganglioside binding in regeneration-inhibiting signaling. Both dimerization and ganglioside binding were found to be required for the regeneration-inhibiting properties of MAG. The combination of MAG dimerization on the myelin membrane and ganglioside binding on the opposing neuronal membrane provides a mechanism for regulation of the myelin-axon spacing. As a monomer, the rod-like MAG extracellular segment has <b>angular</b> <b>freedom</b> with respect to the myelin membrane. However, it is locked in a specific orientation by dimerization and ganglioside binding, maintaining the myelin-axon spacing like a molecular leaf spring. Crystal structures of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NgR were solved, {{for the first time with}} the correct disulfide structure. An extra C-terminal loop is formed, which is important for co-receptor binding, but appears mostly flexible in the absence of stabilizing interactions. An extensive dimerization interface was observed in different crystal forms, which we argue represents a previously-reported NgR self-interaction on the neuronal cell surface. Olfm 1 is shown to form disulfide-linked tetramers. Limited proteolysis was combined with X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of a double olfactomedin (Olf) domain and coiled coil. We show that this Olf domain is stabilized by calcium and use a combination of techniques to provide the architecture of the full-length tetramer. The V-shaped dimer-of-dimers architecture suggests a role for Olfm 1 in receptor clustering at cell surfaces...|$|E
