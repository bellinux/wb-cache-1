Although the strike <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> was unsuccessful in killing him, it effectively ended his ability to command and control his forces. Strikes against Iraq's generals were more successful and significantly degraded the Iraqi command's ability to react to, and maneuver against, the U.S.-led invasion force. SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi Army officers into surrendering their units once the fighting started.|$|E

25|$|The Shias openly revolted <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> {{following}} the Gulf War in 1991 and were encouraged by Saddam's defeat in Kuwait and by simultaneous Kurdish uprising in the north. However, Shia {{opposition to the}} government was brutally suppressed, resulting in some 50,000 to 100,000 casualties and successive repression by Saddam's forces. The governing regimes of Iraq were composed mainly of Sunnis {{for nearly a century}} until the 2003 Iraq War.|$|E
25|$|During the 1991 Gulf War <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein, ADC {{president}} James Abourezk {{expressed concern}} that Arab Americans would be targeted, revealing that a violent anti-Arab telephone message had been left on an ADC answering machine.

When the uprising was crushed he was forced to leave Iraq. His father died a year later in 1992 at the age of 93, while still under house arrest in Iraq.|$|R
25|$|The Shia {{uprising}} in Karbala {{was one of}} many major points of unrest in Iraq following the Gulf War. The uprising started after demoralized troops throughout Iraq began to rebel <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein. From 5 to 19 March 1991, the city of Karbala became a chaotic battlefield between the insurgents and the Iraqi Republican Guard. After the failure of the uprising, citizens were killed in large numbers. Parts of the city were nearly leveled.|$|E
25|$|The United States, {{which had}} urged Iraqis {{to rise up}} <b>against</b> <b>Saddam,</b> did nothing to assist the rebellions. The Iranians, despite the {{widespread}} Shi'ite rebellions, {{had no interest in}} provoking another war, while Turkey opposed any prospect of Kurdish independence, and the Saudis and other conservative Arab states feared an Iran-style Shi'ite revolution. Saddam, having survived the immediate crisis in the wake of defeat, was left firmly in control of Iraq, although the country never recovered either economically or militarily from the Gulf War.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Gotovina's {{case was}} {{combined}} with cases of Ivan Čermak and Mladen Markač as they all relate to Operation Storm. The Trial of Gotovina et al was expected to begin in May 2007 but was postponed indefinitely due to conflicts between lawyers on the defence bench. His lawyers were Luka Misetic, an American attorney of Croatian descent, Greg Kehoe, an American lawyer who advised the prosecution in the Iraqi Special Tribunal case <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein, and Payam Akhavan, former Legal Advisor to the Prosecutor's Office of the ICTY,.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{this team}} led the Peshmerga <b>against</b> <b>Saddam's</b> {{forces in the}} north. Their efforts kept the 5th Corps of Saddam's Army in place to defend against the Kurds rather than move to contest the {{coalition}} force coming from the south. The efforts of the SAD Paramilitary Officers and 10th Special Forces Group with the Kurds, likely saved hundreds if not thousands of lives of the coalition service men and women {{during and after the}} invasion.|$|R
5000|$|Iran {{started to}} work closer with the KDP <b>against</b> <b>Saddam's</b> Iraq, and by 1983 the threat of an Iranian {{incursion}} into Iraq via Kurdistan became a real one. The KDP allowed Iran to seize the famous Iran-Iraq border crossing of Haji Omaran, a move that one Western diplomat called [...] "a stab in the back Saddam will never forget". Subsequently, Saddam gained his vengeance on the Barzani clan. 8,000 Barzani males - including pro-government [...] "jash" [...] - were abducted and paraded {{through the streets of}} Baghdad before being executed.|$|R

On 23 June 2007 Ali Hassan al-Majid, and two co-defendants Sultan Hashem Ahmed and Hussein Rashid Mohammed were convicted of genocide and related charges {{and sentenced to death}} by hanging. Another two co-defendants (Farhan Jubouri and Saber Abdel Aziz al-Douri) were sentenced to life imprisonment, and one (Taher Tawfiq al-Ani) was acquitted on prosecution's demand.|$|E
25|$|The Navy's Lynx {{helicopters}} {{were among}} Britain's {{contribution to the}} coalition <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. During the Battle of Bubiyan, the biggest naval engagement of the conflict, the Lynx and its Sea Skua missiles proved to be decisive, being responsible {{for the majority of}} individual engagements with various Iraqi Navy vessels. By 2 February 1991, 25 Sea Skuas had been launched, out of these, 18 were confirmed as having hit their targets, and had succeeding in heavily damaging a significant portion of Iraq's navy. Navy Lynxes were routinely used to deploy troops to oil platforms and into occupied Kuwait itself, as well as to perform aerial reconnaissance across the Gulf.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} re-emerged {{as part of}} the Iran–Iraq War, {{with the}} Kurdish parties collaborating <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> Husein and KDP also gaining military support by the Islamic Republic of Iran. By 1986 Iraqi leadership grew tired of the strengthening and non-loyal Kurdish entity in north Iraq and began a genocidal campaign, known as Al-Anfal, to oust the Kurdish fighters and take revenge on the Kurdish population—an act often described as the Kurdish genocide, with an estimated 50,000–200,000 casualties. In the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, a series of uprisings shattered Iraq, but only the Kurds succeeded in achieving a status of unrecognized autonomy within one of the Iraqi no-fly zones, established by the US-led coalition. In the mid-1990s the conflict between the KDP and PUK erupted once again, resulting in a bloody civil war, which ended in 1997. Despite mutual recognition after the 2003 Iraq war which ousted Ba'ath rule, relations between Iraqi Kurdistan and the Iraqi central government grew strained between 2011–12 due to power-sharing issues and the export of oil.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{autonomy}} agreement collapsed in 1974, Kurds {{had been fighting}} an armed insurgency <b>against</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime. After the Gulf War heavily damaged the Iraqi military and an uprising began in Southern Iraq, Jash (Kurdish militia used by Saddam Hussein's regime to fight Peshmerga) deserters, seized control {{of the city of}} Raniya with support of the local population. Many of the militia took sides with the Peshmerga. The revolutionary feeling spread to the rest of Kurdistan, where people took to the streets and Peshmerga entered the cities and seized control of Raniya, Chawar Qurna, Koi-Sanjaq, Sulaymaniya, Halabja, Arbat, Arbil, Duhuk, Zahku and Kirkuk.|$|R
50|$|The {{last major}} wave of Kurdish {{migration}} to the United States {{or at least to}} Nashville, which has the largest concentration of Kurdish communities in the country, was in 1996 and 1997, following a major civil war between Iraqi Kurdistan's two major political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The Iraqi army began targeting hundreds of individuals accused of working <b>against</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime. The International Organization for Migration initiated an evacuation. Kurdish refugees crossed the Turkish border, after which they were evacuated to Guam, a US territory, and later resettled in the US.|$|R

25|$|Even though {{autonomy}} {{had been}} agreed in 1970, local population enjoyed no particular democratic freedom denied {{to the rest}} of the country. Things began to change after the 1991 uprising <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein at the end of the Persian Gulf War. United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 gave birth to a safe haven following international concern for the safety of Kurdish refugees. The US and British government established a No Fly Zone over a large part of northern Iraq (see Operation Provide Comfort), however, it left out Sulaymaniyah, Kirkuk and other important Kurdish populated regions. Bloody clashes between Iraqi forces and Kurdish troops continued and, after an uneasy and shaky balance of power was reached, the Iraqi government fully withdrew its military and other personnel from the region in October 1991 allowing Iraqi Kurdistan to function de facto independently. The region was to be ruled by the two principal Kurdish parties; the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The region also has its own flag and national anthem.|$|E
25|$|On 2 August 1990, Saddam {{launched}} a military invasion onto neighboring Kuwait, reportedly {{due to its}} vast oil reserves, which would have helped him pay off the debts he owed to other countries during the Iran–Iraq War (see Gulf War). Within 24 hours, the Emir of Kuwait had fled. However, subsequently, an international coalition force consisting of American, British, Saudi and other troops liberated the country in 1991 and Iraqi troops were forced out of Kuwait (see Operation Desert Storm). Subsequently, {{one month after the}} Gulf War in February 1991, United States President George H. W. Bush called on the Iraqi people to stage an uprising <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein. This was followed by a series of rebellions {{in many parts of the}} country, such as the south by Shi'ite groups such as SCIRI and the Islamic Da'awa Party. Meanwhile, the Kurds in the north staged their own uprising for autonomy, under the leadership of Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The Peshmerga were trained into hardened guerrillas, who managed to infiltrate the Jash, a Saddam-orientated Kurdish militia (see Jash (term) and National Defense Battalions (Iraq)). The rebels soon managed to capture the town of Ranya, Sulaimaniya and ultimately the oil center of Kirkuk. Saddam retaliated swiftly, battering Kirkuk with artillery and targeting hospitals in particular. Geographically the towns captured by the Kurdish rebels were difficult to defend as they sat on plains below mountains. The rebels were forced to retreat in the mountains, where reportedly the Iraqi helicopters threw flour of them (which was believed to be a grim legacy of the reputed powdery chemical weapons which were used by the Iraqi administration during the Al-Anfal Campaign).|$|E

The event {{coincided with the}} start of the Gulf War <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein, and Dylan performed [...] "Masters of War". Dylan then made a short speech, saying [...] "My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you.

As a result, the SAD, US Army Special Forces joint teams and the Kurdish Peshmerga were the entire northern force <b>against</b> <b>Saddam's</b> Army during the invasion. Their efforts kept the 1st and 5th Corps of the Iraqi Army in place to defend against the Kurds rather than their moving to contest the coalition force coming from the south.

500|$|During the 1991 Gulf War Sea Kings {{from several}} nations, {{including}} Canada, Britain, and the U.S., {{were present in}} the coalition forces <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's Iraq regime. Due to the threat of potential use of any Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, it was standard practice for Sea King crews to wear fully enclosed NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) protective suits. Britain's Sea Kings primarily engaged in inter-ship transport duties, including ferrying troops between the fleet and land. Six Sea King Mk4 helicopters from 845 Naval Air Squadron and six of 848 Squadron, which had been reformed to meet this operational demand, worked in support of the ground advance. There was thorough radar coverage by U.S. airborne early warning and control [...] (AWACS) aircraft; British AEW Sea Kings were not deployed.|$|E
