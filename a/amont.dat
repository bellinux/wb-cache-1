It is shown that the model reproduces the experimental values of the elastic constant C 44 from room temperature to near the melting point. However, the calculated values of C 11 and C 12 are estimated over the experimental data by large <b>amonts</b> above 550 K. The result indicates {{that in the case}} of AgBr, the material parameters evaluated at the reference temperature (room temperature) can not be extrapolated above 550 K and that the model for the elastic constant used widely in the literature should be used carefully...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} for estimating the specific fiber length from 3 D images of macroscopically homogeneous fiber systems. The method {{is based on}} a discrete version of the Crofton formula, where local knowledge from 3 x 3 x 3 -pixel configurations of the image data is exploited. It is shown that the relative error resulting from the discretization of the outer integral of the Crofton formula <b>amonts</b> at most 1. 2 %. An algorithmic implementation of the method is simple and the runtime as well as the amount of memory space are low. The estimation is significantly improved by considering 3 x 3 x 3 -pixel configurations instead of 2 x 2 x 2, as already studied in literature. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine, {{has been}} shown to be bound by the intranuclear {{chromatin}} protein associated with active DNA, where it is believed to stimulate transcription. Evidence exists that the thyroid hormones have direct action not only on nuclei, but also on mitochondria. Threfore, specific proteins that bind thyroid hormones in the mitochondria should be demonstrable. Mitochondria were isolated from homogenized rat livers by sedimentation through 0. 25 M sucrose solution, followed by washing four times to free them of microsomes. Strong binding of thyroid hormones was observed in mitochondrial fractions prepared from both the membranes and the matrix. After incubation in an ice bath with increasing <b>amonts</b> of triiodothyronine with added tracer [125 I]triiodothyronine, the matrix infrequently contained specific saturable receptor sites, but usually exhibited strong "nonspecific" interaction [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Certain basic {{weaknesses}} {{seem to be}} {{inherent in}} the traditional approaches to education. Among these shortcomings are the widespread failure to provide for individual differences, and the common failure to {{recognize the importance of}} choice in the classroom. Concern for these problems is certainly not new. Efforts to adapt education to individual needs began as early as the last decades of the nineteenth century 1. In 1925 the National Society for the Study of Education met to consider the issue of complete individualization of instruction. A. A. Sutherland expressed concern that under the instruction system the abilities of brighter students would not be evoked by the easy tasks. At the same time, he feared that the abilities of less capable students would be further blunted by tasks that were too difficult for them. Sutherland pointed out that vast individual differences "make any form of mass instruction inadequate to meet the needs and abilities of the children. Children need differing <b>amonts</b> of time and of drill and different children need different methods" 2...|$|R
5000|$|The chef salad {{probably}} owes {{much of its}} popularity, {{according to}} Evan Jones in American Food: The Gastronomic Story (1975), to Louis Diat, chef at the Ritz-Carlton. Cooking a la Ritz includes Diat's recipe: [...] "Chef's salad. Place separately in a salad bowl equal <b>amonts</b> of chopped lettuce (place {{on the bottom of}} the bowl), boiled chicken, smoked ox tongue and smoked ham, all cut in julienne style. Add 1/2 hard-cooked egg for each portion. Place some watercress in the center and serve with French Dressing." [...] Diat did not invent the salad (older recipes exist), but its inclusion on the menu at the Ritz-Carlton would have introduced the salad to more of the public. It's possible that the inclusion of Thousand Island dressing is also linked to the Ritz, since the hotel also introduced the dressing to New York City. This recipe, while containing smoked ox tongue, still contains the primary chef salad ingredients: meat, eggs, greens and presentation: julienne sliced meat, and sliced eggs. Several other early chef salad recipes mention crumbling Roquefort cheese over the salad.|$|R

40|$|Simian virus 40 early mutants with deletions mapping in the 0. 53 - 0. 60 {{region have}} been sequenced by the Maxam and Gilbert approach. All these deletions effect the small-t gene. The {{size of the}} {{shortened}} small-t-related polypeptides produced by several of the mutants has been compared with the molecular weight as deduced from the nucleotide sequence. There was good agreement for the mutants dl 890, dl 891, and dl 2102. For dl 2121 and dl 2122 the small-t-related protein was considerably larger than expected. It is possible to explain this result {{on the basis of}} the nucleotide sequence: the normal splicing event of the small-t mRNA still occurs, but as the deletion shifts the reading frame, translation of the small-t-related polypeptide continues beyond the small-t splice, but in a different reading frame than large-T. Mutants dl 883, dl 884, and dl 2112 have lost one of the small-t splicing boundaries, and no (or minute <b>amonts</b> of) small-t-related protein has been observed in mutant-infected cells.

40|$|Diesel engine can be {{operated}} on either {{pure plant oil}} (PPO) oil or biodiesel. Biodiesel production process is expensive due to many stages of processes, while PPO has a lower cost of production, lower energy consumption, and simpler process. There are several potential biofuel resources in Indonesia such as coconut, palm, and jatropha. They are tropical plants with large <b>amonts</b> of their quantity. Experiment was conducted in 17 hours engine running test (endurance test) with various operating cycle conditions. Test fuels are pure coconut oil (PCO), pure palm oil (PPaO), pure jatropha oil (PJO), and diesel fuel (DF) as a datum. Each PPO blends with diesel fuel with composition 50 %-volume. As a result, PCO has higher BSFC (10 %) before endurance test in comparison with diesel fuel, also PPaO (13 %) and PJO (27 %) show a similar condition. Surprisingly, all PPO have BSFC almost similar with DF after endurance test due to decreasing of engine components friction. On the other hand, PPO produces more uncompleted combustion than DF. Phosporus content has major responsibility of deposit growth. PCO, PPaO, and PJO result more engine deposits in comparison with DF, which accounts for 139, 7 %, 232, 9 %, and 288, 9 % respectively. Based on wear analysis, PCO has the best antiwear property among test fuels, whereas the worst is DF...|$|R

5000|$|Most of Wynebald's landholdings {{consisted}} in {{the former}} fief of Turstin FitzRolf. Turstin had been standard bearer to William the Conqueror at Hastings, according to Orderic Vitalis(b.1075) in his Ecclesiastical History, written between 1123 and 1141. William had asked successively 2 great nobles to fill the post of standard bearer for him, but both had declined, stating they had contingents of their own retainers to command; effectively they felt their valour would be better displayed taking {{an active part in}} the battle. William was therefore grateful for the acceptance of the humbler Turstin, who proved to be very courageous in his duty, and remained at all times by William's side. It was no doubt due to Turstin's loyal service that he was awarded by the Conqueror the several English manors which <b>amonted</b> to a significant fiefdom. It is not certain how or why the transfer of virtually Turstin's entire fiefdom in several English counties came to Wynebald. These lands included not only those Turstin had held in capite from the King, but also his mesne holdings where he held from a non-royal overlord. For some unstated reason commentators seem to rule out a marriage between Wynebald and a daughter of Turstin's as the causal agent behind the transfers. Turstin appears to have been banished and stripped of his land holdings for rebelling against William Rufus.|$|R
