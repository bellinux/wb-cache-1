40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{provisions}} of the Rotterdam Rules 2009 relating to the performing party in general and the maritime performing party in particular. Performing party means a person who performs or undertakes to perform any of the carrier’s obligations under a contract of carriage with respect to the receipt, loading, handling, stowage, carriage, keeping, care, unloading or delivery of the goods, to the extent that such person acts, either directly or indirectly, at the carrier’s request or under the carrier’s supervision or control. Maritime performing party means a performing party who performs or undertakes to perform any of the carrier’s obligations during the period between the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> at the port of loading and their departure from the port of discharge of a ship. The maritime performing party is a new concept introduced by the Rotterdam Rules. The central intention {{of this paper is to}} study and analyse the concept, legal standing and liability of a maritime performing party under the Rotterdam Rules. A comparative analysis of the legal standing of persons analogous to the performing party in conventions regulating the carriage of goods by sea is also provided...|$|E

40|$|Transport is {{the link}} in the {{logistics}} chain {{that makes it possible}} for emergency humanitarian assistance to reach its destination. When designing an emergency supply transport strategy, {{it is not enough to}} consider in the abstract the best means of transport or the resources needed to mobilize supplies from A to B. Alternative means, methods, and routes should be considered as a matter of course. The challenge does not lie in eventually getting the supplies to their destination, regardless of when they may be needed—but in making sure that they arrive safely and on time. The movement of supplies within the country or area of operations is only one part of the process. The <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> from abroad—donated by the international community, or acquired by a disaster relief organization—also imposes its own logistical challenges. Getting emergency supplies from their point of origin to their final destination involves the combined use of different means of transport over air, land, or water. Types of Transport and Their Characteristics The various means of transport have advantages and disadvantages from the point of view of operational needs, ranging from their cost to their capacity and speed (see Table 10. 1). When deciding which means of transport to use, we must think of two main issues: the needs on the ground, and feasible forms of transport. The needs — How urgently are the supplies needed? What type of supplies are being shipped? How large and heavy is the shipment going to be? What is the destination? What distances must be traversed? Feasible forms of transport — What means of transport are avail- 29 This chapter has benefited from the contributions of Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) and Gerard Góme...|$|E
40|$|The South Battleford Project {{began in}} 1972 with salvage {{excavations}} {{in the historic}} town of Battleford, Saskatchewan. This work encompassed a Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) post in operation from 1876 - 1885 at which time it was burned down during the North-West Resistance. Although the store was raided and subsequently set on fire, the excavated cellar depression revealed many {{of the types of}} goods that would have been available to the community during the late nineteenth century. The catalogue and classification of artifacts from these Battleford excavations are completed in this thesis, along with a historical reconstruction for the study area. The data from the South Battleford Project are also used to examine the HBC’s transition from fur trading to retailing during the late 1800 s. Very little research has been done in this area of Canadian history, especially when compared to the vast amounts of data gathered on the preceding fur trade era. As Battleford was the capital of the North-West Territories (1876 - 1883) and later {{played a role in the}} North-West Resistance, the town has an important place in the history and development of western Canada. Therefore, this archaeological site has significant value and adds to the extensive historical reconstruction done at the National Historic Site of Fort Battleford. This research provides a glimpse into the economic environment surrounding Battleford and the western Canadian plains in the late nineteenth century. Although the HBC had successfully accommodated to the demands of the native trade they were slow in adapting to the growing Euro-Canadian market on the western plains. Increasingly, local competition began to emerge in the form of general retailing, further inspired by the ability to obtain cheap goods from wholesalers in Winnipeg. The HBC, still operating out of London, struggled to keep up with shifting trends and technologies and thus lost much of the local business. Maintenance of long distance trade networks further inhibited efficient supply routes and delayed the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> at western posts. Together through the use of archaeological remains and historic documents, the Battleford economic environment is reconstructed, including the HBC’s struggle to compete for the local trade. It is thus demonstrated that prior to the development of HBC department stores in the 1890 s, this long established trading company was slow in profiting from the emerging retail business in the Canadian west...|$|E

30|$|Hong Kong {{depends on}} trucks, ships, and planes for {{transportation}} into the territory <b>of</b> food, consumer <b>goods,</b> and people, mostly tourists. The electrified trains (subways and light-rail) carried {{an average of}} 4.7 million passengers per day as of 2016 [85], and could be sustained with electricity from one or two nuclear power plants, but they carry {{only a fraction of}} the transportation load. The 13, 000 busses, burning gasoline or diesel fuel, carry another several million passengers daily, but they do not carry goods or food. Food and consumer goods are distributed around the territory by about 113, 000 light trucks, or “goods vehicles,” also burning fossil fuels, which constantly crowd the streets and alleys of the city [90]. The main roads also carry a large number of trucks from mainland China bringing mainland-produced food and goods into Hong Kong every day across the land border. It appears to be impossible to replace these essential modes of transport with electric vehicles. There is also no possible source of biofuels in the region which could keep all of these vehicles operating without fossil fuels. Some heavy goods and foods arrive in Hong Kong in ships burning bunker oil, and eventually these <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> by ship will dwindle, as the fuel for powering these ocean-traveling cargo ships becomes increasingly costly or unavailable.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{consequences}} of delays and cost overruns typically associated with the provision of public infrastructure {{in the context of}} a growing economy. Our results indicate that uncertainty about the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> public capital can more than offset its positive spillovers for private-sector productivity. In a decentralized economy, unanticipated delays in the provision of public capital generate too much consumption and too little private investment relative to the first-best optimum. The characterization of the first-best optimum is also affected: facing delays in the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> public <b>goods,</b> a social planner allocates more resources to private investment and less to consumption relative to the first-best outcome in the canonical model (without delays). The presence of delays also lowers equilibrium growth, and leads to a diverging growth path relative to that implied by the canonical model. This suggests that delays in public capital provision may be a potential determinant of cross-country differences in income and economic growth...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study empirically {{examines}} {{the short term}} under- and overreaction effect in the Karachi Stock Exchange, Pakistan, {{in the context of}} the 2008 Global Financial Crisis considering the period from September 2007 to 2009. Background: Investors’ probable reaction to an anticipated or unforeseen event is gaining immense importance in order to understand the complex market behavior. The <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> or bad news can tend to bring about a rise or decline in the stock price even if the news does not directly impact company’s performance. Method: The sample data for the stock price, trading volume and KSE 100 index are obtained from the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) and Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) websites for the period September 2007 to 2009. To reach our objective, we used event studies. Results: There is evidence of significant overreaction in the first two weeks and significant under- reaction in the 12 th and 24 th week following specifically in the financial sector. For the non-financial sector, the returns stay positive and insignificant for both the winner and loser portfolios thereby negating any evidence of significant overreaction. Contributions: We wants to contribute to the existing literature, testing the under- and overreaction hypothesis in an emerging market. Our study also attempts to draw attention to any evidence of returns reversal in the loser and winner portfolios based on the trading volume. Investors may capitalize on the trading volume information to earn contrarian profits...|$|R
40|$|Since Great Britain’s {{return of}} Hong Kong’s {{sovereignty}} to the Chinese government in 1997, {{attention has been}} increasingly directed at the degree of market efficiency in the post-handover Hong Kong stock market. This study uses a sample of 542 corporate news announcements from January 1994 through December 2000 of Hong Kong and China-affiliated firms that are listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. I examine {{the efficiency of the}} Hong Kong stock market by investigating the abnormal price and volume performances surrounding the corporate news announcements. Data of U. S. stocks are also used and serve as benchmarks for a comparative analysis of the relative market efficiencies. This paper finds that there is very little unusual price and volume behavior for both Hong Kong and U. S. stocks.
