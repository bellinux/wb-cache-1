25|$|Systems that don't have {{a trusted}} {{computing}} base {{as part of their}} design do not provide security of their own: they are only secure insofar as security is provided to them by external means (e.g. a computer sitting in a locked room without a network connection may be considered secure depending on the policy, regardless of the software it runs). This is because, as David J. Farber et al. put it, n a computer system, the integrity of lower layers is typically treated as axiomatic by higher layers. As far as computer security is concerned, reasoning about the security properties of a computer system requires being able to make sound assumptions about what it can, and more importantly, cannot do; however, barring <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> otherwise, a computer is able to do everything that a general Von Neumann machine can. This obviously includes operations that would be deemed contrary to all but the simplest security policies, such as divulging an email or password that should be kept secret; however, barring special provisions in the architecture of the system, there is no denying that the computer could be programmed to perform these undesirable tasks.|$|E

[...] Davidson explains that [...] "whether this personification has originally been based on a belief in a goddess of death called Hel is another question," [...] but that she does not believe that the surviving sources give <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> so. Davidson adds that, on the other hand, various other examples of [...] "certain supernatural women" [...] connected with death {{are to be found in}} sources for Norse mythology, that they [...] "seem to have been closely connected with the world of death, and were pictured as welcoming dead warriors," [...] and that the depiction of Hel [...] "as a goddess" [...] in Gylfaginning [...] "might well owe something to these." ...|$|E

Another highly controversial provision is one that allows the FBI to make an order [...] "requiring the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, provided that such investigation of a United States person is not conducted solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution." [...] Though it was not targeted directly at libraries, the American Library Association (ALA), in particular, opposed this provision.

40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been {{numerous}} discussions of complex interventions and complex systems in the health care literature. The cue for many of these discussions was the publication of an influential document on complex interventions by the Medical Research Council in 2000, and the appearance of an equally influential series of articles on complex systems in the British Medical Journal in 2001. However, it is not always clear that the work published during the intervening period recognises that complex interventions and complex systems are not, in fact, the same thing. This paper discusses a recent contribution to the occupational therapy literature, in which the confusion between complex interventions and complex systems drives the argument. It identifies six claims made by Creek et al (2005) and suggests that only one of them is accurate. Specifically, it argues that, although occupational therapy is sometimes a complex intervention, there is no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suppose that it is a complex system; nor is there <b>any</b> good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that occupational therapy outcomes are intrinsically unpredictable. The paper concludes with an explanation of why this topic is important, and why confusing the two (very different) kinds of complexity risks compromising the idea of evidence-based practice...|$|R

At the suppression hearing, the most Agent Johnson could point to was that Ybarra was wearing a 3/4-length lumber jacket, clothing which the State admits could be expected on almost any tavern patron in Illinois in early March. In short, the State is unable to articulate any specific fact that would have justified a police officer at the scene in even suspecting that Ybarra was armed and dangerous.|$|R

A pattern is a natural-language, context-dependent description of a solution to a class of problems, that is both generative and descriptive. This paper introduces patterns and discusses how they can capture know-how in design. A key feature of patterns is their form: the style of their composition and presentation. There is neither evidence to suggest the superiority of one pattern form over <b>any</b> other, nor <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>any</b> existent pattern form will be suitable for design engineering. The author therefore introduces a new pattern form that is extremely adaptable while remaining true to {{the intent of the}} pattern approach. Three patterns are given in their entirety to demonstrate the author’s form and suggest how patterns can capture and help communicate know-how. Proper evaluation can only be undertaken once enough patterns have been written and used that empirical data can be developed; this has not yet been done. However, early indications are that the pattern approach has good potential in design engineering...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the question: Is there <b>any</b> good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in Nietzsche’s metaphysics even though he himself claims {{that it is not}} THE TRUTH in {{correspondence}} with the world? The traditional replies given by Danto, Nehamas, and Poellner are that Nietzsche’s metaphysics is only valid for Nietzsche himself, and they, thereby, turned his philosophy into a form of relativism. However, this answer does not take into consideration Nietzsche's claim for the general superiority of his philosophy. In addition, Nietzsche's view seems inconsistent - on the one hand he claimed all perspectives are equally false in respect to THE TRUTH, {{but on the other hand}} he regarded his views as superior. I explain in which respect Nietzsche justifies his claims, that Nietzsche's position is not inconsistent, and why consistency is important for him. In the first chapter, I present Nietzsche's metaphysics of the will to power and the eternal recurrence of everything. In the second chapter, I show how Nietzsche's metaphysics led him to his perspectivism, i. e. that all views are interpretations, his denial of THE TRUTH, that all perspectives are equally false in respect to THE TRUTH, that it is essential for human beings to have a defined perspective (e. g. to have a consistent worldview) and his presentation of nihilism. These claims, however, seem to contradict the claims in main part one. In chapter three, I explain why Nietzsche thinks that his metaphysics will come to be regarded as superior for a certain period of time, as transcending the long dominant but declining world-view of Christianity. The claim for the superiority of his philosophy is supported by the belief not that it is true, but that it contains elements which will appeal to people in the future...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the vast}} {{majority}} of its history, hedonism about well-being has been perennially unpopular (Feldman 2004). The arguments in this essay take steps towards reviving the plausibility of hedonism about well-being. The main argument currently used to refute hedonism about well-being, the Argument from False Pleasures, is shown to lack sufficient evidence to be compelling. The main evidence provided for the Argument from False Pleasures {{comes in the form of}} two thought experiments, the Experience Machine (Nozick 1974) and the Deceived Businessman (Kagan 1998). These thought experiments typically produce strong intuitive responses, which are used to directly support the Argument from False Pleasures. This essay investigates how theories of well-being are currently evaluated by moral philosophers, with a specific focus on the place our intuitions have in the process. Indeed, the major role that moral intuitions play in evaluating theories of well-being, despite their sometimes dubious epistemic credentials, leads to an in-depth enquiry into their inner workings and potential for containing normatively significant information. The investigation, which draws on the work of Woodward and Allman (2007), concludes that intuitions about unrealistic thought experiments should not play an important role in evaluating theories of well-being. Rather, they should only act as a warning sign, highlighting moral propositions for further analysis. Based on these findings, a new method for assessing theories of well-being is suggested and applied to a specific internalist account of hedonism about well-being to show how the Deceived Businessman and Experience Machine thought experiments lack normative significance, leaving the Argument from False Pleasures without sufficient evidence to be compelling. Indeed, this essay concludes that the Argument from False Pleasures should no longer be thought <b>to</b> provide <b>any</b> good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that hedonism about well-being is implausible. This result is only one step on the road to reviving hedonism about well-being, but it is a very important one...|$|R
