Individuals describing themselves as a [...] "private group" [...] had met with a senior figure within the Liberal Party of Australia in a hotel in Sydney, and offered him a significant amount of money by way of an anonymous donation. The book's source recounted the events: [...] "They said 'We are a private group'. I asked them if they voted. It was a testing question. They said they didn't. It was a very short discussion." [...] The organisation's members are instructed that government is controlled by God, and they are told not to vote in elections. [...] "We're in the business of ideas and so are the Exclusive Brethren. I regard many of the party's views and those of the Exclusive Brethren as inconsistent. What the [...] Party stands for should not be confused {{in the mind of the}} electorate by the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>donations</b> from fringe groups.

40|$|Purpose of review—Hispanic {{individuals}} are disproportionately {{in need of}} donor organs and {{are less likely to}} consent to donation than their non-Hispanic counterparts. This review addresses psychological constructs including attitudes and beliefs surrounding organ donation within Hispanic communities and highlights the importance of women in the domain <b>of</b> organ <b>donation.</b> Recent findings—Attitudes toward living and posthumous donation are favorable. Mistrust of the medical profession, concerns about religious <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>donation,</b> perceptions <b>of</b> inequity in the distribution of donated organs, and the context in which donation requests typically are made serve as barriers to consent. Women are more likely to consent to donation than men. Summary—Hispanic American groups are heterogeneous. Culturally-sensitive approaches to communicating a donation request must consider ethnic origin and language preference. Family discussion <b>of</b> <b>donation</b> should be encouraged by the medical community as part of health care decision making (independent of death or crisis); women may serve as an excellent bridge between healthcare providers and families in this regard...|$|R

At that time, the Museum’s Board decided that the Permanent Collection should be focused on a more specific collecting area. The Ralph L. Wilson Collection of American Art, gifted in the 1970s, was a significant step toward the eventual focus on 19th and 20th Century American artists.|$|E

40|$|Discussions at {{the inaugural}} meeting of a Trans-European Pedagogic Research Group for Anatomical Sciences {{highlighted}} {{the fact that}} there exist considerable variations in the legal and ethical frameworks throughout Europe concerning body bequests for anatomical examination. Such differences appear to reflect cultural and religious variations as well as different legal and constitutional frameworks. For example, there are different views concerning the "ownership" of cadavers and concerning the need (perceived by different societies and national politicians) for legislation specifically related to anatomical dissection. Furthermore, there are different views concerning the acceptability of using unclaimed bodies that have not given informed consent. Given that in Europe there have been a series of controversial anatomical exhibitions and also a public (televised) dissection/autopsy, and given that the commercial sale or transport of anatomical material across national boundaries is strongly debated, it would seem appropriate to "harmonise" the situation (at least in the European Union). This paper summarises the legal situation in a variety of European countries and suggests examples of good practice. In particular, it recommends that all countries should adopt clear legal frameworks to regulate the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>donations</b> for medical education and research. It stresses the need for informed consent, with donors being given clear information upon which to base their decision, intentions to bequest being made by the donor before death and encourages donors to discuss their wishes to bequeath with relatives prior to death. Departments are encouraged, where they feel it appropriate, to hold Services of Thanksgiving and Commemoration for those who have donated their bodies. Finally, there needs to be legislation to regulate transport of bodies or body parts across national borders and a discouragement of any moves towards commercialisation in relation to bequests...|$|E

That the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> this <b>donation</b> in exchange for the hoary name of this Institution was not caused by an acute financial stringency is proved by the fact that the very next year, in 1955, the Government undertook a vast expansion scheme for this Hospital at a cost of Rs. 57 lakh.|$|R
