[...] The company also sought to discredit Nowinski by claiming that he had failed to disclose that he'd suffered previous concussions before signing his contract with WWE, as was required. They further disputed his claims as to the number of days wrestlers worked, on average, and observed that despite Nowinski's renown in the area of CTE, a form of brain injury resulting from repeated concussions, he is not an expert in matters relating to steroids or pain killers. The charge that Nowinski was a [...] "stranger" [...] to Cade was refuted by Nowinski: He and Lance Cade had been tag team partners during 2002–2003, and co-workers until 2007.|$|E
