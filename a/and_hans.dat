40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} gender roles on earnings differentials between <b>Han</b> Chinese <b>and</b> Uyghurs in Ürümchi, China, using data from a survey (N = 1, 600) conducted in Ürümchi in 2005. It finds sizable earnings differentials between <b>Han</b> Chinese <b>and</b> Uyghurs. However, the differences in income between Uyghur men <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> men fade away controlling for socioeconomic variables. No similar patterns are found among women. Earnings differentials between Uyghur women <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> women <b>and</b> between Uyghurs <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> Chinese disappear after the measures for family responsibilities are introduced into the earnings equation. The differences in socioeconomic status and family responsibilities between Uyghur women <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> women underlie the aggregate income inequality between Uyghurs <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> Chinese...|$|R
25|$|The Qing {{authorities}} considered both <b>Han</b> <b>and</b> Hui to be Chinese, and in Xinjiang both Hui <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> {{were classified}} as merchants, regardless of profession. Laws were passed segregating the different races, in theory keeping Turkic Muslims apart from Hui <b>and</b> <b>Han,</b> however, the law was not followed. Hui <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> households were built closer {{together in the same}} area while Turkic Muslims would live farther away from town.|$|R

5|$|After Høybråten {{announced}} that he would not seek reelection as party leader of KrF, Hareide quickly emerged as the leading candidate to succeed Høybråten, after the two other apparent candidates, Dagrun Eriksen <b>and</b> <b>Hans</b> Olav Syversen, announced they would not run. Hareide is considered to belong to the socially liberal wing of the party, and conservative members of the party have demanded {{that at least one of}} the deputy leaders be from the party's conservative wing if they are to support Hareide. Hareide supported the efforts to eliminate the rule which requires Christian Democratic party representatives to declare a Christian faith, and a vote gave a clear majority to abolish that rule two years later. Hareide was unanimously voted in as new party leader at the 2011 convention on 30 April 2011. Hareide declined the nomination as parliamentary leader, <b>and</b> <b>Hans</b> Olav Syversen was elected to this position.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} Qing dynasty, the Qing {{government}} made distinctions between <b>Han</b> bannermen <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> civilians. Former {{subjects of the}} Ming dynasty, regardless of their origin, were categorised as Han Chinese, so some Manchus ended up in Mongol <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> banners. Nurhaci also allowed transfrontiersmen to identify themselves as Manchu after assimilation. The Kangxi Emperor later moved both <b>Han</b> <b>and</b> Mongol families to Manchu banners from their original Mongol <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> banners.|$|R

5|$|Hitler made a {{prominent}} {{appearance at the}} trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer <b>and</b> <b>Hans</b> Ludin, in late 1930. Both were charged with membership in the NSDAP, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel. The prosecution argued that the NSDAP was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on Hitler to testify. On 25 September 1930, Hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections, which won him many supporters in the officer corps.|$|E

5|$|The direct {{electrolysis}} of a molten {{mixture of}} beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride by Paul Lebeau in 1898 {{resulted in the}} first pure (99.5 to 99.8%) samples of beryllium. The first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1932 by Alfred Stock <b>and</b> <b>Hans</b> Goldschmidt. Their process involves the electrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluorides and barium, which causes molten beryllium to collect on a water-cooled iron cathode.|$|E
5|$|The main {{criticisms of}} the film were that its {{characters}} were underdeveloped, its script was crowded, and it was overlong.

Foxx's portrayal of Max Dillon/Electro was met with mixed reviews.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe bibasic {{trigonometric}} functions, {{recently introduced}} by Foata <b>and</b> <b>Han,</b> {{give rise to}} the p,q-tangent numbers and the p,q-secant numbers. Foata <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> proposed a combinatorial interpretation of these bibasic coefficients as enumerations of alternating permutations by the bi-statistic (inv 1,inv 2). Under this interpretation, the symmetry of the bibasic trigonometric functions yields a combinatorial identity. A combinatorial proof of the identity is desired. For permutations of even order, this has already been given by Foata <b>and</b> <b>Han.</b> Here we give a proof for permutations of odd order...|$|R
50|$|In 659, Empress Wu {{carried out}} even more reprisals—this time, having Xu falsely accuse Zhangsun, who had shown {{implicit}} disapproval of her ascension, of treason, and Chu (who had died at this point), Liu, <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> of encouraging Zhangsun. Zhangsun was exiled (and soon forced to commit suicide), while Liu <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> were demoted to commoner rank. In fall 659, Emperor Gaozong further sent imperial messengers to arrest Liu <b>and</b> <b>Han,</b> {{as well as}} Zhangsun Wuji's cousin Zhangsun En (長孫恩), but even while imperial messengers {{were on the way}} changed the order to have Liu <b>and</b> <b>Han</b> executed instead. Liu's clan members were exiled to the modern Guangdong and Guangxi region, while his immediately family was specifically confiscated to become servants at Gui Prefecture (桂州, roughly modern Guilin, Guangxi).|$|R

5|$|The {{originality}} of {{this document}} remains {{a matter of}} debate. Hans K.

Interpreter Walter Deeters says that the separations in the text act as reading aids, showing that the document {{was intended to be}} read. Diplomats Theodor von Sickel and Carlrichard Brühl believe that the document is not the original as it lacks a seal and the lines are unusually shaped.|$|E
5|$|The taxonomic affinities of the broad-billed parrot are un{{determine}}d. Considering {{its large}} jaws and other osteological features, the ornithologists Edward Newton <b>and</b> <b>Hans</b> Gadow thought {{it to be}} {{closely related to the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus) in 1893, but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus, since a crest was only known from the latter. The British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in 1987.|$|E
