Its own life being all a matter of pose and gesture, it is unable to realize the power and the danger of a real movement and of words that have no sham meaning. It is all fun and sentiment. It is sufficient, for instance, to point out the attitude of the old French aristocracy towards the philosophers whose words were preparing the Great Revolution. Even in England, where you have some common-sense, a demagogue has only to shout loud enough and long enough to find some backing in the very class he is shouting at. You, too, like to see mischief being made. The demagogue carries the amateurs of emotion with him. Amateurism in this, that, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a delightfully easy way of killing time, and feeding one's own vanity--the silly vanity of being abreast with the ideas of the day after to-morrow. Just as good and otherwise harmless people will join you in ecstasies over your collection without having the slightest notion in what its marvellousness really consists." ...|$|E
60|$|See {{the spirit}} that was among the {{primitive}} professors, that knowing and believing how much it concerned them, in the propagating of Christianity, to show forth love to one another, that so all might know them to be Christ's disciples, rather than there should be any complainings among them, they sold all they had. Oh how zealous were these to practise, and, with one shoulder, to do that that was upon their hearts for God! I might further add, how often have we agreed in our judgment? and hath it not been upon our hearts, that this <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> good {{to be done to}} enlighten the dark world, and to repair the breaches of churches, and to raise up those churches that now lie agasping, and among whom the soul of religion is expiring?

Let us then, in what we know, unite, that we may put it in practice, remembering that, if we know these things, we shall be happy if we do them.|$|E

40|$|The {{criminal}} law of every democratic state {{is based on}} several principles which constitute the pillars of its existence, because they serve as a guarantee for the protection and guarantee of rights and freedoms. One of these principles is the principle of legality, known in Latin with the term “Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege”. The recognition and prediction of this fundamental principle of {{criminal law}} {{is one of the}} basic requirements for the criminal legislation of a state, to be considered as democratic and contemporary. But we must consider the other fact that is formal prediction of this principle in criminal law or in the Constitution of a State <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> its effective implementation in practice. This second requirement relates to real and effective implementation of the principle of legality and represents a great importance for countries like Albania, where the implementation of legislation in general {{and the rule of law}} still has problems. It is no coincidence that one of the requirements that the European Union has imposed to Albania, but also to other countries aspiring to integrate in this organization, is the implementation of effective law and real guarantee of the rights and fundamental freedoms. The principle of legality is a multi-dimensional principle. It has at the same time national and international character, legal and constitutional, and consists of several sub principles or elements. The dimensions of this principle would be the scientific purpose of this article, which will be reflected in the conclusions and references based in this article...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{fundamental}} principle of classical portfolio theory states that mature capital markets are nearly efficient thus offering no extra returns and low possibilities for international portfolio diversification. Thus {{it is not}} a surprise that in the recent 20 years mutual funds from emerging economies with their high growth rates, frequent abnormal returns and less than perfect positive correlation with developed economies have been attracting an increasing volume of international investment flows. In this context evaluation of emerging markets funds performance has become a frequent topic of discussion and research by modern portfolio theory and theory of capital markets equilibrium. Here it is necessary to state two things about existing studies: the one thing is that they provide quite mixed results - on average, local equity funds do not generate abnormal returns, but they still exist; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that such evidence is structured predominantly upon country evidence, thus limiting the possibility to derive some generalized conclusions about mutual fund performance in particular groups of emerging economies or emerging economies per se. Another common drawback of existing studies is their frequent usage of data suffering with survivorship bias, which in light of short time-series of available observations, obviously do not add precision to conclusions, derived on the basis of such samples. In light of the stated above the paper aims to reevaluate absolute and relative risk-adjusted performance of open-end equity mutual funds on the sample of advanced, secondary and frontier economies from the Central and Eastern Europe, from the South Eastern Asia, from the Middle East and North Africa, and BRIC economies for the time span from Q 1 / 2000 to Q 1 / 2015. Following established practice, fund performance is evaluated by means of unconditional and conditional single-factor and multifactor CAPM time-series regressions under which individual fund returns are regressed over factor loadings, given by Sharpe and Treynor ratios, Jensen's alpha and M squared, Fama-French and Carhart measures, raw input data for which is collected from Bloomberg terminal and data sets of World Development Indicators and International Financial Statistics. On the basis {{of a large number of}} performance measures and attributes employed in this research as well as survivorship-bias free database, the chosen study provides a useful insight into mutual fund performance of particular groups of emerging economies or emerging economies per se, documenting important country and regional characteristics...|$|E
