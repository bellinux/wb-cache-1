5000|$|<b>American</b> <b>columbo</b> is a {{monocarpic}} perennial, {{meaning it}} flowers once after multiple seasons, and then dies. When {{it reaches the}} flowering stage, the 3 - 6 inch lanceolate leaves develop (usually in whorls of four) on a round elongated stem, and approximately 50 to 100 flowers will develop a panicle, with the fruits maturing soon after. The flowers that it produces are about 1 inch in diameter and folious (tall and [...] "spike"-like), green to yellow in colour with purple speckles. It is a perfect and complete flower, with four stamens and two carpels. The oblong shaped seed capsule has a brownish color and is about 1/2 inch long. The entire plant can reach heights over 2 m. Though it is monocarpic, the plant may live for up to 30 years before flowering.|$|E

5000|$|Ghote's father {{appears in}} the novel The Murder of the Maharajah (1980). Ghote is married; his wife, Protima, is a beautiful, spirited, and argumentative, though loving, Bengali. They have a son, Ved, {{invariably}} {{referred to in the}} earlier novels as [...] "little Ved". In most novels, Ghote finds that he has to spend almost as much time fighting the Indian criminal justice system bureaucracy as he does in fighting criminals. He also tends to get little respect from the often rich and powerful people he must investigate in connection with his work, though in the end he typically wins the day through sheer doggedness. In these characteristics, he has been compared to the <b>American</b> fictional detective <b>Columbo.</b> Ganesh Ghote's character has appeared in a movies and serials. The noted actor Naseeruddin Shah played the role of Ghote in The Perfect Murder. Ghote also appeared in a BBC adaptation of Inspector Ghote Hunts the Peacock, played by Zia Mohyeddin. The same novel was again adapted by the BBC this time as a radio drama starring Sam Dastor.|$|R
