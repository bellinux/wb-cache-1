5|$|Ignoring {{the events}} of the {{previous}} Doom games, the game is the first reboot to the series. Doom 3 is set in 2145 on Mars, where a military-industrial conglomerate has set up a scientific research facility to research into fields such as teleportation, biological research and advanced weapons design. However, the teleportation experiments inadvertently open a gateway to Hell, resulting in a catastrophic invasion by demons. The player, an anonymous space marine, must fight through the base and find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the demons attacking Mars. Doom 3 utilizes the id Tech 4 game engine, which has since been licensed out to other developers, and later released under the GNU General Public License in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|At night, Evelyn {{takes the}} Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally {{awakening}} Imhotep. The expeditions return to Cairo, but Imhotep follows {{them with the}} help of Beni. Imhotep returns to full strength by killing the Americans one by one, and brings the ten plagues back to Egypt. Seeking <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn believes that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of the Living can kill him again, and deduces the book's whereabouts. Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the rest of the group.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} about three {{brothers}} who, traveling together, reach a treacherous river. They make a magical bridge over the river wherein just as they cross, they meet the personification of Death, who is angry for losing three potential victims. He pretends to be impressed by them and grants each a wish as a reward. The oldest brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, so Death gives him the Elder Wand. The middle brother asks for the ability to resurrect the dead, so Death gives him the Resurrection Stone. The youngest brother does not trust Death and asks for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> Death from following him, so Death reluctantly gives him his Cloak of Invisibility.

While Musashi searches for the Fire Scroll, Musashi's rival, Kojiro, kidnaps Princess Fillet and uses her as a hostage to force a battle with Musashi. Kojiro is defeated and Fillet is then rescued. Musashi then searches for thieves from the Thirstquencher Empire and {{makes his way to}} the next crest guardian. It is then revealed that Princess Fillet is actually one of Thirstquencher's thieves disguised and that the real Fillet is still in their hands. Musashi then continues his journey, finds the Wind Scroll, and defeats its crest guardian in an ants' nest.|$|E
5|$|Kirie and Shuichi {{devise a}} plan to escape Kurōzu-cho, but when they attempt to escape, their efforts are unsuccessful. After {{returning}} to the town, they discover that several {{years have passed since}} they left, as time speeds up away from the spiral. The other citizens have expanded the terraced houses until they connect into a single structure forming a spiral pattern. Kirie and Shuichi decide to search for Kirie's parents, which brings them {{to the center of the}} spiral. At the center, they fall down a pit, within which they discover the corpses of Kirie's parents and an ancient city completely covered with spiral patterns. Shuichi urges Kirie to move forward and find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the curse, but she replies that she does not have the strength and wishes to stay with him. The two embrace each other, and their bodies twist and wrap together as a result of the curse. As they lie together, Kirie notes that the curse ended at the same time it began, for just as time speeds up away from the center, it freezes at the center, and concludes that the curse is eternal, and all the events will repeat when a new Kurōzu-cho is built where the previous one laid.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{minimum wage}} laws were first passed in New Zealand and Australia in the 1890s. The {{movement}} for minimum wages was first motivated as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> {{the exploitation of}} workers in sweatshops, by employers who were thought to have unfair bargaining power over them. Over time, minimum wages {{came to be seen}} as a way to help lower-income families. Most countries had introduced minimum wage legislation by the end of the 20th century.|$|E
30|$|Modern {{social and}} {{computer}} networks are common media for cascades of information, ideas, rumors, and viruses. It is often desirable {{to identify the}} source of a cascade from a snapshot of the cascade. For example, <b>a</b> good <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>a</b> rumor is to find out the person that has fabricated it. Similarly, identifying the first computer infected by a virus provides valuable information for catching the author. Therefore, given the network structure and an observed cascade snapshot consisting only the set of infected/active nodes, solving the source inference problem is very useful in many cases. Hereafter, we use infected/active and infect/activate interchangeably.|$|R
5000|$|The {{budget was}} set at six million dollars {{with most of the}} film being shot in Granada, Nicaragua. To get into character, Ed Harris led the entire cast in a 10-mile forced march through the Nicaraguan countryside. The actor was drawn to the {{challenge}} of playing someone [...] "who has incredible moral convictions but turns into such an evil person in the name of spreading democracy." [...] He was also drawn to the script's politics, claiming to be anti-Contra and anti-intervention in Nicaragua and saw making a film there as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> possibly <b>stop</b> the bloodshed.|$|R
50|$|Ferric subsulfate (also {{known as}} Monsell's Solution) {{is often used}} by Jewish burial {{societies}} (chevra kadisha) <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> post-mortem bleeding. Since Jewish burial does not allow any external skin adhesives such as bandages, tape, glue or resin, ferric subsulfate is <b>an</b> effective <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> post-mortem bleeding. Most post-mortem bleeding stems from surgery, emergency room situations, autopsies or blood which may result when removing IV lines during Jewish burial preparation. A piece of cotton, or Q-tip, soaked with this solution is pressed against the open wound and held for a few seconds. This is usually enough time for the seal to take effect. For more severe cases, such as arterial lines, if the line is still inside, the solution can be inserted directly into the IV line.|$|R

25|$|The Spanish Civil War exposed {{political}} divisions across Europe. The {{right and}} the Catholics supported the Nationalists as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the expansion of Bolshevism. On the left, including labor unions, students and intellectuals, the war represented a necessary battle {{to stop the spread}} of fascism. Anti-war and pacifist sentiment was strong in many countries, leading to warnings that the Civil War had the potential of escalating into a second world war. In this respect, the war was an indicator of the growing instability across Europe.|$|E
25|$|DPP {{planned to}} {{discontinue}} the current 18% pension interest rate for civil servants also backfired on the party. The pension reform plan {{had been put}} forward by the Chen administration as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> a drain on the national treasury caused by paying a favored interest rate to long-term KMT officials who had worked relatively short stints in actual public government. Prominent beneficiaries of the high interest rate included KMT honor chairman Lien Chan and current Taichung mayor Jason Hu. The announcement of the reform plan cost the DPP a huge loss of support among civil service employees without the party winning offsetting increases in support from other segments of society.|$|E

50|$|If a {{beekeeper}} is {{stung by}} a bee, {{there are many}} protective measures that should be taken {{in order to make}} sure the affected area does not become too irritated. The first cautionary step that should be taken following a bee sting is removing the stinger without squeezing the attached venom glands. A quick scrape with a fingernail is effective and intuitive. This step is effective in making sure that the venom injected does not spread, so the side effects of the sting will go away sooner. Washing the affected area with soap and water is also <b>a</b> good <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the spread of venom. The last step that needs to be taken is to apply ice or a cold compress to the stung area.|$|R

Garibaldi invaded, attempting to reach Naples quickly before Cavour found <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> him. On September 7, he entered Naples, at that time the largest city in Italy, and unilaterally declared Victor Emmanuel the King of Italy.

40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} worldwide {{competition has}} often {{resulted in a}} spate of plant closures and labor cutbacks.

Declining labor productivity, in turn, can lead to gradual loss of the company's competitive edge over its competitors. As learned from the Japanese success, <b>a</b> better <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> such <b>a</b> vicious circle is a long-term commitment to 'no-layoff' policies. A no-layoff policy may be tenable by utilizing a redeployment strategy with which some US companies are starting to experiment.

50|$|Critics of {{laws against}} predatory pricing may support their case empirically {{by arguing that}} there has been no {{instance}} where such a practice has actually led to a monopoly. Conversely, they argue that there is much evidence that predatory pricing has failed miserably. For example, Herbert Dow not only found <b>a</b> cheaper <b>way</b> <b>to</b> produce bromine but also defeated a predatory pricing attempt by the government-supported German cartel Bromkonvention, who objected to his selling in Germany at a lower price. Bromkonvention retaliated by flooding the US market with below-cost bromine, at an even lower price than Dow's. However, Dow simply instructed his agents to buy up at the very low price and then sell it back in Germany at a profit but still lower than Bromkonvention's price. In the end, the cartel could not keep up selling below cost and had to give in. That is used as evidence that the free market is <b>a</b> better <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> predatory pricing than regulations such as anti-trust laws.|$|R
25|$|The {{sandwich}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} there was a great deal of animosity between the chain and its franchises over its Buck Double promotion, which was driving average checks and profits. The Buck Double had been running for since October 2010 to the introduction of the XT, eventually had taken upwards 10% of all sales in the restaurants - cannibalizing sales from other higher priced items. Combined with the ongoing economic downturn at the time, the value- oriented promotion had sent overall profits for the chain down by as much as 3.3%. The introduction was seen as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> help <b>stop</b> the sales slide and prop up the chain's flagging sales. By mid-2011, the financial crisis was also still lingering and many chains, Burger King included, had moved to a discounting as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> attract customers who were unwilling to spend money during tough economic times. The discounting fit into the barbell strategy as these deals would often encourage people to purchase more food, often at higher price points.|$|R
