5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E
25|$|Two {{original}} first-floor fireplaces survive. One {{of these}} has an over-painted stone surround and mantelpiece, and a hearth surfaced with Arts and Crafts tiles. The other {{one in the}} music room is a large and decoratively carved oak affair, with matching doorways either side. These doors open into a dressing room, allowing the fireplace to be a backdrop for performances. The doors and fireplace contain half-columns and pediments in a semi-neoclassical style, with a carved frieze of fruit and leaves, and the helmeted head of St Cecilia, patroness of musicians. The hearth contains a hand-made Arts and Crafts cast iron hood and moulded, coloured ceramic tiles on the surround. The hearth's floor tiles have been removed. The music room has a carved, oak dado, and a decorative plaster ceiling with ceiling roses which double as ventilators, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> original wooden beams designed to support the heavy hung ceiling.|$|E

25|$|The Lancelot-Grail Cycle and {{the texts}} it {{influenced}} depict {{the city of}} Camelot as standing along a river, downstream from Astolat. It is surrounded by plains and forests, and its magnificent cathedral, St. Stephen's, is the religious centre for Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. There, Arthur and Guinevere are married <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> tombs of many kings and knights. In a mighty castle stands the Round Table; {{it is here that}} Galahad conquers the Siege Perilous, and where the knights see a vision of the Holy Grail and swear to find it. Jousts are held in a meadow outside the city. In the Palamedes and other works, the castle is eventually destroyed by King Mark of Cornwall after the loss of Arthur at the Battle of Camlann. However maddening to later scholars searching for Camelot's location, its imprecise geography serves the romances well, as Camelot becomes less a literal place than a powerful symbol of Arthur's court and universe. It should be noted, too, that there is a Kamaalot featured as the home of Perceval's mother in the romance Perlesvaus.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there are}} several Bronze Age sites on the island, they provide less {{dramatic}} remains. At Warness in the south west there is a burnt mound from this period <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> ruins of two houses of a similar age on Holm of Faray near the Point of Dogs Bones. The Fold of Setter is an [...] Bronze Age enclosure located {{to the north of}} Mill Loch. There is the site of a large Iron Age roundhouse containing a saddle quern at Linkataing in north west Eday. Latterly, Orkney was settled by the Picts although the archaeological evidence is sparse.|$|E
500|$|The Bass Rock {{is about}} [...] offshore, and [...] {{north-east}} of North Berwick. This steep-sided island is currently uninhabited, but was lived on for many centuries.

[...] Other faults in the near surface continental crust, such as the South Whidbey Island Fault (near Everett), and the yet to be studied Olympia Fault (near Olympia), though historically quiescent, are suspected of generating earthquakes of around magnitude 7. [...] Others, such as the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, originate about [...] below Puget Sound in the Benioff zone of the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate; being so deep their energy is dissipated.

The doorway is on the south side, headed by a plain arch, and dates from the 12thcentury. [...] There is a stone bellcote at the west end. [...] There is no structural division between the nave (where the congregation would have sat) and the chancel (where the altar would have been located). There are no window openings on the north side, {{but there is a}} blocked opening to the east (about [...] wide) <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> remains of a window on the south wall.

500|$|The {{concrete}} gun emplacements {{were called}} Summit Battery, Laboratory Battery, Garden Battery and Tombstone Battery. Along with the barracks {{they have been}} designated as GradeII listed buildings. The facilities installed included a master-gunners house, a small inn, and a water tank holding [...] of rainwater. The water tank is beneath the barracks and collects rainwater from its roof. The brick tank is [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high with a vaulted roof. Armaments included ten 7-inch rifled muzzle loaders MkIII spread between six batteries. These were later replaced with Armstrong 6-inch RML guns. Some of the gun batteries are scheduled monuments, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> remains of a centralised group of brick-built barrack blocks. In 1898 test firing by HMS Arrogant, an Arrogant-class cruiser, on Rudder Rock battery showed that the fixed gun emplacements used on Steep Holm and other sites were susceptible to attack by modern warships, and the site was no longer active. The military control on the island was maintained until 1908 when it was leased to James Sleeman and his family. In 1927 the first test of the RAE Larynx (from [...] "Long Range Gun with Lynx engine") an early pilotless aircraft, {{to be used as}} a guided anti-ship weapon, took place just off Steep Holm.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the midst}} of this turmoil, which also {{included}} Clinton pledging government-level support to Japan {{in the wake of the}} devastating 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Clinton reiterated in a mid-March CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer during her post-revolution visit to Cairo's Tahrir Square that she had no interest in becoming Secretary of Defense or vice president or of running for president again. She also explicitly said for the first time that she did not want to serve a second term as Secretary of State if President Obama is re-elected in 2012. She stressed how much she regarded her current position: [...] "Because I have the best job I could ever have. This is a moment in history where it is almost hard to catch your breath. There are both the tragedies and disasters that we have seen from Haiti to Japan <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> extraordinary opportunities and challenges that we see right here in Egypt and in the rest of the region." [...] But reportedly she was weary at times from constant travelling, still not part of Obama's inner circle, and looking forward to a time of less stress and the chances to write, teach, or work for international women's rights. She was not bound by her statements, and Blitzer for one suspected she would change her mind. In any case, she remained popular with the American public; her Gallup Poll favorability rating rose to 66percent (against 31percent unfavorable), her highest mark ever save for a period during the Lewinsky scandal thirteen years earlier. Her favorability was 10 to 20 percentage points higher than those for Obama, Biden, or Gates, and reflected in part the high ratings that secretaries of state sometimes get.|$|E
