40|$|AbstractTraditional {{machining}} of {{a permanent}} magnet is difficult because of magnetic forces and brittleness of materials. However, electrical discharge machining (EDM), which is a non-contact thermal machining method, has carried out for shape machining of magnetic materials. Magnetic materials have a Curie point. As their magnetic flux density reduces when they are heated to a high temperature. Because EDM is a thermal process, {{it has the potential}} to control the magnetic flux density of a machined surface. In this study, to clarify the relationship between magnetic flux density and temperature distributions in depth direction of permanent magnet by EDM, internal temperatures of magnets were investigated using a K type thermocouple during EDM. <b>Neodymium</b> <b>magnets</b> were used as work-pieces. The magnetic flux density of <b>a</b> machined <b>neodymium</b> <b>magnet</b> was measured. In addition, the effects of duty factor (D. F.) and in Diamagnetic Field were also examined. The results showed that the average temperature inside of the magnet is determined by the input energy, depending on the discharge conditions. A decrease of surface magnetic flux density after EDM is affected by the magnitude of the area and the amount of decrease is due to the increase of the internal temperature of the magnet. In a diamagnetic field EDM, the reduction in magnetic flux density is large compared with a regular magnetic field. However, there is no difference in internal temperature each machining. Therefore, it isn’t determined simply by the magnitude of the input energy. It can be said that combination of heat history and machined magnet shape determine the magnetic flux density...|$|R

40|$|Shearwaters {{deprived}} of their olfactory sense before being displaced to distant sites have impaired homing ability but it is unknown what the role of olfaction is when birds navigate freely without their sense of smell. Furthermore, treatments used to induce anosmia and to disrupt magneto-reception in displacement experiments might influence non-specific factors {{not directly related to}} navigation and, as a consequence, the results of displacement experiments can have multiple interpretations.

However, we found that in the pelagic return stage of their foraging trips, anosmic birds were not oriented towards the colony though coastal navigation was unaffected. These results support the case for zinc sulphate having a specific effect on the navigational ability of shearwaters and thus the view that seabirds consult an olfactory map to guide them across seascapes...|$|R
