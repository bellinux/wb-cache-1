The results showed that the magnetic properties of MAC are provided by Fe 3 O 4 and Fe. In the presence of Fe 3 O 4, the rate of carbonization and activation increase to form a large surface area and a high pore volume. Moreover, the addition of Fe 3 O 4 can greatly promote the number of both micro-pores and meso-pores in activated carbon. ...|$|R
40|$|The Pennsylvanian (Atokan) age Pinkerton Trail Formation of {{the eastern}} Paradox basin (SW Colorado) {{displays}} an uncommon stratigraphic signature that is composed of subtidal carbonate sediment packages punctuated by coal layers, reflecting large scale sea level change. These high amplitude relative sea level changes are attributed to combined glacial eustasy and rapid tectonic subsidence on the complexly faulted basin margin during the second order transgressive system tract of the basin. The field area stretches along a 55 km strike oblique transect from a southern fault block that was inundated in clastic sediment after the Pinkerton Trail carbonate deposition, to a northern block which continued to have shallow water carbonate deposition into the Lower Desmoinesian Barker Creek interval. Stratigraphic sections were measured at four outcrops {{on the western side}} of US Highway 550 north of Durango, CO. Three were within 7 km of each other between Goulding Creek and Cascade Creek, and the fourth was 42 km north of the others near Molas Lake, north of the Snowden fault (Spoelhof, 1974). In the three downdip locations, three carbonate-dominated sequences bounded by thin clastic fluvial packages were found. The clastic packages were topped by 10 - 15 cm thick <b>anthracitic</b> <b>coals</b> and rooted zones indicating subaerial exposure. Above the coals, one to two centimeter thick black shales with brachiopods mark knife-sharp flooding surfaces overlain by subtidal spiculitic wackestones, consistent with a transgressive system tract signature. The lower sequences at the Molas Pass location were also dominated by subtidal spiculitic wackestones, however this location contains more parasequences and shallower, photic zone carbonates with stromatolites, phylloid algae, and Chaetetes. The facies variation between the three down dip locations and the shallower water facies of the Molas Pass area is likely due to its location on a higher fault block on the eastern shelf of the Paradox Basin near the uplifted Grenadier block (Spoelhof, 1976) ...|$|E
40|$|Although CO 2 -enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) {{recovery}} {{has been}} comprehensively investigated, {{the impact of}} coal matrix-fracture interactions {{on the evolution of}} coal permeability under in-situ conditions is still unclear. In prior studies on this issue, the influences of coal matrix-fracture interactions have not rigorously coupled with the binary gas transport system. In this work, general porosity and permeability models are developed to explicitly quantify the interactions between binary mixtures (CO 2 and CH 4) and dual solid media (coal matrix and fracture) under the full spectrum of mechanical conditions spanning prescribed in-situ stresses through constrained displacement. These models are implemented into a fully coupled finite element (FE) model of coal deformation, binary gas flow and transport in the matrix system, and binary gas flow and transport in the fracture system. The FE model represents important non-linear responses due to the effective stress effects that cannot be recovered where mechanical influences are not rigorously coupled with the binary gas transport system. The FE model is applied to simulate the results of a single well injection micro-pilot test performed in the <b>anthracitic</b> <b>coals</b> of the South Qinshui basin, Shanxi Province, China. The modeled CH 4 production rates are in good agreement with the observed production history. In addition to this agreement, model results also demonstrate (1) CO 2 injection increases the total pressure gradients; (2) as the CO 2 injection progresses the partial CO 2 pressure increases while the partial CH 4 pressure decreases; (3) without CO 2 injection the CH 4 content at a specific point decreases almost linearly while with the CO 2 injection the CH 4 content at a specific point decreases exponentially; (4) without CO 2 injection the CH 4 production rate decreases linearly while with CO 2 injection the CH 4 production rate increases dramatically; (5) without CO 2 injection coal permeability increases almost linearly while with CO 2 injection coal permeability decreases near exponentially; (6) CO 2 injection enhances cumulative CH 4 production and the enhancement is proportional to the injection pressure; and (7) cumulative CO 2 injection volume is also proportional to the injection pressure...|$|E

For the reaction geometry used in this investigation the reduction rates of graphite and coke are observed to be faster than with coal chars. This unexpected finding is shown to be associated with differences in the dominant chemical and mass transfer mechanisms occurring at the reaction interface.

Manufacturers are looking at opportunities to increase their coal selection options by using higher proportions of technically challenging lower volatile matter content coals; this paper investigates the kinetics, devolatilisation and burnout of these in granulated coal blends using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a drop tube furnace (DTF). The char residue from the semi-anthracitic low volatile coal selected for this blending investigation had a much reduced reactivity at higher conversions which affected the blends in different ways. Burnout of the blends with the low volatile bituminous coals was improved by fragmentation of the granulated particles, but at longer residence times the lower reactivity of the more structurally ordered carbon in the semi <b>anthracitic</b> <b>coal</b> dominated. In contrast, the higher volatile coals showed improvements at low residence times corresponding to rapid volatile loss, but also showed non-additive blend improvement at longer residence times which may be explained by the more obvious presence of included minerals and the higher K/Al ratios associated with illite mineral phases known to improve burnout...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThe Kalahari Karoo Basin is one {{of several}} basins in {{southern}} Africa filled with Late Carboniferous to Jurassic sediments that are primary targets for Permian aged coal. In order to determine the Coalbed Methane (CBM) potential of the Central Kalahari Karoo Basin, 9 exploration boreholes were drilled. Vitrinite reflectance (%Ro) and proximate analysis were conducted on cored coal intervals. Passey’s ΔLogR method used in this thesis employs the use of resistivity and porosity logs to identify and quantify total organic carbon (%TOC) in potential source rocks. Compared with lab measured %Fixed Carbon, the results showed that Passey’s ΔLogR method effectively identifies coal intervals as organic enriched. In terms of %TOC calculations, the method works poorly in coal metamorphosed by dolerite intrusions. These heat affected coal samples display %Ro from 0. 77 % to 5. 53 % and were increased in rank from primarily sub-bituminous to higher ranking volatile bituminous and finally to <b>anthracitic</b> <b>coal.</b> Their higher level of organic metamorphism (LOM), accompanying compositional changes and increased density associated with accelerated coal rank seem to have hindered the method in its estimations or lack thereof. Compositional changes in the coal were controlled by proximity to sill intrusion, with a decrease in fixed carbon and volatile matter, and increases in ash and moisture in the contact metamorphism zone (2 - 12 m from sill). In heat unaltered coal that has undergone normal burial maturation characterized by %Ro of 0. 44 % to 0. 65 %, the method works very well even attaining accuracy in some samples. In unintruded boreholes CH 1 and CH 6, correlations between fixed carbon and generated %TOC curves indicate strong relationships with R 2 from 0. 70 to 0. 83. Therefore, it was found that Passey’s ΔLogR method can be applied effectively on coal that has undergone normal burial maturation only...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{injection}} into coal layers {{serves the}} dual purpose to enhance coal bed methane production (ECBM) and to store CO 2. The efficiency {{of this process}} is expected to be much higher if water is the non-wetting phase in the coal-water-gas system. Therefore, carbon dioxide contact angles in two coal-water-CO 2 systems have been measured. The captive bubble technique was used within a pressure range from atmospheric pressure and 140 bar at a constant temperature of 45 ° C. Two sets of measurements have been performed, one on a polished semi-anthracite, the second set on a polished high volatile bituminous B coal sample. For the anthracite the following observations have been made. At atmospheric pressure, the contact angle of a CO 2 droplet increases with time, but stays below 90 °. At higher pressures (> 3 bar) the contact angle increases beyond 90 °. This shows that the semi-anthracite coal sample behaves CO 2 -wet at system pressures above 3 bar. CO 2 contact angles on the bituminous coal sample show a different behavior. In the pressures range from atmospheric to 85 bar, CO 2 contact angles are independent of pressure and exhibit values of around 85 °. At pressures beyond 100 bar, the coal surface becomes CO 2 wet. The bituminous coal sample is water wet up to much higher pressures than the anthracite. This behavior is related to the difference in stability of the water film between the coal surface and the CO 2. The hydrophobicity of coal increases with rank due to a loss of functional groups which are responsible for hydrogen bonds between coal molecules and water. For the relevant pressures during CO 2 storage, the <b>anthracitic</b> <b>coal</b> behaves CO 2 -wet, whereas in bituminous coal the injection pressure has to exceed a pressure of 100 bar in order to wet the coal surface. It can be concluded that the efficiency of carbon dioxide injection and retention in coal strongly depends on surface properties of the prevailing coal...|$|R
40|$|Four Upper Carboniferous limnic coal basins in the Cantabrian {{mountains}} are described. In the coal measures, which {{are known as}} the Cea formation and unconformably overlie the Older Palaeozoic, two sedimentary cycles are recognised. Accordingly, the unconformable sequence is subdivided into two members. The lower one, the Carrión member, starts with quartzite conglomerates and becomes gradually finer grained upwards. It yields <b>anthracitic</b> <b>coal</b> and upper Westphalian D floras. Its maximum thickness is 1200 m. The upper one, the Prado member, begins with limestone conglomerates and also grades to finer sediments upwards. It contains dry to fat coals and Stephanian A to B floras. Its maximum compiled thickness may be approximately 2500 m but a complete section is not found anywhere. The Cea formation shows onlap onto the Older Palaeozoic towards the west. The predominant structural trend in the Cea formation in the described area is east-west. A few structures with north-south axes were recognised in the Valderrueda and Ocejo basins. They {{are thought to have}} originated from differential compaction and to be the earliest structures of the Cea formation. The east-west structures are dominated by wide, asymmetric synclines, separated by narrow zones of disturbance instead of anticlines. They have originated as a secondary effect of block faulting in the underlying Older Palaeozoic formations. In the history of the Cea formation large east-west trending fundamental faults (terminology from de Sitter, 1956), probably separating basement blocks, play a dominant role in the deposition {{as well as in the}} deformation of the Cea rocks. Activity along these large east-west faults in the Older Palaeozoic rocks is proved to have continued intermittently from the upper Westphalian (and earlier, Rupke, 1965) to the middle Tertiary. Thus the deformation of the Cea deposits, which is dependent on the movement along these faults, must have been a long-lasting process and not a short-lived event like, for instance, the Permian Saalic phase, as was formerly believed...|$|R

The No. 11 Coal has high contents of vein ankerite (10. 2 vol. %) and vein quartz (11. 4 vol. %), with formation temperatures of 85 and 180 °C, respectively, indicating that vein ankerite and vein quartz were derived from low-temperature calcic and siliceous hydrothermal fluids in two epigenetic episodes. The vein quartz appears to have formed earlier than vein ankerite did, and at least three distinct stages of ankerite formation with different Ca/Sr and Fe/Mn ratios were observed. The two types of mineral veins are sources of different suites of major and trace metals. Scanning electron microscope and sequential extraction studies show that, in addition to Fe, Mg, and Ca, vein ankerite is the dominant source of Mn, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the coal, and the contents of these five elements are as high as 0. 09 % and 74. 0, 33. 6, 185, and 289 μg/g, respectively. In contrast, vein quartz is the main carrier mineral for platinum-group elements (PGEs) Pd, Pt, and Ir in the coal, and the contents of Pd, Pt, and Ir are 1. 57, 0. 15, and 0. 007 μg/g, respectively. Sequential extraction showed a high PGE content in the silicate fraction, up to 10. 4 μg/g Pd, 1. 23 μg/g Pt, and 0. 05 μg/g Ir, respectively. It is concluded that the formation of ankerite and quartz and the anomalous enrichment of trace elements in the No. 11 Coal in the Dafang Coalfield, Guizhou, result from the influx of calcic and siliceous low-temperature hydrothermal fluids. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (MIng (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009 The {{growth in}} coal {{consumption}} worldwide {{as well as}} the high oil prices in the recent past has led to the current increased interest in the application of coal gasification technologies. The Sasoi-Lurgi Fixed Bed Dry Bottom (S-L FBDB) gasification technology is one such technology that has the biggest market share in the world and maintains its competitive edge particularly with regard to gasification of low grade and low rank coal. To ensure sustained competitive advantage through technology development, {{it is important to understand}} the fundamentals of the process {{as well as the}} behaviour of coals of different rank in the reactor. The main objective of this study was to investigate the fuel bed behaviour as well as coal properties transformational behaviour in a S-L FBDB gasifier that gasifies North Dakota (NO) lignite. It was hypothesised in this study that using the FBDB gasifier sampling methodologies available in the literature, with some modifications to suit the context of this study, can help to explain the fuel bed behaviour as well as the coal properties transformational behaviour during gasification of lignite in the S-L FBDB process. To test the hypothesis and to achieve the objectives of the study, two MK IV S-L FBDB gasifiers (i. e. "Albert" and "Bernice") operating at the Great Plains Synfuels Plant of the Dakota Gasification Company (DGC) in the United States of America (USA) were sampled using the Turn-Out method developed by Bunt (2006) and modified in this study to suit lignite. The samples were characterised for their chemical, physical, petrographic and mineralogical properties which were then interpreted in terms of their transformation in the various reaction zones of the gasifiers. The different reaction zones In the "Bernice" and "Albert" gasifiers were successfully identified using chemical analyses (i. e. proximate and ultimate analyses as well as Fischer tar yields). Identification of reaction zones in the S-L FBDB gasifiers operating on lignite is a first in the history of the process. In comparing Secunda GG 41 gasifier operating on bituminous coal with the DGC "Bernice" and "Albert" gasifiers operating on lignite, the reaction zones were found to be very different due to, amongst other things, the different operating philosophy, stability and coal rank. About two thirds of the reactor volume, in the case of DGC "Bernice" and "Albert" gasifiers, was found to be drying and devolatilizing the coal, leaving only about a third of the reactor volume for gasification and combustion. Nonetheless, due to the high reactivity of the lignite, more than 98 % of the char/fixed carbon was consumed within a third of the re•maining gasifier volume and this is a significant new finding. The fact that the entire reactor volume was utilized for drying, devolatilization, gasification and combustion with carbon conversion of > 98 %, makes the S-L FBDB gasifier very suitable for lignite gasification. In line with the Secunda GG 41 gasifier, clear overlaps between the reaction zones were observed in the "Bernice" and "Albert" gasifiers. This therefore confirms the gradual transition from one reaction zone to another as reported in the literature. The volatile matter in the ash from both the "Bernice" and "Albert" gasifiers was about 10 % (dry basis). This volatile matter is most probably inorganic in nature given the presence, in the samples obtained from the ash bed, of calcite (CaCO 3), gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O) and melanterite (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) which are expected to decompose during volatile matter determination at 900 °C. Using only •the volatile matter, as determined by proximate analyses, to determine the pyrolysis zone position in the reactor will in the case of DGC gasifiers therefore be delusive. As expected, most of the H, N and S were released in the pyrolysis zone of both the "Albert" and "Bernice" gasifiers. A significant increase in the reactivity of the chars from both the "Bernice" and "Albert" gasifiers was observed in the gasification zones. It is due to this increased reactivity that the char/carbon in these gasifiers were consumed,within only a third of the gasifier volume. The increased reactivity is most probably due to the catalytic reactions effected by the organically bound alkali and alkaline earth metals, particularly calcium as the coal was found to be rich in this element. Thermal fragmentation was found to be severe with the NO lignite tested. The feed coal was found to decrease in size from 3 % in the feed to 90 % of < 6. 3 mm fine particles in the drying and pyrolysis zones of both the "Albert" and "Bernice" gasifiers. This is also a new significant finding in the history of the SL FBDB gasification process which is traditionally known to operate on coarse coal. Mineral matter in the feed coal to the "Bernice" gasifier was mainly dominated by the organically bound calcium. The crystalline phases in the gasification and combustion zones were dominated by gehlenite and bredigite which may have formed from the transformation, at higher temperatures, of the organically bound Ca and Mg to GaO and MgO and subsequent interaction with the reactive silica and transformation products of the clays. In the "Bernice" gasifier, a significant amount of calcite was found to be forming in the beginning of the gasification zone, towards the end of pyrolysis, and decomposing slightly in the hotter combustion zone. It is suggested that the calcite was formed from the reaction of GaO (formed from the transformation of the organically bound Ca) with the CO 2 from the raw gas in the gasifier. As expected, the glass phase was found to be the major part of the ash minerals in the gasification and combustion zones of the "Bernice" gasifier. This phase was composed mainly of the Ca, Mg, Na aluminosilicates with some Fe. This composition is common to the slag formed from the Fort Union lignite. There was therefore a significant amount of melting in the hotter reaction zones (i. e. gasification and combustion zones) of these gasifiers. The organically bound Ca, Mg and Na seemed to have played a significant role in the formation of this glass phase in the gasifiers. Oxygen scavenging by the ash minerals in the combustion and gasification zones of both "Albert" and "Bernice" gasifiers was observed. In the "Bernice" gasifier, it was estimated at about 16 % of the oxygen fed as agent to the gasifier. From an economic viewpoint this is significant given the high cost of producing the 99 % pure oxygen for gasification. The AFT in the feed coal to both "Albert" and "Bernice" gasifiers was found to be higher as compared to the ash samples from the ash bed. This may have implications on the design and operating philosophy since the gasifiers are normally designed to operate between the initial deformation and flow temperatures of the ASTM ash, which is not the same as the ash formed in the gasifier. This is also another new significant finding. The high concentration of the fluxing elements (i. e. Ca, Mg, Na and Fe) in the dominating glass phase determined in the gasification and combustion zones of these gasifiers was most probably the reason behind this phenomenon. The char particles formed in both "Bernice" and "Albert" gasifiers were, as determined petrographically, mainly dominated by the dense chars which were highly reactive. An induced "coalification" process was observed in both "Bernice" and "Albert" gasifiers with the macerals/char particles being transformed from lignite to bituminous and <b>anthracitic</b> <b>coal</b> particles. In the "Bernice" gasifier, the average temperature of solids in the combustion zone was found to be about 700 °C, peaking at 11 00 °C in the combustion zone. The average temperature is in line with the predicted figures (i. e. 741 °C for the predicted temperature at which the water gas shift reaction was forced into equilibrium). Overall, there was an excellent match in the trends of the chemical, physical, petrographic and mineralogical properties of the samples obtained at different levels of the "Albert" and "Bernice" gasifiers. This may therefore confirm plug flow during the Turn-Out sampling methodology and hence supports the hypothesis of this study. It is hoped that the results obtained in this study will not only benefit Sasol or Sasoi-Lurgi Technology Company with regard. to the understanding of the reactors and improvement in modelling and design, but will also assist DGC in further optimising their lignite gasification process.
