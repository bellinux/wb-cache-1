5|$|Born in Oldham, Lancashire, {{the son of}} a musician, Walton was a chorister {{and then}} an {{undergraduate}} at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as <b>a</b> <b>modernist,</b> but later became a popular ballet score.|$|E

The winning entry, the neo-Gothic Tribune Tower, was built in 1925. Saarinen's entry came in second place yet became influential in the design of a number of future buildings.|$|E

5|$|Several {{stations}} were rebuilt in <b>a</b> <b>Modernist</b> style influenced or designed by Charles Holden, who {{was inspired by}} examples of Modernist architecture in mainland Europe. This influence {{can be seen in}} the bold vertical and horizontal forms, which were combined with the use of traditional materials like brick. Holden called them 'brick boxes with concrete lids'. Today, several of these Holden-designed stations are listed buildings, including the prototype Sudbury Town listed as Grade II*.|$|E
5|$|Still, {{the centre}} hosts some {{examples}} of modern architecture {{dating back to the}} Communist era. The Hungarian Theatre building was erected {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, but underwent an avant-garde renovation in 1961, when it acquired <b>a</b> <b>modernist</b> style of architecture. Another example of modernist architectural art is Palatul Telefoanelor, situated in the vicinity of Mihai Viteazul Square, an area that also features a complex of large apartment buildings.|$|E
5|$|The first crest {{to appear}} on a Partick Thistle kit was a thistle design, and every logo since has {{featured}} a thistle. The thistle appeared first in 1902, then again in 1909. It remained until 1978, when a new logo with the thistle housed inside a roundel was used. <b>A</b> <b>modernist</b> logo with the thistle on a rectangle was introduced in 1990, and the current crest was introduced in 2008.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>modernist</b> painter, Bellette was {{influential}} in mid-twentieth century Sydney art circles. She frequently painted scenes {{influenced by the}} Greek tragedies of Euripides and Sophocles and the epics of Homer. The only woman to have won the Sulman Prize more than once, Bellette claimed the accolade in 1942 with For Whom the Bell Tolls, and in 1944 with Iphigenia in Tauris. She helped found the Blake Prize for Religious Art, and was its inaugural judge. Bellette married artist and critic Paul Haefliger in 1935. The couple moved to Majorca in 1957; although she visited and exhibited in Australia thereafter, she did not return there to live, and became peripheral to the Australian art scene.|$|E
5|$|Built in <b>a</b> <b>modernist</b> style, the {{building}} {{has been the subject}} of vigorous public debate about its heritage value. Some parties, such as the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, consider {{the building}} to be an important example of modernist architecture in the city, whilst others consider it ugly. These conflicting views led to animosity in the 1990s, when the State Government refused to heritage list the property, and instead recommended its demolition. Despite this, the City of Perth opted to renovate the tower and keep it as its headquarters. Following this, the building was admitted to the State's Heritage Register.|$|E
5|$|Comments about Heliade and his Bucharest statue feature {{prominently}} in Macedonski's short story Nicu Dereanu, whose main character, a daydreaming Bohemian, idolizes the Wallachian writer. Sburătorul, <b>a</b> <b>modernist</b> literary magazine of the interwar period, edited by Eugen Lovinescu, owed {{its name to}} Zburătorul, making use of an antiquated variant of the name (a form favored by Heliade). During the same years, Camil Petrescu made reference to Heliade in his novel Un om între oameni, which depicts events from Nicolae Bălcescu's lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Constance Stokes (née Parkin, 22 February 1906 – 14 July 1991) was <b>a</b> <b>modernist</b> Australian {{painter who}} worked in Victoria. She trained at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School until 1929, winning a {{scholarship}} to continue her study at London's Royal Academy of Arts. Although Stokes painted few works in the 1930s, her paintings and drawings were exhibited from the 1940s onwards. She {{was one of only}} two women, and two Victorians, included in a major exhibition of twelve Australian artists that travelled to Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 Tange and the {{architectural}} journalist and critic Noboru Kawazoe {{were invited to}} attend {{the reconstruction of the}} Ise Shrine. The shrine has been reconstructed every 20years and in 1953 it was the 59th iteration. Normally the reconstruction process was a very closed affair but this time the ceremony was opened to architects and journalists to document the event. The ceremony coincided {{with the end of the}} American Occupation and it seemed to symbolise a new start in Japanese architecture. In 1965 when Tange and Kawazoe published the book Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture, he likened the building to <b>a</b> <b>modernist</b> structure: an honest expression of materials, a functional design and prefabricated elements.|$|E
5|$|In middle age, Walton left Britain {{and set up}} {{home with}} his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be {{regarded}} as <b>a</b> <b>modernist,</b> and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics {{at the time of their}} premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works.|$|E

5|$|While Lazzell is most {{well known}} for her white-line woodcuts, she also created ceramics, hooked rugs, paintings, and gouache studies. The {{subjects}} of her paintings and prints included landscape scenery and harbor scenes in Provincetown as well as flowers and still lifes. These and her abstract works incorporated elements of both Synthetic and Analytic cubism and frequently comprised arrangements of vibrantly colored geometric shapes. She was among the earliest women artists in the United States to work in <b>a</b> <b>modernist</b> style.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson, {{alongside}} Edward Elgar and H.G. Wells represented British {{culture at}} the celebrations of {{the first anniversary of}} the Republic of Czechoslovakia in Prague in 1919. Nevinson first visited New York in May 1919 and spent a month there while his World War One prints were being shown, to great acclaim, at the Frederick Keppel & Co gallery. A second exhibition at the same venue in October 1920 was poorly received. This led to Nevinson becoming disillusioned with New York, to the extent he changed the name of his painting New York-an abstraction to The Soul of the Soulless City. Nevinson claimed to have been the first artist to depict New York in <b>a</b> <b>modernist</b> style but in fact several British avant-garde artists had painted in the city before World War One. In May 1919, while Nevinson was in America, Kathleen Nevinson gave birth to a baby son, but the child died shortly later and before his father could return to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Rommel was {{an ambitious}} {{man who took}} {{advantage}} of his proximity to Hitler and willingly accepted the propaganda campaigns designed for him by Goebbels. He sought {{to level the playing}} field for non-nobles, and also supported militarism and a strong German Empire, while treating people only according to their merits. He did not display hatred to people of noble descent, and in fact was a throwback to the medieval knight in his personal traits, appearing well-versed in the ancient customs of chivalry, which helped to attract admiration from the British who saw in him a romantic archetype. Rommel classed himself as a traditionalist regarding military ethics and <b>a</b> <b>modernist</b> regarding warfare techniques. Certain authors remark that he also sought military glory and personal recognition, most of all from Hitler on whom, according to Watson, Rommel projected his idea of the German people's will.|$|E

5|$|The church {{featured}} ample {{exterior and}} interior decoration. While the facades were decorated with arches and ceramic tiles, the interior floor mosaics were made of white, yellow and pink marble as well as semi-precious gemstones like sapphire and porphyry. The interior walls were covered with frescoes and mosaics. However, none of the interior decoration has survived. During the church's 20th-century reconstruction, its interior was repainted by artist Teofan Sokerov, who depicted important moments of medieval Bulgarian history in <b>a</b> <b>modernist</b> style. Due to these murals, the church has never been reconsecrated and remains inactive. The facade of the cathedral also includes a stone with a donor's inscription of a Bulgarian ruler, which ended up {{as part of the}} building material.|$|E
