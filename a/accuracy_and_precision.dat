5|$|A bicycle kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. The performer needs to maintain good form when executing the move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>precision</b> when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, {{one of the}} sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 career goals.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of ancient Egypt includes {{some of the}} most famous structures in the world: the Great Pyramids of Giza and the temples at Thebes. Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes, but also to reinforce the wide-ranging power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders; using only simple but effective tools and sighting instruments, architects could build large stone structures with great <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>precision</b> that is still envied today.|$|E
5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>precision</b> found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E

25|$|In the {{physical}} sciences, most physical constants {{such as the}} universal gravitational constant, and physical variables, such as position, mass, speed, and electric charge, are modeled using real numbers. In fact, the fundamental physical theories such as classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, general relativity and the standard model are described using mathematical structures, typically smooth manifolds or Hilbert spaces, {{that are based on}} the real numbers, although actual measurements of physical quantities are of finite <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>precision.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{utility of}} a model will be given, at least in part, by the degree of <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>precision</b> of the model. An {{accurate}} model with relatively poor precision could be useful to study the evolutionary relationships between the structures {{of a set of}} proteins, whereas the rational drug design requires both precise and accurate models. A model that is not accurate, regardless of the degree of precision with which it was obtained will not be very useful.|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to determine, in a {{clinical}} context, the <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> the <b>precision</b> of all activity quantification methods {{in order to develop}} a reliable 177 Lu-DOTATATE dosimetry. The first objective was to determine the most adequate parameters for 177 Lu activity measurement with the radionuclide calibrator, the well counter and the SPECT/CT camera used in clinical routine. The second objective was to determine a calibration factor (CF) to convert counts to becquerels for each device. Finally, dedicated quality control steps were developed to evaluate the <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> the <b>precision</b> of the established CFs for the chosen measurement parameters with respect to manufacturer maintenance, time, and range of activities.|$|R

25|$|Although {{technology}} such as electronics have improved, {{optical equipment}} such as rangefinders and ballistic calculators have eliminated manual mathematical calculations to determine elevation and windage, the fundamentals of accurate and precise long-range shooting {{are the same as}} throughout the history of shooting, and the skill and training of the shooter and his spotter where applicable are the primary factors. <b>Accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>precision</b> of ammunition and firearms are also still reliant primarily on human factors and attention to detail in the complex process of producing maximum performance.|$|E
25|$|The offline combustion/reduction has {{the highest}} <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>precision</b> for {{hydrogen}} isotope measurement without limits for sample types. The analytical uncertainty is typically 1~2‰ in δD. Thus it is still being used today when highest levels of precision are required. However, the offline preparation procedure is very time-consuming and complicated. It also requires large sample size (several 102 mg). Thus the online preparation based on combustion/reduction coupled with the subsequent continuous flow-IRMS (CF-IRMS) system has been more commonly used nowadays. Chromium reduction or high temperature conversion are the dominant online preparation methods {{for the detection of}} hydrogen isotope by IRMS.|$|E
40|$|Besides the {{development}} of sample preparation methods for the determination of separate liposomal-encapsulated prednisolone phosphate and non-encapsulated prednisolone concentrations in murine plasma and blood, this article also presents the first description of an accurate sample preparation method for the determination of such separate concentrations in the murine liver. The quantitative differentiation {{is based on the}} immediate hydrolysis of prednisolone phosphate (PP) into prednisolone (P) after its release from the liposomes in vivo: PP represents the encapsulated drug, while P represents the non-encapsulated drug. The use of 10 [*]ml methanol/g tissue during homogenization of liver tissue ensures complete liposome rupture, prevention of the dephosphorylation of PP released during homogenization, sufficient clean supernatants, excellent extraction of P and sufficient extraction of PP <b>and</b> excellent <b>accuracies</b> <b>and</b> <b>precision</b> complying with the internal guidelines for pre-clinical studies (80 - 120 % and maximal 20 %, respectively). Similarly, the matching sample preparation methods for plasma and blood involve protein precipitation with four equivalents of methanol also ensuring <b>accuracies</b> <b>and</b> <b>precision</b> complying with the internal guidelines for pre-clinical studies. Application of these sample preparation methods is going to generate the first pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a liposomal preparation, in which the encapsulated and non-encapsulated drug concentrations in a tissue are measured separately. Such separated concentration profiles can gain important insights into the PKs of liposomal PP and probably also with regard to liposomal formulations in general, like the quantification of the in vivo drug release from the liposomes...|$|R

25|$|Put simply, ion {{suppression}} {{describes the}} {{adverse effect on}} detector response due to reduced ionisation efficiency for analyte(s) of interest, resulting from the presence of species in the sample matrix which compete for ionisation, or inhibit efficient ionisation in other ways. Use of MS/MS {{as a means of}} detection may give the impression that there are no interfering species present, since no chromatographic impurities are detected. However, species which are not isobaric may still have an adverse effect on the sensitivity, <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>precision</b> of the assay owing to suppression of the ionisation of the analyte of interest.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{sensitivity}} of the electrodes to contaminants, cleanliness of the probes is essential for <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>precision.</b> Probes are generally kept moist when not in use with a medium appropriate for the particular probe, which is typically an aqueous solution available from probe manufacturers.
