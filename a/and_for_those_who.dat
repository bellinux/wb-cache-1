5|$|In {{a meeting}} near Bologna in October 43BC, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus formed a junta called the Second Triumvirate.

5|$|On the {{weekends}} of 9–10 November 2013 and 8–9 February 2014 all voting stations were opened for new voters to register <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> moved residence to re-register {{in their new}} voting district. The presidency of South Africa urged voters who had missed the voting station registration weekends to register at an IEC office during office hours. Presidential spokesperson, Mac Maharaj, said that voters were allowed to register to vote until the election date is published in a government gazette, after which the voters' roll is closed. Approximately 5.5 million people in total visited voting stations, including between 1 and 2 million new voters. This {{increased the number of}} registered voters to 25.3 million, representing 80.5% of the 31.4 million people eligible to vote in the country. South Africans who were born after the 1994 general election, known as the born-free generation, and are aged 18 or older were eligible to vote for the first time.|$|E

25|$|Since that time, {{ventilation}} {{and other}} measures {{have been used to}} reduce radon levels in most affected mines that continue to operate.

25|$|According to folklore, notably {{celebrated by}} a statue {{in front of}} the town hall, the city got its name from a legend about a giant called Antigoon who lived near the Scheldt river. He exacted a toll from passing boatmen, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> refused, he severed one of their hands and threw it into the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. Hence the name Antwerpen, from Dutch hand werpen, akin to Old English hand and wearpan (to throw), which has evolved to today's warp.|$|E

Marriages are arranged. The preferred minimum age is 22 for males and 18 for females, though these ages are increasing as of 2003. Cremation of the dead is the norm, burial being the exception for children <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have died of snake bites.

25|$|Riker and Ordeshook {{developed}} the modern understanding of D. They listed five major forms of gratification that people receive for voting: {{complying with the}} social obligation to vote; affirming one's allegiance to the political system; affirming a partisan preference (also known as expressive voting, or voting for a candidate to express support, not to achieve any outcome); affirming one's importance to the political system; <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> find politics interesting and entertaining, researching and making a decision. Other political scientists have since added other motivators and questioned some of Riker and Ordeshook's assumptions. All of these concepts are inherently imprecise, {{making it difficult to}} discover exactly why people choose to vote.|$|E
25|$|Already {{during the}} Civil War Caylà was commemorated in a hagiographical booklet {{published}} in 1938, presenting him as {{champion of the}} Catholic, national and anti-bolshevik cause. Following the nationalist conquest of Catalonia in 1939 Caylà and other executed or fallen vallencs were re-buried in the newly constructed Panteó dels Mártirs on the Valls cemetery. A street in the old town was named after him and it remains so until today. In the 1940s Caylà remained a hero of the Tarragona Carlists, serving {{as a role model}} for the branch opposing Francoism <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> chose to side with the regime, supporting the claim of self-styled claimant Carlos VIII.

25|$|The divers Cubist {{considerations}} manifested {{prior to}} World War I—such as the fourth dimension, dynamism of modern life, and Henri Bergson's concept of duration—had now {{been replaced by}} a formal reference frame which constituted the second phase of Cubism, based upon an elementary set of principles that formed a cohesive Cubist aesthetic. This clarity and sense of order spread to almost all of the artists exhibiting at Léonce Rosenberg's gallery—including Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris, Jacques Lipchitz, Henry Laurens, Auguste Herbin, Joseph Csaky, Gino Severini and Pablo Picasso—leading to the descriptive term 'Crystal Cubism', coined by Maurice Raynal, an early promoter of Cubism and continuous supporter during the war and post-war phase that followed. Raynal had been associated with Cubists since 1910 via the milieu of Le Bateau-Lavoir. Raynal, who would become one of the Cubists most authoritative and articulate proponents, endorsed a wide range of Cubist activity <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> produced it, but his highest esteem was directed toward two artists: Jean Metzinger, whose artistry Raynal equated with Renoir and who was 'perhaps the man who, in our epoch, knows best how to paint'. The other was Juan Gris, who was 'certainly the fiercest of the purists in the group'.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} winter made life more {{difficult}} for the insurgents hiding in the mountains. Moreover, since October, the financial situation had been worrisome. In order to sustain the insurgents’ war effort, Venizelos had to take out loans. Thus, he borrowed 100,000 francs in obligations of 5 francs each in Greece. October also saw the first defections. Rebel bands from around Sitia laid down their arms and were granted an amnesty. In mid-October, Venizelos and his comrades recognised that {{it would be difficult to}} maintain the revolt, all the more so as the latest military operations had been directly aimed at them, notably by the Russians. They gave notice that they were ready to entrust the island's fate to the Great Powers. Venizelos participated in new negotiations with the consuls, seeking to obtain a maximum of concessions regarding the island's internal affairs. In a letter addressed to the Great Powers, he stated his intention to lay down arms in exchange for honourable conditions. Most of the insurgents were ready to hand over their weapons <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> refused to lay down arms, it was proposed that they be transported to Greece without being disarmed. In exchange for 800 guns and the same number of cartridges, an amnesty would be possible for the insurgents, except for the gendarmes who had deserted. With these conditions, Venizelos accepted surrender. Several days later, he obtained the right to have the deserting gendarmes transported to Greece. On 25 November, the Theriso camp was broken up and an amnesty proclaimed.|$|E

500|$|In 1217 the Charter of the Forest was passed, {{in part to}} {{mitigate}} the worst excesses of royal jurisdiction.
