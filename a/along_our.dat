25|$|In 1872 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{began to}} prepare new defenses. Between 1873 and 1875, four 15-inch Rodman guns and a {{magazine}} were partially constructed. Work ceased in 1875 when money {{was no longer}} available. In 1887, President Cleveland found a treasury surplus. Two years earlier, a Board of Engineers, presided over by Secretary of War William C. Endicott, recommended {{a new system of}} seacoast defense that employed heavy steel breech-loading rifled guns, large mortars, rapid fire guns and underwater mines. The entire plan called for the installation of the new defenses at 27 sites <b>along</b> <b>our</b> coast and rivers.|$|E

2500|$|Binary {{stars are}} often {{detected}} optically, {{in which case}} they are called visual binaries. [...] Many visual binaries have long orbital periods of several centuries or millennia and therefore have orbits which are uncertain or poorly known. [...] They may also be detected by indirect techniques, such as spectroscopy (spectroscopic binaries) or astrometry (astrometric binaries). [...] If a binary star happens to orbit in a plane <b>along</b> <b>our</b> line of sight, its components will eclipse and transit each other; these pairs are called eclipsing binaries, or, as they are detected by their changes in brightness during eclipses and transits, photometric binaries.|$|E

Horton, {{who spent}} World War II working aboard a {{coastwise}} U.S. Merchant Marine barge, posthumously received official veteran’s status for her wartime service, {{becoming the first}} recorded female Merchant Marine veteran of World War II. [...] Sadie Horton was one of six from a single family serving on outdated barges to assist in moving bulk war materials to defense plants and coal to our power plants <b>along</b> <b>our</b> eastern coast. This was necessary due to our nation losing many ships to enemy U-boat action along the coast faster than they could be replaced.|$|E
2500|$|The bush raid was the {{beginning}} of a new Māori strategy that would drain Cameron's resources and halt his advance for another 14 weeks. On 22 July a group of about 40 Māori fatally shot a settler cutting timber at Pukekiwiriki near Papakura and were pursued into the forest by the Auckland militia. Seven Maori were killed. When two more settlers were killed at isolated farms near Drury on 24 July, the government formed a special corps of bush fighters named the [...] "Forest Rangers", who began a series of bush reconnaissance missions and pursuits of armed Māori bands. Cameron wrote: [...] "The bush is now so infested with these natives that I have been obliged to establish strong posts <b>along</b> <b>our</b> line of communication, which absorbs so large a portion of the force that until I receive reinforcements it is impossible for me to advance further up the Waikato." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{expedition}} left Ovalau on 6 October 1859 {{and sailed}} west around {{the northern end}} of the main island of Viti Levu to Waya. During their passage to the island, Lieutenant Caldwell’s men heard many stories from towns and villages about the warriors of Waya. A letter was also received from the Wayan chiefs {{responsible for the deaths of}} the two American traders. The message said, “Do you suppose we have killed the two white men for nothing? No, we killed them and we have eaten them. We are great warriors, and we delight in war.” Caldwell later wrote, “...and woe to the members of any strange tribe that falls into their hands... to be clubbed to death and eaten is the only alternative for the captive. It is not a matter of surprise that the tribes <b>along</b> <b>our</b> route learned with feelings of satisfaction the nature of our expedition.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{his return}} home in February 1919 he stated, [...] "I {{have come from}} France more firmly {{convinced}} than ever that Negros should write Negro music. We have our own racial feeling and {{if we try to}} copy whites we will make bad copies... We won France by playing music which was ours and not a pale imitation of others, and if we are to develop in America we must develop <b>along</b> <b>our</b> own lines." [...] In 1919 Europe made more recordings for Pathé Records. These include both instrumentals and accompaniments with vocalist Noble Sissle who, with Eubie Blake, would later have great success with their 1921 production of Shuffle Along, which gives us the classic song [...] "I'm Just Wild About Harry". Differing in style from Europe's recordings of a few years earlier, they incorporate blues, blue notes, and early jazz influences (including a rather stiff cover record of the Original Dixieland Jass Band's [...] "Clarinet Marmalade").|$|E
2500|$|The poem {{begins on}} the night before Good Friday in the year 1300, [...] "halfway <b>along</b> <b>our</b> life's path" [...] (Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita). Dante is thirty-five years old, half of the biblical {{lifespan}} of 70 (Psalms 89:10, Vulgate), lost in a dark wood (understood as sin), assailed by beasts (a lion, a leopard, and a she-wolf) he cannot evade, and unable to find the [...] "straight way" [...] (diritta via)– also translatable as [...] "right way"– to salvation (symbolized by the sun behind the mountain). Conscious that he is ruining himself and that he is falling into a [...] "low place" [...] (basso loco) where the sun is silent (l sol tace), Dante is at last rescued by Virgil, {{and the two of them}} begin their journey to the underworld. Each sin's punishment in Inferno is a contrapasso, a symbolic instance of poetic justice; for example, in Canto XX, fortune-tellers and soothsayers must walk with their heads on backwards, unable to see what is ahead, because that was what they had tried to do in life: ...|$|E
