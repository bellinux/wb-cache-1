The right arm has {{probably}} been eaten too, though it could be folded in front of the body and held in place by Saturn's thumbs. The titan is on the point of taking <b>another</b> <b>bite</b> from the left arm; as he looms from the darkness, his mouth gapes and his eyes bulge whitely. The only other brightness in the picture comes from the white flesh, the red blood of the corpse, the white knuckles of Saturn as he digs his fingers {{into the back of the}} body. There is evidence that the picture may have originally portrayed the titan with a partially erect penis, but, if ever present, this addition was lost due to the deterioration of the mural over time or during the transfer to canvas; in the picture today the area around his groin is indistinct. It may even have been overpainted deliberately before the picture was put on public display.|$|E

6000|$|The {{last ten}} miles of our journey now lay before us; {{and we sat}} down, before starting, to have <b>another</b> <b>bite</b> of bread and a pull at the rum bottle; after which, we trudged along in silence.

50|$|After {{traveling}} through several states, the skiptracer {{catches up to}} the pair and captures Diana. A chase ensues; she knocks him unconscious, and Sandy rams his van off the road. When Sandy's rental car gets plowed and totaled by an oncoming semi, they take the skiptracer's van, with him {{tied up in the}} back. When it overheats, they continue on foot through a forest. Sandy discards his pants when he finds a snake in them, and Diana accidentally knocks him unconscious when <b>another</b> <b>bites</b> his neck. Sandy wakes at a bus station, and Diana says she carried him until she flagged down a truck. As the next bus to Denver leaves in three days, Sandy uses money hidden in his socks to buy a $200 car from an auto wrecking yard.

Meanwhile, Marisol shoots the skiptracer, and the criminals continue their pursuit of Sandy and Diana.|$|R
50|$|In a {{study by}} Baub et al. (1994) of the case {{histories}} of 32 patients bitten by this species and {{admitted to the hospital}} in Catanduva, São Paulo, Brazil, all developed local pain and swelling. Furthermore, in 97% of all cases the blood clotting time was prolonged (more than 12 minutes), 41% had bleeding (usually from the gums), 32% had local blistering and 9% had necrosis. In all cases, specific antivenin was used and there were no deaths. These findings contrast with other reports involving much more tissue damage. Silva Jr. (1956) includes a description of a Brazilian patient with gangrene on the hand and forearm that required amputation, as well as <b>another</b> <b>bitten</b> four years previously who had scarring over the anterior tibial compartment. Abalos and Pirosky (1963) considered this species to be responsible for many {{of the total number of}} snakebite cases in Argentina and included a picture of a young boy, bitten below the knee, with the bare fibula and tibia exposed.|$|R
