25|$|Conscription was {{introduced}} in early 1939 to meet the threat of Nazi Germany, with the Military Training Act 1939. The Act required all men aged 20 and 21 to take six months' military training. On the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939, the National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939 was rushed through Parliament. This extended the liability to military service to <b>all</b> <b>fit</b> men between 20–23. The age group was increased as the war continued, ultimately applying to <b>all</b> <b>fit</b> men {{between the ages of}} 18–41.|$|E

25|$|Only {{with the}} {{creation}} of the Beveridge committee in 1941, and their subsequent findings in 1942, would the situation of skilled men not being assigned correctly, be addressed. The findings led directly {{to the creation of the}} General Service Corps, and would remain in place long after the war. Hore-Belisha had sought permission to introduce conscription in 1938 but was rebuffed by Neville Chamberlain, who would not agree to increased defence spending. In early 1939, he was finally allowed to introduce conscription to meet the threat of Germany, with the Military Training Act of 27 April 1939. The act required all men aged 20 and 21 to take six months military training. This act was extended on the declaration of the war, to include <b>all</b> <b>fit</b> men between the ages of 18 and 41. Conscription was gradually brought in, starting in October 1939 and applying to <b>all</b> <b>fit</b> men between 20–23, and the age group was increased as the war continued.|$|E
25|$|On 16 February 1943, the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO) {{organisation}} was created, {{requiring the}} call up of able-bodied French men {{to work in}} Germany. In the Reich, with so many men had been called up for service with the Wehrmacht and the very sexist Nazi regime reluctant to have German women work in factories as Hitler believed working damaged a woman's womb, so throughout the war the German state had a policy of bringing foreign workers to Germany to replace the men serving in the Wehrmacht. Reports had reached France (which were true) that at the Dora works near the Buchenwald concentration camp, about 10,000 slave workers, mostly French and Russian, had to work on building V2 rockets in a vast subterranean factory in living quarters meant to house only 2, 500 people, were allowed to sleep only four and half hours every night and were regularly brutalized by the guards. The chief pleasure of the slaves, both French and Russian, at the Dora works was urinating on the machinery when the guards were not looking. The underground press gave much coverage to the conditions at the Dora works, pointed out those Frenchmen who {{went to work in}} Germany were not paid the generous wages promised by the Organisation Todt and instead were turned into slaves, all of which the underground papers used as reasons for why the French should not go to work in Germany. Under the law of 16 February 1943 all able-bodied Frenchmen aged 20–22 who were not miners, farmers and university students had to report to the STO to do two years labour in Germany. As the occupation went on, service with the STO was widened with farmers and university students losing their exempt status until the point in 1944 was reached that <b>all</b> <b>fit</b> men aged 18–60 and women aged 18–45 were being called up for service with the STO. Men over 45 and all women serving in the STO were guaranteed not to go to Germany and many were called up with the STO were put to work building the Atlantic Wall for the Organisation Todt, but those called up with the STO {{had no way of knowing}} where they would go when they entered the ranks of the STO. The so-called réfractaires attempted to avoid being called up for the STO and often went into hiding rather work in the Reich. At least 40,000 Frenchmen (80% of the resistance were people under the age of thirty) fled to the countryside, becoming the core of the maquis guerrillas. Those who fled into the countryside rejected the term réfractaire with its connotations of laziness and called themselves the maquis, which originated as Corsican Italian slang for bandits, whose root word was macchia, which was the term for the scrubland and forests of Corsica. Those who lived in the macchia of Corsica were usually bandits, and those men fleeing to the countryside chose the term maquis as a more romantic and defiant term than réfractaire. By June 1943, the term maquis which had been a little known word borrowed from the Corsican dialect of Italian at the beginning of 1943 become widely known all over France. It was only in 1943 that guerilla warfare emerged in France as opposed to the more sporadic attacks against the Germans that had been going since the summer of 1941 and the resistance changed from an urban movement to a rural movement that was most active in central and southern France.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers of {{the first}} three episodes {{interpreted}} Carnivàles story as being full of myth and allegory. The show was seen as more than just a human-scaled metaphor of good and evil, with the power of spirits as one of the show's strongest elements. Some reviewers were deeply confused and described almost everything as [...] "mysterious" [...] the characters and their powers and abilities, characters and scenarios within visions, the whole carnival [...] wondering how it <b>all</b> <b>fit</b> together. The visions of the two main characters were shortly addressed, distinguishing between violent and benign visions, but parallels between the visions and the beings of good and evil were not necessarily drawn. The characters' stories were described as unfolding in [...] "zig-zagging starts, moving back and forth in time and space, dropping oblique clues along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|These ten, the Commentator Buddhaghosa says, <b>all</b> <b>fit</b> {{within the}} three first bases of merit: 'Giving' {{includes}} 'Transferring merit to others' and 'Rejoicing in others' merit' by extension, whereas 'Virtue' includes 'Honoring others' and 'Offering service'. The remaining items 'Listening to Teachings', 'Instructing {{others in the}} Teachings' and 'Straightening one's own views' are part of 'Mental development'. Thus, in Theravāda Buddhism, merit is always accrued through morally (good) actions. Such good deeds are also highly valued {{in the other two}} Buddhist schools, that is Mahāyāna (China, Japan, etc.) and Vajrayāna (Tibet, Nepal, etc.). In some forms of Mahāyāna or Vajrayāna it is believed, however, that even more merit will accrue from certain ritual actions, sometimes called the 'power of blessed substances' (...) [...] These are considered an addition to the traditional list and can help protect against calamities or other negative events caused by bad karma.|$|E
500|$|Moore, in {{a letter}} to McLane, noted that sending an agent to Europe to gather {{technology}} had been discussed in the past, but proposals had foundered over the difficulty of finding a person both competent enough to undertake the trip successfully and not too busy to spend a year or more in Europe. At the recommendation of the director's first cousin, Robert M. Patterson, Moore hired Peale for the position. According to Patterson, [...] "I do not know any man more likely to succeed in such a mission. [...] His skill, his perseverance, his address <b>all</b> <b>fit</b> him for the errand." [...] Peale was willing to go, writing, [...] "a variety of circumstances render me very desirous of vacating the situation that I have held for many years as Manager of the Phila Museum, it will therefore be agreeable to change even at a pecuniary sacrifice." ...|$|E

Cole and Moriarty were not bothered by the limited character sprites and animation or static backgrounds; Cole called the character designs [...] "memorable and hilariously animated", while Moriarty, who liked both, said that the characters looked [...] "awesome". Thomas called the game's music outstanding, saying that the intense music that plays at high-stakes moments during trials, as well as the character themes, <b>all</b> <b>fit</b> well. Cole said that the courtroom and character themes were memorable and fitting; he called them improvements over their counterparts in Justice for All, and [...] "at least on par with" [...] those in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. Moriarty said that the music [...] "set the mood perfectly" [...] for each scene.|$|E

Robert Copsey for Digital Spy described the song as [...] "care-free" [...] and [...] "a bit cheeky." [...] Sarah Godfrey for The Washington Post praised Aguilera for sounding more like herself on the [...] "frenzied" [...] track. Jim Farber for Daily News wrote that [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] contains [...] "a can't-miss gimmick of a chorus". He also wrote that Aguilera [...] "hits the clubs in horny revenge." ...|$|E
