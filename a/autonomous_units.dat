25|$|Military {{swarming}} is {{a behaviour}} where autonomous or partially <b>autonomous</b> <b>units</b> of action attack an enemy from several different directions and then regroup.

Historically military forces used principles of swarming without really examining them explicitly, but now active research consciously examines military doctrines that draw ideas from swarming.|$|E
25|$|Iqbal {{expressed}} {{fears that}} not only would secularism weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India's Hindu-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In his travels to Egypt, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey, he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences. He also speculated on different political arrangements to guarantee Muslim political power; in a dialogue with Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, Iqbal expressed his desire to see Indian provinces as <b>autonomous</b> <b>units</b> under the direct control of the British government and with no central Indian government. He envisaged autonomous Muslim provinces in India. Under a single Indian union he feared for Muslims, who would suffer in many respects {{especially with regard to}} their existentially separate entity as Muslims.|$|E

25|$|The Tribal Hidage is {{evidence}} {{of the existence of}} numerous smaller provinces, meaning that southern and eastern Britain may have lost any macro-political cohesion in the fifth and sixth centuries and fragmented into many small <b>autonomous</b> <b>units,</b> though late Roman administrative organisation of the countryside may have helped dictate their boundaries. By the end of the sixth century the leaders of these communities were styling themselves kings, with the majority of the larger kingdoms based on the south or east coasts. They include the provinces of the Jutes of Hampshire and Wight, the South Saxons, Kent, the East Saxons, East Angles, Lindsey and (north of the Humber) Deira and Bernicia. Several of these kingdoms may have their foundation the former Roman civitas and this has been argued as particularly likely for the provinces of Kent, Lindsey, Deira and Bernicia, all of whose names derive from Romano-British tribal or district names.|$|E

2500|$|For a while, the Romanians of Banat {{continued}} to plead with the emperor for Romanian self-rule in the Banat. One such petition, circulated in December 1863, also asked Franz Joseph to surround himself with Romanian advisers, including [...] "Andrea de Mocioni, lord of Foeni", a man distinguished by [...] "political, patriotic, and national virtues". As noted by historian Tudor-Radu Tiron, {{the restoration of}} Hungarian rule ultimately pushed the Mocionis back into Hungarian politics, which explains why Andrei, Anton and Gheorghe all took seats in the last Diet of Hungary (1865). Alexandru also won a Rittberg seat in that legislature, becoming known as the theoretician of national liberalism, and main proponent of a Nationalities Bill, which aimed at validating <b>autonomous</b> <b>units</b> for the Romanians in Hungary.|$|E
