These mechanisms are usually deployed in a prescribed order which does not change. In this work we use real world data from the process industry to compare deploying <b>adaptive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in a fixed manner to deploying them in a flexible way, which results in varying adaptation sequences. We demonstrate that flexible deployment of available adaptive methods coupled with techniques such as cross-validatory selection and retrospective model correction, can benefit the predictive accuracy over time.

25|$|Pregnancy-induced {{hypercoagulability}} {{is probably}} a physiologically <b>adaptive</b> <b>mechanism</b> to prevent post partum hemorrhage. Pregnancy changes the plasma levels of many clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, which can rise up to three times its normal value. Thrombin levels increase. Protein S, an anticoagulant, decreases. However, the other major anticoagulants, protein C and antithrombin III, remain constant. Fibrinolysis is impaired {{by an increase in}} plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1 or PAI) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), the latter synthesized from the placenta. Venous stasis may occur {{at the end of the}} first trimester, due to enhanced compliance of the vessel walls by a hormonal effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of micro-endemism, therefore, states that speciation occurs in small specific habitats as aided by <b>adaptive</b> <b>mechanism</b> occurring in geological, topographical, and climatic isolation.

Isolated, the duplicity of organization in Pachypodium form through geology and location significant variation where over evolutionary time a new species might develop, if not have developed. The development of new species is through, in part, the adaptive mechanisms of pachycaul and spinescence as well as strict and flexible structural organization at various levels of plant physiology.|$|E
25|$|PCD in the {{developing}} nervous system has been observed in proliferating as well as post-mitotic cells. One theory suggests that PCD is an <b>adaptive</b> <b>mechanism</b> to regulate the number of progenitor cells. In humans, PCD in progenitor cells starts at gestational week 7 and remains until the first trimester. This process of cell death has been identified in the germinal areas of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord among other regions. At gestational weeks 19-23, PCD is observed in post-mitotic cells. The prevailing theory explaining this observation is the neurotrophic theory which states that PCD is required to optimize the connection between neurons and their afferent inputs and efferent targets. Another theory proposes that developmental PCD in the nervous system occurs in order to correct for errors in neurons that have migrated ectopically, innervated incorrect targets, or have axons that have gone awry during path finding. It is possible that PCD during {{the development of the}} nervous system serves different functions determined by the developmental stage, cell type, and even species.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRole of metabosensitive {{afferent fibers}} in neuromuscular <b>adaptive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Adaptation to {{exercise}} {{is provided by}} central neuron activity adjustments which are regulated partly by activation of group I and II (mechanosensitive) and group III and IV (metabosentitive) afferent fibers. These last two groups are activated by exercise-induced changes in muscle metabolism. The role played by these afferents seems to be crucial to exercise and fatigue tolerance <b>adaptive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Nevertheless, many questions remain unresolved. The aim of this review {{is to focus on}} the involvement of metabosensitivity in sensorimotor loops and neuromuscular <b>adaptive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The existence of an adaptive cardiovascular and respiratory reflex to exercise originating from metabosensitive afferent fiber activation is well established. Furthermore, the mechanism of skeletal muscle protection against fatigue could be due to modulation of central motor command at the spinal and supraspinal levels via these afferent fibers...|$|R

25|$|Programmed {{cell death}} {{can be reduced}} or {{eliminated}} in the developing nervous system by the targeted deletion of pro-apoptotic genes or by the overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes. The absence or reduction of PCD can cause serious anatomical malformations but can also result in minimal consequences depending on the gene targeted, neuronal population, and stage of development. Excess progenitor cell proliferation that leads to gross brain abnormalities is often lethal, as seen in caspase-3 or caspase-9 knockout mice which develop exencephaly in the forebrain. The brainstem, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia of these mice develop normally, however, suggesting that the involvement of caspases in PCD during development depends on the brain region and cell type. Knockout or inhibition of apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), also results in malformations and increased embryonic lethality. Manipulation of apoptosis regulator proteins Bcl-2 and Bax (overexpression of Bcl-2 or deletion of Bax) produces {{an increase in the}} number of neurons in certain regions of the nervous system such as the retina, trigeminal nucleus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. However, PCD of neurons due to Bax deletion or Bcl-2 overexpression does not result in prominent morphological or behavioral abnormalities in mice. For example, mice overexpressing Bcl-2 have generally normal motor skills and vision and only show impairment in complex behaviors such as learning and anxiety. The normal behavioral phenotypes of these mice suggest that an <b>adaptive</b> <b>mechanism</b> may be involved to compensate for the excess neurons.|$|E
25|$|Pursuit {{predation}} {{revolves around}} a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move {{to find new}} foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density, and prey should therefore avoid these areas. However, dilution factor may be a reason to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, dilution factor seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations. Models of spatial patterns and synchrony of predator-prey relationships {{can be used as}} support for the evolution of pursuit predation as one mechanism to preserve these population mechanics. By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and prey population through population synchrony. Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations in synchrony, which increases metapopulation persistence. Pursuit predation’s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out. Pursuit predation can then be supported as an <b>adaptive</b> <b>mechanism</b> for not just individual feeding success but also metapopulation persistence.|$|E

These adaptations, variations on habit, trunks, branches, branchlets, spines, leaves, or flowers, are plentiful in demonstrating how Pachypodium as a genus fosters greater variation in its speciation. The manner in which speciation occurs in Pachypodium, therefore, is apparent: adaptive mechanisms on a morphological level respond to the microenvironment of Pachypodium habitat. The genus' unique organizational, architectural morphology shapes plants that are highly, adaptively responsive to their immediate, surrounding, microenvironments. The duplicity of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{that is at once}} [...] "strict" [...] and [...] "flexible" [...] at differing levels of plant physiology, or structure, has granted Pachypodium the ability to evolve within the landscape into variations that fulfill an ecological niche as various species.|$|E

40|$|Innovative {{research}} on the interactions between biomechanical load and cardiovascular (CV) morphogenesis by multiple investigators over the past 3 decades, including the application of bioengineering approaches, {{has shown that the}} embryonic heart adapts both structure and function in order to maintain cardiac output to the rapidly growing embryo. Acute <b>adaptive</b> hemodynamic <b>mechanisms</b> in the embryo include the redistribution of blood flow within the heart, dynamic adjustments in heart rate and developed pressure, and beat to beat variations in blood flow and vascular resistance.
