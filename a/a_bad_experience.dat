Crows {{arrive on the}} new garden, so Marge makes a scarecrow, which scares Homer. Homer destroys the scarecrow, and the crows see Homer as their leader, following him everywhere and doing his bidding. But when the crows try to carry Maggie, Homer turns on them and they attack his eyes. He is prescribed medicinal marijuana.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, Plumb was the US Olympic athlete {{with the}} {{greatest}} number of appearances in any sport at the Games. He was named to the US team in every Olympic games between 1960 (his first) and 1984, as well as appearing for the last time at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and competed at all of the Games except for 1980, when the US did not compete. During his seven Olympic appearances, he gathered multiple medals. At the 1960 Summer Olympics, Plumb took an individual 15th, while the US team did not finish the competition. At the 1964 Games, he repeated his individual performance, while the US team improved to take the silver medal. At these Games, he became the first rider ever to win a medal on a horse that he had never previously ridden in competition. Plumb had planned to ride his main event horse, Markham, but on the flight to the Games in Tokyo, the horse panicked, possibly due to <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> previously suffered in a horse trailer. In order to keep him from destroying his stall and potentially the aircraft, the horse was euthanized. Plumb instead rode Bold Minstrel, a horse loaned to him by another top-level eventer.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} cause of pyrophobia is that fire poses a {{potential}} danger, such as house fire, wildfire, and getting caught on fire.

In many cases <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> childhood <b>experience</b> with fire may have triggered the condition.|$|R
50|$|Research by Demand Metric {{into the}} cost of <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> sales <b>experience</b> {{indicated}} that a misalignment between sales and marketing is key to a loss in revenue. Specifically, 72% {{of sales and marketing}} professionals agree on this statement. 60% of these professionals often deliver <b>bad</b> sales <b>experiences.</b> The cause of this problem is due to sales thinking that marketing materials lacks quality, while marketers think salespeople aren’t using the content the right way. Mobile sales enablement provides a solution to this problem.|$|R
25|$|Because Rand had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> {{with the}} Broadway {{production}} of Night of January 16th due to numerous script changes {{mandated by the}} producer, she insisted on having final approval of any revisions. The production was quickly troubled as Abbott requested many changes that Rand refused. To facilitate rewrites, Abbott asked experienced playwright S. N. Behrman to work with Rand as a script doctor. Abbott also decided to replace actor John Davis Lodge, who was hired to play Andrei.|$|E
25|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry {{typified by}} a {{situation}} where a harmless species has evolved to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species directed at a common predator. The harmful species (the model) might have spines, stingers, or toxic chemistry, while its apparent double has no defence other than resembling the unpalatable species. Protection of the mimic from predators is afforded by its resemblance to the unpalatable species, which the predator associates with a certain appearance and <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E

Langtry later had a second Cesarewitch winner with Yentoi, and a third place with Raytoi. An imported horse from New Zealand called Uniform, won the Lewes Handicap for her.|$|R
25|$|The {{first thing}} many people notice when {{entering}} {{the gates of}} Oakland is the mausoleum of Jasper Newton Smith, on which sits a striking life-size statue of Smith himself. Jasper Smith was a real estate investor who financed two buildings downtown. One, known as The House that Jack Built, was constructed with the stipulation that its cornerstone be left even after the building was torn down. That cornerstone still stands {{at the entrance of}} the Peachtree Center MARTA station on Carnegie Way. Smith was well known for refusing to wear a necktie due to <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> as a child. Therefore, one story describing the creation of his statue notes that when the artist sculpted him wearing a cravat, Smith refused to pay until the offending item had been chiseled off.|$|E
25|$|Although both {{footage and}} the film's soundtrack were off-limits, the {{designers}} {{were allowed to}} re-create the likenesses of the actors who {{had appeared in the}} film. Westwood never intended for Rick Deckard to be a major character in the game, but they did attempt to contact Harrison Ford with the intention of asking him to make a cameo appearance. However, they never received a response. This didn't surprise them, as Ford had had a negative experience working on the film and, at the time, even refused to talk about it in interviews. According to Castle, Ford was also against the concept of video games based on films in general. The designers were also unable to get any input from Ridley Scott, the film's director, as he too had had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> on the film, and had fallen out with Yorkin and Perenchio when they took over production. He was uninterested in participating in the game.|$|E
500|$|Yelp {{added the}} ability for {{business}} owners to respond to reviews in 2008. Businesses can respond privately by messaging the reviewer or publicly on their profile page. In some cases, Yelp users that had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses' efforts to make it right. In other cases disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations. The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating, though Yelp users say this rarely occurs. A business owner can [...] "claim" [...] a profile, which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports. Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using the [...] "check in" [...] feature. In 2014, Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device. Business owners can also flag a review to be removed, if the review violates Yelp's content guidelines.|$|E

How to replace GCJ with the Sun JDK was a frequently asked question by users, because GCJ was an incomplete implementation, incompatible and buggy.|$|R
2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> PCP <b>experience</b> and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> PCP [...] <b>experience</b> when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|R

Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and their production partner Kevin S. Bright. At the end of March, the potential actors {{had been reduced to}} three or four for each part; they read for Les Moonves, president of Warner Bros. Television. David Schwimmer was first to be cast. He was in Chicago doing a stage adaptation of The Master and Margarita when his agent offered him the audition. He was not interested in doing television after <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> appearing in Monty, but changed his mind when he learned that it was an ensemble script. Unknown to him, Crane and Kauffman had remembered him from when he auditioned for an earlier pilot of theirs; they had written the part of Ross with Schwimmer in mind to play him. Eric McCormack also auditioned for the role several times. He later became famous for his lead role in the sitcom Will & Grace.|$|E

This represented about $400 million in equipment that would not be counted against the Mutual Defense Assistance Program. The RAF was wary. The B-47 was judged inferior to the English Electric Canberra although it had greater range and could carry a larger bomb load. It would require [...] runways, and RAF had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> with the last American-built bomber it operated, the Washington. Above all though, there was the potential loss of prestige and independence. The head of RAF Bomber Command, Sir Hugh Lloyd was in favour of acceptance, but the Secretary of State for Air, Lord de L'Isle and Dudley, and the Minister of Supply, Duncan Sandys advised Churchill against it. In June, the Chief of the Air Staff, Sir William Dickson thanked the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Nathan Twining, for the generous offer.|$|E
500|$|... "She is enigmatic but I {{must tell}} you I never had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> because of her enigma. What it was, she {{explained}} this once, is that she did this on purpose. The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} the need for desensitizing {{training}} is when an object, such as a plastic bag, suddenly blows across the path of horse and rider, which, if the horse has not been properly desensitized, could result in spooking. Spooking is potentially dangerous, as it can result in fallen riders or horses bolting into danger. Another example would be the need to desensitize a horse to the sound of traffic, music, loudspeakers and other stimuli seen at public events. In some cases, <b>a</b> previous <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> may have given a horse reason to fear a specific situation, requiring a form of systematic desensitization to gradually overcome its fear.|$|R

Pascal tried to convince Shaw to let Pygmalion be turned into a musical, but the outraged Shaw explicitly forbade it, having had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> with the operetta The Chocolate Soldier (based on Shaw's Arms and the Man). He was, though, the only man to convince George Bernard Shaw to adjust his scripts to the new medium of cinema, gaining concessions from Shaw that no other man could. Pascal even invented the line for Pygmalion (later utilised by Lerner and Loewe in the musical version, My Fair Lady) [...] "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain" [...] and Shaw, by now publicly referring to Pascal as a genius, wrote the line into the script. In 1938 Pascal was named as one of the world's most famous men by Time magazine along with Adolf Hitler and the Pope.|$|E
