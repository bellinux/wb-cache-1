40|$|A compact air {{separator}} demonstrator based on centrifugally enhanced distillation has been studied. The full size device {{is meant to}} be used on board of a Two Stage To Orbit vehicle launcher. The <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> <b>system</b> must be able to extract oxygen in highly concentrated liquid form (LEA, Liquid Enriched Air) from atmospheric air. The LEA is stored before being used in a subsequent rocket propulsion phase by the second stage of the launcher. Two reference vehicles are defined, one with a subsonic first stage and one with a supersonic first stage. In both cases, oxygen collection is performed during a cruise phase (M 0. 7 and M 2. 5 respectively). The aim of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> <b>system,</b> investigate the separation cycle design, and assess that the separator design selected is suitable for the reference vehicles. The project is described from original base ideas to design, construction, extended testing and analysis of experimental results. Preliminary computations for a realistic layout have been performed and the motivations for the choices made during the process are explained. Test rig design, separator design and technical discussion are provided for a subscale pilot unit. Mass transport parameters and flooding limits have been estimated and experimentally measured. Performance has been assessed and shown to be sufficient for the reference Two Stage To Orbit vehicles. The technology developed is found suitable without further optimization, although some volume and mass reduction would be desirable for the supersonic first stage concept. There are many ways of optimisation that can be further investigated. The aim of this program, however, is not to fully optimize the device, but to demonstrate that a device based on a simple, robust, low-risk design is already suitable for the launch vehicles. On top of that analysis, directions for improvements are suggested and their potentials estimated. A complete assessment of those improvements requires further maturation of the technological concept through further testing and practical implementations.

40|$|The {{availability}} of hollow fiber membranes and membrane modules has brought forth {{the development of}} simple processes {{for the production of}} oxygen and nitrogen from ambient air.

40|$|Issue: Materials {{that are}} {{delivered}} to a wood waste processing facility contain {{a myriad of}} non-wood contaminants. These contaminants include small pieces of metal (e. g., nails, fasteners), dirt, chemicals, lead-based paint, and other trace materials. Certain quantities of these contaminants must be removed to ensure the wood can be processed and the end-product is marketable. A piece of processing equipment alone, such as a ferrous magnet or an <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> <b>system,</b> might be insufficient to obtain the required level of cleanliness. As a result, a manual sorting system might be a viable option to augment the processing equipment. However, {{there are a number}} of factors to consider: the location of the facility, the labor pool, and labor rates in the area. Implementing a combination of mechanical and manual sorting systems requires adopting or establishing quality control standards and issuing adherence by all personnel, throughout the facility. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends implementing a manual sorting system by line sorters in addition to a facility tipping fee/charge system. The tipping fee/charge system ensures marketable woodbase materials are produced by managing the quality of waste-loads delivered to the facility before they reach the manual sorting system. Size variations of feedstock and types of materials that could potentially contaminate the wood waste present a challenge to the processing facility. The following practices are recommended to overcome these challenges and control the quality of the finished product: • Place a mobile shear-sizing equipment at the receiving side of the plant • Use screening equipment to remove and control the fine materials • Capture the ferrous metal with magnets • Establish a series of manual sorting systems The following are recommended elements for implementing a manual sorting system...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOxy-combustion is {{presently}} considered {{as the most}} promising technology to enable the capture of CO 2 from fossil fuel based power plants. The concept of oxy-combustion is to use oxygen instead of air for the combustion process and to achieve {{a high concentration of}} CO 2 in the flue gas.

POPs containing iron (Fe-POP) and cobalt (Co-POP) were synthesized, characterized and evaluated. Adsorption studies under ambient and cryogenic conditions (91 - 303 K) were studied. Interestingly, these POPs showed selective adsorption of O 2 over N 2 of up to 1. 3 at 273 K, and most significantly, the oxygen uptake {{was found to be}} stable and reversible over the range of temperatures studied. Furthermore, the polymers also exhibited a molecular sieving effect, which showed increasing nitrogen exclusion between 110 K and 160 K and led to an extraordinary O 2 :N 2 selectivity of up to 14. 7 at 91 K.

40|$|Molecular sieve oxygen {{generating}} systems (MSOGS) {{have become}} the accepted method {{for the production of}} breathable oxygen on military aircraft. These systems separate oxygen for aircraft engine bleed air by application of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology. Oxygen is concentrated by preferential adsorption in nitrogen in a zeolite molecular sieve. However, the inability of current zeolite molecular sieves to discriminate between oxygen and argon results in an oxygen purity limitations of 93 - 95 percent (both oxygen and argon concentrate). The goal was to develop a new PSA process capable of exceeding the present oxygen purity limitations. A novel molecular sieve oxygen concentrator was developed which is capable of generating oxygen concentrations of up to 99. 7 percent directly from air. The process is comprised of four absorbent beds, two containing a zeolite molecular sieve and two containing a carbon molecular sieve.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Oxygen {{constitutes}} 30 % {{share of}} the global industrial gas market and is the second largest-volume chemical produced in the world after sulfuric acid. Commercial applications of oxygen {{can be found in}} industry sectors as diverse as metallurgical industry, chemical synthesis, glass manufacturing, pulp and paper industry, petroleum recovery / refining, and health services. Advanced power generation systems, such as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), Oxy-fuel combustion and solid oxide fuel cells, SOFC represent emerging markets for oxygen. Oxygen is commonly produced at industrial scales by air separation using cryogenic distillation and adsorption based technologies. Advanced technologies such as membrane separation (e. g. ion-transport membrane, ITM) and in-situ air separation are also being developed for small-volume point-of-use oxygen generation. While conventional cryogenic and adsorption air separation methods are matured technologies, their energy intensity and high costs can no longer be tolerated under the current economic, energy, and environmental crises. Membrane separation methods whilst less energy intensive remain expensive due to challenges associated with their fabrication, installation and integration. In view of the above, a team of researchers led by Prof Moghtaderi at the University of Newcastle devised the Chemical Looping Air Separation (CLAS) process and its variants including: (i) Integrated Chemical Looping Air Separation (ICLAS) process for oxy-fuel applications and (ii) Redox Energy Storage (RES) process for thermo-chemical energy storage. Depending on the operating temperature and frontend conditions, the energy input into the CLAS process is 50 % - 80 % lower than that required for the cryogenic process and, as such, the CLAS family of processes has a relatively small energy footprint. CLAS works in a cyclic fashion by continuous recirculation of metal oxide particles between a set of two interconnected reactors, where oxidation (O₂ coupling) and reduction (O₂ decoupling) of carrier particles take place, respectively. In the original version of the CLAS process the reduction half cycle is carried out in presence of steam so that the desired oxygen product can be obtained by condensing out the steam. However, the production and condensation of steam is energy consuming and if it can be replaced by an alternative method the overall energy footprint of the CLAS process can be further reduced. Motivated by this, Prof Moghtaderi and his team turned their attention on to yet another variant of CLAS named Membrane Integrated Chemical Looping Air Separation (MICLAS) where the oxygen product from the reduction reactor is separated from steam or other suitable reducing agents (e. g. N₂) using an oxygen transport membrane (OTM) system. The combination of the OTM and CLAS in the MICLAS process creates an air separation platform which is far more cost effective than the standalone OTM based processes because of the smaller volume of gases involved, thereby, smaller physical dimensions and lower capital / operating costs. The principal vision in this PhD project was to determine the fundamental science underpinning the operation of the above integrated membrane systems using a combined theoretical and experimental approach. While both steam and nitrogen compatible OTMs studied theoretically, the primary focus of the experimental investigations was on the use of OTMs compatible with nitrogen as past experience has shown that by and large steam detrimentally impacts on the operation of membranes suitable for oxygen transport. As part of the theoretical component of the project the feasibility of integrating an OTM into the CLAS process was examined using Aspen Plus simulations, in which the net amount of energy required for each process was determined. An empirical model was then developed for calculating the oxygen permeation fluxes of the membranes using both simulation results and literature-based experimental data. It was found that the energy saving of MICLAS over the conventional CLAS was approximately 30 % if a 100 % oxygen recovery was assumed. When the actual oxygen recovery data were employed the energy saving of MICLAS over CLAS was 12 % for BSCF type perovskite membranes reported in the literature and 16 % for BSCF and 22 % for LSCF type perovskite membranes specifically developed as part of this PhD study. The experimental component of the project was designed to address several important research questions fundamental to the effective operation of the MICLAS process. Of these, an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the particle deposition on a membrane {{and its impact on the}} membrane performance (i. e., the oxygen flux across the membrane and thereby the reactions taking place within the CLAS system) was the first research question examined in this study. For this purpose, a fluidised bed chamber was designed and constructed to study particle deposition on surrogate ceramic membranes. Images of the surface coverage of each membrane were taken with a Phantom V 5 high speed camera and analysed using Image J software. Preliminary deposition experiments using the experimental setup with the Perspex fluidised bed created a severe electrostatic charging issue which led to the redesign and construction of the fluidised bed chamber. The modified deposition setup consisted of a combination of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass window and a complete metallic body machined from aluminium. Grounding the experimental setup, including the new fluidised bed chamber, almost completely eliminated the electrostatic charging problem. The results of this set of experiments showed that the degree of particle deposition and electrostatic forces acting upon the particle deposition in the two phase flow were minimised. The experimental results showed that the surface coverage of the surrogate membranes with particles was less than 3 %. Therefore, the impact of particle deposition which was initially considered to be detrimental to the effectiveness of the membrane was found to be insignificant. The other research questions addressed in the experimental component of the project were related to the effectiveness of membrane materials and identifying the most suitable candidate for MICLAS based processes. In this context, experimental studies were directed toward the synthesis of two types of perovskite membranes and their characterisation. These were namely Ba 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 −δ (BSCF 5582) and La 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 −δ (LSCF 5582) which were prepared at different sintering temperatures and characterised. The BSCF 5582 membranes were also synthesised using a modified Pechini method in collaboration with the FIMLab at the University of Queensland. The BSCF 5582 and LSCF 5582 membranes were sintered in the temperature ranges of 1000 °C - 1150 °C for 8 h and 1050 °C - 1350 °C for 5 h, respectively. The sintered membranes were characterised using an array of complementary techniques to determine the optimum sintering temperature in order to optimise their desired properties and oxygen permeability. The surface morphology of the membranes were examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy, which revealed that the segregation of the cobalt oxide phase occurring at the sintering temperatures of 1250 °C and 1100 °C for the LSCF 5582 and BSCF 5582 membranes, respectively; impacts on the oxygen permeability of the membranes. The sintering experiments also revealed that the sintering temperatures of 1350 °C and 1150 °C were impractical for the sintering of LSCF 5582 and BSCF 5582 membranes due to an excessive liquid phase forming at these temperatures. The phase and crystal structure of the membranes were identified using the X-ray diffraction technique. The presence of segregated phases for the membranes at high sintering temperatures was also verified using XRD and analysed using EDS techniques. The surface areas of the membranes were measured using the BET method in order to study their oxygen adsorption and desorption characteristics. A significantly lower surface area was acquired for the membranes sintered at elevated temperatures due to the formation of larger grain sizes at these temperatures. For example, the LSCF 5582 fresh powder and LSCF 5582 membrane sintered at 1350 °C had the highest (5. 84 m². g - 1) and the lowest (0. 556 m². g - 1) surface areas, respectively. Studies of the oxygen desorption/adsorption characteristics of the membranes showed a significantly higher oxygen adsorption rate over the oxygen desorption rate. The characterisation results demonstrated that the optimum sintering temperatures of the LSCF 5582 and BSCF 5582 membranes were 1200 °C and 1050 °C, respectively. The oxygen permeation experiments were conducted in three permeation cells with: Concentric Tube configuration, Double-Tube configuration and Multi-Tube configuration. The adjustable variables in the Concentric Tube setup were the pressure and flow rate of the sweep gas and the permeation temperature. The Double-Tube setup was used to determine the oxygen recovery of the membranes. However, sealing was the major challenge in the Double-Tube setup; therefore the Multi-Tube setup was designed and constructed. The adjustable parameters in the Multi-Tube setup were the flow rates and pressures of the feed and the sweep gas, as well as the permeation temperature. Oxygen permeation fluxes increased significantly with temperature due to the enhanced formation of oxygen vacancy concentrations in the crystal structure of the membranes with increased temperatures. As oxygen ions migrate through the vacancies, the oxygen permeation fluxes increased at elevated temperatures due to the increased oxygen vacancies. Considerably higher oxygen permeation fluxes were acquired using the Multi Tube setup than with the other permeation setups as the oxygen partial pressure gradient was adjustable in this particular setup. In order to investigate the feasibility of the integration of an OTM into the CLAS process, the reduction reactions of the oxygen carrier particles was initially examined using the TGA instrument and a fixed bed reactor. The equilibrium conversion of the metallic oxides and the concentrations of oxygen produced at different reduction temperatures were determined. Subsequently, the metallic oxides were packed in the vicinity of the LSCF and BSCF membranes using the Multi-Tube apparatus. The permeation fluxes and recoveries of oxygen obtained with the membranes were measured in the course of the reduction of the metallic oxide particles containing 17 weight percent active CuO. Finally, in a set of experiments, hypothetical oxygen carriers containing 10 %, 15 % and 21 % oxygen concentrations were considered as future oxygen carriers for the CLAS process. The permeability and oxygen recovery of the LSCF 5582 and BSCF 5582 membranes were measured under simulated experimental conditions using hypothetical oxygen carriers. A mixture of oxygen and nitrogen was used to simulate the oxygen content of the hypothetical oxygen carriers. The experimental results showed that significantly higher oxygen permeation fluxes and recoveries were obtained for membranes at a 10 % oxygen concentration, compared with a 21 % oxygen concentration. In summary, it has been demonstrated that the OTM integrated CLAS process, even with the existing oxygen carriers which contain 0. 3 % oxygen, is a viable technology that can be usefully applied to a future <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

Both of these systems operate at cryogenic temperatures and include self-integrated refrigeration cycles, making their design challenging. Several researchers have applied sensitivity tools available in the commercial flow sheet simulators to study and improve ASU and CPU systems for oxy-fired coal power plants. These studies are limited, however, as they neglect important interactions between design variables. In this paper, we apply an advanced equation-based flowsheet optimization framework to design these cryogenic <b>separations</b> <b>systems.</b> The key advantage of this approach is the ability to use state-of-the-art nonlinear optimization solvers that are capable of considering 100, 000 + variables and constraints.

Similarly, the optimized CPU requires 18 % less specific separation energy than an academic reference case. Pareto (sensitivity) curves for the ASU and CPU systems are also presented.

The ultimate objective is to arrive at conceptual designs of <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> plants, optimized for minimum specific power consumption and capital investment costs, for integration with MHD combined cycle power plants...|$|R
50|$|This plastic is {{also used}} to produce <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> {{membranes}} for generating nitrogen. The PPO is spun into a hollow fiber membrane with a porous support layer and a very thin outer skin. The permeation of oxygen occurs from inside to out across the thin outer skin with an extremely high flux. Due to the manufacturing process, the fiber has excellent dimensional stability and strength. Unlike hollow fiber membranes made from polysulfone, the aging process of the fiber is relatively quick so that <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> performance remains stable throughout the life of the membrane. PPO makes the <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> performance suitable for low temperature (35-70F)(2-21C) applications where polysulfone membranes require heated air to increase permeation.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{centered}} around the problem of carbon dioxide capture and storage considered as an option to mitigate climate changes. In particular, the paper describes the oxy-fuel combustion, based on the ASU technology, applied to two different power plants with CO 2 capture: a supercritical steam power plant fed with pulverized coal and a {{combined cycle power plant}} fed with natural gas. The paper analyses these two different technologies considering thermodynamic, technical and economical aspects. But if capital and operating costs cannot be overlooked, it is also necessary to estimate the energy required to operate an <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> plant. From this point of view the paper illustrates the main <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> technologies, reporting both cryogenic (ASU – <b>Air</b> <b>Separation</b> Unit) and non-cryogenic systems...|$|R
