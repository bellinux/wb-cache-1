5|$|Psittacosaurus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{completely}} known dinosaur genera. Fossils of hundreds of individuals have been collected so far, including many complete skeletons. Most <b>age</b> <b>classes</b> are represented, from hatchling through to adult, which has allowed several detailed studies of Psittacosaurus growth rates and reproductive biology. The abundance of this dinosaur in the fossil record has led to the labelling of Lower Cretaceous sediments of east Asia the Psittacosaurus biochron.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) and the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), the velvet belly {{is one of}} the most abundant deep-sea sharks in the northeastern Atlantic. It is found individually or in small shoals. Samplings in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages; this imbalance increases in the older <b>age</b> <b>classes.</b> In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups. However, this pattern has not been observed at other sites in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E

Beetles were taken by all other <b>age</b> <b>classes</b> of chicks, but in smaller amounts. All ages fed upon ants, and while the volume was generally low, ants were found {{in most of the}} crops.

25|$|Problems {{that can}} arise from {{selective}} harvesting are smaller reproducing adult fish, {{as well as}} the unexpected mortality of the fish which sustain injuries from the gillnet but are not retained in the fishery. Most salmon populations include several <b>age</b> <b>classes,</b> allowing for fish of different ages, and sizes, to reproduce with each other. A recent 2009 study looked at 59 years of catch and escapement data of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon to determine age and size at maturity trends attributable to the selectivity of commercial gillnet harvests. The study found that the larger females (>550mm) of all <b>age</b> <b>classes</b> were most susceptible to harvest. The study suggests that smaller, younger fish were more likely to successfully traverse the gillnet fishery and reproduce than the larger fish. The study also found that the average length of sockeye harvested from 1946–2005 was 8mm larger than the sockeye who escaped the gillnet fishery to spawn, reducing the fecundity of the average female by 5%, or 104 eggs. If a salmon enters a gillnet, but manages to escape, it can sustain injuries. These injuries can lead to a lower degree of reproductive success. A study aimed at quantifying mortality of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon due to gillnet-related injuries found that 11–29% of sockeye sustained fishery-related injuries attributable to gillnets, and 51% of those fish were expected to not reproduce.|$|E
25|$|Young halibut {{are highly}} migratory and {{generally}} migrate in a clockwise direction {{east and south}} throughout the Gulf of Alaska. Halibut in older <b>age</b> <b>classes</b> {{tend to be less}} migratory, but continue to move predominately on a clockwise direction. Mature fish are also involved in winter spawning migrations towards deeper waters, migrating across several areas in some instances. Research has indicated small, localized spawning populations may occur in deep waters such as in Chatham Straight in northern Southeast Alaska. However, because of the free-floating nature of larvae and subsequent mixing of juvenile halibut from throughout the Gulf of Alaska, only one genetic stock of halibut is known in the northern Pacific.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of trophic cascades has become widely accepted in ecology. However, studies of trophic cascades {{have generally been}} limited to small spatiotemporal scales with small organisms conducive to manipulation. Evidence for trophic cascades involving large mammals over large spatiotemporal scales has been building over the last decade. We conducted a meta-analysis that included 9 studies with 15 individual datasets to determine whether predator extirpation could lead to recruitment gaps in browse-sensitive tree species. We included studies that quantitatively measured tree population age structure in a location from which large predators have been functionally reduced by human activity. <b>Age</b> <b>class</b> size should decrease exponentially with time since establishment, whereas we hypothesized smaller than expected <b>age</b> <b>class</b> sizes in decades without predators. We tested this hypothesis by using <b>age</b> <b>class</b> sizes before predator extirpation and an exponential model to estimate expected post-extirpation <b>age</b> <b>class</b> sizes.
