5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder populations that arrive from outside (<b>allochthonous),</b> Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else can see it closely is from a small plane. This allows the natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E
5|$|Hippo {{defecation}} creates <b>allochthonous</b> {{deposits of}} organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function. A 2015 study suggests that hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can {{have a significant impact}} on the land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the paths of swamps and channels.|$|E

25|$|Pike Perch (Sander lucioperca Linnaeus 1758) (also see Sander (genus)) {{population}} in the Neretva River watershed was observed in 1990 for the first time. The Rama River, a right tributary of the Neretva, and its Rama Lake received an unknown quantity of this <b>allochthonous</b> species. Population estimates have increased in the Neretva accumulation lakes. This fact confirms previous scientific assumptions of Škrijelj (1991, 1995), who predicted the possibility of Pike Perch displacement (migration) from Ramsko Lake to the Rama River and then further downstream {{to the river and}} its lakes.|$|E
25|$|The common {{denominator}} among most deposits of fossil insects and terrestrial plants is the lake environment. Those insects that became preserved were either {{living in the}} fossil lake (autochthonous) or carried into it from surrounding habitats by winds, stream currents, or their own flight (<b>allochthonous).</b> Drowning and dying insects not eaten by fish and other predators settle to the bottom, where they may be preserved in the lake’s sediments, called lacustrine, under appropriate conditions. Even amber, or fossil resin from trees, requires a watery environment that is lacustrine or brackish {{in order to be}} preserved. Without protection in anoxic sediments, amber would gradually disintegrate; it is never found buried in fossil soils. Various factors contribute greatly to what kinds of insects become preserved and how well, if indeed at all, including lake depth, temperature, and alkalinity; type of sediments; whether the lake was surrounded by forest or vast and featureless salt pans; and if it was choked in anoxia or highly oxygenated. There are some major exceptions to the lacustrine theme of fossil insects, the most famous being the Late Jurassic limestones from Solnhofen and Eichstätt, Germany, which are marine. These deposits are famous for pterosaurs and the earliest bird, Archaeopteryx. The limestones were formed by a very fine mud of calcite that settled within stagnant, hypersaline bays isolated from inland seas. Most organisms in these limestones, including rare insects, were preserved intact, sometimes with feathers and outlines of soft wing membranes, indicating that there was very little decay. The insects, however, are like casts or molds, having relief but little detail. In some cases iron oxides precipitated around wing veins, revealing better detail.|$|E
2500|$|The {{need for}} {{manpower}} causes the massive influx {{of people from}} the interior (which the natives call Bilanda Lail, [...] "rail followers"); Their housing needs {{contribute to the development of}} the city. The Vilis, which were hitherto the majority inhabitants of the region, must now share the land and work with the <b>allochthonous</b> populations. They see their habitat area diminishing according to the atomization of the kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|According to the RCC, low ordered {{sites are}} small shaded streams where <b>allochthonous</b> inputs of CPOM are a {{necessary}} resource for consumers. [...] As the river widens at mid-ordered sites, energy inputs should change. [...] Ample sunlight should reach {{the bottom in}} these systems to support significant periphyton production. [...] Additionally, the biological processing of CPOM (Coarse Particulate Organic Matter - larger than 1nbsp&mm) inputs at upstream sites is expected to result in the transport of large amounts of FPOM (Fine Particulate Organic Matter - smaller than 1nbsp&mm) to these downstream ecosystems. [...] Plants should become more abundant at edges of the river with increasing river size, especially in lowland rivers where finer sediments have been deposited and facilitate rooting. The main channels likely have too much current and turbidity {{and a lack of}} substrate to support plants or periphyton. [...] Phytoplankton should produce the only autochthonous inputs here, but photosynthetic rates will be limited due to turbidity and mixing. [...] Thus, <b>allochthonous</b> inputs are expected to be the primary energy source for large rivers. This FPOM will come from both upstream sites via the decomposition process and through lateral inputs from floodplains.|$|E
2500|$|Biota {{should change}} with {{this change in}} energy from the {{headwaters}} {{to the mouth of}} these systems. [...] Namely, shredders should prosper in low-ordered systems and grazers in mid-ordered sites. [...] Microbial decomposition should play the largest role in energy production for low-ordered sites and large rivers, while photosynthesis, in addition to degraded <b>allochthonous</b> inputs from upstream will be essential in mid-ordered systems. [...] As mid-ordered sites will theoretically receive the largest variety of energy inputs, they might be expected to host the most biological diversity (Vannote et al. 1980).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Allochthonous</b> {{energy sources}} are those derived {{from outside the}} lotic system, that is, from the {{terrestrial}} environment. [...] Leaves, twigs, fruits, etc. are typical forms of terrestrial CPOM that have entered the water by direct litterfall or lateral leaf blow. [...] In addition, terrestrial animal-derived materials, such as feces or carcasses that {{have been added to}} the system are examples of <b>allochthonous</b> CPOM. [...] The CPOM undergoes a specific process of degradation. [...] Allan gives the example of a leaf fallen into a stream. [...] First, the soluble chemicals are dissolved and leached from the leaf upon its saturation with water. [...] This adds to the DOM load in the system. [...] Next, microbes such as bacteria and fungi colonize the leaf, softening it as the mycelium of the fungus grows into it. [...] The composition of the microbial community is influenced by the species of tree from which the leaves are shed (Rubbo and Kiesecker 2004). [...] This combination of bacteria, fungi, and leaf are a food source for shredding invertebrates, [...] which leave only FPOM after consumption. [...] These fine particles may be colonized by microbes again or serve as a food source for animals that consume FPOM. [...] Organic matter can also enter the lotic system already in the FPOM stage by wind, surface runoff, bank erosion, or groundwater. [...] Similarly, DOM can be introduced through canopy drip from rain or from surface flows.|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of bacteria in lakes and ponds obtain their energy by decomposing vegetation and animal matter. [...] In the pelagic zone, dead fish and the occasional <b>allochthonous</b> input of litterfall are examples of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM>1mm). [...] Bacteria degrade these into fine particulate organic matter (FPOM<1nbsp&mm) and then further into usable nutrients. [...] Small organisms such as plankton are also characterized as FPOM. [...] Very low concentrations of nutrients are released during decomposition because the bacteria are utilizing them {{to build their own}} biomass. [...] Bacteria, however, are consumed by protozoa, which are in turn consumed by zooplankton, and then further up the trophic levels. [...] Nutrients, including those that contain carbon and phosphorus, are reintroduced into the water column at any number of points along this food chain via excretion or organism death, making them available again for bacteria. [...] This regeneration cycle is known as the microbial loop and is a key component of lentic food webs.|$|E
2500|$|Fish {{can also}} be placed into feeding guilds. Planktivores pick {{plankton}} {{out of the water}} column. [...] Herbivore-detritivores are bottom-feeding species that ingest both periphyton and detritus indiscriminately. [...] Surface and water column feeders capture surface prey (mainly terrestrial and emerging insects) and drift (benthic invertebrates floating downstream). [...] Benthic invertebrate feeders prey primarily on immature insects, but will also consume other benthic invertebrates. [...] Top predators consume fishes and/or large invertebrates. [...] Omnivores ingest a wide range of prey. [...] These can be floral, faunal, and/or [...] detrital in nature. [...] Finally, parasites live off of host species, typically other fishes. [...] Fish are flexible in their feeding roles, capturing different prey with regard to seasonal availability and their own developmental stage. [...] Thus, they may occupy multiple feeding [...] guilds in their lifetime. [...] The number of species in each guild can vary greatly between systems, with temperate warm water streams having the most benthic invertebrate feeders, and tropical systems having large numbers of detritus feeders due to high rates of <b>allochthonous</b> input.|$|E

5000|$|In limnology, <b>allochthonous</b> {{sources of}} carbon or {{nutrients}} come {{from outside the}} aquatic system (such as plant and soil material).

In aquatic food webs, the portion of biomass derived from <b>allochthonous</b> material is then named [...] "allochthony".
