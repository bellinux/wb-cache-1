40|$|The {{effect of}} the anti-rotating terms on the {{short-time}} evolution and the quantum Zeno (QZE) and anti-Zeno (AQZE) effects is studied for a two-level system coupled to a bosonic environment. A unitary transformation and perturbation theory are used to obtain the electron self-energy, energy shift and the enhanced QZE or the AQZE, simultaneously. The calculated Zeno time depends on the <b>atomic</b> transition <b>frequency</b> sensitively. When the <b>atomic</b> transition <b>frequency</b> is smaller than the central frequency of the spectrum of boson environment, the Zeno time is prolonged and the anti-rotating terms enhance the QZE; when it is larger than that the Zeno time is reduced and the anti-rotating terms enhance the AQZE.

40|$|Different {{possible}} uses of lasers in crossed beam {{experiments are}} examined. The scope {{is limited to}} low energy collisions (few tens of meV) between excited atoms and atoms or molecules. The first role of the laser {{in this kind of}} experiments is that of a selector, allowing either the preparation of the incoming channel or the analysis of the outcoming one, by selecting one definite atomic level (radiative or metastable), one class of velocities, one magnetic sublevel. In all these applications, the laser does not act on the collision process itself. The situation is quite different at high laser powers and frequencies detuned with respect to <b>atomic</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Some suggestions are made about the feasability of crossed beam studies of these laser-assisted collisions...|$|R
50|$|Inter-range {{instrumentation}} group time codes, {{commonly known}} as IRIG time codes, are standard formats for transferring timing information. <b>Atomic</b> <b>frequency</b> standards and GPS receivers designed for precision timing are often equipped with an IRIG output. The standards were created by the TeleCommunications Working Group of the U.S. military's Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG), the standards body of the Range Commanders Council.

50|$|All {{magneto-optical}} traps require {{at least}} one trapping laser plus any necessary repumper lasers (see above). These lasers need stability, rather than high power, requiring {{no more than the}} saturation intensity, but a linewidth much less than the Doppler width, usually several megahertz. Because of their low cost, compact size and ease of use, laser diodes are used for many of the standard MOT species while the linewidth and stability of these lasers is controlled using servo systems, which stabilises the lasers to an <b>atomic</b> <b>frequency</b> reference by using, for example, saturated absorption spectroscopy and the Pound-Drever-Hall technique to generate a locking signal.|$|E
5000|$|Movers are {{powerful}} telekinetics {{who are trained}} to identify the specific <b>atomic</b> <b>frequencies</b> of a given material and alter the gravitational field around it, usually causing the nearby air to appear [...] "warped". This allows them to move both animate and inanimate objects. Advanced Movers can work at the molecular level, creating shields in the air around them to deflect bullets or create power fists and kicks, a strike that delivers three times {{the power of a}} normal punch. Nick is a Mover, with his abilities at a basic level {{at the start of the}} film, developing Advanced abilities later on. Victor, Carver's right-hand man, is a more advanced Mover with abilities to create shields and power-strikes. Nick's father was also an advanced Mover.|$|R
40|$|We {{determine}} how a system {{composed of two}} nonidentical two-level atoms with different resonance frequencies and different damping rates could work as a nano-antenna for controlled mode switching and light routing. We calculate the angular distribution of the emitted field detected in a far-field zone of the system including the direct interatomic interactions and arbitrary linear dimensions of the system. The calculation is carried out {{in terms of the}} symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the two atom system. We find {{that as long as the}} atoms are identical, the emission cannot be switched between the symmetric and antisymmetric modes. The switching may occur when the atoms are non-identical and the emission can then be routed to different modes by changing the relative ratio of the <b>atomic</b> <b>frequencies,</b> or damping rates or by a proper tuning of the laser <b>frequency</b> to the <b>atomic</b> resonance <b>frequencies.</b> It is shown that in the case of atoms of different resonance frequencies but equal damping rates, the light routing is independent of the frequency of the driving laser field. It depends only on the sign of the detuning between the <b>atomic</b> resonance <b>frequencies.</b> In the case of atoms of different damping rates, the emission can be switched between different modes by changing the laser frequency from the blue to red detuned from the atomic resonance. The effect of the interatomic interactions is also considered and it is found that in the case of unequal resonance frequencies of the atoms, the interactions slightly modify the visibility of the intensity pattern. The case of unequal damping rates of the atoms is affected rather more drastically, the light routing becoming asymmetric under the dipole-dipole interaction with the enhanced intensities of the modes turned towards the atom of smaller damping rate.

By using the ground state of the total Hamiltonian, the evolution of the effective decay rate and the energy shift are calculated. When the <b>atomic</b> transition <b>frequency</b> is smaller than the central frequency of the spectrum, the Zeno effect dominates, and if the <b>atomic</b> transition <b>frequency</b> is larger than the central frequency, the anti-Zeno effect will dominate. The time evolution of the energy shift is obtained. The counter-rotating terms lead to a shift toward the low frequency region for the frequency distribution of the emitted photon...|$|R

5000|$|In 1955, the caesium {{atomic clock}} was invented. This {{provided}} {{a form of}} timekeeping that was both more stable and more convenient than astronomical observations. In 1956, the U.S. National Bureau of Standards and U.S. Naval Observatory started to develop <b>atomic</b> <b>frequency</b> time scales; by 1959, these time scales were used in generating the WWV time signals, named for the shortwave radio station that broadcasts them. In 1960, the U.S. Naval Observatory, the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and the UK National Physical Laboratory coordinated their radio broadcasts so time steps and frequency changes were coordinated, and the resulting time scale was informally referred to as [...] "Coordinated Universal Time".|$|E
50|$|The primary {{motivation}} {{behind the}} development of the atomic fountain derives from the Ramsey method of measuring the <b>frequency</b> of <b>atomic</b> transitions. In broad strokes, the Ramsey method involves exposing a cloud of atoms to a brief radiofrequency (rf) electromagnetic field; waiting a time T; briefly exposing the cloud to the rf field again; and then measuring what fraction of the atoms in the cloud have transitioned. If the frequency of the rf field is identical to the <b>atomic</b> transition <b>frequency,</b> 100% of the atoms will have transitioned; if the frequency of the field differs slightly from the transition frequency, some of the atoms will not have transitioned. By repeatedly sending clouds of atoms through such an apparatus, the frequency of the field can be adjusted to match the <b>atomic</b> transition <b>frequency.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{rotation}} of the Earth is somewhat irregular, and is very gradually slowing due to tidal acceleration. Furthermore, {{the length of the}} second was determined from observations of the Moon between 1750 and 1890. All of these factors cause the mean solar day, on the average, to be slightly longer than the nominal 86,400 SI seconds, the traditional number of seconds per day. As UT is slightly irregular in its rate, astronomers introduced Ephemeris Time, which has since been replaced by Terrestrial Time (TT). Because Universal Time is synchronous with night and day, and more precise atomic-frequency standards drift away from this, however, UT is still used to produce a correction (called a leap second) to atomic time, in order to obtain a broadcast form of civil time that carries <b>atomic</b> <b>frequency.</b> Thus, civil broadcast standards for time and frequency usually follow International Atomic Time closely, but occasionally step (or [...] "leap") in order to prevent them from drifting too far from mean solar time.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the power}} {{required}} to run the heater, OCXOs require more power than oscillators that run at ambient temperature, and the requirement for the heater, thermal mass, and thermal insulation means that they are physically larger. Therefore they are not used in battery powered or miniature applications, such as watches. However, in return, the oven-controlled oscillator achieves the best frequency stability possible from a crystal. The short term frequency stability of OCXOs is typically 1x10−12 over a few seconds, while the long term stability is limited to around 1x10−8 (10 ppb) per year by aging of the crystal. [...] Achieving better performance requires switching to an <b>atomic</b> <b>frequency</b> standard, such as a rubidium standard, caesium standard, or hydrogen maser. Another cheaper alternative is to discipline a crystal oscillator with a GPS time signal, creating a GPS-disciplined oscillator (GPSDO). Using a GPS receiver that can generate accurate time signals (down to within ~30 ns of UTC), a GPSDO can maintain oscillation accuracy of 10−13 for extended periods of time.|$|E

40|$|A common {{biquadratic}} {{potential for}} the Higgs field h and an additional scalar field ϕ, non minimally coupled to gravity, is considered in locally scale symmetric approaches to standard model fields in curved spacetime. A common ground state of the two scalar fields exists and couples both fields to gravity, more precisely to scalar curvature R. In Einstein gauge (ϕ = const, often called "Einstein frame"), also R is scaled to a constant. This condition makes perfect sense, even in the general case, in the Weyl geometric approach. There it has been called Weyl gauge, because it was first considered by Weyl in the different context of his original scale geometric theory of gravity of 1918.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the effects of relatively strong, periodic perturbations on the classical and quantum dynamics of excited hydrogen atoms and {{the relation between the}}se two dynamics. By considering a range of driving frequencies it is shown how the relative ratio of this to the unperturbed <b>atomic</b> <b>frequencies</b> affects the response and the relation between the classical and quantum dynamics. After providing an introduction to the system a brief overview of its behaviour in six different frequency regimes is given. This is followed by a detailed discussion of the response of a one-dimensional atom driven bya resonant field describing the subtle relations between the classical and quantum dynamics. This discussion is followed by a description of the more complex response of a three-dimensional hydrogen atom to a low frequency elliptically polarised field where, again, we demonstrate that the relative time scales of the system affect the dynamics in unexpected ways. ...|$|R
