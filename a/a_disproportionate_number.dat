5|$|The block {{voting system}} was used, with each peer casting as many votes {{as there were}} seats to be filled. The system, however, {{permitted}} the party with {{the greatest number of}} peers, normally the Conservatives, to procure <b>a</b> <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of seats, with opposing parties sometimes being left entirely unrepresented. The Lord Clerk Register was responsible for tallying the votes. The return issued by the Lord Clerk Register was sufficient evidence to admit the representative peers to Parliament; however, unlike other peers, Scottish representatives did not receive writs of summons.|$|E

25|$|The {{battle has}} {{frequently}} {{been compared to}} the Battle of Thermopylae, where a small Greek force faced a large Persian army of Xerxes (480 BC).

5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French {{troops would be}} soon returned by the Germans. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like doctors and nurses along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers of four or more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that <b>a</b> <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of prisoners who were released early came from the upper classes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is <b>a</b> <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Cornell {{admitted}} {{its first}} female students, {{making it the}} first coeducational school among {{what came to be}} known as the Ivy League. However, the admission of female students was limited until the construction of Sage Hall to serve as a women's dormitory in 1872. The requirement that women (at least freshman women) must live in dormitories, which started in 1884, served to constrain female student admissions until 1972, when Cornell dropped its freshman dorm residency requirement. As a result, the academic admission standards for women in each college were typically higher than the corresponding standards for men. In general, women have been over-represented in certain schools and under-represented in others. For example, the NYS College of Home Economics and the Cornell School of Nursing historically drew <b>a</b> <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of women students, while the College of Engineering attracted fewer women.|$|E
50|$|A {{genre of}} romance novels with male {{homosexual}} main characters. The category ranges from young adult, sci-fi, contemporary, paranormal, historical and erotic. After gaining popularity {{over the past}} ten years, male/male romance (aka mm romance or m/m romance) novels are now hitting mainstream best-seller lists. Although traditionally written by and for gay men, most contemporary gay romance novels have high female readerships. According to best selling author Aria Grace, approximately 90% of her readers are female. There is also <b>an</b> <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of female authors in this genre with {{more than half of the}} titles on Amazon's current best-selling list written by women.

5|$|There are no extant written {{records of}} the make-up of the broader {{categories}} of soldiers and sailors, but since the Mary Rose carried some 300 longbows and several thousand arrows {{there had to be}} a considerable proportion of longbow archers. Examination of the skeletal remains has found that there was <b>a</b> <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of men with a condition known as os acromiale, affecting their shoulder blades. This condition is known among modern elite archery athletes and is caused by placing considerable stress on the arm and shoulder muscles, particularly of the left arm that is used to hold the bow to brace against the pull on the bowstring. Among the men who died on the ship it was likely that some had practised using the longbow since childhood, and served on board as specialist archers.|$|E
5|$|Although still wary of one another, the Russian and Austrian commanders were {{satisfied}} with the result of their cooperation. They had outfought Frederick's army in a test of nerve, courage and military skills. Elizabeth of Russia promoted Saltykov to Generalfeldmarschall and awarded a special medal to everyone involved. She also sent a sword of honor to Laudon. The price of this rout, though, was high: 26 percent Austrian and Russian losses would not usually qualify as a victory. The storming of field works typically resulted in <b>a</b> <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of killed over wounded. The conclusion of the battle in hand-to-hand struggle also increased casualties on both sides. Finally, subsequent cavalry charges and the stampeding flight of men and horses had caused many more injuries. Regardless of the losses, though, Saltykov and Laudon remained on the field with intact armies, and with extant communications between one another. The Prussian defeat remained without consequences when the victors did not capitalize on the opportunity to march against Berlin, but retired to Saxony instead. If Saltykov had sought the coup de grâce in the last hour of the battle, he did not follow through with it.|$|E
5|$|The Batavi, a Germanic tribe, {{inhabited}} the region today known as Gelderland (Netherlands), in the Rhine river delta, {{then known as}} the Insula Batavorum ("Island of the Batavi", because surrounded by branches of the Rhine), part of the Roman province of Germania Inferior. They were a warlike people, skilled horsemen, boatmen and swimmers. In return for the unusual privilege of exemption from tributum (direct taxes on land and heads normally exacted from peregrini), they supplied <b>a</b> <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of recruits to the Julio-Claudian auxilia: one ala and eight cohortes. They also provided most of Augustus' elite personal bodyguard unit (the Germani corpore custodes), which continued in service until 68AD. The Batavi auxilia amounted to about 5,000 men, implying that during the entire Julio-Claudian period, over 50% of all Batavi males reaching military age (16 years) may have enlisted in the auxilia. Thus the Batavi, although just 0.05% {{of the total population}} of the empire of c. 70 million in 23AD, supplied about 4% of the total auxilia i.e. 80 times their proportionate share. They were regarded by the Romans as the very best (fortissimi, validissimi) of their auxiliary, and indeed all, their forces. In Roman service, both their cavalry and infantry had perfected a technique for swimming across rivers wearing full armour and weapons.|$|E

The Mazhabi Sikhs and Ramdasias continued their service with the SLI in the new army. The SLI has served in {{almost all of the}} post-1947 conflicts involving India, including the wars with Pakistan in 1947, 1965 and 1971, the Hyderabad Police Action of 1948 and the Chinese aggression in 1962.

5|$|Students of Confucian {{studies were}} {{potential}} {{candidates for the}} imperial examinations, the graduates {{of which could be}} appointed as state bureaucrats in the local, provincial, and central government. There were two types of exams that were given, mingjing ('illuminating the classics examination') and jinshi ('presented scholar examination'). The mingjing was based upon the Confucian classics and tested the student's knowledge of a broad variety of texts. The jinshi tested a student's literary abilities in writing essay-style responses to questions on matters of governance and politics, as well as their skills in composing poetry. Candidates were also judged on their skills of deportment, appearance, speech, and level of skill in calligraphy, all of which were subjective criteria that allowed the already wealthy members of society to be chosen over ones of more modest means who were unable to be educated in rhetoric or fanciful writing skills. There was <b>a</b> <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of civil officials coming from aristocratic as opposed to non-aristocratic families. The exams were open to all male subjects whose fathers were not of the artisan or merchant classes, although having wealth or noble status was not a prerequisite in receiving a recommendation. In order to promote widespread Confucian education, the Tang government established state-run schools and issued standard versions of the Five Classics with selected commentaries.|$|E

Only 8,700 of these servicemen were ordered to South Vietnam, a tiny 0.3% of the total American military personnel who actually served there. Furthermore, <b>a</b> greatly <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of famous, wealthy, or politically connected young men received hard to get places in the National Guard or Reserves during Vietnam, including 360 professional athletes such as Bill Bradley and Nolan Ryan.|$|R
40|$|Are young {{consumers}} {{easier to}} attract? We {{shed some light}} on the presumption that younger consumers are less loyal to brands and more willing than older consumers to try new brands. Analysis of 230 brands from 12 categories revealed a tendency for new and growing brands to skew towards younger consumers. This suggests that younger consumers are slightly easier for brands to attract. The most plausible explanation is that younger consumers {{are more likely to be}} new buyers of the category. We therefore caution that our results do not support a marketing strategy strongly targeting younger consumers. If a brand grows, then it is likely to attract <b>a</b> slightly <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of younger consumers. However, it does not follow that, if it seeks largely to attract younger consumers, it will grow. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{percentage}} of women in BS attainment {{in science and engineering}} continued to increase over time, but they were likely to find themselves without the female faculty needed for optimal role models.

40|$|Many {{systems that}} learn from {{examples}} express the learned concept as a disjunction. Those disjuncts that cover {{only a few}} examples {{are referred to as}} small disjuncts. The problem with small disjuncts is that they have a much higher error rate than large disjuncts but are necessary to achieve a high level of predictive accuracy. This paper investigates the effect of noise on small disjuncts. In particular, we show that when noise is added to two real-world domains, <b>a</b> significant, and <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of the total errors are contributed by the small disjuncts; thus, in the presence of noise, it is the small disjuncts that are primarily responsible for the poor predictive accuracy of the learned concept. 1 INTRODUCTION Systems that learn from examples often express the learned concept as a disjunction.

Mesenteric perfusion is altered by primary endothelial dysfunction, which may further be exacerbated by the use of vasoconstrictors during CPB; inflammatory mediators can 'prime' the mesenteric vasculature. Cardiac surgery with or without CPB is associated with increased tissue oxygen demands, particularly by the splanchnic bed. The disparity in general and regional oxygen supply and demand results in the development of mucosal hypoxia and this cannot be attributed to CPB alone. This injury is measurable by reductions in both absorptive and barrier functions of the gut. Protection may be conferred by modulating the perfusion protocol during bypass and pharmacological interventions which modify the inflammatory response to surgery...|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised internationally {{about the role of}} the media in {{influencing}} public opinion and by implication, social policy on mental health issues. In particular, anxieties have been expressed that an 'excessive' focus by the news media on violence in association with mental illness may reinforce pre-existing stereotypes and by escalating public concerns lead to the adoption of policies which place a high priority on the safety of the public. Such assertions are often contained in the numerous studies that record <b>a</b> seemingly <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of stories featuring violence in association with mental health. What is, however, almost invariably lacking is a developed theory of agency that explains how or why such depictions of mental illness might exert an influence on social policy. This paper critically examines the potential significance of the way in which responsibility for events is constructed for social policy by means of a discourse analysis, inspired by the genealogical work of Michel Foucault. It uses the device of 'frames' originally developed by Goffman to explore the nature of newspaper coverage of two deaths to which causal responsibility for changes in the nature of English social policy in mental health has been attributed. Results presented suggest that attempts to assert a causal influence between media coverage and changes in the nature of social policy must engage with the question of agency...|$|R
40|$|The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA), {{enacted in}} November 1997, {{represents}} {{a shift in}} federal child welfare philosophy from an emphasis on reunification of {{children in foster care}} with their biological families toward an emphasis on adoption. The promotion of ASFA and the critique of family preservation policy is framed as a defense of children¹s rights. The debate surrounding the law pitted children¹s interests against the state¹s interest in keeping families together, and children¹s right to be safe against parents¹ right to custody of their children. This paper uses the perceived antagonism between children¹s rights and family preservation policies to explore the politics of children¹s rights. I argue that there are both pragmatic and philosophical flaws in ASFA¹s emphasis on adoption that undermine the claim that the law advances children¹s rights. America¹s foster care problem stems more from the removal of too many children from their homes than from the failure to place enough children in adoptive homes. I also argue that the passage of ASFA reflected contemporary developments in race and class politics, particularly welfare reform and changes in federal policy on transracial adoption. <b>A</b> grossly <b>disproportionate</b> <b>number</b> of children placed in substitute care are poor and Black. I conclude by making a case for injecting a deliberate attention to social justice in discussions about children¹s rights. ...|$|R
