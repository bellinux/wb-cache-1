5|$|There {{has been}} a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980, {{although}} the Scandinavian population is growing. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both <b>are</b> <b>arriving</b> in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} similar hypothesis was advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. He contends that more comets <b>are</b> <b>arriving</b> {{in the inner}} Solar System from a particular region of the postulated Oort cloud than {{can be explained by}} the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit. This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had defined it.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} in {{the south}} and west of Europe and south of latitude 40°N are mainly resident, although other populations migrate from regions where the winter is harsh, the ground frozen and food scarce. Large numbers of birds from northern Europe, Russia and Ukraine migrate south westwards or south eastwards. In the autumn, when immigrants <b>are</b> <b>arriving</b> from eastern Europe, many of Britain's common starlings are setting off for Iberia and North Africa. Other groups of birds are in passage across the country and the pathways of these different streams of bird may cross. Of the 15,000 birds ringed as nestlings in Merseyside, England, individuals have been recovered at various times of year as far afield as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Germany and the Low Countries. Small numbers of common starling have sporadically been observed in Japan and Hong Kong but it is unclear from where these birds originated. In North America, northern populations have developed a migration pattern, vacating much of Canada in winter. Birds in the east of the country move southwards, and those from further west winter {{in the south}}west of the US.|$|E
50|$|In {{enclosed}} rooms {{not only}} the direct sound from a sound source <b>is</b> <b>arriving</b> at the listener's ears, but also sound which has been reflected at the walls. The auditory system analyses only the direct sound, which <b>is</b> <b>arriving</b> first, for sound localization, but not the reflected sound, which <b>is</b> <b>arriving</b> later (law of the first wave front). So sound localization remains possible even in an echoic environment. This echo cancellation occurs in the Dorsal Nucleus of the Lateral Lemniscus (DNLL).|$|R

5|$|There is a migratory {{divide in}} Europe at {{longitude}} 10–11°E. Birds {{to the west}} of this line head southwest towards Iberia or West Africa, whereas populations to the east migrate to the eastern Mediterranean and on to East Africa. Cross-breeding in captivity of birds from the resident population on the Canary Islands with migratory blackcaps from Germany showed the urge to migrate is genetically controlled, the offspring showing intermediate behaviour in terms of restlessness at migration time. Similar experiments using birds from southern Germany and eastern Austria, {{on opposite sides of the}} migratory divide, demonstrated that the direction of migration is also genetically determined. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both <b>are</b> <b>arriving</b> in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s.

The Serbian people withdrew alongside their army and many retreated to Niš, where news of Belgrade's fall was greeted [...] "impassively", {{as it had been}} [...] "expected {{since the beginning of the}} war". Albin Kutschbach, a German agent in Niš, reported: [...] "More refugees <b>are</b> <b>arriving</b> by the day, and despite many people being sent on south, there are certainly still 60,000 people here." [...] Germany responded to the capture of Belgrade with delight and sent a congratulatory telegram to the Austro-Hungarian leadership. The Austro-Hungarians ascertained that their war with Serbia would soon be over and began preparing for the country's occupation. On 2 December, the anniversary of Franz Joseph's 66th year on the throne, Potiorek wrote that he was [...] "laying town and fortress Belgrade at His Majesty's feet".|$|E

[...] Rilke depicted the six artists about to begin their performance, and that they were used as a symbol of [...] "human activity... always travelling and with no fixed abode, they are even a shade more fleeting than the rest of us, whose fleetingness was lamented." [...] Further, Rilke in the poem described these figures as standing on a [...] "threadbare carpet" [...] to suggest [...] "the ultimate loneliness and isolation of Man in this incomprehensible world, practicing their profession from childhood to death as playthings of an unknown will... before their 'pure too-little' had passed into 'empty too-much.'" ...|$|E
