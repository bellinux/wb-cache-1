5|$|Unlike the oval-shaped {{eye socket}} of Tanystropheus, the eye socket of Dinocephalosaurus {{appears to be}} peach-shaped, with a narrow {{anterior}} end. On {{the top of the}} skull, the parietal is broad and flattened, bearing no trace of the midline crest found in Tanystropheus. The jugal only has two processes, missing the third backward-projecting process present in most other reptiles. Also missing are the retroarticular process of the posterior (rear) lower jaw (<b>another</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> distinction from Tanystropheus), as well as additional teeth and a cavity between the pterygoid bones on the palate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> {{contention}} {{came from}} the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned {{in the general population}} since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law {{less than a year later}} amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a Companhia Correcional (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb on the practice, as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the Companhia Correcional but not have any change in their daily routines.|$|E
5|$|Ra's {{enemies are}} {{the forces of}} chaos, which {{threaten}} maat, the cosmic order that he creates. They include both humans who spread disorder and cosmic powers like Apep, the embodiment of chaos, whom Ra and the gods who accompany him in his barque are said to combat every night. The malevolent gaze of Apep's own Eye is a potent weapon against Ra, and Ra's Eye {{is one of the}} few powers that can counteract it. Some unclear passages in the Coffin Texts suggest that Apep was thought capable of injuring or stealing the Eye of Ra from its master during the combat. In other texts, the Eye's fiery breath assists in Apep's destruction. This apotropaic function of the Eye of Ra is <b>another</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> overlap with the Eye of Horus, which was similarly believed to ward off evil.|$|E

5|$|Being in {{the genus}} Acinonyx, the {{morphology}} of the cheetah differs notably {{from the big}} cats (genus Panthera). The face and the jaw are unusually shortened and the sagittal crest is poorly developed, possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed. In fact, the skull resembles that of the smaller cats. <b>Another</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> similarity to the small cats is the long and flexible spine, {{in contrast to the}} stiff and short one of other large felids. A 2001 study of felid morphology stated that the truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in the cheetah at a relatively younger age than other felids could be a major reason for the peculiar morphology of the cheetah. Interestingly, the cheetah appears to show convergent evolution with canids in morphology as well as behaviour. For example, the cheetah has a relatively long snout, long legs and deep chest, tough foot pads and blunt, semi-retractable claws; moreover, its hunting behaviour resembles that of canids. In the 2001 study, it was observed that the claws of cheetah have features intermediate between those of felids and the wolf. In the Puma lineage, the cheetah's skull morphology {{is similar to that of}} the pumaboth have short, wide skullswhile that of the jaguarundi is different.|$|E
5|$|Other {{distinguishing}} {{features of the}} false potto are in the dentition. Sarmiento notes, however, that captive specimens may develop abnormalities in the teeth and that some dental characters Schwartz uses are quite variable, sometimes even {{from one side of}} the same individual to another. The third upper molar (M3) is more reduced in the false potto than in any other prosimian, according to Schwartz, but Leon notes that western pottos also have a relatively small M3. The third upper premolar (P3) is also reduced, resembling the condition in the fork-marked lemurs (Phaner). Stump writes that small P3s are also common in western pottos, although the false potto's P3 is shaped differently. Groves notes that P1 is quite long, <b>another</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> similarity with the fork-marked lemurs. The lower premolars are compressed laterally in Pseudopotto, the cusps on the cheekteeth are higher, and the cristid obliqua (a crest connected to the protoconid cusp) is at a relatively buccal position (in the direction of the cheeks).|$|E
5|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the 2011 Orange Bowl focused on {{the manner in which the}} two teams involved had reversed their fortunes during the 2010 college football season. Stanford had its longest winning streak since 1991 its most wins in history, and was four years removed from a one-win season, while Virginia Tech became the first team in college football history to win 11 consecutive games in a season after losing its first two. The two teams had never played each other, but they shared a common 2010 opponent, Wake Forest. Before the Orange Bowl, Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said he didn't see much difference in quality. <b>Another</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> conversation was the poor performance of the ACC in nonconference games and Virginia Tech's poor past performance against teams ranked in the top 5. The Hokies had won just one of 27 games against teams in that category. Partially because of this factor, spread bettors favored Stanford by three points when the first odds were released December 10, a margin that various organizations either kept constant or raised to 3.5 points by the day of the game. It was the first time all season the Hokies were point spread underdogs.|$|E

5|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the game focused {{on the fact that the}} 2009 Orange Bowl was Cincinnati's first Bowl Championship Series game in school history. For Virginia Tech, coverage focused on the Hokies' winless history in BCS games since 1995, as Tech had lost all four of its appearances in a BCS game since an upset win over Texas in the 1995 Sugar Bowl. Also mentioned was the fact that the two teams had faced each other in the 1947 Sun Bowl, which had been each school's first bowl game. The low win rate of ACC teams in general was <b>another</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> interest. Teams from the conference had won just one of their ten appearances in a BCS bowl before the Orange Bowl. Before the Orange Bowl matchup, the two teams last played in 2006, when the Hokies defeated the Bearcats, 29–13, at Virginia Tech's home field, Lane Stadium. For the Orange Bowl, spread bettors favored a reversal of that 2006 final, as Cincinnati was initially favored by one point. This expanded to 1.5 points by December 9. The trend toward Cincinnati continued, and on December 27, betting organizations gave Cincinnati the edge by two or two and a half points.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{independence}} in 1948, G. G. Ponnambalam and his All Ceylon Tamil Congress joined D. S. Senanayake's moderate, western-oriented United National Party led government {{which led to}} a split in the Tamil Congress. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, the leader of the splinter Federal Party (FP or Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi), contested the Ceylon Citizenship Act, which denied citizenship to Tamils of recent Indian origin, before the Supreme Court, and then in the Privy council in England, but failed to overturn it. The FP eventually became the dominant Tamil political party. In response to the Sinhala Only Act in 1956, which made Sinhala the sole official language, Federal Party Members of Parliament staged a nonviolent sit-in (satyagraha) protest, but it was violently broken up by a mob. The FP was blamed and briefly banned after the riots of May–June 1958 targeting Tamils, in which many were killed and thousands forced to flee their homes. <b>Another</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> conflict between the communities was state sponsored colonisation schemes that effectively changed the demographic balance in the Eastern Province, an area Tamil nationalists considered to be their traditional homeland, in favour of the majority Sinhalese.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbits of}} the Halley-type comets {{suggest that they}} were {{originally}} long-period comets whose orbits were perturbed by {{the gravity of the}} giant planets and directed into the inner Solar System. If Halley was once a long-period comet, it is likely to have originated in the Oort Cloud, a sphere of cometary bodies that has an inner edge of 20,000–50,000 AU. Conversely the Jupiter-family comets are generally believed to originate in the Kuiper belt, a flat disc of icy debris between 30 AU (Neptune's orbit) and 50 AU from the Sun (in the scattered disc). <b>Another</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> origin for the Halley-type comets was proposed in 2008, when a trans-Neptunian object with a retrograde orbit similar to Halley's was discovered, , whose orbit takes it from just outside that of Uranus to twice the distance of Pluto. It may be a member of a new population of small Solar System bodies that serves as the source of Halley-type comets.|$|E

25|$|American Doll Posse was {{met with}} {{generally}} favourable reviews, with most criticism being directed not at the musical content, but towards the extensive concept as a potential turn-off for casual listeners. <b>Another</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> critique for some reviewers was the album's 23 tracks and long running time.
