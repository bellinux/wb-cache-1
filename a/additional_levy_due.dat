50|$|A levy in {{the form}} of {{garnishment}} upon wages {{is considered to be a}} continuous levy, i.e. it needs to be applied only once and will be applicable to future wages until either released by the IRS under §6343 or the debt is fully paid. So as future wages are earned, no <b>additional</b> <b>levy</b> action is necessary by the IRS to take a large portion from them. Distinguish this from a bank account levy. Once the money in the bank account has been sent by the bank to the IRS, any future deposits can only be reached with <b>additional</b> <b>levy</b> action by the IRS.|$|R

Individuals can take out {{health insurance to}} cover out-of-pocket costs, with either a plan that covers just selected services, to a full coverage plan.

50|$|In {{the course}} of Hohenzollern power {{politics}} Joachim Nestor and his brother {{managed to get the}} latter, Albert of Mainz, first onto the sees of Magdeburg and then its suffragan of Halberstadt, both prince-bishoprics also comprising princely territories. Since prince-episcopal sees were so influential, competing candidates usually ran for them. A candidature could turn into a bribery competition, without ever knowing exactly how much competitors paid to obtain office. The expenditures involved, as far as they exceeded one's own potential, were usually advanced by creditors and had then to be recovered by <b>levying</b> <b>dues</b> from the subjects and parishioners in the prince-bishoprics and dioceses that were just acquired. The acquisition in 1514 of the very influential Prince-Archbishopric-Electorate of Mainz for Albert was a coup that provided the Hohenzollerns with control over two of the seven electoral votes in imperial elections and many suffragan dioceses to <b>levy</b> <b>dues.</b>|$|R

This article examines the EUÂ’s record on sugar and finds little evidence to substantiate the claim. However, world prices increased between the base period (1986 - 88) and the date of implementation (1995), and so tariffication resulted in an increase in the tax that would have been charged on sugar imports into the EU.

Selected for analysis are the 3 / 2 -stable and Gamma marginal Lévy measures, along with Clayton, Gumbel, and Complementary Gumbel Lévy versions of ordinary [probability] copulas, with the last two being here introduced. A relationship between the original coupled subordinated processes and the terminal dependency relationship between the simulated variables is observed and calibrated. Normal inverse Gaussian and tempered stable measures are also noted, as are <b>additional</b> <b>Lévy</b> copulas constructed from the Gumbel and Frank ordinary copulas, with some analysis and suggestion for using them in future research. 1...|$|R

Verne Gagne shares the record of four championship reigns, with three different partners: Leo Nomellini, Bronco Nagurski, and Butch <b>Levy.</b> <b>Due</b> to lack of details surrounding various championship changes, it is uncertain which team had the shortest reign; Herb and Seymore Freeman's reign of seven days is the shortest confirmed reign, but the possibility exists that another team had a shorter reign. The last reign was also the longest reign, as Murder Inc. held the championship for 193 days before being awarded the AWA World Tag Team Championship.|$|R

50|$|According to the 2006 Census report, the Thai working {{force in}} Hong Kong forms about 7,414 people {{out the whole}} Thai {{population}} of 11,900 in Hong Kong. 71.9% of the working force consists of domestic helpers, whose median income is $4,000. However, Thai domestic helpers are being replaced by Indonesian workers because the latter’s demand of wages is lower and their ability of speaking Cantonese is higher. Losing those two advantages, except for those Thai domestic helpers who can speak Cantonese, the Thai domestic helpers cannot occupy the mainstream market in Hong Kong. The minimum wage for domestic helpers in Hong Kong is HKD3,270 , adjusted downwards from HKD3,670; an <b>additional</b> <b>levy</b> on the salary {{is supposed to be}} paid by the employer, but the Thai Ministry of Labour reported in 2005 that employers often forced the employee to pay this levy instead.|$|R

This legislation has increased the production costs of poultry meat. At {{the same time the}} EU is negotiating with other countries or groups of countries to liberalise trade in agricultural products. This report examines how lowering import levies impacts the competitiveness of the EU poultry industry. The results show that the offer price of broiler breast fillet in 2011 of some third countries was already below the average EU price. Despite the current import levy on breast fillet, these third countries can be competitive in the EU market. In a scenario with 50 % lower import <b>levies</b> and no <b>additional</b> <b>levy,</b> Brazil, Argentina, the USA, Ukraine and Thailand have a lower offer price for breast fillet than the EU poultry meat industry...|$|R
