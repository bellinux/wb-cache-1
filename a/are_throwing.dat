25|$|Despite their {{insistence that}} they would not let sex with each other affect their friendship, Zack and Miri soon develop romantic {{feelings}} for each other. When it comes time for Zack and Miri to have sex on camera, they find that instead of the clinical sex enacted by the actors in the other scenes, their interlude is romantic and heartfelt. Later the next evening, Zack and Miri are at home tentatively about to discuss their reactions to the scene, when suddenly their apartment's electricity and water service return. The rest of the actors and crew reveal that they pooled their resources to pay one month of Zack and Miri's bills and <b>are</b> <b>throwing</b> them an early wrap party.|$|E
500|$|Back in Scranton, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{tries to}} protect Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{from a group}} of kids who <b>are</b> <b>throwing</b> pine cones at her, and a young girl, [...] "Tiffany" [...] (Caitlin Williams), punches him, giving him a black eye. Andy tells his {{co-workers}} that he stepped in when a [...] "gang" [...] harassed Pam, and Pam plays along out of gratitude to Andy. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) arranges a meeting in the conference room to discuss self-defense. Andy is then humiliated when Tiffany is brought in by her mother (Tig Notaro) and half-apologizes to him and Pam. Kelly asks Toby to demonstrate how to defend oneself when being attacked by a girl, and begins physically harassing him; Andy steps in between the two to break the fight up, resulting in his other eye being blackened. The rest of the office laughs but shuts up when Andy points out he got hit twice because he defended other people who were being attacked. The episode concludes with Andy noting that he took a bunch of pain medication, drank a bottle of wine, and took his pants off, thus greatly improving his feelings as the day ends.|$|E

In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate, Tom Nero's name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom. The absence of parish officers who should be controlling the boys is an intentional rebuke on Hogarth's part; he agreed with Henry Fielding that one of the causes for the rising crime rate was the lack of care from the overseers of the poor, who were too often interested in the posts only for the social status and monetary rewards they could bring.|$|E

When Gates assumed command of the Northern Department in August 1777, Stewart wrote him, [...] "You can't Imagine my Dear Sir, the Satisfaction it gives me your being sent back to your proper Command. It is so great a thing, to get the better so Nobly of that petty party, for I can call them by no other Name." [...] In another letter to Gates, he wrote of his fellow Pennsylvanian Anthony Wayne having to dig trenches, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>throwing</b> up a few works at Wilmington, where Wayne is like a mad bear, it falling to his brigade.

2500|$|On March 25, 2007, New York Daily News {{reported}} that an unnamed Queens drug dealer, after being arrested, alleged that Sean Bell had shot him {{the previous year}} on July 13, 2006, over a drug turf dispute. Police sources called the drug dealer's account credible but could {{not rule out the}} possibility that he falsely identified Sean Bell to garner favor with authorities. The attorney representing the Bell family, Nicole Paultre, and the two other occupants of the vehicle who were wounded during the shooting denounced this development, saying, [...] "We expected them to throw dirt at us, and they <b>are</b> <b>throwing</b> dirt at us." [...] NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau detectives say the dealer's tale has no direct bearing on the police shooting of Bell, though some legal experts have noted that it could help the defense by portraying Sean Bell as possibly armed and dangerous.|$|E

2500|$|La Pintada is {{an archaeological}} zone located [...] {{south of the}} city and was a refuge area for the Seri and Pima Indians. The site is {{important}} because of its caves, which were used as dwellings, burial spaces and religious centers. The caves shelter paintings that contain numerous animals such as deer, birds and lizards as well as human figures. The human figures are stylized and some appear to be adorned with skins and/or horns, other <b>are</b> <b>throwing</b> spears and some appear to be dancing, wearing body paint. In addition there are geometric figures such as squares, triangles, circles, straight and wavy lines, all of which combine {{in one way or another}} to form complicated designs. In some areas of the caves there is evidence of paintings on top of paintings, testifying to the length of time the area was inhabited. The paintings have been attributed to the Comca'ac or Seri culture.|$|E
2500|$|The {{efforts were}} {{successful}} - the Lithuanians became the champions of Europe {{for the first}} time, defeating all their opponents and with Talzūnas being picked as the tournament's most valuable player. Following the final victory over Italy, the famous Lithuanian tenor Kipras Petrauskas even interrupted his performance at the State Theatre to joyfully announce {{the triumph of the}} national basketball team. The crowd then rose to their feet and together sang the Lithuanian anthem. The team returned to a warm reception, with thousands gathering at a train station in a way Kriaučiūnas compared to [...] "like we, here in America, greet the president." [...] Basketball regained its ground immediately, and had its popularity rise abruptly, especially among students. Gymnasium teams from almost all counties competed in student games, teams were assembled in firms and basketball courts appeared all around the country. According to future player Stepas Butautas, [...] "In every yard hoops are being made from barrels. Children, teenagers <b>are</b> <b>throwing</b> balls into them, others - even a sock crammed with clouts. Our Veršvai Primary School teacher K. Požemecka built two poles, made hoops from a willow and said: 'We will play basketball'." [...] Future team coach Vladas Garastas added that [...] "as kids we started using a barrel to make a hoop. We didn't have a ball, we stuffed in grass or whatever we could find".|$|E
2500|$|The Coriolis force {{exists only}} when one uses a {{rotating}} reference frame. In the rotating frame it behaves {{exactly like a}} real force (that is to say, it causes acceleration and has real effects). However, the Coriolis force {{is a consequence of}} inertia, and is not attributable to an identifiable originating body, as is the case for electromagnetic or nuclear forces, for example. From an analytical viewpoint, to use Newton's second law in a rotating system, the Coriolis force is mathematically necessary, but it disappears in a non-accelerating, inertial frame of reference. For example, consider two children on opposite sides of a spinning roundabout (Merry-go-round [...] ), who <b>are</b> <b>throwing</b> a ball to each other. From the children's point of view, this ball's path is curved sideways by the Coriolis force. Suppose the roundabout spins anticlockwise when viewed from above. From the thrower's perspective, the deflection is to the right. From the non-thrower's perspective, deflection is to the left. For a mathematical formulation see Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces. In meteorology, a rotating frame (the Earth) with its Coriolis force provides a more natural framework for explanation of air movements than a non-rotating, inertial frame without Coriolis forces. In long-range gunnery, sight corrections for the Earth's rotation are based upon the Coriolis force. These examples are described in more detail below.|$|E

2500|$|From 1989 to 1990, the Najibullah {{government}} was partially successful in {{building up the}} Afghan defence forces. The Ministry of State Security had established a local milita force which stood at an estimated 100,000 men. The 17th Division in Herat, which had begun the 1979 Herat uprising against PDPA-rule, stood at 3,400 regular troops and 14,000 tribal men. In 1988, {{the total number of}} security forces available to the government stood at 300,000. This trend did not continue, and by the summer of 1990, the Afghan government forces were on the defensive again. By the beginning of 1991, the government controlled only 10 percent of Afghanistan, the eleven-year Siege of Khost had ended in a mujahideen victory and the morale of the Afghan military finally collapsed. In the Soviet Union, Kryuchkov and Shevardnadze had both supported continuing aid to the Najibullah government, but Kryuchkov had been arrested following the failed 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt and Shevardnadze had resigned from his posts in the Soviet government in December 1990 – there were no longer any pro-Najibullah people in the Soviet leadership and the Soviet Union {{was in the middle of}} an economic and political crisis, which would lead directly to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991. At the same time Boris Yeltsin became Russia's new hope, and he had no wish to continue to aid Najibullah's government, which he considered a relic of the past. In the autumn of 1991, Najibullah wrote to Shevardnadze [...] "I didn't want to be president, you talked me into it, insisted on it, and promised support. Now you <b>are</b> <b>throwing</b> me and the Republic of Afghanistan to its fate." ...|$|E
