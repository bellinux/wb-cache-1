For that reason, insect proof packages will be asked by manufacturers and packers. Research work has revealed that infestation of packed foods will be caused exclusively by untight and defective package closures.

40|$|Restorative {{dentistry}} {{is mainly}} based on good ad-hesion between restorative materials and dental substrates; while adhesion to enamel is generally reliable, adhesion to dentin is less predictable (1) {{because of the}} presence of dentinal tubulis and the perfusion of liquids from it. Adhesion to dentin requires demineralization of peritubular and intertubular dentin to replace the demineralized layer of dentin with monomers. The main role of adhesive materials is to insure good adhesion between tooth tissues and restora-tive materials while maintaining good marginal seal. Formation of hybrid layer between adhesive mate-rial and dentin depends on penetration of mono-mers through collagen fibers, this can be seen with total etch adhesive techniques. The obstacle with this technique is the collapse of collagen fibers due to rinsing and air drying proce-dures after the application of acid which makes the use of total etch <b>adhesive</b> <b>technique</b> sensitive and results in poor penetration of monomers to the full depth of the demineralized layer of dentin. Because of the complexity and sensitivity of total etch <b>adhesive</b> <b>technique,</b> a new generation of den-tal bonding was needed and self-etch adhesive was introduced.

30|$|The {{substances}} {{tested in}} this study (petroleum jelly and hydrosoluble gel) are {{the most widely used}} substances in clinical practice when lubrication/isolation of the root canal walls is required. Irrespective of the cleaning condition, the hydrosoluble gel group presented higher bond strength values and this might be explained because the hydrosoluble gel can be removed from the root canal walls during the etch-and-rinse steps of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>technique</b> for post cementation. Clinicians that use petroleum jelly as lubricant material may not be aware that this product reduces (according to our study) almost 30 % of the bond strength of a cemented relined glass fiber post.|$|E
30|$|Petroleum jelly is {{insoluble}} {{in water}} and can only be dissolved with products that cannot be used into the root canal such as ether, benzene, chloroform, carbon sulfide, benzene and essence of turpentine. This is important because unlike hydrosoluble gel, the etch-and-rinse steps of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>technique</b> for post cementation {{is not able to}} completely remove the petroleum jelly remnants of the root canal walls. The use of paper points for the petroleum jelly groups seems to be insufficient to remove all the substance from the root canal walls and the use of a substance that dissolves petroleum jelly could provide higher values of bond strength, but this substance remains to be tested.|$|E

40|$|Restoration of endodontically treated teeth {{is still}} {{considered}} a challenge. When restoring endodontically treated teeth, the majority of failures appeared {{to be due to}} biomechanical or restorative rather than biological reasons. Thanks to the breakthrough of adhesive dentistry, guidelines for restoration of endodontically treated teeth may be revised, in the light of a less invasive approach. The ultimate goal of contemporary <b>adhesive</b> <b>techniques</b> is to preserve as much as possible sound tissue and to use restorative materials with mechanical properties similar to that of dentin {{in order to reduce the}} occurrence of severe not-restorable failures and enhance the longevity of the restored tooth. Aim of this study was was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo efficiency of fiber post-and-core restorations. For this purpose, in vitro research was carried out to evaluate the bonding effectiveness of fiber-posts cemented with <b>adhesive</b> <b>techniques</b> and the bio-mechanical behaviour of endodontically treated teeth. Besides, a randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to compare the durability of alternative <b>adhesive</b> <b>techniques</b> to the cast post-and-core, the so-called gold-standard. First, techniques for restoration of endodontically treated teeth were reviewed along with an in-depth discussion on the types and causes of failure. It is clear that several factors may affect bonding into the root canal and the biomechanical behaviour of endodontically treated teeth, and therefore its clinical success. Six different post systems available into the market were analyzed with regard to mechanical properties and structural characteristics. Afterwards, the influence of different adhesive approaches on both the adhesion into the root canal and sealing ability of fiber post bonding was evaluated. Although it is well known that adhesive cementation of fiber post increases post retention and reduces micro-leakage at the interfaces, bonding to root dentin is still a challenge, due to the difficult control of the adhesive procedures and the unfavorable configuration of the root canal. Although etch-and-rinse adhesive systems proved to be the most effective ones when bonding to coronal dentin, their efficacy into the deep root canal appears to be questionable. The more user-friendly and less technique-sensitive self-adhesive cements, that do not require etch and rinse steps, may replace them for fiber post bonding. Nevertheless, in order to achieve a durable bonding at the post-cement-dentin interface, specific combinations of adhesive systems and fiber posts should be carefully evaluated, along with pre-treatments of the substrates. Next we analyzed the biomechanical behavior of endodontically treated teeth restored with <b>adhesive</b> <b>techniques</b> with or without the use of a post. Since failure usually occurs because of cyclic loading during clinical function, fatigue testing still remains, in vitro, the more accurate tool to evaluate biomechanical behavior of post-endodontic restorations. It has been reported that avoiding extra-removal of sound tooth structure, at both the root and coronal level, rather than placing a fiber post, can protect endodontically treated teeth against catastrophic failure. In particular, a circumferential ferrule of 2 mm in height led to the highest fatigue-fracture resistance regardless the use of a fiber post. However, when no ferrule can be used, a fiber-post may improve the retention and fatigue resistance of the restoration. Moreover, since bonding appears to be more predictable at the coronal third of the root, adhesively luted posts may not need to be inserted as deep into the root canal as metallic posts conventionally are, thus yielding a less invasive approach. Besides, no influence of the adhesive approach on the fatigue resistance was observed in this study, where the self-etch and the innovative self-adhesive composite cements performed equally well. Finally, in a randomized controlled clinical trial, the cast gold post-and-core and alternative <b>adhesive</b> <b>techniques</b> were compared. Up to 3 -years, results were very encouraging, since a few failures occurred and the ensuing overall success/survival rates ranged between the 91. 7 and 97. 2 %. Although longer follow-up times are needed to evaluate which post-and-core system is the most reliable-one for a long term treatment, it could be speculated that preserving the tooth structure may be crucial for the success of the restoration and that the anterior region may be more at risk of failure. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In the 25 {{years since}} the first resin-bonded {{prosthesis}} was described, this <b>adhesive</b> <b>technique</b> for splinting mobile teeth has developed into a conservative method for replacing missing teeth. There was a high debond rate associated with the early resin-bonded prostheses, which led many clinicians to question their clinical appropriateness for long-term use. These early failures were attributed to the limited bond strength between the metalwork and etched enamel. Despite improvements in the adhesive bond strengths, there was still an unacceptable number of clinical debonds. The biomechanical design of resin-bonded prostheses did not develop with the same rapidity or with the same predictability as did the advancements with the associated adhesive technology. Through ongoing development, studies have shown various biomechanical designs that may improve clinical retention.

30|$|Laser {{manufacturers}} are nowadays {{driven by the}} wide variety of laser applications to build compact and robust devices that are able to perform in more stringent conditions [1]. To fulfill such demands, the common assembling techniques using clamping or adhesive means have to be substituted with more sophisticated approaches which enable components miniaturization (making them unsuitable for clamping methods), and more robust manufacturing that could offer a higher operational thermal range, vacuum compatibility or even the ability to withstand space radiation (making them unsuitable for <b>adhesive</b> <b>techniques)</b> [2]. Techniques such as solderjet bumping can attune to the utilization of a minimized input of thermal energy, allowing for the assembly of brittle materials such as glasses, crystals or ceramics. This guarantees the possibility of components miniaturization while still assuring highly robust bond strength [3].|$|R
30|$|The {{advantages}} of GFPs {{cited in the}} introduction have contributed to their popularity. An additional advantage of GFPs {{is that they are}} readily retrievable after failure [36]. An in vitro study intimated that fiber posts are less likely to cause vertical root fractures than stainless steel posts [37]. Forces in the tooth restored with a fiber post are distributed to the restored complex in a manner that does not put stress on the vulnerable root structure [4]. A finite element analysis also showed that a GFP resulted in the lowest stress generation inside the root because the stiffness of the post {{is similar to that of}} dentin [38], whereas a metal post-and-core system transferred higher stresses to the root, which might cause a higher incidence of vertical root fractures. Hence, two important characteristics of GFPs are that (i) their elastic modulus is similar to that of dentin [20] and that (ii) these posts and the respective core build-ups are cemented with an <b>adhesive</b> <b>technique</b> [39]. These characteristics may improve the retention and mechanical performance of the restored teeth [33].|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to review and {{summarize}} the in vitro and clinical data on the use of glass-fiber posts concerning recent changes in the philosophy, materials, and technology that have impacted significantly the art and science of endodontic post placement. Original scientific papers or reviews listed in the Medline or ISI Web of Science databases from 1981 to 2013 were searched electronically using the following key words: endodontically-treated teeth, glass-fiber post, dentistry, resin cement, silane, and adhesive. The literature supports the use of a post when the remaining coronal structure is insufficient to provide retention for the restoration. Concerning which post to select, glass-fiber posts offer two important advantages: the elastic modulus is similar to that of dentin, and these posts and the respective core build-ups are cemented by an <b>adhesive</b> <b>technique.</b> However, some issues remain unclear. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm whether the use of silane influences the bonding and whether self-adhesive resin cements constitutes a reliable clinical option. Overall, the use of fiber posts is an important clinical option in dentistry, but clinicians should be aware of the difficulties in achieving good adhesion within the root canal.|$|E
