2500|$|Resonating {{absorbers}} can be broadened in {{the frequency}} range of efficacy to some degree by either introducing porous absorptive material to {{the interior of the}} vessel, by constraining the vibrations of the panel or membrane, or by installing an array of resonating devices each tuned to <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> ranges so that collectively the array functions over a broadened range of sounds. [...] Such devices can be enormously effective over their tuned range, but can take up a great deal of space, especially when installed in arrays, and thus are sometimes not a practical solution.|$|E
50|$|A tourist {{information}} radio station, CIRC-FM, {{which is}} owned by Instant Information Services formerly operated at 93.3 FM which is an <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> to 93.1 FM. According to CIRC-FM's Wikipedia article, the station had ceased broadcasting in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Included in the {{purchase}} of KTRU was a broadcast translator that improved reception in the area near the campus of Rice University. The translator has been relocated off-campus after the sale and moved to an <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency.</b> This translator was {{also included in the}} sale to KSBJ.|$|E

50|$|In March 2007, CKKK-FM {{applied to}} move from 99.5 FM to 90.5 FM. CKPT, then on 1420 AM, was {{approved}} in 2007 to move to 99.3 FM which is the <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> of 99.5 FM. On July 9, 2007 CKKK received CRTC approval to move to 90.5 FM.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the launch}} of the American-owned, ship-based pirate radio station Laser 558 off the British coast, there were {{announcements}} that another such station, provisionally called Stereo Hits 576, would soon follow, using AM stereo on an <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> to Laser. Nothing ever came of this project and 576 kHz was adopted by Radio Caroline instead.|$|E
50|$|In {{all other}} directions, Ofcom's {{published}} technical parameters {{indicate that the}} radiated power is as little as 400 watts, particularly to the east in order to minimise interference to Classic FM's Wrotham transmitter on the <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> of 100.9 MHz FM which serves much of South East England and is located in North Western Kent.|$|E
50|$|Chen and Feng 2003 {{proposed}} {{a technique to}} improve the HHT procedure. The authors noted that the EMD is limited in distinguishing different components in narrow-band signals. The narrow band may contain either (a) components that have <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies</b> or (b) components that are not <b>adjacent</b> in <b>frequency</b> but for {{which one of the}} components has a much higher energy intensity than the other components. The improved technique is based on beating-phenomenon waves.|$|R
50|$|WCCD {{broadcasts}} at only 500 watts, {{presumably because}} it is short-spaced to KDKA in Pittsburgh. It signs off at sunset to protect WMVP in Chicago and a glut of other clear channel stations on <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies,</b> including KDKA.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Block {{diagram of}} a tuned radio {{frequency}} receiver.

50|$|It is {{a narrow}} {{frequency}} range used to separate two wider frequency ranges {{to ensure that}} both can transmit simultaneously without interfering with each other. It is used in Frequency division multiplexing. It {{may be used in}} both wired or wireless communications, so that <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> bands on the same media can avoid interference.|$|E
5000|$|The phase vocoder was {{introduced}} in 1966 by Flanagan as an algorithm that would preserve horizontal coherence between the phases of bins that represent sinusoidal components. This original phase vocoder did {{not take into account}} the vertical coherence between <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> bins, and therefore, time stretching with this system did produce sound signals that were missing clarity.|$|E
50|$|GMSK {{is similar}} to {{standard}} minimum-shift keying (MSK); however the digital data stream is first shaped with a Gaussian filter before being applied to a frequency modulator, and typically has much narrower phase shift angles than most MSK modulation systems. This {{has the advantage of}} reducing sideband power, which in turn reduces out-of-band interference between signal carriers in <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> channels.|$|E
50|$|SSHL is {{diagnosed}} via pure tone audiometry. If the test shows {{a loss of}} at least 30db in three <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the hearing loss {{is diagnosed}} as SSHL. For example, a hearing loss of 30db would make conversational speech sound more like a whisper.|$|R
50|$|If {{a defect}} is {{introduced}} into the liquid crystal to disturb the periodicity, a single allowed mode may be created inside of the photonic bandgap, reducing power leeching by spontaneous emission at <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Defect mode lasing was first predicted in 1987, and was demonstrated in 2003.|$|R

50|$|The station {{received}} CRTC approval on August 28, 2007 {{to operate}} a new english-language FM radio station in Kingston. However, the 93.5 FM frequency is an <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> to a nearby radio station WCIZ-FM in Watertown, New York across the St. Lawrence River broadcasting at 93.3 FM. The antenna configuration used by CKXC is directional to protect WCIZ. The 93.5 MHz frequency was formerly used by WCIZ up until the late 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{advantages}} of graphic equalizers is their simplicity of use. When ringing the monitors, a person can boost then restore each frequency band until the ringing starts. [...] This helps you identify the feedback frequency. A drawback of graphic equalizers is the fixed frequency bands. Feedback rarely occurs on the exact center of the frequency band so two <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> bands may have to be reduced in parallel to eliminate the feedback.|$|E
50|$|WKSS transmits with {{frequency}} modulation (FM) at 95.7 MHz using a directional antenna with an {{effective radiated power}} (ERP) of 16,500 watts. The signal is nulled to the southeast to protect WFOX in Norwalk, which uses the <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> 95.9 MHz. The station has a 50 kW equivalent signal at 268 meters above average terrain. The station broadcasts from the West Peak of the Hanging Hills in Meriden on a tower with former sister station WMRQ.|$|E
30|$|In fact, a {{relative}} discrete distance {{should be more}} meaningful than a discrete distance because it can reflect the true information of two <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The relative discrete distance (△) of two adjacent peaks {{can be defined as}} △[*]=[*] 2 (f 2  −[*]f 1)/(f 1 [*]+[*]f 2), where f 1 and f 2 are the frequencies of two neighboring peaks. To guarantee △[*]>[*] 0, the frequency of f 2 should be higher than that of f 1. According to this definition, the minimum △ values of previous multiple-band MPAs are typically no less than 50 % [19 – 30], which are far from satisfactory to explore and investigate the hidden messages in the areas of <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies.</b> It is very reasonable, therefore, to develop multiple-band MPAs with very near frequencies or low values of △.|$|R
30|$|The above step {{ensures that}} the quality of the primary speech signal is not affected, and {{the reason is that the}} whole HA {{algorithm}} is based on the FFT that has an inherent problem of spectral leakage. For this reason, a comb filter is used, but it has a drawback of removing additional <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies.</b>|$|R
50|$|WRKO is Boston's {{second most}} {{powerful}} station. A 50,000-watt class B station, it provides at least secondary coverage to portions of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Maine during the day. Its signal is highly directional {{at night to}} protect a number of clear-channel stations on <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and CFTR on 680 kHz in Toronto, Canada.|$|R
50|$|Transfer mode {{can be used}} {{to adjust}} audio {{crossover}} settings for multi-way loudspeakers; similarly, it {{can be used to}} adjust only the subwoofer-to-top box crossover characteristics in a sound system where the main, non-subwoofer loudspeakers are flown or rigged but the subwoofers are placed on the ground. One of the traces in the Smaart display shows phase response. To properly align <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> bands through a crossover, the two phase responses should be adjusted until they are seen in Smaart to be parallel through the crossover frequency.|$|E
50|$|Resonating {{absorbers}} can be broadened in {{the frequency}} range of efficacy to some degree by either introducing porous absorptive material to {{the interior of the}} vessel, by constraining the vibrations of the panel or membrane, or by installing an array of resonating devices each tuned to <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> ranges so that collectively the array functions over a broadened range of sounds.

50|$|The {{station was}} first {{licensed}} in 2005 with the call sign CKNS-FM. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved the {{application for a}} station serving Haldimand, but assigned the frequency for which the station initially applied, 106.7 FM, to another station in a nearby market (CIKZ). Bel-Roc Communications then applied for 92.9, from a transmitter location approximately 20 kilometers east of the original, at lower effective radiated power, but from a higher tower. A contemporaneous competing application from CHCD in nearby Simcoe, Ontario sought the <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency,</b> 93.1, for a CHCD repeater in Haldimand.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} strategies developed to boost the commercial introduction of new digital radiobroadcast standards is based {{on the use of the}} present AM transmission infrastructure to send both analog and digital signals over the same medium and range of frequencies through a suitable scheme of modulation. This mode of transmission is denominated “hybrid mode”, and is based on the use of the keeper range of frequencies between carriers of analogical transmission to send the digital signals. However, radiobroadcast over <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies</b> with minimal guard intervals between them could generate interference on the digital information under certain circumstances. In this work the transmission of both In Band – On Channel (AM IBOC) and Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) digital standards, broadcasting in hybrid mode from <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies</b> is analyzed through the use of models, and the implications of the phenomenon and its possible solutions are concluded, taking as example the case of three commercial stations nowadays operating in Mexico City...|$|R
50|$|Foxtel's {{satellite}} service transmits exclusively from the Optus C1 satellite on a primary downlink frequency of 12.438 GHz expanded to <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies,</b> with further expansion during November 2009 of frequencies on the Optus D3 satellite. The Telstra hybrid fibre-coaxial cable carries Foxtel with an approximate downstream bandwidth of 560 MHz with an upstream return (for internet, on-demand, phone and other two-way dependent services) bandwidth of 2.4 MHz.|$|R
25|$|Morse code {{is usually}} heard at the {{receiver}} as a medium-pitched on/off audio tone (600–1000Hz), so transmissions {{are easier to}} copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, {{and it can be}} used in very high noise / low signal environments. The transmitted power is concentrated into a limited bandwidth so narrow receiver filters can be used to suppress interference from <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The audio tone is usually created by use of a beat frequency oscillator.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the station}} did not achieve {{the level of}} success {{expected}} by Raymark. The station was put up for sale and was sold for $167,000 {{in the spring of}} 1993 to WKYN, Inc., which owned Adult CHR-formatted WKYN-FM (now WDDH) northwest of Spangler in Ridgway, the seat of government for Elk County. WKYN, which operated at the <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> of 97.5, changed the call letters of WCCZ to WXVE and took on the similar call letters of WKVE to replace WKYN, using WXVE as a translator to bring 97.5's signal closer to the more populous city of Johnstown.|$|E
5000|$|WKYN, {{billed as}} [...] "97 KYN", {{signed on with}} an Adult CHR format. Stevens stuck with this formula for seven years, until the {{opportunity}} presented itself in 1993 to acquire WCCZ (now WPCL) in Spangler. WCCZ operated on the <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> of 97.3 and could be heard clearly in the more populous area of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Stevens purchased WCCZ and changed the call letters to WXVE, {{turning it into a}} translator to extend WKYN's signal into the Johnstown market. At the time of the acquisition, WKYN became WKVE (an allusion to Pittsburgh's legendary AOR station WDVE) and the station changed format from Adult CHR to AOR, as there was no album rock formatted station in Johnstown at that time.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, {{the network}} {{surrendered}} its licenses for transmitters in Kitchener, Ontario (CKAV-FM-8, 102.5 MHz) and Montreal (CKAV-FM-10, 106.7 MHz). On August 20, 2009, the CRTC approved an application by Canadian Hellenic Cable Radio (CHCR) {{to amend the}} broadcasting licence for its station in Montreal at 106.3 MHz, a second <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> to CKAV-FM-10 at 106.7 FM, requiring AVR to find an alternative frequency {{in the event of}} any interference with the signal of CKAV-FM-10. As of January 2011, CHCR's station, CKIN-FM, has signed on at 106.3 MHz. Another broadcaster, Evanov Communications, has since filed an application for a new station at 106.7 serving the western suburb of Hudson in January 2012; that station, since becoming CHSV-FM, was approved in October 2012.|$|E
30|$|Through {{implementation}} of FFT on the acquired vibration data, {{it was found}} that the characteristic frequencies under normal, inner-race fault, outer-race fault, and ball fault states are distributed separately in different frequency bands, and that there is little overlap between any two <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the spectrum. Therefore, three-layer wavelet packet decomposition can also be applied to the vibration data, and thus, eight-dimensional feature vectors can be acquired by calculating and normalizing the energy of each band.|$|R
30|$|Separating {{the sources}} for each {{frequency}} bin introduces the permutation problem: {{the order of}} the estimated sources is not the same from one frequency to another. To solve the permutation problem, we use the method proposed by Wei-hua and Fenggang and described in [10]. This method is based on the signals correlation between two <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequencies.</b> In this article, {{we are not going to}} investigate the permutation problem and we use the cited method for all the proposed algorithm.|$|R
