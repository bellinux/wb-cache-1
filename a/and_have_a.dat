Elliott et al. distinguishes between two categories: scattered-near (i.e. typical SDOs) and scattered-extended (i.e. detached objects). Scattered-near objects are those whose orbits are non-resonant, non-planetary-orbit-crossing <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) less than 3. Scattered-extended objects have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) greater than 3 <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> time-averaged eccentricity greater than 0.2.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{birds in}} Asia can be {{confused}} with the similar lesser whistling duck, although that species is smaller, has a blackish crown and lacks an obvious dark stripe down the back of the neck. Juvenile fulvous whistling ducks are very like young lesser whistling ducks, but the crown colour is still a distinction. Juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than whistling ducks <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced whistling ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E
5|$|Adults have {{forewings}} {{that are}} yellowish brown in color <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dark spot {{located in the}} center of their body. The moths have a wingspan ranging from 32 to 45mm, and live over thirty days in optimal conditions. However, the life span ranges from five to fifteen days on average. They are nocturnal and hide in vegetation during the day. Adult moths collect nectar or other plant exudates from a large number of plants, and live for 12 to 16 days. Females can lay up to 2,500 eggs in their lifetime.|$|E

5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of curium are radioactive <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> small {{critical mass}} for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit α-particles, {{and the heat}} released in this process {{can serve as a}} heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, but this application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost, and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition and structure of the surface.|$|E

5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and type II alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types I and II make up the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells generally cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E

They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E
5|$|Away {{from the}} urban centre, the tribal people of Chamba are divided into two major groups; the Gujjars and the Gaddis. The Gujjars, mainly nomads, came to Chamba across the state border from Kashmir along the trade routes.

5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E
