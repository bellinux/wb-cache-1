5|$|The Mundo Perdido {{underwent}} six {{phases of}} construction; {{four of these}} date to the Preclassic and two to the Classic. Each construction phase produced {{a new version of}} the E-Group (the Lost World Pyramid <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>East</b> Platform). Evidence recovered from the Mundo Perdido dates back to the earliest years of occupation at Tikal in the Middle Preclassic prior to 700 BC, although these remains represent rubbish rather than structures. The complex began to take form around the end of the Middle Preclassic, around 600 BC, when structures started to be added to a series of artificially levelled surfaces or platforms. Gradually both the complexity and the height of the structures increased. The Lost World Pyramid <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>East</b> Platform together form an E-Group that is the oldest architectural complex in Tikal. During the Late Preclassic a causeway was built to unite the Mundo Perdido with the North Acropolis; this causeway channelled runoff rainwater into a canal that fed into the Temple Reservoir. About AD 100, toward the end of the Late Preclassic, three temples were built upon the East Platform.|$|E
