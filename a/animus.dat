5|$|Paine's creed encapsulates many of {{the major}} themes {{of the rest of}} his text: a firm belief in a creator-God; a {{skepticism}} regarding most supernatural claims (here the afterlife, later in the text, miracles); a conviction that virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself; an <b>animus</b> against corrupt religious institutions; and an emphasis on the individual's right of conscience.|$|E
5|$|Seymour's {{operatives}} sought Johnson's support, but he long {{remained silent}} on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, {{in part because of}} their <b>animus</b> from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of President-elect Grant, who did not allow his to go.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the public}} blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious {{explanations}} for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had {{played a part in}} the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the <b>animus</b> and fear towards the Duke {{to the fact that he}} did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.|$|E
5|$|No German {{team was}} allowed at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London or the Winter Games in St. Moritz. Brundage {{was anxious to}} reintegrate Germany into the Olympic {{movement}} once the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, through Brundage's lifetime) was formed in 1949. Soon after the state's formation, its National Olympic Committee approached the IOC, seeking recognition, {{but there was still}} much <b>animus</b> towards Germany. Just prior to the IOC session in Vienna in 1951 (Brundage was still vice president), the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) also formed an NOC and requested recognition. This created controversy, as the Federal Republic and its NOC claimed to represent both West and East Germany, but did not control the latter. Despite lengthy discussions, no resolution was reached in 1951, and the matter was put over until February 1952, when a negotiating session was scheduled for Copenhagen. Although the East Germans came to Copenhagen, they refused to attend the session, which was eventually cancelled by Edström after the IOC officials and West Germans waited for hours in vain. The German team which competed in Helsinki that summer was entirely West German.|$|E
5|$|Each dream {{acts as a}} {{character}} study, exploring the fears and future of the dreamer. Willow, Xander, and Giles are stalked by a shadowy figure, then killed within their dreams. The way in which each is killed {{is directly related to}} the role they had assumed when melding with Buffy in the previous episode—that role is indicated by the Tarot-like card used to symbolize the character's essence. Willow's card had been Spiritus, representing her magical powers; she is killed by having her spirit sucked out of her. Xander's card had been <b>Animus,</b> representing his heart; he is killed by having his heart ripped out. Giles had been represented by the card Sophus, a symbol of his intellect and role as teacher; he is killed by being scalped. Buffy's card, Manus, was representative of her physical strength. In her dream the stalker is revealed as the primitive, first slayer, who confronts her aggressively. The two fight, but the First Slayer is defeated when Buffy realizes a key difference between them: the First Slayer was alone and isolated, while Buffy is unique among Slayers in that she has friends and a life beyond slaying, factors which make her the greatest Slayer ever.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{awakening}} on <b>Animus</b> Island, {{the original}} <b>Animus</b> testing program {{located within the}} Black Room, Desmond meets the consciousness of Subject Sixteen, who occupied Abstergo's <b>Animus</b> before him. Sixteen explains that Desmond's mind is broken, {{and the only way}} for him to repair it is by reliving his ancestors' memories until there is nothing left for them to show Desmond, at which point the <b>Animus</b> can separate Desmond from Ezio and Altaïr, and awaken Desmond from his coma.|$|E
25|$|While {{the games}} are often {{presented}} through protagonist Desmond Miles, {{the bulk of the}} game is played as Desmond experiences the memories of his ancestors through an advanced device called the <b>Animus.</b> This provides a means of a diegetic interface, showing Desmond's ancestor's health, equipment, goals, and other features as part of the <b>Animus</b> interface. The <b>Animus</b> is based on the player controlling the assassin to maintain the synchronization between Desmond and his ancestor's memories. Performing actions that go against the Assassin's way or dying breaks the synchronization, effectively requiring the player to restart at a previous checkpoint. Furthermore, the player cannot explore outside areas that the assassin has not experienced yet. There are also abnormalities within the <b>Animus</b> from previous users of the device.|$|E
25|$|Anima <b>Animus</b> is {{the third}} album by British duo the Creatures (a.k.a. singer Siouxsie Sioux and drummer Budgie), {{released}} in 1999. The title of the album was inspired by Carl Jung's concept of Anima and <b>animus</b> ("the woman inside the man, the man inside the woman").|$|E
25|$|Anima <b>Animus</b> was {{released}} on both CD and double 10-inch vinyl record.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} in the Black Room, Desmond Miles relived the {{memories}} passed to him by a virtual construct of Clay Kaczmarek, his predecessor in the <b>Animus</b> Project. The memories related to Clay becoming a member of the Assassins, being assigned to infiltrate Abstergo Industries' <b>Animus</b> Project laboratory in Italy, and discovering what Warren Vidic hoped to achieve by exploring the genetic memories of various Assassin figures.|$|E
25|$|Desmond Miles, a {{bartender}} {{who is a}} descendant of several lines of prominent Assassins; though raised as an Assassin, he left his nomadic family to seek out a more common lifestyle. He is initially kidnapped by Abstergo, who is aware of his ancestral lineage. Desmond is forced into the <b>Animus</b> and is revealed to be subject 17; many of the sixteen previous subjects {{died as a result}} of <b>animus</b> over-exposure.|$|E
25|$|Anima <b>Animus</b> {{was later}} hailed by peer PJ Harvey, who {{selected}} {{it in her}} Top 10 Albums of 1999.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{cited as}} {{authoritative}} National Labor Relations Board v. Bell Oil & Gas Co., 91 F.2d 509 (5 Cir. 1937). If Mackay Radio {{had refused to}} rehire the workers because of anti-union <b>animus,</b> then {{that would be an}} unfair labor practice, the court held. Reviewing briefly the evidence generated by the Board during the hearings, Justice Roberts concluded that anti-union <b>animus</b> had motivated the employer and thus reinstatement was proper.|$|E
25|$|The Court's assumptions, some say, {{have made}} the Mackay Radio ruling {{theoretically}} unsupportable {{as a matter of}} equity. Because the Court assumed that employers must hire permanent replacements as a matter of business necessity, the Court did not find it necessary to require the employer to show the need for permanent replacements. This places the burden on either the Board or unions to prove that the employer had an anti-union <b>animus.</b> But the Supreme Court subsequently held that replacement workers cannot be presumed to be anti-union, so their use is not enough to show <b>animus.</b> Indeed, courts have been reluctant to find support for anti-union <b>animus</b> in any except the most extreme cases. As legal scholars point out, under Mackay Radio, employers can now cloak anti-union <b>animus</b> under the guise of using permanent replacements. They note that it is becoming increasingly common for employers to deunionize using permanent replacements, and nearly impossible for unions to obtain legal redress. This has held to a radical shift in American labor policy which Congress did not intend.|$|E
25|$|Greenwald {{has also}} been {{critical}} of the New Atheist movement, accusing Sam Harris and others within the movement he accuses of anti-Muslim <b>animus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Its sheer breadth is so {{discontinuous}} {{with the}} reasons offered for {{it that the}} amendment seems inexplicable by anything but <b>animus</b> toward the class that it affects; it lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{previous}} installments, Desmond {{can leave}} the <b>Animus</b> at almost any time. This allows Desmond to explore the present-day town of Monteriggioni. The player is also offered virtual training, a mini-game where the player may test their free-running or combat skills.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, {{members of}} the extreme-right Action Française {{movement}} expressed strong <b>animus</b> against Huguenots and other Protestants in general, as well as against Jews and Freemasons. They were regarded as groups supporting the French Republic, which Action Française sought to overthrow.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, the Supreme Court {{issued the}} most recent (as of early 2008) of its post-Mackay decisions. That year, the Court held that {{permanent}} replacements could not automatically be presumed to oppose an incumbent union. Therefore, use of strikebreakers was not automatically a presumption of anti-union <b>animus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The anima {{archetype}} {{appears in}} men and is his primordial image of woman. It represents the man's biological expectation of women, but also {{is a symbol of}} a man's feminine possibilities, his contrasexual tendencies. The <b>animus</b> archetype is the analogous image of the masculine that occurs in women.|$|E
25|$|The Orthodox Church clergy in Russia {{were seen}} as {{sympathetic}} with {{the cause of the}} White Army in the Civil War (see White movement) after the October Revolution, and occasionally collaborated with it; Patriarch Tikhon's declared position was vehemently anti-Bolshevik in 1918. This may have further strengthened the Bolshevik <b>animus</b> against the church.|$|E
25|$|After Desmond dies {{to ensure}} Earth's survival, his memories, which have survived in cyberspace, are {{accessed}} by Abstergo, which hires a new subject {{to enter the}} <b>Animus.</b> The new subject relives the memories of Edward Kenway (Grandfather of Ratohnhaké:ton's other wise known as Connor Kenway) and a privateer-turned-pirate during the Golden Age of Piracy.|$|E
25|$|Within the <b>Animus,</b> Desmond {{explores the}} {{memories}} {{of a number of}} Assassins, including Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, an initially disgraced Assassin working to redeem himself during the Third Crusade; Ezio Auditore da Firenze, an Assassin in Italy during the late 15th and early 16th centuries of the Italian Renaissance, and , otherwise known as Connor, a half-Mohawk, half-British Assassin during the American Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Catholic <b>animus</b> in the United States {{reached a}} {{peak in the}} 19th century when the Protestant {{population}} became alarmed by the influx of Catholic immigrants. Fearing the end of time, some American Protestants who believed they were God's chosen people, {{went so far as}} to claim that the Catholic Church was the Whore of Babylon in the Book of Revelation.|$|E
25|$|The Russian Orthodox Church {{collaborated with}} the White Army in the Russian Civil War (see White movement) after the October Revolution. This may have further {{strengthened}} the Bolshevik <b>animus</b> against the church. According to Lenin, a communist regime cannot remain neutral {{on the question of}} religion but must show itself to be merciless towards it. There was no place for the church in Lenin's classless society.|$|E
25|$|For {{that matter}} Levin himself {{did not seem}} to have any {{personal}} sectarian <b>animus,</b> which suggests that his anti-Catholic activism was merely rhetorical and opportunistic. The explorer and soldier John Gregory Bourke (1846–1896), whose devoutly Catholic family were friends and neighbors of Levin's in 1840s and 1850s Philadelphia, recalled Levin fondly and wrote that the Bourke and Levin families were close for many years.|$|E
25|$|Juba I {{had long}} held a {{personal}} <b>animus</b> against Julius Caesar {{dating back to}} an incident when Caesar was praetor (62 BC) in Africa; the story is related by the ancient Roman writer Suetonius and regarded King Hiempsal II, father of Juba I. Caesar judged as unfair and oppressive the King's treatment of his noble vassal Masintha and effectively interfered, not without physical altercation between Caesar and Juba I.|$|E
25|$|When first encountered, {{the figure}} is a dangerous, 'hairy chthonic wildman' possessed of {{kindness}} and intelligence. If repressed, later in life The Horned God appears as {{the lord of the}} Otherworld, or Hades. If split off entirely, he leads to violence, substance abuse and sexual perversion. When integrated he gives the male an ego 'in possession of its own destructiveness' and for the female psyche gives an effective <b>animus</b> relating to both the physical body and the psyche.|$|E
25|$|Throughout these events, Desmond learns of {{allusions to}} the prophetic {{end of the}} world in 2012 from a former <b>Animus</b> test subject, Subject 16; the event {{turns out to be a}} repeat of the {{disaster}} which wiped out the ancient civilization, and he finds out that his memories hold the key to Earth's surviving a second solar storm. During his experiences, Desmond is aided by holographic projections of three of the ancient race's rulers: Jupiter, Minerva, and Juno.|$|E
25|$|Any {{attempt to}} give an {{exhaustive}} list of the archetypes, however, would be a largely futile exercise since the archetypes tend to combine {{with each other and}} interchange qualities making it difficult to decide where one archetype stops and another begins. For example, qualities of the shadow archetype may be prominent in an archetypal image of the anima or <b>animus.</b> One archetype may also appear in various distinct forms, thus raising the question whether four or five distinct archetypes should be said to be present or merely four or five forms of a single archetype.|$|E
25|$|Daood Gilani {{was raised}} in a {{political}} environment steeped in Pakistani nationalism and Islamic conservatism, both of which were amplified by Pakistani tensions with India. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, stray bombs hit Gilani's elementary school in Karachi and killed two people; this event, along with Pakistan's defeat at the war's conclusion, is thought to have stoked Gilani's <b>animus</b> towards India. Gilani went on to attend the elite Cadet College Hasan Abdal, a boys' military prep school. Gilani remained in contact with classmates, and later engaged in impassioned debates with them about politics and Islam in e-mail correspondence.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{follows the}} centuries-old {{struggle}} between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story {{is set in the}} 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, {{with the aid of a}} machine known as the <b>Animus,</b> relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The main story takes place immediately after the plot of Assassin's Creed II, featuring Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze in 16th century Italy and his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} limited editions of Assassin's Creed Revelations. The <b>Animus,</b> Collector's and Special editions were available on all platforms {{and only in}} Europe, Australia and New Zealand, while the Signature Edition was only available in North America through GameStop for all platforms. Those who pre-ordered Assassin's Creed: Revelations through GameStop automatically upgraded to the Signature Edition of the game at no extra cost. The Signature Edition features exclusive packaging, a bonus single-player mission (Vlad the Impaler Prison), an exclusive multiplayer character (Ottoman Jester), weapons capacity upgrades, an animated short film (Assassin's Creed Embers Movie) and the original game's soundtrack.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{believed}} {{to be one of}} the subconscious identities developed by Carol Ferris, which acted as a masculine <b>animus</b> to the feminine anima of Star Sapphire, the Predator repeatedly appeared as a mysterious figure, protecting Carol's beloved company from the threats of Eclipso, the Demolition Team, and Jason Bloch. He also established the company Intercontinental Petroleum (Con-Trol) to let her regain control of Ferris Aircraft. Finally, the Predator started to court Carol (who did not know that the Predator was a part of herself) and battled Hal Jordan for her love. The Predator was later assumed to have been killed by Nekron.|$|E
25|$|Desmond's story {{continues}} {{where it}} left off, in 2012. After escaping the Templars' attack {{at the end}} of Assassin's Creed II, Desmond Miles, Lucy Stillman, Rebecca Crane, and Shaun Hastings flee to Monteriggioni, establishing a new hideout in the ruins of the Villa Auditore. After restoring the electricity in the old tunnels under the villa, the player once again takes control of Ezio Auditore through Desmond's genetic memory, using the <b>Animus</b> 2.0 (which is the game's memory interface). Their mission is to find the Apple of Eden, an important and mysterious artifact that could prevent the impending disaster that is coming in that same year, believed to be perpetrated by the Templars.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} history of real world events and follows the centuries-old {{struggle}} between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features the series protagonist Desmond Miles who, {{with the aid of a}} machine known as the <b>Animus,</b> relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse.
