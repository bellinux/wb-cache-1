500|$|One of the Flight 305 {{flight attendants}} {{reportedly}} [...] "did {{not find any}} similarities" [...] between photos of Rackstraw from the 1970s and her recollection of Cooper's appearance. Rackstraw's attorney called the renewed allegations [...] "the stupidest thing I've ever heard", and Rackstraw himself told People.com, [...] "It's a lot of , <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is." [...] The FBI declined further comment. Rackstraw stated in a 2017 phone interview that {{he lost his job}} over the 2016 investigations.|$|E
500|$|The acting of {{the main}} cast was conflictingly received. Lloyd Miller of the St. Petersburg Times said the {{characters}} [...] "return to their original roles with a vigor and wit unseen in earlier episodes of the film series". Rob Salem of The Toronto Star quipped that though the actors looked silly on occasion, this was a benefit; [...] "as their capacity for action has diminished, their comedic talents have blossomed [...] they have all become masters of self-deprecating self-parody." [...] The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert called the actors' performances [...] "photocopies" [...] of previous films: [...] "Shatner and Nimoy are respectable, but lack energy. There's {{nowhere else to go}} with their roles, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> DeForest Kelley is oddly out of it." [...] Plummer and Warner's portrayals of their Klingon characters were well-received; Maslin commented that [...] "whenever a skilled actor [...] manages to emerge from behind all this [...] with his personality intact, it's a notable accomplishment." [...] The other supporting characters received similar praise; H.J. Kirchhoff, writing for The Globe and Mail, said that the guest stars joined the [...] "family fun" [...] of the film as [...] "zesty, exotic and colorful good guys and bad guys". A Cinefantastique retrospective review considered the film to have the finest guest stars ever assembled for a Star Trek film.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of making the film was to convey the smells {{and the world of}} scents that Grenouille experiences. Tykwer said that to him Perfume [...] "was much more a film about the importance of smell in our life than a film that tries to be smelly." [...] The filmmakers strived to convey smell visually without the use of colors or special effects, Griebe says [...] "people see the fish market full of raw, bloody fish, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> stinks; they see a field of lavender and know it smells wonderful. We show Grenouille taking in smells by cupping his nose, and by doing close shots of his nose, and that's it!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding his {{religious}} beliefs, Carolla has stated, [...] "I am not agnostic. I am atheist. I don't {{think there is}} no God; I know there's no God. I know there's no God the same way I know many other laws in our universe. I know there's no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit there's no God <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} tour to Zimbabwe, after two close draws, Lloyd {{generated}} controversy with his post-match statements. Speaking {{after the first}} Test in Bulawayo, which ended as a draw with the scores level, he stated [...] "We murdered them. We got on top and steamrollered them. We have flipping hammered them. One more ball and we'd have walked it. We murdered them <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> To work so hard and get so close, there is no praise too high. We have had some stick off your lads. We flipping hammered them." [...] The comments were not appreciated by Zimbabwe fans, with one banner in the crowd reading [...] "Wanted. David Lloyd. For Murder of Zim Cricket Team. Last seen with his finger up his nose talking complete bollocks. He knows it and we know it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{premise of}} Wildwood is that Forest Park in Portland is [...] "its own secret country, {{populated}} by a diverse and strange people". The real Forest Park is about [...] long and [...] wide, containing [...] of natural woods, mostly {{second growth forest}} with some old growth, all within the city limits. This place fired Meloy's imagination, and the fantasy version of Forest Park is Wildwoods [...] "most distinctive element". Outsiders, the people of Portland, call it the Impassable Wilderness, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> only as a forbidden, taboo area, never visited and rarely spoken of. Children are taught to stay away and even learn, eventually, to stop asking why it is forbidden. Unknown to the Outsiders, {{it is filled with}} magical talking animals and people, some living in the pastoral, almost medieval conditions of North Wood, while the country of South Wood is industrialized with technology typical of the 19th and early 20th Century. North Wood and South Wood are separated by Wildwood, an untamed no man's land filled with bandits and ostensibly wild coyotes. Travelers, and the Postmaster's truck, make the risky journey from the northern and southern countries by the Long Road through Wildwood. Tucked between Wildwood and South Wood is the Avian Principality, a nation of birds.|$|E

60|$|His {{fondness for}} honey is well known. When he has {{discovered}} a rotten tree in which wild bees have hidden their store, he will claw {{at the bottom}} till it falls. Curling one paw under the log he sinks the claws deep into the wood. The other paw grips the log opposite the first, and a single wrench lays it open.
