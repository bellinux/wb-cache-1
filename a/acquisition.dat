5|$|<b>Acquisition</b> {{of second}} and {{additional}} languages can come at any age, through exposure {{in daily life}} or courses. Children learning a second language {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language <b>acquisition</b> and additional language <b>acquisition</b> is that the process of additional language <b>acquisition</b> is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{announcement}} and post-acquisition share returns of UK acquirers in over 4, 000 <b>acquisitions</b> of domestic, cross-border, {{public and private}} targets. Domestic public <b>acquisitions</b> result in negative announcement and post-acquisition returns, whilst cross-border public <b>acquisitions</b> result in zero announcement returns and negative post-acquisition returns. In contrast, both domestic and cross-border private <b>acquisitions</b> result in positive announcement returns and zero post-acquisition returns. The main differences between private and public <b>acquisitions</b> are that glamour acquirers underperform in public <b>acquisitions</b> but not in private <b>acquisitions,</b> and that acquirers using noncash methods of payment underperform in domestic public <b>acquisitions</b> but not in domestic private <b>acquisitions.</b> Overall, cross-border <b>acquisitions</b> result in lower announcement and long run returns than domestic <b>acquisitions.</b> In cross-border <b>acquisitions,</b> those involving high-tech firms perform relatively well, as do those with low national cultural differences.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} researches which analyze mergers and <b>acquisitions,</b> {{but most of}} them do not focus on a certain industry, but their sample considers companies from different industries. This paper focuses on mergers and <b>acquisitions</b> in the pharmaceutical industry. It is assumed that pharmaceutical companies with no experience in mergers and <b>acquisitions</b> achieve better results in relatively small and domestic mergers and <b>acquisitions</b> while pharmaceutical companies with greater experience in mergers and <b>acquisitions</b> are successful even in bigger and international mergers and <b>acquisitions.</b> Bigger mergers and <b>acquisitions</b> and international mergers and <b>acquisitions</b> are more risky for the companies so lack of experience in mergers and <b>acquisitions</b> additionally increases risks during the process of mergers and <b>acquisitions.</b> On average, such increase of the risk results in lower returns for stock owners of pharmaceutical companies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acquisitions,</b> {{the process}} by which {{libraries}} order, claim, and receive material, was once {{an essential part of the}} library school curriculum. Since the 1930 s, training in this area has diminished significantly and over the past several years there appears to be a preponderance of opinion among <b>acquisitions</b> librarians that more formalized library school training is needed. A survey of <b>acquisitions</b> librarians employed in ARL-member libraries was used to determine where contemporary training for <b>acquisitions</b> does occur and where it should occur. In addition, the survey identified those <b>acquisitions</b> librarians most recognized in their field and compared and contrasted their formal and informal <b>acquisitions</b> training with ARL <b>acquisitions</b> librarians. The significant findings were: (1) ARL <b>acquisitions</b> librarians receive more than 75 % of their <b>acquisitions</b> training outside the library science classroom. Despite this, only about 26 % of the respondents believe that the majority of their <b>acquisitions</b> training should come from library school. (2) ARL <b>acquisitions</b> librarians believe that most of their education for <b>acquisitions</b> should come from on-the-job training, followed by library school training, workshops and conferences, vendor interaction, and other sources, including professional readings. (3) <b>Acquisitions</b> librarians identified as being most recognized and effective in their work differ little from ARL <b>acquisitions</b> librarians in their perceptions about <b>acquisitions</b> education and received comparatively less formal training in <b>acquisitions.</b> Members of this population were more active in continuing education than their ARL counterparts. The findings demonstrate that the library school curriculum should contain more about <b>acquisitions,</b> with particular reference to specific areas, but that the primary training for <b>acquisitions</b> work should continue to occur in the workplace...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{announcement}} and post-acquisition share returns of 4, 000 <b>acquisitions</b> by U. K. public firms during 1984 - 1998. We include <b>acquisitions</b> {{of domestic and}} cross-border targets, and of both publicly quoted and privately held targets. In <b>acquisitions</b> of domestic public targets, abnormal returns are negative over both the announcement and post-acquisition period. In <b>acquisitions</b> of cross-border public targets, abnormal returns are zero over the announcement period but negative over the post-acquisition period. In contrast, <b>acquisitions</b> of both domestic and cross-border private targets result in positive announcement returns and zero long run returns. The main difference between private and public <b>acquisitions</b> is that glamour acquirers experience negative announcement and long run returns in public <b>acquisitions,</b> whereas glamour acquirers do not under-perform in private <b>acquisitions.</b> Furthermore, whereas the under-performance of domestic public <b>acquisitions</b> is limited to acquirers using non-cash methods of payment, acquirers of domestic private targets that use non-cash methods do not under-perform. Overall, cross-border <b>acquisitions</b> result in lower announcement and long run returns than domestic <b>acquisitions.</b> In cross-border <b>acquisitions</b> involving high?tech firms both announcement and long run returns are positive, whilst non-high-tech cross-border <b>acquisitions</b> experience zero announcement returns followed by negative long run performance. Our results also suggest that, in cross-border <b>acquisitions,</b> the national cultural difference between the bidder and target countries has a significantly negative impact on long run returns.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} merger programs, that is, repeated <b>acquisitions</b> by the same firm. Most <b>acquisitions</b> are made by firms with merger programs. <b>Acquisitions</b> {{that are part of}} programs are different from one-off <b>acquisitions</b> both in the effect on CEO compensation and in the reaction of the stock market. CEO compensation rises more after growth from program <b>acquisitions</b> than after internal growth or growth from one-off <b>acquisitions.</b> During a merger program, the increase in CEO compensation is much larger when the acquirer’s stock price is increasing than at other times. This is not true for other types of growth. Merger programs also show a distinct evolution. Initially, program mergers are received better by the stock market than are one- off mergers.; As a program progresses, however, the <b>acquisitions</b> tend to have lower announcement reactions and long-run returns. In addition, the effect on CEO compensation is smaller for mergers later in a program. There is evidence that some firms are predisposed to make <b>acquisitions.</b> Firms that have made <b>acquisitions</b> in the recent past and that already pay their CEOs well are more likely to make future <b>acquisitions.</b> This suggests {{that there may be a}} managerial motivation for merger programs: firms where CEOs can expect to get large compensation increases from <b>acquisitions</b> are more likely to have merger programs.
