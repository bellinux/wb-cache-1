5|$|Echmarcach first {{appears on}} record in about 1031, {{when he was}} one of three kings in {{northern}} Britain who submitted to Knútr Sveinnsson, ruler of the Anglo-Scandinavian Empire. Echmarcach is recorded to have ruled over Dublin in 10361038 and 10461052. After losing Dublin for the final time, he <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> seated in the Isles on Mann. In 1061, about a decade after his final defeat in Dublin, Echmarcach <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> expelled from the Isles, and may have then fallen back into Galloway.|$|E

5|$|Probably {{dating from}} St-Calais' {{time is the}} confraternity {{relationship}} between the monks of Durham and the monks of the monastery of Saint Calais in Maine. The cult of Saint Calais <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> confined to the region around the monastery which the saint had founded. St-Calais <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a devotee of the cult, and the most likely date {{for the creation of}} the confraternity link between the two houses is during St-Calais' time as bishop.|$|E

5|$|Æthelwig's {{relationship}} with Wulfstan, when Wulfstan was {{acting as the}} abbot's diocesan bishop, <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tense, for on the only recorded visitation by Wulfstan to Evesham during Æthelwig's abbacy, Æthelwig was not there. Although in legal matters Wulfstan and Æthelwig were in conflict, personally, Æthelwig {{is said to have}} regarded Wulfstan as a father figure, and as the abbot's confessor. The fact that the Evesham's house chronicle <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reworked after 1100 to gloss over embarrassing incidents of the abbots submitting to the bishops of Worcester makes evaluation of Æthelwig's relations with his episcopal superiors more difficult.|$|E

5|$|About {{forty years}} after Somairle's death, a Benedictine monastery was {{established}} on Iona. The monastery's foundation charter dates to December 1203, {{which suggests that}} Ragnall may {{have been responsible for}} its erection, as claimed by early modern tradition preserved in the eighteenth-century Book of Clanranald. Be that as it may, there is no hard evidence linking Ragnall to the house's foundation. Since the charter reveals that the monastery received substantial endowments from throughout the meic Somairle domain, the foundation <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> supported by other leading members the kindred, such as Dubgall himself (if he was still alive) or his son, Donnchad. The charter placed the monastery under the protection of Pope Innocent III (died 1216), which secured its episcopal independence from the Diocese of the Isles. However, the price for the privilege of Iona's papal protection <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the adoption of the Benedictine Rule, and the supersession of the centuries-old institution of Colum Cille.|$|E

5|$|After Aymer's {{death in}} 1324, the castle passed by {{marriage}} to Lawrence, Lord Hastings, and {{was held in}} the Hastings family until 1390, when Reginald Lord Grey de Ruthin acquired it.
