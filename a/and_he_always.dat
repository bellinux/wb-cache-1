5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

25|$|After being {{released}} from the concentration camp, Bolz moved back to Beuron, near Ulm. There, he forswore politics for a while, busying himself mainly with economic issues, papal social encyclicals, and Catholic Action.

25|$|No {{forensic}} evidence linked Fred {{to the murder}} of Anne McFall, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> denied killing her. However, the fact her body had been extensively dismembered, and was missing several phalange bones, plus the fact the cubicle dimensions of the grave in which her body was buried match the modus operandi of Fred's later murders.|$|E
25|$|He {{was hardly}} more than five feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly {{the shape of an}} egg, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> perched it a little on one side. His {{moustache}} was very stiff and military.

25|$|The {{father of}} the Fowler family, Arthur was {{essentially}} a good man, but he made some foolish choices <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> ended up paying dearly for them, also being bossed {{to the brink of}} insanity by his mother-in-law and wife, Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard).

25|$|I {{am writing}} {{to ask you}} to {{consider}} the inclusion of my son, E. M. Grace– a splendid hitter and most excellent catch– in your England XI. I am sure he would play very well and do the team much credit. It may interest you to learn that I have another son, now twelve years of age, who will in time be a much better player than his brother because his back stroke is sounder, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> plays with a straight bat.|$|E

White can checkmate with 2. Nbc7#, but Black can play 1... Kc8 and escape the threat. The defender's task is easy — he simply has to avoid moving into a position in which he can be checkmated on the next move, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> has another move available in such situations.|$|E
25|$|Soghoghtani's husband Tolui, whose appanages {{included}} eastern Mongolia, {{parts of}} Iran and North China, {{died at the}} age of 40 in 1232. Ögedei Khan, Genghis's third son who had succeeded his father, gave her enduring authority to handle Tolui's estates. The Secret History suggests that Ögedei may have consulted Sorghaghtani on various matters, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> held her in high regard. Ogedei appointed her in charge of the Empire's administration, which meant she played a pivotal role in securing the lands won under Genghis Khan.|$|E

And I think that today of all days with the state visit and the warm relationship between Britain and Ireland that he can see that some of his work being completed.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Gable {{got along}} well with his co-stars during filming. Gable was great friends with actress Hattie McDaniel, {{and he even}} slipped her a real {{alcoholic}} drink during the scene {{in which they were}} supposed to be celebrating the birth of Scarlett and Rhett's daughter. Gable tried to boycott the premiere of Gone with the Wind in Atlanta, Georgia, because the African American McDaniel was not permitted to attend. He reportedly only went after she pleaded with him to go. Gable remained friends with McDaniel, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> attended her Hollywood parties, especially when she was raising funds during World War II.|$|E
25|$|For {{historian}} Akira Fujiwara, {{the thesis}} that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war. Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule {{in the manner of}} the British constitutional monarchy, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> accepted the decisions and consensus reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as Prince Chichibu, Prince Yasuhiko Asaka, Prince Higashikuni, Prince Hiroyasu Fushimi and Prince Takeda.|$|E
5|$|Those {{lyrics are}} crazy. I {{listen to that}} like, 'What was she doing?'

25|$|Schultz {{was born}} to German Jewish {{immigrants}} Herman and Emma (Neu) Flegenheimer, who had married in Manhattan on November 10, 1900. He had a younger sister, Helen, born in 1904. Herman Flegenheimer apparently abandoned his family, and Emma is listed as divorced in the 1910 census. (In her 1932 petition for U.S. citizenship, however, she wrote {{that her husband had}} died in 1910.) The event traumatized Schultz, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> denied his father had left them. Schultz would drop out of school in the eighth grade to help support himself and his mother. From 1916 to 1919, he worked as a feeder and pressman for the Clark Loose Leaf Company, Caxton Press, American Express, and Schultz Trucking in the Bronx. He then worked at a neighborhood night club owned by a minor mobster, and began robbing craps games before turning to burglary. Schultz was caught breaking into an apartment and sent to the prison on Blackwell's Island (now called Roosevelt Island). A photograph of Schultz at age 18, during his incarceration, was published in the 2010 book New York City Gangland.|$|E
