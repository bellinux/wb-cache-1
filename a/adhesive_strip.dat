50|$|Butterfly closures, {{also known}} as {{butterfly}} stitches, are generally thin <b>adhesive</b> <b>strips</b> {{which can be used}} to close small wounds. They are applied across the laceration in a manner which pulls the skin {{on either side of the}} wound together. They are not true sutures, but can often be used in addition to, or in place of real sutures for small wounds. Butterfly stitches can be advantageous in that they do not need a medical professional to be placed or removed, and are thus a common item in first aid kits.|$|R

50|$|Early {{half-inch}} tape {{had seven}} parallel tracks of data {{along the length}} of the tape allowing, six-bit characters plus one bit of parity written across the tape.

Effective recording density increased over time. Common seven-track densities started at 200, then 556, and finally 800 cpi and nine-track tapes had densities of 800 (using NRZI), 1600 (using PE), and 6250 cpi (using GCR). This translates into about 5 MB to 140 MB per standard length (2400ft) reel of tape. End of file was designated by a tape mark and end of tape by two tape marks.

50|$|Some nudans have a {{very large}} oral cavity, {{allowing}} them to swallow prey whole. While swimming, and particularly while pursuing prey, they close their mouths like a zipper so that they maintain a streamlined profile. The mouth is zipped closed from each end, and the edges seal shut by forming temporary inter-cellular connections. When close to the prey, the lips contract and the mouth is opened rapidly, sucking in the prey. This action is reversible and the lips can be resealed. An alternative method of feeding involves the lips spreading over the prey and the sword-shaped macrocilia lining the lips chopping off chunks. The lips are sealed {{by the presence of}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>strips</b> of epithelial cells along their opposite edges. Not all species seem to have these strips which seem specifically adapted to those with wide mouths whereas species with small oral openings are able to control the opening of the aperture by more conventional means.|$|R

40|$|Background Replacing mutant skin in {{epidermolysis bullosa}} (EB) by {{epithelial}} sheets of transduced autologous keratinocytes {{is the essential}} surgical step of ex vivo gene therapy. The same applies for revertant cell therapy in which epithelial sheets of revertant autologous keratinocytes are used. Revertant cells {{can be found in}} patches of normal skin in patients with junctional EB (JEB) due to revertant mosaicism caused by in vivo reversions. Objectives To develop a technique of <b>adhesive</b> tape <b>stripping</b> as a method for epidermis removal to prepare the acceptor site for revertant cell therapy in a patient with revertant mosaic JEB. Methods We performed revertant cell therapy on a patient with mosaic type XVII collagen-deficient non-Herlitz JEB. Skin biopsies were taken from revertant skin on the wrist. Graft production took place on a 3 T 3 -J 2 feeder layer resulting in two 6 x 7 cm grafts. An innovative method that uses the pathological plane of least resistance of JEB skin was developed to prepare the acceptor site. A polyacrylate adhesive plaster was placed on the skin and then pulled off with the epidermis. Results The epidermis was easily removed with the plaster. The skin separated {{at the level of the}} lamina lucida, leaving a bloodless wound bed of naked lamina densa. Transplantation was successful; the acceptor site healed without scarring. However, blistering could be provoked. The functional repair was not achieved due to the low percentage of revertant cells in the graft. Conclusions We conclude that <b>adhesive</b> <b>stripping</b> is a simple, effective and almost painless procedure for removing epidermis for ex vivo cell therapy in EB...|$|R
40|$|A ctin filaments, {{with the}} aid of {{multiple}} accessory proteins, self-assemble into a variety of network patterns. We studied the organization and dynamics of the actin network in nonadhesive regions of cells bridging fibronectin-coated <b>adhesive</b> <b>strips.</b> The network was formed by actin nodes associated with and linked by myosin II and containing the formin disheveled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (DAAM 1) and the crosslinker filamin A (FlnA). After Latrunculin A (LatA) addition, actin nodes appeared to be more prominent and demonstrated drift-diffusion motion. Superresolution microscopy revealed that, in untreated cells, DAAM 1 formed patches with a similar spatial arrangement to the actin nodes. Node movement (diffusion coefficient and velocity) in LatA-treated cells was dependent on the level and activity of myosin IIA, DAAM 1, and FlnA. Based on our results, we developed a computational model of the dynamic formin-filamin-actin asters that can self-organize into a contractile actomyosin network. We suggest that such networks are critical for connecting distant parts of the cell to maintain the mechanical coherence of the cytoplasm. © 2013 Shigeoka et al. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
