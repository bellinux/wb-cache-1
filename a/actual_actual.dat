There is no record of Ruby having made any more voyages for the EIC, and the EIC still had a monopoly on trade between England and India and China. It is, therefore, most probable that Ruby sailed as a London-registered [...] "country ship", i.e., only within the Far East.|$|E

Using a new dataset covering over 250, 000 randomly selected potential city locations, and all <b>actual</b> <b>actual</b> cities during the period 800 – 1800, we disentangle the different roles of geography in shaping today’s European city system. We find that a location’s physical, first nature, geography characteristics are the dominant determinant of city location. A location’s relative position to already-existing cities (its second nature geography) only becomes important during the later centuries. Interestingly, we show that it does {{so in a way}} corresponding closely to predictions from new economic geography theory...|$|E
40|$|A {{variable}} stability, blended-wing-body research mini-UAV {{was developed}} at the CSIR in South Africa. The purpose of the UAV was to study some of the aerodynamic design and control issues associated with flying wing geometries {{and to develop a}} practical methodology for aerodynamic optimisation of this class of UAV. Optimisation was performed in two phases – first optimisation of the planform shape and then the design of a family of optimised aerofoils. The approach was shown to be practical and gave interesting insight into the advantages and challenges of relaxing some of the flying qualities constraints during the aerodynamic design process.

40|$|Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, {{originally}} {{developed in the}} context of time series analysis, were used to predict Test Day (TD) yields of milk production traits in dairy cows. ARMA models are able to take into account both the average lactation curve of homogeneous groups of animals and the residual individual variability that may be explained in terms of probability models, such as Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) processes. Milk, fat, and protein yields of 6000 Italian Simmental cows with 8 TDrecords per lactation were analyzed. Data were grouped according to parity (1 st, 2 nd, and 3 rd calving) and fitted to a Box-Jenkins ARMA model in order to predict TD yields in five situations of incomplete lactations. Reasonable accuracies have been obtained for a limited horizon of prediction: average correlations among actual and predicted data were 0. 85, 0. 72, and 0. 80 for milk, fat and protein yields when the first predicted TD was one step ahead (on average 42 d) of the last actual record available. Cumulative 305 -d yields were calculated using all <b>actual</b> (<b>actual</b> yields) or actual plus forecasted (estimated yields) daily yields. Accuracy of lactation predictions was remarkable even when only a few actual TD records were available, with values of 0. 88 for milk and protein and 0. 84 for fat for the correlations between actual and estimated yields when 6 out of 8 TD records were predicted. Accuracy rapidly increases with the number of actual TD available: correlations were about 0. 96 for milk and protein and 0. 93 for fat when 4 out of 8 TD records were predicted. In comparison with other prediction methods, ARMA models are very simple and can be easily implemented in data recording software, even at the farm level...|$|E

40|$|Willard van Orman Quine {{once said}} that he had a {{preference}} for a desert ontology. This was in an earlier day when concerns with logical structure and ontological simplicity reigned supreme. Ontological genocide was practiced upon whole classes of upper-level or "derivative " entities in the name of elegance, and we were secure in the belief that one strayed irremediably into the realm of conceptual confusion and possible error the further one got from ontic fundamentalism. In those days, one paid more attention to generic worries about possible errors (motivated by our common training in philosophical scepticism) than to <b>actual</b> errors derived from distancing oneself too far from the nitty-gritty details of <b>actual</b> theory, <b>actual</b> inferences from <b>actual</b> data, the <b>actual</b> conditions under which we posited and detected entities, calibrated and "burned in " instruments, identified and rejected artifacts, debugged programs and procedures, explained the mechanisms behind regularities, judged correlations to be spurious, and in general, the real complexities and richness of <b>actual</b> scientific practice. The belief that logic and philosophy were prior to any possible science has had a number of distorting effects on philosophy of science. One of these was that for ontology, we seemed never to be able to reject the null hypothesis: "Don't multiply entities beyond necessity. " But Ockham's razor (or was it Ockham's eraser?) has a curiously ambiguous form [...] an escape clause which can turn it into a safety razor: How do we determine what is necessary?
