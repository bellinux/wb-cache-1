5|$|Methylmalonic acidemia – an <b>autosomal</b> {{recessive}} {{metabolic disorder}} that mimics {{the effects of}} ethylene glycol poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, an <b>autosomal</b> {{recessive}} condition {{caused by}} mutations in PANK2.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (<b>autosomal</b> recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems {{to play a role in}} the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with <b>autosomal</b> recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other <b>autosomal</b> dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also <b>autosomal</b> recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Among other innovations, {{the project}} {{developed}} DNA-marking methods which were {{an important step}} in making the Human Genome Project possible. In 1993, the research group isolated the precise causal gene at 4p16.3, making this the first <b>autosomal</b> disease locus found using genetic linkage analysis.|$|E
5|$|Chorea acanthocytosis is an <b>autosomal</b> {{recessive}} disorder {{caused by}} mutations in the VPS13A, also called CHAC, on chromosome 9q21. The gene encodes the protein Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13A, {{also known as}} chorein. The protein's function is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Chronic copper {{toxicity}} {{does not}} normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion. <b>Autosomal</b> recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to Wilson's disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis {{of the liver}} in persons who have inherited two defective genes.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary hemorrhagic {{telangiectasia}} (HHT), {{also known}} as Osler–Weber–Rendu disease and Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome, is a rare <b>autosomal</b> dominant genetic disorder that leads to abnormal blood vessel formation in the skin, mucous membranes, and often in organs such as the lungs, liver, and brain.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{measurements}} of the molecular clock for mitochondrial DNA reported a value of 1 mutation every 7884 years {{dating back to the}} most recent common ancestor of humans and apes, which is consistent with estimates of mutation rates of <b>autosomal</b> DNA (10−8 per base per generation).|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{heritability}} of Alzheimer's disease (and memory components thereof), {{based on}} reviews of twin and family studies, ranges from 49% to 79%. Around 0.1% {{of the cases}} are familial forms of <b>autosomal</b> (not sex-linked) dominant inheritance, which have an onset before age 65. This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Most of <b>autosomal</b> dominant familial AD {{can be attributed to}} mutations in one of three genes: those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42, which is the main component of senile plaques. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—particularly Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} cause in unknown. Various scientists and physicians {{have suggested that}} this condition {{may be the result}} of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and <b>autosomal</b> dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E
5|$|<b>Autosomal</b> {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD), a hereditary kidney condition, {{is known to be}} associated with cerebral aneurysms in 8 percent of cases, but most such aneurysms are small and therefore unlikely to rupture. As a result, screening is only recommended in families with ADPKD where one family member has had a ruptured aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|Counseling and {{guidelines}} {{on the use}} of genetic testing for HD have become models for other genetic disorders, such as <b>autosomal</b> dominant cerebellar ataxias. Presymptomatic testing for HD has also influenced testing for other illnesses with genetic variants such as polycystic kidney disease, familial Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network have published yearly external quality assessment scheme for molecular genetic testing for this disease and have developed best practice guidelines for genetic testing for HD to assist in testing and reporting of results.|$|E
5|$|HHT is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} by definition. It is inherited in an <b>autosomal</b> dominant manner, {{which means that}} an affected person carries one abnormal gene with a 50% chance of passing this gene to offspring. Those with HHT symptoms that have no relatives with the disease may have a new mutation. It seems that carrying two abnormal copies of the gene is not compatible with life, and hence no homozygotes have been described.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} <b>autosomal</b> {{dominant}} inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one {{copy of the}} gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that those with the syndrome {{who are capable of}} having children seek genetic counseling before deciding to have children. As the syndrome presents frequently as a forme fruste (incomplete, or unusual form) variant, an examination of all family members must be undertaken. As an <b>autosomal</b> dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with the syndrome. Although fully penetrant, since the syndrome has variable expressivity, one generation may have a mild expression of the syndrome, while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E
5|$|It {{may lead}} to nosebleeds, acute and chronic {{digestive}} tract bleeding, and various problems due to the involvement of other organs. Treatment focuses on reducing bleeding from blood vessel lesions, and sometimes surgery or other targeted interventions to remove arteriovenous malformations in organs. Chronic bleeding often requires iron supplements and sometimes blood transfusions. HHT is transmitted in an <b>autosomal</b> dominant fashion, and occurs in one in 5,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene {{were linked}} to <b>autosomal</b> {{dominant}} (i.e. requiring only one abnormal copy) FH in a 2003 report. The gene {{is located on the}} first chromosome (1p34.1-p32) and encodes a 666 amino acid protein that is expressed in the liver. It has been suggested that PCSK9 causes FH mainly by reducing the number of LDL receptors on liver cells.|$|E
5|$|Neuroacanthocytosis {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1950 as Bassen-Kornzweig disease, or Bassen-Kornzweig Syndrome, a rare, <b>autosomal</b> recessive, childhood-onset disorder {{in which the}} body fails to produce chylomicrons, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Symptoms include ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, retinitis pigmentosa {{and other forms of}} nerve dysfunction. It was first noted by the North American physician Frank Bassen, who later partnered with the ophthalmologist Abraham Kornzweig to identify and describe causes and symptoms of the disease. Affected children appear normal at birth but usually fail to thrive during their first year.|$|E
5|$|Other {{causes that}} can {{secondarily}} produce parkinsonism are stroke and drugs. Parkinson plus syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy must be ruled out. Anti-Parkinson's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson plus syndromes. Faster progression rates, early cognitive dysfunction or postural instability, minimal tremor or symmetry at onset may indicate a Parkinson plus disease rather than PD itself. Genetic forms with an <b>autosomal</b> dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance are {{sometimes referred to}} as familial Parkinson's disease or familial parkinsonism.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous {{adenitis}} is an {{autoimmune disease}} that affects sebaceous glands. It is mainly known {{to occur in}} dogs, particularly poodles and akitas, where it {{is thought to be}} generally <b>autosomal</b> recessively inherited. It has also been described in cats, and one report describes this condition in a rabbit. In these animals, it causes hair loss, though the nature and distribution of the hair loss differs greatly.|$|E
5|$|Some Giant Schnauzers develop central {{diabetes}} insipidus, <b>autosomal</b> recessive hypothyroidism, selective malabsorption of cobalamin, narcolepsy, cataplexy, {{and various}} seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common {{causes of death}} in Giant Schnauzers are lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by heart attacks and heart failure.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{is one of}} the dog breeds {{affected}} by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the rods and cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an <b>autosomal</b> recessive trait and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} is inherited in an <b>autosomal</b> recessive pattern. In order to inherit it, {{both of the}} parents of an individual must carry an affected gene. Most have no family history of the condition. People with only one abnormal gene are called carriers (heterozygotes) and may have mild, but medically insignificant, abnormalities of copper metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The {{disorder}} {{has been}} reported in more than 100 families worldwide, though some sources cite up to 400 families, and it is inherited in an <b>autosomal</b> dominant pattern. It is considered to be under-diagnosed because of the variability in its expression. The pattern of mutations and spectrum of symptoms are heterogeneous between individuals. Less severe skin phenotypes are seen in women and people of both sexes who have a late onset of skin symptoms.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been reports in other genetic conditions, such as osteogenesis imperfecta type 1, <b>autosomal</b> {{dominant}} polycystic kidney disease and pseudoxanthoma elasticum, α1 antitrypsin deficiency and hereditary hemochromatosis, but evidence for these associations is weaker. Genetic studies in other connective tissue-related genes have mostly yielded negative results. Other abnormalities to the blood vessels, such as fibromuscular dysplasia, {{have been reported in}} a proportion of cases. Atherosclerosis does not appear to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} an <b>autosomal</b> {{recessive}} condition {{due to a}} mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. For a person to be affected they must inherit an affected copy of the gene from each parent. Diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests, urine tests, and a liver biopsy. Genetic testing {{may be used to}} screen family members of those affected.|$|E
5|$|About 1 in 300 to 500 {{people have}} {{mutations}} in the LDLR gene that encodes the LDL receptor protein, which normally removes LDL from the circulation, or apolipoprotein B (ApoB), {{which is the}} part of LDL that binds with the receptor; mutations in other genes are rare. People who have one abnormal copy (are heterozygous) of the LDLR gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40. Having two abnormal copies (being homozygous) may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood. Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder, inherited in an <b>autosomal</b> dominant pattern, occurring in 1:500 people in most countries; homozygous FH is much rarer, occurring in 1 in a million births.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe <b>autosomal</b> recessive disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a disease progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Scottie cramp is an <b>autosomal</b> {{recessive}} hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's {{ability to}} walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{abnormalities}} are in {{some cases}} completely responsible for hypercholesterolemia, such as in familial hypercholesterolemia, where one or more genetic mutations in the <b>autosomal</b> dominant APOB gene exist, the <b>autosomal</b> recessive LDLRAP1 gene, <b>autosomal</b> dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (HCHOLA3) variant of the PCSK9 gene, or the LDL receptor gene. Familial hypercholesterolemia affects about one in five hundred people.|$|E
25|$|The {{hereditary}} ataxias are {{categorized by}} mode of inheritance and causative gene or chromosomal locus. The hereditary ataxias can be inherited in an <b>autosomal</b> dominant, <b>autosomal</b> recessive, or X-linked manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} {{congenital}} hyperinsulinism {{has been linked}} to anomalies in nine different genes. The diffuse form of this condition is inherited via the <b>autosomal</b> recessive manner(though sometimes in <b>autosomal</b> dominant).|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{study by}} Paull et al. {{analyzed}} <b>autosomal</b> SNP data from FTDNA's Family Finder test for 100 study participants, divided into Jewish, non-Jewish, and interfaith study groups. It reported <b>autosomal</b> DNA test values, {{such as the}} size and number of shared DNA segments, the number of genetic matches, {{and the distribution of}} predicted relationships, varies between study groups. The study also investigates how shared <b>autosomal</b> DNA, and longest block values vary by strength-of-relationship for each study group.|$|E
25|$|In dogs its {{inheritance}} is <b>autosomal</b> dominant.|$|E
