We investigated whether using a foot with a hydraulically controlled articulating ankle that allows the foot to be relatively dorsiflexed at toe-off and throughout swing would increase minimum toe clearance (MTC). Twenty-one people with unilateral transtibial amputation completed overground walking trials using their habitual prosthetic foot with rigid or elastic <b>articulating</b> <b>attachment</b> and a foot with a hydraulic ankle attachment (hyA-F). MTC and other kinematic variables were assessed across multiple trials. When using the hyA-F, mean MTC increased on both limbs (p= 0. 03). On the prosthetic limb this was {{partly due to the}} device being in its fully dorsiflexed position at toe-off, which reduced the “toes down” foot angle throughout swing (p = 0. 01). Walking speed also increased when using the hyA-F (p = 0. 001) and was associated with greater swing-limb hip flexion on the prosthetic side (p = 0. 04), which {{may have contributed to the}} increase in mean MTC. Variability in MTC increased on the prosthetic side when using the hyA-F (p = 0. 03), but this did not increase risk of tripping...|$|R

While sociological research on popular music audiences is well established, {{little attention has been}} paid to the articulation and management of fan practices of individuals beyond the age of 30. Based on ethnographic interviews conducted with older punk fans in East Kent, England, the article begins to redress this oversight in studies of popular music audiences. This involves an assessment of both the way in which articulations of punk style transgress with age from the visual to the biographical and how older punks develop particular discursive practices as a means of legitimating their place within a scene dominated by younger punk fans.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{experiences}} of Scotland's largest foreign-born minority group, namely Poles, {{in the run-up to}} the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. We draw on 20 in-depth interviews to explore our participants’ intentions and justifications for voting (or not) in the referendum. We found that our participants tended to emphasise the jus domicili principle when justifying their eligibility to vote in the referendum. However, our participants extended the jus domicili principle in their justifications to also include the intention to stay in Scotland as a central aspect of their continuing stake in (and right to vote in the referendum to determine) Scotland's future. Through exploring our participants’ justifications for voting in the referendum, we were able to examine and better understand how migrants constitute their citizenship through <b>articulating</b> their substantive <b>attachments</b> (social, economic and relational or familial) in their adoptive country and in their country of origin...|$|R

Este artigo tem como objetivo {{discutir}} criticamente o papel de estudos transculturais sobre responsividade materna, à luz da teoria do apego, a partir da revisão da literatura recente sobre o tema. Considerando a teoria do apego um referencial valioso para investigações sobre interações mãe-bebê e responsividade materna, as conclusões apontam, basicamente, para três questões: 1) a teoria do apego precisa ser investigada em diferentes contextos socioculturais e receber validação transcultural; 2) pesquisas sobre responsividade materna devem considerar a discussão sobre a teoria do apego e diferenças culturais; 3) a inclusão do estudo da responsividade materna em referenciais teóricos que levem em conta variáveis socioculturais é necessária.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{investigation}} into processes of becoming-stakeholder. It focuses specifically on strategic spatial planning where the stakeholder concept {{has become one of}} the linchpins of much contemporary theory and practice. Through drawing upon the sociology of attachments and scholarship on subjectification, it is argued that the enactment of stakeholders in strategic planning processes can be gainfully understood as the production of stakeholder subjectivities by way of practices of ontological choreography which can generate territorial attachments and rearticulate existing attachments into a specifically territorial format. From this perspective, stakeholderness is never an ontologically pregiven property to be uncovered by diligent analysis. Rather, we might come to see that stakeholder subjectification is a process through which actors learn to be affected, and where these affections further come to be <b>articulated</b> as territorial <b>attachments</b> engendering, or at least prompting, a 'caring for place'. Still, as relational effects, subjectivities are always potentially precarious achievements and it is important not to take for granted that the subjectivities enacted in a specific situation or setting will be easily transposable to other contexts.

40|$|TO MAKE THE WORLD HABITABLE This {{thesis is}} based on {{narratives}} of place associations as told by nine children of ethnic minority background living in Denmark. The narratives trouble the normalities of the positioning of children with ethnic minority backgrounds from {{an idea of the}} convergence between one place, one culture, and one identity. The narratives also challenge the understanding of place, as a geographically, bordered space. The field of inquiry for this thesis work is two Copenhagen “free-schools” established by parents of ethnic minority background. Nine children from 4 th and 5 th grade are invited to participate in this work as co-producers of knowledge. My theoretical point of departure is located in post-structuralism, mainly articulated through articles by Bronwyn Davies and Dorthe Staunæs. Davies and Staunæs offer a conceptual framework based on criticism and problematisation of the understanding of identity as essence and attached to a pre-determined social category. Furthermore, Karen Fog Olwig, among others, is introduced as a proponent for an understanding of the concept of place as defined by local and social relations. With emphasis on Staunæs’ and Davies’ understanding of social categories as constructed and fluid, and of the subject as always already discursively positioned. I analyze the narratives of nine children regarding their connections to and attachment with place. My theoretical understanding of place and subject offers an opportunity to contain the changeable, the ambiguous, and the antagonistic. With a point of departure in post-structuralist ways of thinking, I also choose a particular frame for production of knowledge with includes, among others, the premise that it is through language that we make sense, and realize the world. The world is constructed and understood through language and thus, reality and recognition cannot be separated. This has had two consequences for my understanding {{of the role of the}} researcher. This has resulted in the first analytical portion of my work, which discusses and reflects upon the construction of field and object, and of the relation between the children and myself (the researcher). Thus, the theoretical analysis frame involves an interactionistic perspective in the analysis of interviews, meaning that the interview is analyzed as a meeting. As such the focus is on both content and mode. Another theoretical point of departure of this thesis work is the adoption of the children’s perspectives, and this privileges children as active participants in their own lives. In order to live up to the standard of such a perspective, I have chosen to apply an array of different methods, that each in their own way invites the children to participate as co-producers of knowledge. The first task for the children was to photograph their daily lives. They were all interviewed on the basis of these photographs. In addition, I chose two of the children to participate in a focus group. Besides keeping a field diary during the whole process, I spoke with school leaders and teachers on several occasions, and had numerous informal conversations with many children in the schoolyard. The cross-disciplinary methods were an attempt to invite a dialogue in many ways, to thereby give the children an opportunity to articulate their connection to places. The second part of the analysis is an analysis of how the children articulated connection to places. The thesis concludes that children <b>articulate</b> <b>attachment</b> to places in many ways, which thereby troubles the normalities of belonging to pre-determined social categories. As such the notion of attachment to specific places (certain countries) because of their ways of doing is disrupted. Besides this, the children’s narratives can be seen as new or differing ways of understanding attachment. Their understandings lay the ground work for the notion of ‘place’ as drawing significance from local anchoring and from close personal experiences. This prepares the ground for transgressing the notion of place as bound up in national boundaries, in favor of a more dynamic understanding of place as located in personal experiences...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 Attachment between {{caregiver}} {{and child}} is an affectional, nurturing bond that develops through {{the provision of}} sensitive, constantly available, and responsive care for the child. The attachment bond evolves around diverse interactive experiences that encourage the development of cognitive-emotional schemata and the internalization of a cognitive-emotional working model of relationships. Different cultural experiences encourage the development of different cognitive-emotional schemata. Using a semi-structured interview, behavior, values, and the developmental endpoint associated with attachment was collaboratively explored with four Athabascan research participants, and concepts that emerged were compared and contrasted with those <b>articulated</b> by mainstream <b>attachment</b> theory within Western psychology. Attachment domains that emerged from triangulated interview data were (1) caregiver sensitivity, (2) trust development, (3) exploring, and (4) social competence. In mainstream attachment theory, one caregiver is the primary secure base for a child. Athabascan primary caregivers were a component of a larger community-wide secure base that included important secondary caregivers within a large kinship structure. In mainstream attachment theory, Western cultural values guide a social attachment process toward autonomy and self-direction for the individual. Athabascan community encourages values such as sharing of materials and community solidarity; an endpoint to the attachment process is instead social competence...|$|R
40|$|The area of Notting Hill in west London {{has been}} subject to much media {{coverage}} in recent years, which, along with substantial gentrification, {{has given rise to}} an image of the area as the epitome of fashionable London. This study investigates the views of those marginal to gentrification and mediated representation on their feelings about the local area, its image and their changing neighbourhoods. Many participants in the research resented some of the more recent changes in Notting Hill and the area's representation in the media. However, in contrast to expectations, most of the more working-class respondents involved in the research did not <b>articulate</b> much emotional <b>attachment</b> to the area. They were more concerned with what might be termed the material aspects of life in Notting Hill: convenience, facilities, safety and so on. In contrast, the more middle-class respondents frequently spoke of their regret of the changes to the area, such as the loss of independent shops, and the reduction in diversity. Paradoxically, the loss of working-class landscapes seems a relatively middle-class worry. The symbolically important landscapes described by working-class respondents were related to more immediate, material issues, in which gentrification was only a relatively minor concern.

40|$|While {{there is}} great radical and anti-capitalist {{potential}} within the “Food Movement,” it can often be undermined by foodie culture’s attachment to a problematic racial politics in which white, urban and middle/upper classed subject positions are <b>articulated</b> through romanticized <b>attachments</b> to local and organic foodways, attachments that at times unconsciously echo nativist and settle colonial sentiments. These problematic racial logics limit the food movement’s ability to fully address the ways by which the corporate domination of the food system disproportionally impacts low-income communities and communities of color. This article contends that food educators must fundamentally rewrite and reshape the very foundations of our food pedagogy to forefront the ways by which the food system is {{and always has been}} driven by the exploitation of bodies of color, the forced removal of Indigenous peoples from their homelands and the ways by which food access continues to be predicated on systems of power that perpetuate racial genocide. Drawing upon the experiences from a unit taught on “soul food” in an undergraduate course on the U. S. Food System, this article offers pedagogical strategies and innovative interdisciplinary methodological approaches to teaching the race based apartheid within the American food system and role of race within contemporary food justice movements. As such, this article will contend that conversations with students on soul food, and a race-centered analysis of the food system, ultimately result in a more radical food consciousness, one that is not just located in food related issues, but also grounded in a foundational critique of the complex hierarchal systems of power and oppression that drive American society...|$|R
