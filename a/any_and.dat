5|$|By saying this, Kennedy was admonishing {{people not}} to riot in wake of King's death and in effect equating their actions {{to that of the}} civil rights leader's assassin. After quoting Abraham Lincoln, he portrayed the American public as a people {{increasingly}} succumbing to its violent tendencies that undermined its national ideals. He argued that all deaths degraded American society, thereby assuming an uncompromising stance that <b>any</b> <b>and</b> all acts of violence were unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Cicero {{decided to}} stay with his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus for a time, during which he perused Atticus's library, reading <b>any</b> <b>and</b> all books that dealt with {{overcoming}} grief. Unsatisfied with what he found, he relocated to his villa at Astura, where he composed the Consolatio. It was during this time that he also wrote the famed—and now lost—dialogue Hortensius. Cicero later opined that the Consolatio was written in an attempt not only to heal himself emotionally, but also to benefit others who are mourning or experiencing sadness.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to prove Zariski density of {{crystalline}} representations in the rigid analytic space associated to the universal deformation ring of a d-dimensional mod p representation of Gal(K̅/K) for <b>any</b> d <b>and</b> <b>any</b> p-adic field K. This is a generalization of the results of Colmezand Kisin for d = 2 and K = Qp, of the author for d = 2 <b>and</b> <b>any</b> K, <b>and</b> of Chenevier for <b>any</b> d <b>and</b> K = Qp. A key ingredient for the proof is to construct a p-adic family of trianguline representations which can be seen as a local analogue of eigenvarieties. In this article, we construct such a family by generalizing Kisin’s theory of finite slope subspace Xfs for <b>any</b> d <b>and</b> <b>any</b> K, <b>and</b> using Bellaïche- Chenevier’s idea of using exterior products in the study of trianguline deformations...|$|R

5|$|The Prince {{had reason}} to feel aggrieved by this. He did have large patrimonial estates in the Netherlands that now were forfeit. Besides, {{the loss of his}} {{hereditary}} offices entailed a loss of income. According to his own calculations the arrears in all these incomes since 1795 amounted to 4 million guilders. The Staatsbewind refused to pay this, or any sum, point blank, and the peace treaty specifically exempted the Dutch from paying anything. Instead, an arrangement between the French, British and Prussians (the former stadtholder's champions) in the matter was reached that in return for dropping <b>any</b> <b>and</b> all claims William was to be compensated with the abbatial domains of Fulda and Corvey Abbey (see also Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda).|$|E

Her only role is to be an object for men to look upon. The fact that she is able to achieve success by filling this simple role, contrasted against the protagonist's inability to succeed despite his hard work, reveals how differently the film industry views the roles of male and female actors.|$|E

5|$|The knights and {{the entire}} town mourn over Niren's death. Flynn realizes that the blastia used in the {{fortress}} where the aer abnormality originated, along with the piece he spotted on the floor, were a specialized type used only by Garista. Yuri and Flynn confront Garista with this information, and Garista reveals that he was attempting to illegally create {{a new kind of}} blastia, but failed and decided to leave the blastia to destroy itself, therefore destroying Shizontonia and killing <b>any</b> <b>and</b> all witnesses. Yuri and Flynn attempt to arrest Garista, but a fight ensues and Yuri kills him. In the aftermath, Shizontonia is evacuated due to the failure of the barrier blastia. Yuri leaves the knights, taking Niren's blastia as a keepsake and bringing Repede along with him, saying his goodbyes to everyone in the town. Flynn sees him off at the gates, and the two share a fond farewell, swearing to meet again one day.|$|E
5|$|The {{money was}} used to {{complete}} the line to Nantwich, and to build a reservoir at Bunbury Heath. The work was completed in August 1779, and the company hoped to raise enough money to then build the line to Middlewich. They proposed building it with narrow locks, to reduce the cost, but the shareholders were not prepared to support them; instead they concentrated on trying to generate traffic on the line that had been built. They attempted to mine salt at Nantwich, but failed to find <b>any,</b> <b>and</b> tried running boats on the Trent and Mersey, from which goods were carried over land to Nantwich, for onward carriage to Liverpool. They also ran boats for cargo and passengers on the canal itself. By the end of 1781, the company had no money {{and was unable to}} meet interest payments on the loans. They decided to forfeit the canal to Egerton, the main mortgagee, but he did not respond to their offer. Angry landowners who had not been paid drained Bunbury reservoir in March 1782, but somehow the committee managed to keep the canal open, by selling boats and land. Disaster struck in November 1787, when Beeston Staircase Locks collapsed, and there was no money to fund repairs.|$|E

5|$|Two of the Jain {{references}} to this parable {{are found in}} Tattvarthaslokavatika of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the Syādvādamanjari of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view. Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or doubt is the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. <b>Any</b> <b>and</b> all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.|$|E
5|$|Using the Geneforge {{to empower}} {{himself and his}} followers, the Barzites, Barzahl intends to bestow god-like {{abilities}} on himself and his followers within the city of Rising. Barzahl cut off contact with Drypeak, preparing to repel the inevitable assault of the Shaper Council, who they wish to remain independent from. The Takers, a faction of intelligent serviles who had originated on Sucia Island, were given powers by Barzahl because they worked for him. In turn the Takers created powerful dragon-like beasts called drakons, taught the drakons how to create life themselves, and betrayed Barzahl. The Takers stand for the total destruction of the Shaper Council. The Awakened, the other servile faction in Geneforge 2, believe that Shapers should treat them as equals. They had {{been working with the}} Barzites, but the Awakened's leader Learned Pinner rejected the Barzites' view that serviles need to be controlled. Trade and communications between Zakary's now Shaper Council loyalist Drypeak and the other three factions have ceased, replaced with spies and subterfuge. The player is free to decide which faction they wish to join, if <b>any,</b> <b>and</b> to explore the game world, reacting to the characters and situations they encounter.|$|E
