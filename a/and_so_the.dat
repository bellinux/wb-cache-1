5|$|A {{group of}} {{anomalous}} units, as mentioned above, {{had not been}} transferred into the new system; these were the two Irish Yeomanry regiments and the Volunteers of Bermuda and the Isle of Man. The decision had been taken to have no Territorial Force units in Ireland <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> two yeomanry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted in the Special Reserve as the North Irish Horse and South Irish Horse. The Isle of Man Volunteers and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps remained organised as Volunteers; whilst the new legislation did extend to the Isle of Man, the force was not reorganised there {{partly due to the}} difficulty of changing to annual training. Bermuda, the Channel Islands and Malta were not encompassed by the scope of the legislation, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> Militia there continued to operate under the old system.|$|E

5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the fraud {{argument}} is significantly flawed. The theory suggests that liability for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about {{as soon as the}} trustee accepts the property to hold on trust, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> fraud theory is not necessary to bind the trustee's hands.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of these problems, in 1954 serious {{consideration}} was given to scrapping the class and replacing them with Britannia class locomotives. However, the locomotives had excellent boilers and several other good features <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> decision was taken to rebuild them, removing several of Bulleid's less successful ideas.|$|E

5|$|As the Khmer Rouge had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E
5|$|By mid-summer of 1942, Mt. St. Peter Parish {{was once}} again without funds. By this time, the {{majority}} of the work on the new church had been completed <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> congregation agreed {{that it was time to}} sell the old St. Peter Church in order to fund the new church. The General Electric Company was willing to pay $16,000 for St. Peter's and on July 16, 1942, the church became the property of the General Electric Company.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} 23 August 1774. The Prince of Wales {{was invited to}} lay the first stone but declined, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> stone was laid by {{commission}} member Henry Hobart. The bridge opened to pedestrians in September 1776 and to other traffic on 12 January 1777, at which time the ferry service was closed, although work on the bridge was not completed until December 1777. A large milestone was placed at the Richmond end, giving the distances to other bridges and to local towns.|$|E

5|$|Every {{driver of}} a CMV is {{required}} {{to keep track of}} his/her time with a log book or an ELD. A log book is simply a notebook with a grid pattern on every page, dividing the 24-hour day into 15-minute (1/4-hour) segments. Drivers are required to make carbon copies of each page, so one page may be kept with the driver (to be produced upon inspection by DOT officers), <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> other copy may be sent to the driver's employer.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, three {{production}} Su-27Ms {{were delivered}} to the air force's 929th State Flight-Test Centre (GLITs) at , Akhtubinsk, to perform weapons trials. In 2001, the air force decided to transfer several Su-27Ms to re-equip the Russian Knights aerobatics team, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> team's pilots took familiarisation flights with the aircraft. The three production and two other pre-production Su-27Ms arrived at the team's Kubinka air base near Moscow in 2003.

5|$|In 2006, a new registry, the Foundation Foxtrotter Heritage Association (FFHA), {{was formed}} {{with a goal}} of {{preserving}} and promoting the original heritage type of Fox Trotter that {{was seen in the}} first 20 years of the MFTHBA registry, in large part through reducing the amount of Tennessee Walking Horse blood. The Tennessee Walker did not figure prominently in original Missouri Fox Trotter pedigrees, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> FFHA, by restricting the amount of Walker blood, is attempting to develop horses that more closely resemble the original Fox Trotter type.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1871, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant had named Hall as overall {{commander}} of the expedition, and he was being referred to as Captain. Though Hall had abundant Arctic experience, he had no sailing experience, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> title was purely honorary. In selecting the officers and seamen, Hall relied heavily on whalers with experience in the Arctic. This was markedly different from the polar expeditions of the British Admiralty, which tended to use naval officers and highly disciplined crews.|$|E
5|$|Most Native Americans in {{the region}} decided against joining the uprising, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> {{conflict}} ended after U.S. officials responded with a show of military force.

Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President John Quincy Adams and released.|$|E
5|$|Nilo Rodis, who {{had worked}} on two {{previous}} Star Trek features, was appointed the role of art director, and worked with Shatner to establish the film's visual design.
