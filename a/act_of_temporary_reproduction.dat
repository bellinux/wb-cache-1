5000|$|In {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries in England, as suicides came to be seen more and more as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> insanity, many coroner's juries began declaring more suicide victims as non compos mentis rather than felo de se.

While this tax break is likely to lead to a surge in temporary repatriations, it is unlikely to encourage new investment in the United States. Instead, the tax break sends a confused message about the intent of the U.

40|$|Why do we travel? Because {{we want to}} – {{or because}} we have no other choice? Some {{thoughts}} are presented {{about the benefits of}} travel from an individual and societal perspective. Travel is considered to represent induced demand in that the spatial configuration of land use and facilities requires individuals and households to travel in order to participate in their daily activities, which in turn are instrumental to achieving their needs, desires, and aspirations. Travel is however often more than only an episode of negative utility between two activity episodes. It may be a positive <b>act</b> <b>of</b> a <b>temporary</b> break from routines or an opportunity to release frustration, chill down, and recharge for things to come. Moreover, travel is also an opportunity to having a moment for oneself and enjoying the passing of the landscape and the brief non-obligatory, superficial encounters with others. These notions are used to derive a formalization that identifies the conditions under which the utility of travel becomes positive...|$|R

40|$|The Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, {{created in}} the Trade <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 2002, authorizes <b>temporary</b> {{payments}} to farmers hurt by import competition. The Act requires petitioning farmers to demonstrate that prices have fallen by at least the statutory minimum proportion, and importantly, {{as a result of}} rising foreign competition. With the raspberry industry as an example, we show that credible demonstration of import harm requires an econometric model distinguishing domestic from foreign impacts on U. S. prices. We construct such a model and use it to argue that raspberry producers-and specialty crops in general-will infrequently qualify for program assistance, despite recent apparent evidence of import-induced price damage.

However, the shift from permanent to temporary workers began long before. This paper empirically explores links between the shift from permanent to temporary workers in the Japanese manufacturing sector and economic globalization, using industry-level data. We find that outsourcing is positively correlated with the replacement of permanent workers with temporary workers in domestic production. In addition, we find that industries losing world share of value added tend to decrease the employment of permanent workers. Industries with higher exports or imports are aggressive in using temporary workers, which suggests the role <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> workers as an employment buffer...|$|R
50|$|Each {{state must}} meet certain {{criteria}} to ensure recipients are being encouraged to work {{themselves out of}} welfare. The new program is called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). It encourages states to require some sort of employment search in exchange for providing funds to individuals, and imposes a five-year lifetime limit on cash assistance. The bill restricts welfare from most legal immigrants and increased financial assistance for child care. The federal government also maintains a contingency $2 billion TANF fund (TANF CF) to assist states that may have rising unemployment. The new TANF program expired on September 30, 2010, on schedule with states drawing down the entire original emergency fund of $5 billion and the contingency fund of $2 billion allocated by ARRA.
