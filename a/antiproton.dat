5|$|Emilio Gino Segrè (1 February 1905 – 22 April 1989) was an Italian-American {{physicist}} and Nobel laureate, {{who discovered the}} elements technetium and astatine, and the <b>antiproton,</b> a subatomic antiparticle, {{for which he was}} awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, {{he became}} a {{naturalized}} citizen of the United States. On his return to Berkeley in 1946, {{he became a}} professor of physics and of history of science, serving until 1972. Segrè and Owen Chamberlain were co-heads of a research group at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory that discovered the <b>antiproton,</b> for which the two shared the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|Each {{particle}} {{of matter}} has a corresponding antimatter particle {{with the opposite}} electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the <b>antiproton</b> is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance {{between the number of}} matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.|$|E
40|$|Centrifugal {{separation}} of <b>antiprotons</b> and electrons is observed, {{the first such}} demonstration with particles that cannot be laser cooled or optically imaged. The spatial separation takes place during the electron cooling of trapped <b>antiprotons,</b> the only method available to produce cryogenic <b>antiprotons</b> for precision tests of fundamental symmetries and for cold antihydrogen studies. The centrifugal separation suggests a new approach for isolating low energy <b>antiprotons</b> and for producing a controlled mixture of <b>antiprotons</b> and electrons...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>antiprotons</b> {{are still}} hot when {{initially}} trapped. To cool them further, they are mixed into an electron plasma. The electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation, and then sympathetically cool the <b>antiprotons</b> via Coulomb collisions. Eventually, the electrons are removed by {{the application of}} short-duration electric fields, leaving the <b>antiprotons</b> with energies less than [...] While the <b>antiprotons</b> are being cooled in the first trap, a small cloud of positrons is captured from radioactive sodium in a Surko-style positron accumulator. This cloud is then recaptured in a second trap near the <b>antiprotons.</b> Manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the <b>antiprotons</b> into the positron plasma, where some combine with <b>antiprotons</b> to form antihydrogen. This neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and <b>antiprotons,</b> {{and within a few}} microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls, where it annihilates. Some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{catching}} trap slows, traps, cools, and accumulates <b>antiprotons.</b> To cool <b>antiprotons,</b> the catching trap {{is first}} loaded with [...] electrons, which cool by synchrotron radiation in the 3 T magnetic field. Typically, the AD delivers [...] <b>antiprotons</b> having kinetic energy 5.3 MeV and a pulse duration of 200 ns to the experiment at 100 s intervals. The <b>antiprotons</b> are slowed {{in a thin}} foil and trapped using a pulsed electric field. The <b>antiprotons</b> lose energy and equilibrate with the cold electrons by Coulomb interaction. The electrons are ejected before mixing the <b>antiprotons</b> with positrons. Each AD shot results in about [...] cold <b>antiprotons</b> for interaction experiments. The positron accumulator slows, traps and accumulates positrons emitted from a radioactive source (1. Bq Na22). Accumulation for 300 s yields 1. positrons, 50% of which are successfully transferred to the mixing trap, where they cool by synchrotron radiation.|$|R
5|$|Since baryons are {{composed}} of quarks, they participate in the strong interaction. Leptons, on the other hand, are not composed of quarks and as such {{do not participate in}} the strong interaction. The most famous baryons are the protons and neutrons that make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe, whereas electrons, the other major component of atoms, are leptons. Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle known as an antibaryon in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark, while its corresponding antiparticle, the <b>antiproton,</b> is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} offers from IBM and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Segrè {{returned}} to Berkeley in 1952. He {{moved his family}} from Berkeley to nearby Lafayette, California, in 1955. Working with Chamberlain and others, he began searching for the <b>antiproton,</b> a subatomic antiparticle of the proton. The antiparticle of the electron, the positron had been predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 and then discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932. By analogy, it was now expected {{that there would be}} an antiparticle corresponding to the proton, but no one had found one, and even in 1955 some scientists doubted that they existed. Using Lawrence's Bevatron set to 6GeV, they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons. Chamberlain and Segrè were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. This was controversial, because Clyde Wiegand and Thomas Ypsilantis were co-authors of the same article, but did not share the prize.|$|E
25|$|The <b>antiproton</b> is the {{antiparticle}} of the proton. It {{was discovered}} by University of California, Berkeley physicists Thomas Ypsilantis, Emilio Segrè, Clyde Wiegand, and Owen Chamberlain in 1955.|$|E
50|$|<b>Antiprotons</b> were {{produced}} by directing an intense proton beam at a momentum of 26 GeV/c from the Proton Synchrotron (PS) onto {{a target for}} production. The emerging burst of <b>antiprotons</b> had a momentum of 3.5 GeV/c, and was selected via a spectrometer, and injected into the AA. The produced <b>antiprotons</b> would have a substantial momentum spread, and during 2 s orbit around the AA this spread was decreased using Simon van der Meers method of stochastic cooling. The <b>antiprotons</b> were then trapped using a radiofrequency system, and moved inwards in the orbit to a stacking region. A next burst of <b>antiprotons</b> arrived at 2.4 s (the PS cycle time) after the preceding one. This process was repeated during the whole accumulation period, which took about a day. The most intense stack, obtained after many days, would typically contain 5.2·1011 <b>antiprotons.</b>|$|R
40|$|In many antihydrogen {{trapping}} schemes, <b>antiprotons</b> {{held in a}} short-well Penning–Malmberg trap {{are released}} into a longer well. This process necessarily causes the bounce-averaged rotation frequency Ω_r of the <b>antiprotons</b> around the trap axis to pass through zero. In {{the presence of a}} transverse magnetic multipole, experiments and simulations show that many <b>antiprotons</b> (over 30...|$|R
2500|$|The biggest {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} large-scale production of antimatter is the availability of <b>antiprotons.</b> Recent data released by CERN states that, when fully operational, their facilities are capable of producing ten million <b>antiprotons</b> per minute. Assuming a 100% conversion of <b>antiprotons</b> to antihydrogen, it would take 100 billion years to produce 1gram or 1 mole of antihydrogen (approximately [...] atoms of anti-hydrogen).|$|R
25|$|Each baryon has a {{corresponding}} antiparticle (antibaryon) where quarks {{are replaced by}} their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark; and its corresponding antiparticle, the <b>antiproton,</b> is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antiproton</b> {{annihilation}} Theoretically {{a quantity}} of antiprotons injected into a mass of fusion fuel can induce thermonuclear reactions. This possibility {{as a method of}} spacecraft propulsion, known as Antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion, was investigated at Pennsylvania State University in connection with the proposed AIMStar project.|$|E
25|$|Antimatter {{particles}} bind {{with one}} another to form antimatter, just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a positron (the antiparticle of the electron) and an <b>antiproton</b> (the antiparticle of the proton) can form an antihydrogen atom. Physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible, as well as anti-atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements.|$|E
40|$|The Future Accelerator Facility for Beams of Ions and <b>Antiprotons</b> at Darmstadt {{will produce}} the highest flux of <b>antiprotons</b> in the world. So far it is {{foreseen}} {{to accelerate the}} <b>antiprotons</b> to high energies (3 - 15 GeV) for meson spectroscopy and other nuclear and particle physics experiments in the HESR (High Energy Storage Ring). Within the planned complex of storage rings, {{it is possible to}} decelerate the <b>antiprotons</b> to about 30 MeV kinetic energy, opening up the possibility to create low energy <b>antiprotons.</b> In the proposed FLAIR facility the <b>antiprotons</b> shall be slowed down in a last step from 300 keV to 20 keV in an ultra-low energy electrostatic storage ring (USR) for various in-ring experiments as well as for their efficient injection into traps. In this energy range - especially if one thinks about realizing a real multi-purpose facility with not only <b>antiprotons,</b> but also various highly-charged radioactive ions to be stored and investigated - electrostatic storage rings have clear advantages compared to their magnetic counterparts. In case one envisions to even approach the eV range, electrostatic machines are the only possible choice. This contribution presents the layout and design parameters of the USR...|$|R

40|$|Positrons {{are used}} to cool <b>antiprotons</b> for the first time. The oppositely charged positrons and <b>antiprotons</b> are first {{simultaneously}} accumulated in separate Penning trap volumes, and then are spatially merged in a nested Penning trap.

25|$|In theory, a {{particle}} and its anti-particle {{have the same}} mass as one another, but opposite electric charge, and other differences in quantum numbers. For example, a proton has positive charge while an <b>antiproton</b> has negative charge. A collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner is known to lead to their mutual annihilation, giving rise to various proportions of intense photons (gamma rays), neutrinos, and sometimes less-massive particle–antiparticle pairs.|$|E
25|$|An antideuteron is the {{antimatter}} counterpart of {{the nucleus of}} deuterium, consisting of an <b>antiproton</b> and an antineutron. The antideuteron was first produced in 1965 at the Proton Synchrotron at CERN and the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory. A complete atom, with a positron orbiting the nucleus, would be called antideuterium, but as of 2005 antideuterium {{has not yet been}} created. The proposed symbol for antideuterium is , that is, D with an overbar.|$|E
25|$|In October 2017, {{scientists}} {{working on}} the BASE experiment at CERN reported a measurement of the <b>antiproton</b> magnetic moment to a precision of 1.5 parts per billion. It {{is consistent with the}} most precise measurement of the proton magnetic moment (also made by BASE in 2014), which supports the hypothesis of CPT symmetry. It should be noted that this measurement represents {{the first time that a}} property of antimatter is known more precisely than the equivalent property in matter.|$|E
40|$|Aside {{from the}} {{enhancement}} of physical dose deposited by <b>antiprotons</b> annihilating in tissue-like material compared to protons of the same range a further increase of biological effective dose has been demonstrated. This enhancement can be expressed in an increase of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of <b>antiprotons</b> {{near the end of}} range. We have performed the first-ever direct measurement of the RBE of <b>antiprotons</b> both at rest and in flight...|$|R
40|$|The {{physics of}} the {{annihilation}} of photinos is considered {{as a function of}} mass in detail, in order to obtain the energy spectra of the cosmic ray <b>antiprotons</b> produced under the assumption that photinos make up the missing mass in the galactic halo. The modulated spectrum is at 1 a. w. with the cosmic ray <b>antiprotons</b> data. A very intriguing fit is obtained to all of the present <b>antiprotons</b> up to 13. 4 GeV data for similar to 15 GeV. A cutoff is predicted in the <b>antiprotons</b> spectrum at E = photino mass above which only a small flux from secondary production should remain...|$|R
40|$|A {{possible}} {{signature of}} a class of superconducting cosmic strings trapped in the Milky Way plasma is the emission of low energy <b>antiprotons</b> due to baryon number violating processes on the string. We find the terrestrial flux and the energy spectrum of such <b>antiprotons.</b> Current observational bounds on the flux of low energy <b>antiprotons</b> place a lower bound on the string tension which is comparable to that given by the electroweak scale...|$|R
25|$|CR and the 1937 {{theory has}} led to a large array of {{applications}} in high energy physics. A notable application are the Cherenkov counters. These are used to determine various properties of a charged particle such as its velocity, charge, direction of motion, and energy. These properties are important in the identification of different particles. For example, the counters were applied in the discovery of the <b>antiproton</b> and the J particle. Six large Cherenkov counters were used in the discovery of the J particle.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, CERN {{announced}} that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the SLAC/Fermilab concept during the PS210 experiment. The experiment was performed using the Low Energy <b>Antiproton</b> Ring (LEAR), and was led by Walter Oelert and Mario Macri. Fermilab soon confirmed the CERN findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities. The antihydrogen atoms created during PS210 and subsequent experiments (at both CERN and Fermilab) were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study. To resolve this hurdle, and {{to gain a better}} understanding of antihydrogen, two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s, namely, ATHENA and ATRAP.|$|E
25|$|Goldhaber {{became a}} {{naturalized}} {{citizen of the}} United States in 1953. The Goldhabers moved to Berkeley, California in 1953 when Gerson was given {{a job as an}} assistant professor at the University of California. While Goldhaber had previously worked in physical chemistry, she was able to transition to high energy physics and form a collaboration with her husband working on nuclear emulsion. The Goldhabers hoped to use their nuclear emulsion technique with the newly opened Bevatron — at the time the highest energy accelerator in operation — and it was through their methods that they observed some of the earliest interactions between K− mesons and protons. Using the Bevatron and the nuclear emulsion technique Goldhaber was the first to observe mass splitting in charged E hyperons as well as the first nuclear interactions of the <b>antiproton.</b>|$|E
40|$|Production and {{trapping}} of <b>antiprotons</b> {{for space}} propulsion applications are reviewed. Present and foreseeable production rates at Fermilab are discussed, and experiments on trapping, confinement and transport of {{large quantities of}} <b>antiprotons,</b> as well as synthesis of atomic antihydrogen, are outlined...|$|R
50|$|In 2011, a study {{confirmed}} earlier {{speculation that}} the Van Allen belt could confine antiparticles. The PAMELA experiment detected orders of magnitude higher levels of <b>antiprotons</b> than are expected from normal particle decays while passing through the South Atlantic Anomaly. This suggests the Van Allen belts confine a significant flux of <b>antiprotons</b> produced by {{the interaction of the}} Earth's upper atmosphere with cosmic rays. The energy of the <b>antiprotons</b> has been measured in the range from 60-750 MeV.|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} succeeded in decelerating and confining millions of <b>antiprotons,</b> 50 times {{more efficiently than}} conventional methods, in an electromagnetic trap. These <b>antiprotons</b> were cooled by preloaded electron plasma to an energy below an electronvolt. They were then extracted out of the magnetic field of 2. 5 T and transported typically at 250 eV along a beamline, designed for efficient transport at 10 – 1000 eV. This unique beam from our apparatus named MUSASHI opens up a new field of atomic and nuclear physics probed by ultra‐slow <b>antiprotons.</b> In this paper, the whole experimental setup and procedure will be overviewed: deceleration, capture, cooling and extraction of <b>antiprotons</b> {{will be discussed in}} detail, including technical description of diagnostic devices...|$|R
25|$|Other astronomers suchs as Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1625–1712) and Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835–1910) {{made many}} {{important}} discoveries about the Solar System.

Fibonacci (c. 1170 – c. 1250), and Gerolamo Cardano (1501–76) made fundamental advances in mathematics. Luca Pacioli established accounting to the world.

40|$|The models {{proposed}} {{to explain the}} observed spectrum of cosmic ray <b>antiprotons</b> are reexamined {{in light of recent}} results from balloon-borne experiments. It is found that the prediction of modified closed galaxy model fits the observed data very well.

It has been shown that there cannot be any significant contribution to the observed <b>antiprotons,</b> from the evaporation of mini black holes or from the annihilation of dark matter like photinos. The role of extragalactic cosmic rays has been examined critically {{in the context of the}} recent data, and they are not the source of cosmic ray <b>antiprotons.</b> However, determination of the energy spectrum of <b>antiprotons</b> at least up to a few tens of GeV would be valuable to provide information on the possible existence of supersymmetric particles and on the modulation of extragalactic cosmic rays while entering the Galaxy...|$|R
