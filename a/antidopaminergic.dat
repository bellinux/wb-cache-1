25|$|Sometimes classed {{with the}} tetracyclic antidepressants. Has {{atypical}} antipsychotic actions too. Not available in Australia, Canada or the UK but {{available in the}} US. May be faster acting. <b>Antidopaminergic,</b> which means that it can cause extrapyramidal side effects, tardive dyskinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Causes kidney failure and seizures in overdose, although it usually does not cause cardiotoxic effects in overdose.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to binding to serotonin receptors, buspirone is an antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor with weak affinity. It preferentially blocks inhibitory presynaptic D2 autoreceptors, and antagonizes postsynaptic D2 receptors only at higher doses. In accordance, buspirone {{has been found}} to increase dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal pathway at low doses, whereas at higher doses, postsynaptic D2 receptors are blocked and <b>antidopaminergic</b> effects such as hypoactivity and reduced stereotypy, though notably not catalepsy, are observed in animals. Buspirone has also been found to bind with much higher affinity to the dopamine D3 and D4 receptors, where it is similarly an antagonist.|$|E

25|$|An {{accurate}} diagnosis may {{be difficult}} {{because of the way}} the disorder manifests itself. Sufferers may be diagnosed as having similar and perhaps related disorders including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, carpal tunnel syndrome, TMD, Tourette's syndrome, conversion disorder or other neuromuscular movement disorders. It has been found that the prevalence of dystonia is high in individuals with Huntington's disease, where the most common clinical presentations are internal shoulder rotation, sustained fist clenching, knee flexion, and foot inversion. Risk factors for increased dystonia in patients with Huntington's disease include long disease duration and use of <b>antidopaminergic</b> medication.|$|E
25|$|Clomipramine is a reuptake {{inhibitor}} of serotonin and norepinephrine, or a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI); that is, it {{blocks the}} reuptake of these neurotransmitters back into neurons by {{preventing them from}} interacting with their transporters, thereby increasing their extracellular concentrations in the synaptic cleft and resulting in increased serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. In addition, clomipramine also has antiadrenergic, antihistamine, antiserotonergic, <b>antidopaminergic,</b> and anticholinergic activities. It is specifically an antagonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor, the histamine H1 receptor, the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, the dopamine D1, D2, and D3 receptors, and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1–M5). Like other TCAs, clomipramine weakly blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels as well.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to nausea occurs within 7–10 days, {{during which}} antiemetics (e.g. low dose {{haloperidol}} once at night) are very effective. Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is now rarely used. A related drug, prochlorperazine {{is more often}} used, although it has similar risks. Stronger antiemetics such as ondansetron or tropisetron are sometimes used when nausea is severe or continuous and disturbing, despite their greater cost. A less expensive alternative is dopamine antagonists such as domperidone and metoclopramide. Domperidone does not cross the blood–brain barrier and produce adverse central <b>antidopaminergic</b> effects, but blocks opioid emetic action in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. (The drug is not available in the U.S.) Some antihistamines with anticholinergic properties (e.g. orphenadrine or diphenhydramine) may also be effective. The first-generation antihistamine hydroxyzine is very commonly used, with the added advantages of not causing movement disorders, and also possessing analgesic-sparing properties. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol relieves nausea and vomiting; it also produces analgesia that may allow lower doses of opioids with reduced nausea and vomiting.|$|E
50|$|Misregulation of this pathway would sympathetically dysregulate LTP via {{disruption}} of NMDA. Such alteration in LTP {{may play a}} role, specifically in negative symptoms of schizophrenia, in creation of more broad disruptions such as loss of brain volume; an effect of the disease which <b>antidopaminergics</b> actually worsen, rather than treat.|$|R
40|$|Bipolar affective {{disorder}} {{is a common}} neuropsychiatric disorder. Whilst its neurobiological underpinnings are incompletely understood, the dopamine hypothesis has been a key theory of the pathophysiology of both manic and depressive phases of the illness for over four decades. The increased use of <b>antidopaminergics</b> {{in the treatment of}} this disorder and new in vivo neuroimaging and post-mortem studies makes it timely to review this theory. To do this, we conducted a systematic search for post-mortem, pharmacological and imaging studies of dopamine function in bipolar disorder. Converging findings from pharmacological and imaging studies support the hypothesis that a state of hyperdopaminergia, specifically elevations in D 2 / 3 receptor availability and a hyperactive reward processing network, underlies mania. In bipolar depression imaging studies show increased dopamine transporter levels, but changes in other aspects of dopaminergic function are inconsistent. Puzzlingly, pharmacological evidence shows that both dopamine agonists and <b>antidopaminergics</b> can improve bipolar depressive symptoms and perhaps actions at other receptors may reconcile these findings. Tentatively, this evidence suggests a model where an elevation in striatal D 2 / 3 receptor availability would lead to increased dopaminergic neurotransmission and mania, whilst increased striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) levels would lead to reduced dopaminergic function and depression. Thus, it can be speculated that a failure of dopamine receptor and transporter homeostasis might underlie the pathophysiology of this disorder. The limitations of this model include its reliance on pharmacological evidence, as these studies could potentially affect other monoamines, and the scarcity of imaging evidence on dopaminergic function. This model, if confirmed, has implications for developing new treatment strategies such as reducing the dopamine synthesis and/or release in mania and DAT blockade in bipolar depression...|$|R
40|$|Background: Restless-legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) {{is known}} to be caused by dopaminergic hypofunction in the brain. We investigated whether antipsychotics that act as <b>antidopaminergics</b> increase the risk of RLS. Methods: We prospectively recruited 72 schizophrenic patients who had been medicated with antipsychotic drugs in a psychiatry clinic. We evaluated RLS diagnostic criteria and basic sleep habits using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index by face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. We also applied the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale to evaluate extrapyramidal symptoms. Results: Three of the 72 patients (4. 2 %) met RLS criteria, which is similar to the previously reported RLS incidence among the general population in Korea. Conclusions: There is no evidence that antipsychotics increase the risk of RLS. We believe that the mild anti-dopaminergic effect of antipsychotics does not overwhelm their prominent antipsychotic effect...|$|R

2500|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{dystonia}} {{is aimed at}} reducing symptoms such as involuntary movements, pain, contracture, embarrassment, and to restore normal posture and improve the patient’s function. [...] This treatment is therefore not neuroprotective. [...] According to the European Federation of Neurological Sciences and Movement Disorder Society, there is no evidence-based recommendation for treating primary dystonia with <b>antidopaminergic</b> or anticholinergic drugs although recommendations {{have been based on}} empirical evidence. [...] Anticholinergic drugs prove to be most effective in treating generalized and segmental dystonia, especially if dose starts out low and increases gradually. [...] Generalized dystonia has also been treated with such muscle relaxants as the benzodiazepines. [...] Another muscle relaxant, baclofen, can help reduce spasticity seen in cerebral palsy such as dystonia in the leg and trunk. [...] Treatment of secondary dystonia by administering levodopa in dopamine-responsive dystonia, copper chelation in Wilson’s disease, or stopping the administration of drugs that may induce dystonia have been proven effective in a small number of cases. [...] Physical therapy has been used to improve posture and prevent contractures via braces and casting, although in some cases, immobilization of limbs can induce dystonia, which is by definition known as peripherally induced dystonia. [...] There are not many clinical trials that show significant efficacy for particular drugs, so medical of dystonia must be planned on a case-by-case basis. Botulinum toxin B, or Myobloc, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat cervical dystonia due to level A evidential support by the scientific community. Surgery known as GPi DBS (Globus Pallidus Pars Interna Deep Brain Stimulation) has come to be popular in treating phasic forms of dystonia, although cases involving posturing and tonic contractions have improved to a lesser extent with this surgery. [...] A follow-up study has found that movement score improvements observed one year after the surgery was maintained after three years in 58% of the cases. [...] It has also been proven effective in treating cervical and cranial-cervical dystonia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{secretion}} of gonadotropins (GtH) in goldfish and carp, is {{stimulated by}} GtH-releasing hormone (GnRH) and is inhibited by dopamine. Studies with <b>antidopaminergics</b> have demonstrated {{to be effective}} in order to stimulate the spermiation and the ovulation in different species of teleosts. The reserpine, a drug that deplets the dopamine, has shown to stimulate the spermiation in the common carp. We report here, the effects of reserpine on the number and volume of gonadotrophic cells of the common carp. Eight injections of reserpine alone, at doses of 0. 5, 1. 0 or 1. 5 mg/ml/kg of body weight and at intervals of 48 hours, caused {{an increase in the number}} and volume of gonadotrophic cells. The dose 0. 5 mg/ml/kg, presented an increase in the number and volume of gonadotrophic cells of 382 % and 123 %, respectively, above the control group. The dose 1. 0 mg/ml/kg, showed an enhanced number and volume of gonadotrophic cells of 704 % and 152 %, respectively. With the dose 1. 5 mg/ml/kg increase in number (171 %) and volume (106 %) of gonadotrophic cells was lower. The gonads of the experimental groups had an abundance of advanced states of spermatogenesis. Our results show that eight intraperitoneal injections of reserpine were responsible for an increase in gonadodrophic cell, number and volume...|$|R

Group P received the placebo (0. 9 % normal saline 2 ml) and Group D received 10 mg dexamethasone intravenously right before theinduction of anesthesia. Results: We found that during the postoperative period of 1 - 8 h, patients in Group Dreported a lower incidence of PONV (24 %) than those in Group P (39 %, p < 0. 001).
