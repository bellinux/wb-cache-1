40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for the purification of a neutral protease from fermentation broths of Vibrio proteolyticus.

We {{describe}} herein the design and in vitro biochemical evaluation of a novel class of mechanism-based inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase (HLE) that inactivate the enzyme via an unprecedented enzyme-induced sulfonamide fragmentation cascade. The inhibitors incorporate in their structure an appropriately functionalized saccharin scaffold. Furthermore, the inactivation of the enzyme by these inhibitors {{was found to be}} time-dependent and to involve the active site. Biochemical, HPLC, and mass spectrometric studies show that the interaction of these inhibitors with HLE results in the formation of a stable acyl complex and is accompanied by the release of (L) <b>phenylalanine</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ester.</b> The data are consistent with initial formation of a Michaelis-Menten complex and subsequent formation of a tetrahedral intermediate with the active site serine (Ser(195)). Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate with tandem fragmentation results in the formation of a highly reactive conjugated sulfonyl imine which can either react with water to form a stable acyl enzyme and/or undergo a Michael addition reaction with an active site nucleophilic residue (His(57)). It is also demonstrated herein that this class of compounds can be used in the design of inhibitors of serine proteases having either a neutral or basic primary substrate specificity. Thus, the results suggest that these inhibitors constitute a potential general class of mechanism-based inhibitors of (chymo) trypsin-like serine proteases. NHLBI NIH HHSpeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the asymmetric hydrogenation of methyl (Z) - 2 -acetamidocinnamate (mac) catalysed by [Rh(MonoPhos) (2) (nbd) ]SbF(6) (MonoPhos: 3, 5 -dioxa- 4 -phosphacyclohepta[2, 1 -a: 3, 4 -a']dinaphthalen- 4 -yl) dimethylamine) was elucidated by using (1) H, (31) P and (103) Rh NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS. The use of nbd allows one to obtain in pure form the rhodium complex that contains two units of the ligand. In contrast to the analogous complexes that contain cis, cis- 1, 5 -cyclooctadiene (cod), this complex shows well-resolved NMR spectroscopic signals. Hydrogenation of these catalyst precursors at 1 bar total pressure {{gave rise to the}} formation of a bimetallic complex of general formula [Rh(MonoPhos) (2) ](2) (SbF(6)) (2); no solvate complexes were detected. In the dimeric complex both rhodium atoms are ligated to two MonoPhos ligands but, in addition, each rhodium atom also binds to one of the binaphthyl rings of a ligand that is bound to the other rhodium metal. Upon addition of mac, a mixture of diastereomeric complexes [Rh(MonoPhos) (2) (mac) ]SbF(6) is formed in which the substrate is bound in a chelate fashion to the metal. Upon hydrogenation, these adducts are converted into a new complex [Rh(MonoPhos) (2) {mac(H) (2) }]SbF(6) in which the methyl phenylalaninate mac(H) (2) is bound through its aromatic ring to rhodium. Addition of mac to this complex leads to displacement of the product by the substrate. No hydride intermediates could be detected and no evidence was found for the involvement at any stage of the process of complexes with only one coordinated MonoPhos. The collected data suggest that the asymmetric hydrogenation follows a Halpern-like mechanism in which the less abundant substrate-catalyst adduct is preferentially hydrogenated to <b>phenylalanine</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ester...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new methodology for the synthesis of a chiral, non-racemic quaternary carbon bearing an α-nitrogen (an α-tertiary amine or ATA) {{continues to be an}} active area of modern research in current synthetic organic chemistry. As a privileged biological scaffold, ATAs are widespread amongst bioactive natural products, providing an inspiration in their complex architecture to synthetic chemists in drug discovery programmes. Three experimental endeavours comprise this project, which are presented as separate sections of Chapter 2. The first part focuses on new methodology for all-carbon quaternization based on an auxiliary-based diastereoselective alkylation of an auxiliary-malonate, in which an imidazolidinone auxiliary provided excellent facial selectivities in the alkylation in conjunction with KHMDS as the base. Five derivatives were generated in high yields (> 85 %) and selectivities (dr > 95 : 5). Extension of the methodology to generate ATAs using the auxiliary-malonate system forms the basis of the second section. This was achieved via a modified Curtius rearrangement protocol performed on quaternary carboxylic acids, in turn obtained from a chemoselective cleavage of a PMB ester malonate-auxiliary system. The ATA products were obtained in high yields and with retention of stereoselectivity, and following the non-destructive removal of the auxiliary by methanolysis, produced enantioenriched α,α-disubstituted alanine and <b>phenylalanine</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>esters.</b> Additional steps on other suitable derivatives furnished α-quaternary proline and lysine derivatives, all in high ees (96 – 98 %). The methodology offers a general approach to the production of enantioenriched ATAs, and in particular, access to both natural and unnatural α,α-disubstituted amino acids. Application to an attempted synthesis of lepadiformine is described in the final section, whereby the ATA of the alkaloid is constructed in an acyclic form employing the newly developed methodology. Reductive (non-destructive) removal of the auxiliary provided an amino alcohol derivative that was further elaborated via a sequence involving ring-closing metathesis, hydrogenation, hydroxyl group oxidation and Grignard addition to afford a functionalised A-ring of lepadiformine A, with key functionality in place for elaboration to the target. However, dehydration of the tertiary alcohol from the Grignard step, although successful in a related model study, led to problems, bringing the total synthesis endeavour to a close. In spite of this setback, the divergent nature of the approach allows for new designs in the synthetic plan, particularly regarding the order of which the functionalised A ring from this work is elaborated into the A/B/C target...|$|R

Nitro-L-arginine <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> (0. 3 - 3 mM) and L-Arg (0. 3 - 3 mM) released small amounts (40 %). Histamine release was quantified by radioimmunoassay since nitro-L-arginine <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> and L-Arg interfere with the fluorometric assay. The potentiation of paw oedema observed with higher doses of all arginine analogues is caused by in vivo mast cell degranulation and is probably due to the cationic charge of these substances...|$|R

40|$|In {{acute and}} {{subacute}} toxicological studies, amphotericin B <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> {{was shown to}} be much less toxic than the parent antibiotic. As a single intravenous dose in mice, the <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> was approximately 20 times less toxic than amphotericin B. Also, the acute toxicity of the <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> in mice was not enhanced {{by the presence of}} chemically induced hepatic or renal damage or by the concurrent administration of amphotericin B or flucytosine.

40|$|Leishmania amastigotes parasitize almost {{exclusively}} the mononuclear phagocytes of mammals. The organisms survive and multiply within acidified vacuoles (parasitophorous vacuoles; p. v.) akin to phagolysosomes. Certain amino acid esters {{are known to}} accumulate in and disrupt lysosomes. We postulated that, since Leishmania possess lysosome-like organelles, they may be susceptible to the potentially high ester concentrations attained in the p. v. We report here that L- amino acid esters can rapidly destroy intracellular Leishmania at concentrations that {{do not appear to}} damage the host cells. L-leu-OMe, which cured {{greater than or equal to}} 90 % of infected macrophages at 0. 8 mM concentrations, was used in most of the experiments. L-leu-OMe was only active after infection, implying inefficient transfer from secondary lysosomes to the p. v. Parasite destruction had several features in common with lysosomal and leukocyte damage induced by the esters, i. e., inactivity of D-amino acid esters, a marked pH dependence and increased killing after ester pulses at lower temperatures. Killing depended on the amino acid and on the ester substitution. The most active of the <b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> assayed was that of leucine, followed by those of tryptophan, glutamic acid, methionine, <b>phenylalanine,</b> and tyrosine. <b>Methyl</b> <b>esters</b> of seven other amino acids were inactive when tested at up to 10 mM concentrations. Among leucine esters studied, benzyl ester was sixfold more active than the methyl homolog. The dipeptide L-leu-leu-OMe produced 90 % cure at 0. 08 mM concentrations. Leishmanicidal activity could be related to penetration of the parasites by the esters or to toxic ester hydrolysis products released in the p. v. The first hypothesis is supported by the pH-dependent destruction of isolated amastigotes by the esters. Furthermore, relatively high concentrations of L-leucine, methanol, or benzyl alcohol were not demonstrably toxic to the amastigotes. We postulate that ester concentrations sufficient to damage the intracellular amastigotes may be obtained within the p. v. after exposure of infected macrophages to the esters. Esters preferentially hydrolyzed by parasite enzymes may be expected to be leishmanicidal, but less damaging to the host...|$|R
