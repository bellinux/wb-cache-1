5|$|Another {{arm of the}} {{conspiracy}} was directed at the Indian troops who were serving in Middle East, while efforts were directed at drawing Afghanistan into the war {{on the side of}} the Central Powers, which it was hoped would incite <b>a</b> <b>nationalist</b> or pan-Islamic uprising in India and destabilise the British recruiting grounds in Punjab and across India. After Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, her influence had declined, and it was Afghanistan that was at the time seen by Britain as the only power in the sub-continent capable of directly threatening India.|$|E

At al-Bakri's invitation, al-Kharrat joined the revolt in August 1925 {{and formed a}} group of fighters from al-Shaghour and other neighborhoods in the vicinity. He led the rebel assault against Damascus, briefly capturing the residence of French High-Commissioner Maurice Sarrail before withdrawing amid heavy French bombardment.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Bayan Muna Congressmen Neri Colmenares and Carlos Isagani Zarate filed House Bill 3431 {{aiming to}} declare Andres Bonifacio as National Hero {{due to his}} actual {{participation}} in the Philippine Revolution against Spain.

5|$|White ran unsuccessfully as <b>a</b> <b>Nationalist</b> for the House of Representatives seat of Maribyrnong in the 1925 elections. In 1927, {{he failed}} to win the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Prahran. Denied {{pre-selection}} as <b>a</b> <b>Nationalist</b> for the Senate the following year, he won the seat of Balaclava at a by-election held on 3August 1929. He succeeded retiring member William Watt. The United Australia Party (UAP) {{came to power in}} the 1931 elections and in March 1933 he was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs in the first Lyons Ministry, replacing Henry Gullett, who had stood down due to ill-health. White had given up the directorship of C.J. White & Sons the previous year. His portfolio was responsible for reducing tariffs and attempting to increase trade with Britain as opposed to the United States and Japan, and also with book and film censorship; for the latter he established an advisory board, chaired by Robert Garran, to make recommendations to him. In 1934, White became Australian chairman of the Royal Life Saving Society, serving until 1951; he was also an active supporter of such organisations as Legacy and the Royal Flying Doctor Service.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>nationalist</b> {{movement}} in the Belgian Congo demanding the end of colonial rule led to the country's independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many issues, such as the questions of federalism and ethnicity, remained unresolved. In {{the first week of}} July, a mutiny broke out in the army and violence erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites and two areas of the country, Katanga and South Kasai, seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest and violence, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers, but the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld refused to use these troops to help the central government in Léopoldville fight the secessionists. Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted by calling for assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisors and other support.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the French in the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Belgium came under Dutch rule. The Belgian Revolution, which broke out on 25 August 1830 after the {{performance}} of <b>a</b> <b>nationalist</b> opera in Brussels led to a minor insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, was inspired to some extent by the Brabant Revolution. The day after the revolution broke out, revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by the colours chosen by the Brabant Revolution of 1789. The colours (red, yellow and black) today form the national flag of Belgium. Some historians have also argued that the Vonckists and Statists were the forerunners of the major political factions, the Liberals and the Catholics, which would dominate Belgian politics after independence.|$|E
5|$|Even the Jäger {{battalion}} {{was divided}} {{in the same}} way that the rest of the country was: 450 mostly socialist Jägers remained stationed in Germany as they could have chosen the Red side in the conflict. The leaders of the White Guards faced a similar problem with drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish labor movement never showed up. It was also uncertain whether common troopers drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough motivation to fight the Finnish Reds; the White's propaganda promoted <b>a</b> <b>nationalist</b> war against the Red, Bolshevist Russians, and belittled the significance of the Red Finns.|$|E
5|$|German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg {{encouraged}} this activity. The {{effort was}} led by prominent archaeologist and historian Max von Oppenheim, who headed the new Intelligence Bureau for the East and formed the Berlin Committee, which was later renamed the Indian Independence Committee. The Berlin Committee offered money, arms, and military advisors according to plans made by the German Foreign Office and Indian revolutionaries-in-exile such {{as members of the}} Ghadar Party in North America. The planners hoped to trigger <b>a</b> <b>nationalist</b> rebellion using clandestine shipments of men and arms sent to India from elsewhere in Asia and from the United States.|$|E

5|$|In 1862, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich was {{appointed}} viceroy of Russian Poland {{by his brother}} and moved to Warsaw {{with his wife and}} children. The stay in Poland proved difficult for the Grand Duke, who was the victim of <b>a</b> <b>nationalist</b> assassination attempt the day after his arrival in the Polish capital. Although Constantine embarked on a program of liberalization and re-instated Polish as an official language, Polish nationalists agitating for reform were not appeased. Finally, an uprising in January 1863 and the radicalization of the separatists pushed the Tsar to recall his brother in August. Olga's difficult experiences in Poland marked her profoundly.|$|E
5|$|In July 1905 then Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, {{partitioned}} Bengal. This sparked {{an outburst}} of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and <b>a</b> <b>nationalist</b> campaign by groups of revolutionaries, who included Aurobindo. In 1908, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, {{the wife and}} daughter of barrister Pringle Kennedy. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in Alipore Jail. The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually he was acquitted on May 6, 1909. His defence counsel was Chittaranjan Das.|$|E
5|$|In early 1947 the French {{administration}} {{instituted a}} new rule that increased {{the weight of}} the French vote over the Malagasy vote in selection of candidates, and three PADESM candidates favored by French conservatives were successfully elected to the Conseil de la Republique. The results of the election and popular discontent with French interference served to intensify widespread frustration against the colonial authority and desire for Malagasy self-governance across the island. These factors finally erupted in <b>a</b> <b>nationalist</b> uprising that began on the evening of 29 March 1947 with attacks against a police camp and several French plantations in the eastern rainforest carried out by militant Malagasy nationalists, chief among them the members of the nationalist secret societies Vy Vato Sakelika (VVS) and Jiny.|$|E

5|$|Pećanac {{became the}} {{president}} of the Chetnik Association in 1932. By opening membership of the Chetnik Association to new younger members that had not served in World War I, he grew the organisation during the 1930s from <b>a</b> <b>nationalist</b> veterans' association focused on protecting veterans' rights to an aggressively partisan Serb political organisation with 500,000 members throughout the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During this period, Pećanac formed close ties with the far-right Yugoslav Radical Union government of Milan Stojadinović. Pećanac was known for his hostility to the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, which made him popular with conservatives, especially those in Stojadinović's party.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Revolution {{broke out}} on 25 August 1830, after the {{performance}} of <b>a</b> <b>nationalist</b> opera (La muette de Portici) in Brussels led to a minor insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, who sang patriotic songs and captured some public buildings in the city. This early revolutionary group was swelled by {{a large number of}} urban workers. The following day, the revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789. To maintain order, several bourgeois militia groups were formed. The situation in Brussels led to widespread unrest across the country. William I rejected his son's advice to negotiate with the rebels, forcing them towards a more radical, pro-independence stance, and sent a large military force to Brussels suppress the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|The FNLA formed {{parallel}} to the MPLA, and was initially devoted to defending {{the interests of the}} Bakongo people and supporting the restoration of the historical Kongo Empire. However, it rapidly developed into <b>a</b> <b>nationalist</b> movement, supported in its struggle against Portugal by the government of Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire. During the early 1960s, the FNLA was also supported by the People's Republic of China, but when UNITA was founded in the mid-1960s, China switched its support to this new movement, because the FNLA had shown little real activity. The United States refused to give the FNLA support during the movement's war against Portugal, which was a NATO ally of the U.S.; however, the FNLA did receive U.S. aid during the civil war.|$|E
