25|$|Mormarevi Brothers {{started their}} {{collaboration}} writing feuilletons for Starshel (Hornet) newspaper, a Bulgarian weekly paper of humour and satire. Their work method was {{to sit down}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> Yomtov's small kitchen and figure out subjects and characters while playing cards. Afterwards, they would alternate on the typewriter, but often Stoychev did more of this work.|$|E
25|$|Hitchcock appears {{briefly in}} most of his own films. For example, he is seen {{struggling}} to get a double bass onto a train (Strangers on a Train), walking dogs out of a pet shop (The Birds), fixing a neighbour's clock (Rear Window), as a shadow (Family Plot), sitting <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> a photograph (Dial M for Murder), and missing a bus (North by Northwest).|$|E
25|$|Mathieu {{began her}} career by {{participating}} in an annual singing contest in Avignon called On Chante dans mon Quartier (We sing in my neighborhood). Photos depict the affair as rather drab with a cheap curtain and one projector light. The stage was only twenty feet square, and the singer having to share that with a large piano and musicians. One cannot help but notice the large, boisterous, and mostly young audience. The judges sat <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> front of and below the elevated stage. Anyone who signed the contract {{in the weeks before}} the show was allowed to sing. Talent scouts made this a worthwhile event for singers within hundreds of kilometers to participate in.|$|E

500|$|<b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> {{a corner}} {{recently}} {{there were six}} elementary trainees: One was a Chinese quartermaster, another a half-Burmese. Two were Americans … One … an aircraft skipper down from New Guinea to get his wireless ticket; and the other chap a ship's officer with the same objective. In another corner there's an ANA commander preparing for his 20-word-a-minute exam: an English ship's wireless officer...an ex-RAF Wing-Commander...an Indian Navy man... groups of airline 'types' also on the job.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{international}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Scott Lyon and Sophie Muller and premiered in August 2004. The video features several sequences. It opens with Bedingfield sitting <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> her Spanish villa, in Málaga, frustrated by her inability to find inspiration to write a song, and she cuts the flowers off by the window. She is then seen walking through the villa in colorful outfits, and sitting by the swimming pool, surrounded by dancing chairs, dancing radios, dancing books in the library, and multiple versions of herself. The video concludes with Bedingfield scribbling in her notebook {{on the roof of}} her villa. Her scribblings lead her boyfriend to the front of her home where she admits that she loves him and she goes to the balcony, asking him if her feelings are [...] "okay".|$|E

2500|$|Levitin had a cameo {{appearance}} in The Big Bang Theory {{at the invitation}} of the producers, in Season 8, Episode 5, [...] "The Focus Attenuation," [...] during the opening scene, sitting <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the Caltech cafeteria over Sheldon's right shoulder.|$|E
2500|$|The Sopranos' Season 2 finale [...] "Funhouse", {{originally}} {{aired in}} April 2000, includes several discrete dream sequences dreamed by Tony {{that take place}} on the Asbury Park Boardwalk, including Madame Marie's as well as Tony and Pauly playing cards <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the empty hall of the Convention Center. The episode's title alludes to the Palace, which is also shown.|$|E
2500|$|A {{student at}} Rank's [...] "Charm School", Lee {{and many of}} the others had {{difficulty}} finding work. He finally made his film début in Terence Young's Gothic romance Corridor of Mirrors (1947). He played Charles; the director got around his height by placing him <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> a nightclub alongside Lois Maxwell, Mavis Villiers, Hugh Latimer and John Penrose. Lee had a single line, [...] "a satirical shaft meant to qualify the lead's bravura".|$|E
50|$|The President is <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> of <b>in</b> Parisian cafe {{waiting for}} his young lover, Florence. When she arrives she announces that {{she is going to}} marry Jerome, a young man she has just met.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a pretty}} room adorned with a fine picture of the chase; <b>at</b> <b>a</b> round <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the centre sat two ladies {{interested}} in the meal to which Rigby had alluded.|$|R
60|$|The two {{men were}} seated {{opposite}} one another <b>at</b> <b>a</b> long <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> huge popular restaurant {{in the heart of}} the city. It was Kendricks' plan--Kendricks, in fact, had insisted upon it.|$|R
2500|$|Over {{the same}} period these same painters, later {{followed}} by Rubens, produced many depictions of Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus ("Without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus freezes", meaning that love needs food and wine to thrive), a proverb derived from the emblem books, which showed just Ceres, Bacchus, Venus and Cupid picnicking {{on the ground in}} most early versions, or seated <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> some later ones. [...] It has been suggested that the concentration of images by the Haarlem Mannerists reflects the patronage of the powerful brewers of Haarlem.|$|E
2500|$|Bull and Peel, {{by early}} 1867, had moved their {{operations}} on to Belmont, Nevada, {{and then to}} Salt Lake City, Utah. While in Salt Lake City, the two argued, {{and for a time}} separated. [...] However, by the summer of 1867 the two were working together again, by this time in Helena, Montana. On the night of July 22, 1867, Peel and Bull were seated <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the [...] "Greer Brothers Exchange Saloon", and for some reason the argument they had previously had was rekindled. Both men jumped to their feet and became arguing loudly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} sketches feature two men {{inside the}} brothel; a sailor and {{a medical student}} (who was often depicted holding either a book or a skull, causing Barr and others to read the painting as a memento mori, a reminder of death). A trace of their presence <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the center remains: the jutting edge of a table {{near the bottom of}} the canvas. The viewer, Steinberg argues, has come to replace the sitting men, forced to confront the gaze of prostitutes head on, invoking readings far more complex than a simple allegory or the autobiographical reading that attempts to understand the work in relation to Picasso's own history with women. A world of meanings then becomes possible, suggesting the work as a meditation on the danger of sex, the [...] "trauma of the gaze" [...] (to use a phrase of Rosalind Krauss's invention), and the threat of violence inherent in the scene and sexual relations at large.|$|E

2500|$|At {{a casino}} {{blackjack}} table, the dealer faces {{five to seven}} playing positions from behind a semicircular table. Between one and eight standard 52-card decks are shuffled together. At {{the beginning of each}} round, up to three players can place their bets in the [...] "betting box" [...] at each position in play. That is, there could be up to three players at each position <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> jurisdictions that allow back betting. The player whose bet is {{at the front of the}} betting box is deemed to have control over the position, and the dealer will consult the controlling player for playing decisions regarding the hand; the other players of that box are said to [...] "play behind". Any player is usually allowed to control or bet in as many boxes as desired at a single table, but it is prohibited for an individual to play on more than one table at a time or to place multiple bets within a single box. In many U.S. casinos, however, players are limited to playing two or three positions at a table and often only one person is allowed to bet on each position.|$|E

60|$|After {{this little}} {{discourse}} the good woman took her station <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> {{the garden to}} pour out the coffee.|$|E
60|$|They drank coffee <b>at</b> <b>a</b> little <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> huge building, {{hung with}} tobacco smoke, with the {{inevitable}} band at one end, and crowded with people. Kendricks smiled as the waiter brought them sugared cakes with their coffee.|$|R
30|$|In the {{original}} version one item is formulated “Can sit comfortably <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> or <b>at</b> movies”. We revealed minor difficulties for the children below age 11  years to fully interpret the term. This part was initially adjusted already during the translation and back-translation process and the Swedish version was “Can sit comfortably <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> or <b>in</b> <b>an</b> easy chair {{but not on the}} floor”. Still, children below age 11  years had some problem to interpret this alternative properly, especially the word “comfortably”. Therefore, we further adjusted the final version and changed the first alternative to “Can sit without any problem on the floor” and the second alternative to “Can sit without any problem <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> or <b>in</b> <b>an</b> easy chair but not on the floor”.|$|R
50|$|This Steven Seagal thriller sees Wong Dai (Chooi Kheng Beh), an {{influential}} Chinese drug kingpin, sitting <b>at</b> <b>a</b> long <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> old building in Paris, France, {{going through the}} motions of a gigantic merger between himself and several other major Chinese drug dealers.|$|R

60|$|They {{sat down}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> small <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the {{embrasure}} of the window, and their hostess placed before them a boiled fowl, {{a dish of}} eggs, a stew of herbs, and a flask of red wine, all of which La Boulaye had bidden her prepare.|$|R
