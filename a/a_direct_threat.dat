5|$|Late on July5, the Government of Jamaica {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} {{watch for the}} nation as Dennis intensified over the eastern Caribbean. This was upgraded to a hurricane warning early on July6. The warning remained in place for 48hours as the hurricane brushed the island, being discontinued on July8 as Dennis moved over northern Cuba and no longer posed <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in {{its fourth}} year. The {{previous}} year {{had been one of}} success for France and her allies, most particularly on the Danube, where Marshal Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had created <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to Vienna, the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of Versailles and Madrid, Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the Grand Alliance.|$|E
5|$|By that time, the Byzantines had {{captured}} Arsamosata and additional strategically important {{locations in the}} mountains of southwest Armenia, posing <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to the Muslim emirates around Lake Van. To reverse the situation, in 940Sayf al-Dawla initiated a remarkable campaign: starting from Mayyafiriqin (Byzantine Martyropolis), he crossed the Bitlis pass into Armenia, where he seized several fortresses and accepted the submission of the local lords, both Muslim and Christian. He ravaged the Byzantine holdings around Theodosiopolis and raided as far as Koloneia, which he besieged until Kourkouas arrived with a relief army and forced him to withdraw. Sayf al-Dawla was not able to follow up on this effort: until 945, the Hamdanids were preoccupied with internal developments in the Caliphate and with fighting against their rivals in southern Iraq and the Ikhshidids in Syria.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days prior}} to Fabian {{striking}} Bermuda, computer models forecast a ridge of high pressure forcing the hurricane {{to the west of}} the island by 200miles (320km). Not expected to be <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>threat,</b> a meteorologist at the Bermuda Weather Service expected gusty winds and potentially heavy rainfall. Each successive advisory brought the hurricane steadily closer to Bermuda, and 35hours before Fabian made its closest approach, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the island. When a track near Bermuda became more certain, a hurricane warning was issued for the island, approximately 29hours before Fabian made a direct hit on the island.|$|E

When unharmed, it can live for up to 40 years in the wild and 58 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|At around 1600UTC on August26, the National Hurricane Center issued {{hurricane}} watches for Dominica, Martinique, St. Martin, Anguilla, Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Six hours later, {{the watch}} was upgraded to a hurricane warning for Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Local meteorological agencies {{on the islands}} also declared small craft advisories. The local government in Montserrat mobilized the 100 member police force and 50 off-duty volunteer army members. Supermarkets, hardware stores, banks, and pharmacies were specially opened for residents to purchase plywood, canned food, bottled water, and other hurricane kit items. Around 1300UTC on August27, the hurricane watch for Dominica and Martinique was discontinued as Gustav no longer posed <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to the islands. Three hours later, all watches and warnings were discontinued except for Antigua and Barbuda where a tropical storm warning and St. Martin where a tropical storm watch were in place. By 1900UTC, once Hurricane Gustav turned towards the north away from the Lesser Antilles, all watches and warnings were discontinued.|$|E

5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and a feudal system of obligation {{has been seen}} as creating the highland clan system. The head of a clan was usually the eldest son of the last chief of the most powerful sept or branch. The leading families of a clan formed the fine, often seen as equivalent to lowland lairds, providing council in peace and leadership in war, and below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. In the isles and along the adjacent western seaboard there were also buannachann, who acted as a military elite, defending the clan lands from raids or taking part in attacks on clan enemies. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and sometimes acted as soldiers. In the early modern period they usually took the clan name as their surname, turning it into a massive, if often fictive, kin group. Because the Highland Clans were not <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to the Restoration government, or relations with England, the same effort was not put into suppressing their independence as had been focused on the Borders, until after the Glorious Revolution. Economic change and the imposition of royal justice had begun to undermine the clan system before the eighteenth century, but the process was accelerated after the rebellion of 1745, with Highland dress banned, the enforced disarming of clansmen, the compulsory purchase of heritable jurisdictions, the exile of many chiefs and sending of ordinary clansmen to the colonies as indentured labour. All of this largely reducing clan leaders to the status of simple landholders within a generation.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture {{throughout}} the reserve poses <b>a</b> more <b>direct</b> <b>threat.</b> <b>As</b> the populations expand within the reserve, so do their agricultural operations. Much of the wetland area is unsuitable for agriculture, needing levees and continued development to be productive. Much of the non-legal de facto ownership has spurred conflict, sometimes violent, among different cultural groups over rights to agriculturally productive areas.|$|R

50|$|In retaliation, the Pomeranians {{directed}} {{military actions}} against Zbigniew, who {{at that point}} allied with Bohemia and wanted in this way to pressure Bolesław III into stopping his fight with Pomerania. The junior prince, in counterweight, decided to make an alliance with Hungary and Kievan Rus', sealed with his marriage with Zbyslava, daughter of Grand Prince Sviatopolk II of Kiev in 1103. Zbigniew declined to attend the wedding, seeing in this union <b>a</b> <b>directed</b> <b>threat</b> against him. Thanks to bribery, Zbigniew urged Borivoj II of Bohemia to invaded Bolesław III's lands. Bolesław III, reacted by ravaging and looting the Pomeranian border regions and Moravia; after this, and after the a huge payment, Borivoj II ended his alliance with Zbigniew. The incursions in 1103 -unsuccessful battle for Kołobrzeg) and during 1104-1105 effectively destroyed Zbigniew's peaceful relationship with Pomerania.|$|R

25|$|The {{rulers of}} Karasahr grew uneasy as the Chinese {{expanded}} into Central Asia. After {{the conquest of}} the city of Turfan, center of the kingdom of Gaochang, the Chinese army stationed nearby was seen as <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>threat.</b> This is a little ironic, because Gaochang's military aggression against Karasahr (a response to Karasahr's developing a trade route to China that bypassed Gaochang) had earlier served as one of the pretexts for the Tang campaign against Gaochang.|$|E
