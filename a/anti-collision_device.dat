50|$|Augusto Bissiri is {{credited}} {{as one of}} the first developers of television and the cathode ray tube.In 1900 he developed an <b>anti-collision</b> <b>device</b> applied on railways, used for the first time by Luigi Merello for the Tranvie del Campidano (Tramways of Campidano) on a steam train which linked Cagliari to Quartu Sant'Elena, in Sardinia. His patent was later acquired by the Westinghouse Electric Company.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of this <b>anti-collision</b> <b>device</b> has been refined to not only prevent midsection collisions but also to prevent their occurrences in station yards. The newly engineered solution is integrated with the signalling systems, interlocking to react appropriately in case collision-like conditions are perceived {{at the time of}} reception and dispatch of trains from a station (e.g. while approaching a station). Loco ACDs also give 'Station Approach' alerts to train operators and regulate train speed when they receives information from Station ACDs.|$|E
50|$|The Red Martians of Barsoom have fliers {{operating}} with {{a form of}} anti-gravity. Thuvia, Maid of Mars is notable in that John Carter's son, Cathoris, invents an apparent precursor of the autopilot (decades before an actual device was created). The mechanism allowed the pilot to reach any destination on Barsoom, although it required the pilot to keep the craft pointed in the right direction. Upon arrival, the mechanism also lowered the flier to the ground. Carthoris' flier was also equipped with an <b>anti-collision</b> <b>device,</b> which detected obstacles and automatically steered around them.|$|E

The definition and composition of vehicle collision avoidance system CCAS (Car Collision Avoidance System) {{is an important part}} of an intelligent vehicle that has <b>anti-collision</b> radar <b>device</b> to prevent vehicle collision. It based on the advanced computer digital system analysis and operation, and can think itself. When danger occurs, such as the front of the vehicle, pedestrian and vehicle obstacle, it can send alarm information to remind the driver to brake on time, and reduced speed in order to avoid collisions. The intelligent vehicle system consists of at least three components： (1) Signal acquisition component.

By simplifying the rubber cushion dual-box pier ship <b>anti-collision</b> <b>device</b> as elliptic physical model and by simplifying the elliptic rubber cylindrical air cushion as linear elastic spring element, this paper can build the relationships between torque equation, elliptic structure parameters and equivalent elastic coefficient under different loading force. When outer steel ring takes a small displacement translation, the reverse force is only related to parallel direction of displacement and has a linear relationship with displacement. Making an analysis on elastic response of translational-rotational device, it can be approximated as a pure rotation curve under certain conditions. And the equivalent elasticity coefficient is only related to translational-rotational joint effect. The results will help the flexible dual-box ship <b>anti-collision</b> <b>device</b> to apply...|$|E
