These nests {{may be found in}} the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> threats.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, then-Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers {{told the}} Dutch Parliament that {{his office was}} running a secret {{organisation}} {{that had been set}} up inside the Dutch defence ministry in the 1950s, but denied it was supervised directly by NATO or other foreign bodies. He went to inform that successive prime ministers and defence chiefs had always preferred not to inform other Cabinet members or Parliament about the secret organization. It was modeled on the nation's World War II experiences of having to evacuate the royal family and transfer government to a government-in-exile, originally aiming to provide an underground intelligence network to a government-in-exile {{in the event of a}} foreign invasion, although it included elements of guerilla warfare. Former Dutch Defence Minister Henk Vredeling confirmed the group had set up arms caches around the Netherlands for sabotage purposes.

500|$|The St. John Fortress (...) , {{often called}} Mulo Tower, {{is a complex}} monumental {{building}} on the southeastern side {{of the old city}} port, controlling and protecting its entrance.

Always cautious <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> danger, the inhabitants of Dubrovnik used to close the entry into the port with heavy chains stretched between the St. John Fortress and the Kase jetty, and they also used to wall up all the port entries to the Great Arsenal.|$|E

500|$|Despite lacking {{support from}} Cornwallis' main army, Tarleton's cavalry struck {{immediately}} upon {{arriving at the}} scene, charging into the militia's makeshift camp. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the British approach, the Patriots attempted to organize a defense under the ad-hoc command of Captain Nathaniel M. Martin, who tried to rally the militia to a line behind a nearby rail fence. [...] There is also evidence that Col. Thomas Farmer and some 300 militia were stationed at the tavern as a secondary defensive line. Tarleton claimed to have led the charge by reminding his cavalrymen to [...] "remember the Cowpens". The British won in a quick and convincing fashion, dispersing the outnumbered militia units before they managed to complete their rally. Martin was captured {{in the first few}} moments of the battle, thereafter leaving the Patriots without any effective tactical command. With Patriot forces under the effects of such confusion, Tarleton divided his dragoons into smaller parties, ordering them to chase and further disburse the militia from the area.|$|E
500|$|Later in the trial, Lieutenant Carleton MorehouseCommander of Division Eight at Port Chicagotook {{the stand}} {{to say that}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> {{problems}} on August 9, he assembled his men and read their names off alphabetically, ordering each man to work. Ninety-six of 104 refused and {{were sent to the}} prison barge, but all of these men agreed to work after hearing Admiral Wright's speech on August 11; none of Morehouse's men were on trial for mutiny. Morehouse confirmed to Veltmann that some of his men had said they were afraid to handle ammunition. Following Morehouse, Lieutenant James E. Tobin, Commander of Division Two, took the stand. Lieutenant Tobin (no relation to Commander Joseph R. Tobin) related that 87 of his men initially refused to work but that number was reduced to 22 after Admiral Wright talked about the firing squad. Tobin said he put three additional men in the brig the next morning when they, too, refused to work, saying they were afraid. Tobin affirmed that one of the accused men from Division Two was permanently assigned the job of cook because he weighed [...] and was considered too small to safely load ammo.|$|E

500|$|The 24th Infantry {{first came}} into heavy contact with North Korean People's Army troops on 22 July {{during the battle of}} Sangju. North Korean rifle fire came in on the {{dispersed}} regiment, and its troops almost immediately began retreating from the front, ignoring officers' commands to stay in position. Historians blame the retreat as much on officers' ineptitude as on the panicking of individual soldiers. The tendency to panic continued in nearly all the 24th Infantry operations west of Sangju. Men left their positions and straggled to the rear, abandoning weapons. On many occasions, units lost most of their equipment while on the move, even when not under fire, causing logistical shortages. In other cases, the majority of a unit deserted its position <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> North Korean fire. The situation became so dire that the regiment's senior officers set up a checkpoint west of the town and stopped every vehicle coming from the west, removing stragglers attempting to retreat. Many jeeps were filled with six or seven men claiming they were retreating after their position was overrun. The 24th quickly gained a poor reputation as a [...] "bug out" [...] unit, blasted for its poor performance during combat. Historians contend its accomplishments, particularly at the Battle of Yechon, were ignored, while shortcomings were seized upon to depict the 24th as a sub-par unit, and African-Americans as inferior soldiers to whites.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the verdict}} of a {{successful}} D-Day for the 3rd CID, the failure of Canadian units to reach their final objectives has proven more disputed than {{the reasons for their}} success. Terry Copp places the blame on Keller, who committed the entirety of the 9th Brigade reserve to land on the narrower beaches of the 8th Brigade—which was itself still fighting to clear the seaside towns—after receiving reports of poor progress by the 7th Brigade. Dutch historian Dan Van der Vat notes that [...] "the planned breakout of the 9th Brigade was held up by a huge jam of vehicles". Wilmot also places the blame with logistical difficulties of the landing, saying that [...] "on the whole it was not so much the opposition in front as the congestion behind—on the beaches and in Bernières—that prevented the Canadians from reaching their final D-Day objective". Stacey offers a different view, suggesting that it was not impossible for the 3rd CID to reach its D-Day objectives, and that the failure to do so rests in the fact that [...] "British and Canadian forces were usually better at deceiving the enemy and achieving initial success in an assault than they were at exploiting surprise and success once achieved. Perhaps they were rather too easily satisfied". Copp disagrees with Stacey's assessment, suggesting that such caution was not the result of poor planning but of the fact that [...] "the British and Canadians fought the way they had been trained, moving forward to designated objectives in controlled bounds and digging in <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> a counterattack". He also disputes whether the capture of the final objectives would have been strategically intelligent, observing that [...] "if 9th Brigade had reached Carpiquet and dug in, with artillery in position to offer support, the commander of the 26th Panzer Grenadiers might have followed orders and waited until a coordinated counterattack with other divisions had been organized. Such an attack might well have done far more damage to the Allied beachhead than the hastily improvised operation actually carried out [...] ".|$|E
