Several metals are naturally present as metal sulfides; these include copper, lead, molybdenum, cadmium, nickel, silver, cobalt, and zinc.

40|$|International audienceSix {{materials}} (stainless steel, nickel-base alloy, titanium, chromium, {{nickel and}} admiralty brass) are tested in chemical and biochemical synthetic seawaters. The biochemical seawater contains enzymes catalyzing oxidation of glucose (glucose oxidase), simulating {{the action of}} natural biofilms. The evolutions of free corrosion potential (Ecor) versus time, and of cathodic and <b>anodic</b> <b>reactions</b> are compared with those obtained in natural seawater. Then, electrochemical behavior is related to semi-conducting properties of passive films. When glucose oxidase is present, increase of Ecor versus time is only reported for materials presenting a n-type semi-conductor passive film, and whose cathodic reaction current is increased. On the contrary, when passive layers are p-type semi-conductors, cathodic and <b>anodic</b> <b>reactions</b> are increased, and lead to a global Ecor constant with time of immersion. It appears that interaction between bacteria, medium and materials includes evolution of semi-conducting properties of passive layers...|$|R

30|$|Liquid-phase inhibitors can {{be further}} divided into three subtypes that are anodic, {{cathodic}} and mixed inhibitors. Anodic inhibitors are those inhibitors that prevent corrosion by forming a protective layer of oxide film on the metal surface. They are also known as passivators, and these inhibitors alter the <b>anodic</b> <b>reactions</b> in the cell [61]. The process of controlling corrosion either by decreasing the reduction rate or by precipitating selective areas of cathodic region (cathodic preceptors) are termed as cathodic inhibitors. In simple words, we can also describe cathodic inhibitors as the chemical compounds that can decrease the corrosion rate of a metal or an alloy, when added to a certain liquid or gas [58, 59, 60, 61, 62]. The compounds which are neither anodic nor cathodic, i.e. compounds which show the characteristics of both anodic and cathodic inhibitors are termed as mixed inhibitors. On an average 80 % organic compounds are mixed inhibitors. They protect metal {{by the process of}} physical adsorption, chemisorption and film formation. They also reduce the cathodic and <b>anodic</b> <b>reactions</b> to work [58, 59].|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the <b>anodic</b> <b>reactions</b> of phenols was made using the {{techniques}} of voltammetry, coulometry, and controlled potential electrolysis. It was shown that two entirely different <b>anodic</b> <b>reactions</b> are possible with phenolic compounds. The first is an electrophilic attack on the aromatic nucleus of the nonionized phenol with the irreversible removal of two electrons to give a mesomeric phenoxonium ion. As {{an example of this}} process an electrolysis of 2, 6 -di-tert-butyl-p-cresol in acetonitri le at a platinum anode resulted in the addition of methanol to form 2, 6 -di- tert-butyl- 4 -methyl- 4 -methoxy-cyclo-hexadienone in 65 % yield. The second possible electrode reaction is the re-versible removal of one electron from the phenoxide anion to give a phenoxy free radical. This process was i l lustrated by the electrolysis of the vanil l inate anion in acetonitri le at a plat inum anode to give dehydrodivanil l in i 65 % yield. It was found that hal f-wave potentials for both electrode reactions could be correlated by Hammett- type quations. Brief voltammetric experiment...|$|R
40|$|The overall process {{enhancement}} {{by different}} electrical current application on the biological phosphorus release and uptake have been investigated.

In Exp. 1 by comparing the control and the bio-electrochemical reactors, {{it was found that}} the overall phosphorus removal efficiency could be enhanced at lower electrical current applications of 5. mA and 10. mA, but were restrained at higher than 20. mA, although 20. mA could be a sensitive turning point. Moreover, the electrochemical effects of the cathodic and the <b>anodic</b> <b>reactions</b> on the phosphorus release and uptake, respectively, have been further evaluated separately under an electrical current application of 10. mA in Exp. 2 and Exp. 3, respectively. As observed, both of the biological release and uptake were improved by the cathodic reactions in the cathode reactor, but not by the <b>anodic</b> <b>reactions</b> in the anode reactor, and thus indicated that the cathodic reactions play an important role in the improvement of the biological phosphorus release and uptake. © 2012 Elsevier B.

Weight los s experiments showed {{that the effect of}} cation is a strong function of its nature and concentration and the effect became significant only above a critical concentration. Of the cations studied, $Cu^{ 2 +}$ ions were found to be the most aggressive corrosion activators followed by $Al^{ 3 +}$ ions while $Li^+$ ions showed little effect. Polarisation experiments inferred that $Cu^{ 2 +}$ ions influence the corrosion process mainly by accelerating the cathodic reaction. While a decrease in both cathodic and <b>anodic</b> <b>reactions</b> was evident in the presence of $Al^{ 3 +}$ ions at higher concentration, $Li^+$ ions showed no remarkable affect either on cathodic or <b>anodic</b> <b>reactions.</b> Critical analyses of results of the two experiments indicated that the corrosion activation by $Al^{ 3 +}$ ions is due to their chemical reactivity with the corroding substrate.
