5|$|During {{his time}} in Norway, Reich {{attempted}} to ground his orgasm theory in biology, exploring whether Freud's metaphor of the libido was in fact electricity or a chemical substance, an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned. Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do not. He {{wanted to know what}} <b>additional</b> <b>element</b> had to be present for pleasure to be felt.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the Forgotten Realms setting is the {{continent}} of Faer√ªn, part of the fictional world of Abeir-Toril, usually called simply Toril, an Earth-like planet with many real-world influences. Unlike Earth, the lands of the Forgotten Realms are not all ruled by the human race: the planet Toril is shared by humans, dwarves, elves, goblins, orcs, and other peoples and creatures. Technologically, {{the world of the}} Forgotten Realms is not nearly as advanced as that of Earth; in this respect, it resembles the pre-industrial Earth of the 13th or 14th century. However, the presence of magic provides an <b>additional</b> <b>element</b> of power to the societies. There are several nation states and many independent cities, with loose alliances being formed for defense or conquest. Trade is performed by ship or horse-drawn vehicle, and manufacturing is based upon cottage industry.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(2) of the Act {{creates an}} offence which {{includes}} {{all the elements}} of the section 1(1) offence with an <b>additional</b> <b>element</b> of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant. In R v. Steer (1986), the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. This approach was extended in R v. Webster (1995), in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored. That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that a defendant may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this will cause the driver to swerve into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, in the {{quantification}} of damages generally {{and/or the}} partitioning of damages between {{two or more}} defendants, {{the extent of the}} liability to compensate the plaintiff(s) will be determined by what was reasonably foreseeable. So if, for example, the plaintiff unexpectedly contributed to the extent of the loss suffered, that <b>additional</b> <b>element</b> would not be included in the damages award even though the plaintiff would not {{have had the opportunity to}} make this mistake had it not been for the defendant's breach. In cases involving the partitioning of damages between multiple defendants, each will be liable to the extent that their contribution foreseeably produced the loss.|$|E
25|$|Racial {{segregation}} {{is another}} environmental factor that occurs through the discriminatory action of those organizations and working individuals within {{the real estate}} industry, whether in the housing markets or rentals. Even though residential segregation is noted in all minority groups, blacks tend to be segregated regardless of income level when compared to Latinos and Asians. Thus, segregation results in minorities clustering in poor neighborhoods that have limited employment, medical care, and educational resources, which is associated with high rates of criminal behavior. In addition, segregation affects the health of individual residents because the environment is not conducive to physical exercise due to unsafe neighborhoods that lack recreational facilities and have nonexistent park space. Racial and ethnic discrimination adds an <b>additional</b> <b>element</b> to the environment that individuals have to interact with daily. Individuals that reported discrimination {{have been shown to}} have an increase risk of hypertension in addition to other physiological stress related affects. The high magnitude of environmental, structural, socioeconomic stressors leads to further compromise on the psychological and physical being, which leads to poor health and disease.|$|E

In [...] "Old Friends", the title generally conveys the introduction or ending of sections through repetition, and the song builds upon a [...] "rather loose formal structure" [...] that at first includes an acoustic guitar and soft mood. An <b>additional</b> <b>element</b> is introduced midway through the track: an orchestral arrangement conducted by Jimmie Haskell, dominated by strings and xylophone notes. Horns and other instruments are added when the duo cease singing, creating a turbulence that builds to a single high, sustained note on the strings.

500|$|In {{some cases}} it is {{possible}} to continue using a topological network diagram even when components needing a distributed element analysis are present. [...] In the electrical domain, a transmission line, a basic distributed element component, can be included in the model with the introduction of the <b>additional</b> <b>element</b> of electrical length. [...] The transmission line is a special case because it is invariant along its length and hence the full geometry need not be modelled. [...] Another way of dealing with distributed elements is to use a finite element analysis whereaby the distributed element is approximated by a large number of small lumped elements. [...] Just such an approach was used in one paper to model the cochlea of the human ear. [...] Another condition required of electrical systems for the application of the lumped element model is that no significant fields exist outside the component since these can couple to other unrelated components. [...] However, these effects can often be modelled by introducing some virtual lumped elements called strays or parasitics. [...] An analog of this in mechanical systems is vibration in one component being coupled to an unrelated component.|$|E

2500|$|To {{further reduce}} the cost and {{complexity}} of radio equipment, two separate structures (triode and pentode for instance) could be combined in the bulb of a single multisection tube.

As the Loewe set had only one tube socket, {{it was able to}} substantially undercut the competition since, in Germany, state tax was levied by the number of sockets. However, reliability was compromised, and production costs for the tube were much greater. In a sense, these were akin to integrated circuits.
