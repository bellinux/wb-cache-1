5|$|Poliovirus {{enters the}} body through the mouth, infecting the first cells {{with which it}} comes in contact — the pharynx and {{intestinal}} mucosa. It gains entry by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or CD155, on the cell membrane. The virus then hijacks the host cell's own machinery, and begins to replicate. Poliovirus divides within gastrointestinal cells for about a week, from where it spreads to the tonsils (specifically the follicular dendritic cells residing within the tonsilar germinal centers), the intestinal lymphoid tissue including the M cells of Peyer's patches, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes, where it multiplies abundantly. The virus is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|Rogers {{learned from}} {{questioning}} the prisoners that a French and Indian war party {{had just arrived}} at Carillon, and that the two forts were garrisoned by a thousand regulars. Concerned that the escaped sleds would raise the alarm, Rogers immediately ordered a return to their last camp. His council disapproved of the return by the same route (a violation of Rogers' own ranging guidelines), but he overruled them, citing the need for speed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> snow. By early afternoon they had returned to their camp, rested, and {{were on their way}} south.|$|E

In the same episode John Evans plays the role of Winston Churchill. She also was a character in Underworld, a 2005 novel by Don DeLillo.

5|$|Simonds {{knew that}} {{infantry}} assaults supported by massed artillery {{had failed to}} overcome the German forward lines in Operation Atlantic and Operation Spring. During Operation Goodwood, a bombardment by aircraft of RAF Bomber Command had assisted British tanks {{to break through the}} German front but they had then suffered many casualties from intact German defences arrayed in depth beyond the bombing. Infantry had been unable to follow up quickly enough to support the leading tanks or to secure ground behind them (so that follow-up units were also slowed). To solve the tactical problem presented by the terrain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> defences, Simonds proposed a radical solution, the first large attack by mechanized infantry.|$|E

She served as an executive producer and starred as the divorced single mother architect Melanie Parker in the romantic comedy One Fine Day (1996) opposite George Clooney, Subsequent performances included Rose Cook Lewis in the film adaptation of Jane Smiley's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel A Thousand Acres (1997) with Jessica Lange and Jennifer Jason Leigh; Beth Cappadora in The Deep End of the Ocean (1998) about a married couple who found their son who was kidnapped nine years ago; Titania the Queen of the Fairies in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999) with Kevin Kline, Rupert Everett and Stanley Tucci; and Katie Jordan in Rob Reiner's comedy-drama The Story of Us (1999) opposite Bruce Willis.|$|E

5|$|Since first {{making contact}} with the {{advancing}} German and Turkish force on 20 July they had been harassed alternately by the Australian 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades. During the night of 3–4 August, {{the day before the}} battle commenced, both brigades were involved in fighting. By about midday on 4 August, the Turkish and German force had pushed the two Australian brigades back to a point where the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, in their trenches, were able to attack the Turkish right flank, and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and British 5th Mounted Brigade arrived from their deployment protecting the Suez Canal, to extend the Australians' line on the left flank. The Turkish and German advance was stopped by the fire brought to bear on them by the combined British infantry and Australian, British and New Zealand mounted forces <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> sand, the midday summer heat, and thirst.|$|E
5|$|The {{veins of}} the brain, both the {{superficial}} veins <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> venous system, empty into the dural venous sinuses, which carry blood {{back to the}} jugular vein and thence to the heart. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, blood clots usually form both in the veins {{of the brain and}} the venous sinuses. The thrombosis of the veins themselves causes venous infarction—damage to brain tissue due to a congested and therefore insufficient blood supply. This results in cerebral edema (both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema), and leads to small petechial haemorrhages that may merge into large haematomas. Thrombosis of the sinuses is the main mechanism behind the increase in intracranial pressure due to decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The condition does not lead to hydrocephalus, however, because there is no difference in pressure between various parts of the brain.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the town are the ruins of Ravenscraig Castle on a rocky spit of land {{extending}} into the Firth of Forth. King James II began construction of the castle in 1460 for his queen, Mary of Gueldres. It was also a means of defending {{the upper reaches of the}} Forth, including the port of Dysart. To a lesser extent it protected the harbour of Kirkcaldy against piracy and English rivalry. Ravenscraig is one of the earliest British castles designed to defend against and use artillery, an innovation demonstrated by the massive walls, the regularly placed shot holes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> rock-cut ditch. Following the death of the King at the siege of Roxburgh Castle (1460), work continued on Ravenscraig, and it became a home for Mary of Gueldres until her death in 1463. In 1470 King James III granted the castle and lands to William Sinclair, Earl of Orkney and Caithness, in exchange for the castle in Kirkwall and the right to the Earldom of Orkney.|$|E

5|$|Two sculptures made by Dan Corson were {{installed}} at the station's underground level: Portals consists of a wall of portals with images from the Hubble Space Telescope, microscopes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> sea at the elevator lobby; Space Forms {{is a series of}} brightly-colored, translucent sculptures suspended above the platforms that resemble microscopic creatures floating under a microscope. An additional installation, Bill Bell's Light Sticks, is embedded in the walls of the Beacon Hill Tunnel. A series of LED displays, typically showing images of playing cards, flash for 1/30th of a second through the train windows. The art is considered by Sound Transit an extension of Bell's installation at the University Street station that similarly depends on persistence of vision to project subliminal images.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to her barrier city, Aki joins Sid and appears before the leadership council along with General Hein (James Woods), who is determined to use the powerful Zeus space cannon to destroy the Phantoms. Aki is concerned the cannon will damage Earth's Gaia (a spirit representing its ecosystem) and delays the use of it by revealing {{that she has been}} infected and the collected spirit signatures are keeping her infection stable, convincing the council that there may be another way to defeat the Phantoms. However, this revelation leads Hein to incorrectly conclude that she is being controlled by the Phantoms. Aki <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> Eyes squad succeed in finding the seventh spirit as Aki's infection begins to worsen and she slips into unconsciousness. Her dream reveals to her that the Phantoms are the spirits of dead aliens brought to Earth on a fragment of their destroyed planet. Sid uses the seventh spirit to bring Aki's infection back under control, reviving her.|$|E
