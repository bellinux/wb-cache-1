50|$|Improvements to the {{security}} of tenure available to occupants of agricultural tied cottages were made by the Agriculture Act 1970. It amended Section 33 of the Rent Act 1965 to ensure that, subject to conditions, the tenant of a tied cottage, or his widow, would automatically get at least six months’ security of tenure alter the employment ended.

40|$|This paper uses {{representative}} farm account {{data for}} 1985 - 2007 to estimate stochastic production frontiers {{in the form}} of input distance functions for Danish crop, dairy and pig farms. The objective is to study and compare scale economies for the three farm types. The estimated technical efficiency is relatively constant over time for all three farm types, but the elasticity of scale differs. Although the size of all farm types has increased considerably during the last 20 years, more than 95 % of the crop farms and 85 % of the dairy and pig farms are still below the estimated technical optimal scale of production. The results support the hypothesis that the restrictions concerning the <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> and the purchase of farm land have seriously prevented Danish farmers, and especially cash crop farmers, from taking full advantage of scale economies.

50|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, {{extensive}} agricultural reforms took place, involving {{the abolition of}} the old open-field system and the <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> many smaller <b>farms</b> into larger ones.

These reforms were possible because agricultural prices steadily rose {{in the second half of}} the century.|$|R
30|$|This {{region is}} {{specifically}} interesting for our purpose as the <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> small <b>farms</b> during socialist years (Behrens 2005) and the land-use {{change of the}} last 50  years resulted in large-scale changes creating large field units (20 – 75  ha; Katzschner 2011). These fields dominate the scenery and cover about 66 % of the study area. Remnant forest patches (13 %), grasslands (10 %), water bodies (6 %), and built-up areas (5 %) represent a minor feature of the landscape. During summer, ambient temperature averages 17.4 [*]±[*] 0.9  °C in Brandenburg (mean[*]±[*]STD calculated {{based on data from}} 1981 to 2010 of the DWD 2016) with a precipitation of 567.1 ± 81.8 mm per year (mean[*]±[*]STD calculated based on data from 1881 to 2016 of the DWD 2017).|$|R
40|$|The {{wildlife}} {{industry in}} South Africa is thriving, with {{increasing numbers of}} game farms. Large parts of the South African countryside are enclosed with fences. Fences have always been strategically important in wildlife production and conservation, both to protect wildlife, but also to keep local people out. The high - often electrified - fences allow game farmers to claim ownership of wildlife. Farm dwellers - farm labourers and (former) tenants who consider the farms as their home - are relocated to recreate the idea of 'pristine wilderness'. These relocations negatively affect their ability to claim land on the farms through the component of the South African land reform programme aimed at securing farm dwellers' security of tenure. Contrary to claims by wildlife industry proponents, employment opportunities on game farms - especially on hunting farms - decrease, also due to the <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> to create viable wildlife areas. As a result, large numbers of farm dwellers end up being pushed {{beyond the boundaries of}} the fences into townships and informal settlements. The fences hence serve to claim wildlife and land. The paper will discuss the ways in which fences are used to keep certain groups of people out - especially those 'preying on land' through land reform - and to claim and commercially exploit wildlife. The fences keep predators in, but also hide how the status of these precious animals changes during the course of their lifetime and the different ways in which they are commodified...|$|E
40|$|This {{chapter is}} from the {{forthcoming}} Oxford Handbook of Food, Politics, and Society edited by Ronald Herring. Livestock {{is an integral part}} of agriculture and a prominent source of food. It contributes 40 % of the global value of agricultural output and supports the livelihoods and food security of almost a billion people, especially in developing countries. There is nothing new in <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> animals in agriculture system, but the debate questioning its existence and relevance is a rather new drift. The politics, the climate debate, the nutrition debate around livestock sector, especially levitating from industrial countries, needs to be sympathetic toward the millions of people, especially in developing countries, that continue to remain dependent on livestock as an important, or often the only, source of livelihood. This chapter looks at the diverse livestock agriculture systems in industrial and less developed countries and it’s policy implications. It re-examines the prevailing debates such as, the heat and meat debate, the zoonotic disease discussions, the debate on ethics around animal-source food and the debate of over- and undernutrition. The authors take a balanced view on the pros and cons of livestock sector, considering the global debates, but at the same time, looking at livestock sector’s socioeconomic and nutrition value for the poor. Take a global view, debate, campaign but don’t forget to also look at the sector from livelihood and food-security angle. The underline message of the chapter is to call for a bounteous outlook, evidence-based debate and equable policies...|$|R
50|$|The {{oldest of}} the 3 primary schools in the area is Ingle Farm East Primary School (Halidon Street), which opened in 1970 and in 2007 had 289 {{students}} enrolled. North Ingle Primary (Rothwell Avenue) opened in 1973. Since its opening the enrolments steadily grew until it hit a peak of approximately 500 students in the late 70's and early 80's but currently is now only about 150. Ingle Farm Primary School (Belalie Road) was established in 1992 after the <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> Ingle <b>Farm</b> Central Primary, Ingle Heights Primary and the old Ingle Farm Primary School.

5000|$|Eastbourne {{was formed}} by the Victorian-era <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> four <b>farming</b> hamlets. The {{principal}} village was Bourne (later known as Old Town), location of St Mary the Virgin's parish church {{and a collection of}} houses and other buildings dating from the medieval era to the 18th century. South Bourne consisted of buildings strung out along a route which led southeastwards to the English Channel from Bourne; the present South Street roughly follows its alignment. Sea Houses (a name first encountered in the 14th century) was further to the east, where the old houses of Marine Parade (many of them listed) now stand; and Meads was further west on higher ground. By 1780, when King George III's children stayed in Sea Houses, the area was developing into a modest but select resort at which the contemporary fashion for sea-bathing could be indulged. [...] As well as St Mary the Virgin's Church, the Lamb Inn, Bourne's old manor house and several cottages, some former agricultural buildings and farmhouses—mostly now converted for other uses—survive from the pre-resort era. Flint, cobblestones and red brick are the characteristic building materials of these simple Vernacular structures. Examples include Pillory Barn, Upperton Farmhouse, and the farmhouse, barn and dovecote <b>of</b> Motcombe <b>Farm.</b> A large group of similar buildings of the 18th and 19th centuries are found in Willingdon, a Downland village which {{has become part of the}} Eastbourne conurbation and whose southern section is part of the borough. Several flint-built cottages surround the village post office and stretch down Wish Hill. Nearby, Chalk Farm and its barn have been converted into a hotel and restaurant.|$|R

5000|$|In 1959 the Communist Party {{borrowed}} from the Chinese Great Leap Forward to symbolize a sudden burst of economic activity to be injected into the Third Five-Year Plan (1958-1962), whose original scope was quite conservative. According to the revised plan, industrial production would double and agricultural production would triple by 1962; a new agricultural collectivization and consolidation drive would achieve great economies of scale in that branch; investment in light industry would double, and foreign trade would expand. Following the Chinese model, all of Bulgarian society was to be propagandized and mobilized to meet the planning goals. Two purposes of the grandiose revised plan were to keep Bulgaria {{in step with the}} Soviet bloc, all of whose members were embarking on plans for accelerated growth, and to quell internal party conflicts. <b>Amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> collective <b>farms</b> cut their number by 70 percent, after which average farm acreage was second only to the Soviet Union among countries in Eastern Europe. Zhivkov, whose [...] "theses" [...] had defined the goals of the plan, purged Politburo members and party rivals Boris Taskov (in 1959) and Anton Yugov (in 1962), citing their criticism of his policy as economically obstructionist. Already by 1960, however, Zhivkov had been forced to redefine the impossible goals of his theses. Lack of skilled labor and materials made completion of projects at the prescribed pace impossible. Harvests were disastrously poor in the early 1960s; peasant unrest forced the government to raise food prices; and the urban dissatisfaction that resulted from higher prices compounded a crisis that broke in the summer of 1962. Blame fell on Zhivkov's experiments with decentralized planning, which was totally abandoned by 1963. Despite this, by 1960 the value produced by heavy industry matched that of light industry, and food processing for export grew rapidly. Throughout the second phase, budget expenditures consisted primarily of reinvestment in sectors given initial priority. The completion of collectivization in 1958 had shifted 678,000 peasants, about 20 percent of the active labor force, into industrial jobs.|$|R
