Otherwise, it will generally feed on molluscs, arthropods, frogs, seeds, berries, palm fruits, {{and the occasional}} water snake. Maize, rice, <b>and</b> <b>bananas</b> are also viable food items for the grey-necked wood rail. It is also known to feed on the feces of giant otters at latrines.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that the storm damaged at least 16,000homes and about 250square kilometers (60thousand acres) of land used for cattle. In addition over 420square kilometers (103 thousand acres) of various crops, including sugarcane, corn <b>and</b> <b>bananas,</b> were flooded.

40|$|A {{framework}} for plantain <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> innovation system in Nigeria, where learning and capacity development {{will be fully}} realised was presented to replace the existing framework which was modelled along the now moribund top-down approach which T and V system of extension methods set out to correct. Actors in plantain <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> innovation system were classified into 5 groups based on their actions (research, technology transfer, government agencies, farmers and marketers) Data were collected in eleven Nigeria states from a total of 95 respondents, on capacity development, resource capabilities, learning and learning alliances among stakeholders in the innovation system. The result revealed IITA, NIHORT and NSPRI as the major technology generating agencies in plantain <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> innovation system In Nigeria. Above average linkage index was recorded from 7 of the 18 stakeholders IITA (57. 6 %), university (69. 2 %), ADP (65. 6 %), plantain <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> cooperative (53. 9 %), plantain <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> farmers (77. 6 %), plantain <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> marketers (70. 1) <b>and</b> plantain <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> consumers (55. 8 %). The study concluded that a {{framework for}} plantain <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> innovation system should be that with multi-dimensional interactions among stakeholders with the end users at the centre of all actions, which will allow a demand-supply pool that will make technology so generated needed and utilised for greater social and economic benefits in plantain <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> innovation system in Nigeria...|$|R

5|$|There {{are various}} climatic areas in Israel and areas it has settled that allow {{a variety of}} {{products}} to be grown. Citrus trees such as orange, lemon and grapefruit thrive on the coastal plain. Figs, pomegranates and olives also grow in the cooler hill areas. The subtropical climate near the Sea of Galilee and in the Jordan River Valley is suitable for mangoes, kiwis <b>and</b> <b>bananas,</b> while the temperate climate of the mountains of the Galilee and the Golan is suitable for grapes, apples and cherries.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Deir al-Balah had a {{population}} of 2,560, all Arabs, with 14,735 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 327 dunams were for citrus <b>and</b> <b>bananas,</b> 472 plantations and irrigable land, 14,438 used for cereals, while 39 dunams were built-up land. In the lead-up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, residents of Deir al-Balah participated in a local attack against the nearby kibbutz of Kfar Darom, despite being discouraged by Egyptian Army officers, but they were repelled and suffered casualties. During the war, Egypt captured the town along with other towns {{in an area that}} became known as the Gaza Strip. The Egyptians later established a sharia court system that held jurisdiction over personal affairs. Egyptian rule introduced relative prosperity to Deir al-Balah. The town witnessed a booming citrus industry made possible by the discovery of a substantial reservoir of ground water in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reports from}} Nukuʻalofa on December31 {{indicated}} severe agricultural damage but few infrastructural losses. Following {{the passage of}} Waka, communication with Niuas and Vava'u were lost. According to local reports, high winds sandblasted Neiafu and downed nearly every tree. Surveys by the Red Cross revealed that roughly 200 homes in the city were severely damaged or destroyed and those left standing lost their roofs. Vava'u lost roughly 90% of its crops, including essential food crops such as taro, yams <b>and</b> <b>bananas.</b> In Ha'apai, one person died from cardiac arrest {{brought on by the}} storm. Fallen trees blocked numerous roads; power and water supplies were also interrupted to most residents. Severe damage also took place on Niuatoputapu where coastal homes were impacted by Waka's storm surge and several structures lost their roofs. In one instance, a yacht was brought onshore by the surge and crashed into a restaurant, destroying both.|$|E
30|$|The colours of {{the wines}} {{in the present}} study were {{observed}} to be pale yellow (pawpaw and watermelon wine), straw yellow (pawpaw <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> wine), dark brown (pawpaw, <b>banana</b> <b>and</b> watermelon wine) <b>and</b> cream (<b>banana</b> <b>and</b> watermelon wine). This is an indication that the combination of the fruits served as a good substrate for wine production with pawpaw <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> being the most efficient as shown in this study. The good aroma obtained in the wines could be attributed to high alcohol content in accordance with the report of Clement-Jimenez et al. (2005).|$|R
