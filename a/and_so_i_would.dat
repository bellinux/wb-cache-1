500|$|Johnson opposes {{federal and}} state gun control {{legislation}}, saying: [...] "I'm {{a firm believer in}} the Second Amendment <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have signed legislation banning assault weapons or automatic weapons." [...] Johnson says that the Second Amendment [...] "was designed to protect us against a government that could be very intrusive. And in this country, we have a growing police state - if people can own assault rifles or automatic rifles, I think leads to a more civil government." [...] Johnson would, however, limit weapons such as rocket launchers. Johnson believes that allowing concealed carrying of guns reduces crime and gun violence. He opposes barring gun sales to individuals on the no-fly list, because he claims that such lists have a high error rate. Johnson has called for a [...] "thousand-person taskforce" [...] or [...] "hot line" [...] to prevent terrorists from obtaining guns, and has questioned why the perpetrator of the Orlando nightclub shooting was not [...] "deprived of his guns" [...] after being interviewed three times.|$|E

But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide my purse from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if I could do it with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E

All Ireland had shouted after him, and worshipped as a liberator, a saviour, the greatest Irish patriot and citizen. Dean Drapier Bickerstaff Gulliver—the most famous statesmen, and the greatest poets of his day, had applauded him, and done him homage; and at this time writing over to Bolingbroke, from Ireland, he says, “It is {{time for me to}} have done with the world, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> if I could get into a better before I was called into the best, and not to die here in a rage, like a poisoned rat in a hole.” ...|$|E
