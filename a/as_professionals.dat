5|$|There is {{difficulty}} in labeling the trobairitz as either amateurs or professionals. The distinction {{between these two}} roles was complicated in the medieval era, since professionals were generally lower class, and amateurs had as much time <b>as</b> <b>professionals</b> to devote to their craft. Joglaresse were lower class, professional composers far less respected than the trobairitz.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2005, Cotto {{faced the}} last man to beat him as an amateur, former Olympic gold {{medalist}} Mohamed Abdulaev from Uzbekistan. As amateurs, Abdulaev eliminated Cotto from {{the first round of}} the 2000 Sydney Olympics. This time they met <b>as</b> <b>professionals</b> in New York City's Madison Square Garden. Before the beginning of the fight Cotto received a positive ovation from the public. During the first round Miguel went on the offensive scoring hits on Abdullaev's head and body while he was in a defensive stance. In the fourth round a left hook by Miguel hurt Abdullaev, who proceeded to focus his hits on Cotto's body. Abdullaev's offense was effective in the sixth and seventh rounds and as a result of this Cotto assumed a defensive stance. Following the eighth round Abdullaev's eye was swollen to the point of being almost entirely closed. In the ninth round following accurate punches by Cotto the fight's referee paused the fight and asked the ringside doctor to examine Abdullaev's eye. After being examined by the doctor Abdullaev indicated to the referee that he could not continue, this way Cotto retained the Welterweight division championship.|$|E
