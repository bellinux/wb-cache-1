40|$|A new {{nematode}} species Dichelyne (Cucullanellus) sciaenidicola sp. nov. {{is described}} based on specimens {{collected from the}} Whitemouth croaker Micropogonias furnieri (Desmarest) and the <b>Argentine</b> <b>croaker</b> Umbrina canosai Berg, from coastal waters of Argentina and Brazil. These nematodes were firstly identified as D. (C.) elongatus (Törnquist, 1931), a commonly reported species from M. furnieri in South American Atlantic waters. However, other species of Dichelyne have so far been reported from this host in the same area, namely D. (C.) rodriguesi (Pinto, Fábio et Noronha, 1970), D. (C.) amaruincai (Freitas, Vicente e...|$|E
40|$|<b>Argentine</b> <b>croaker</b> (Umbrina canosai) {{and chicken}} (Gallus domesticus) bones were hydrolyzed with {{different}} proteases (Flavourzyme, "-Chymotrypsin and Trypsin) {{in order to}} obtain peptides whit antioxidant activity. The hydrolysates showed different degrees of hydrolysis and antioxidant activity. The antioxidant power of the hydrolysates was evaluated through inhibition of the peroxidation of linoleic acid, hydroxyl radical scavenging, DPPH free radical scavenging, ABTS free radical scavenging and reducing power. The hydrolysates of the fish (FF) and chicken (CF) bones produced with Flavourzyme had high activity of lipid peroxidation inhibition (77. 3 and 61. 6 %, respectively) and moderate DPPH free radical scavenging, ABTS scavenging and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. The fraction < 3000 Da was the main constituent of the six hydrolysates followed by the fraction < 1000 Da. The {{results of this study suggest}} that protein hydrolysates of fish and chicken bones are good sources of natural antioxidants. FF showed better performance e can be used as antioxidant substance...|$|E
