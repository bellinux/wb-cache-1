5|$|In March 1975 Massino {{was arrested}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> {{the arrest of}} one of his hijackers, Raymond Wean, and charged with {{conspiracy}} to receive stolen goods. He was scheduled to go on trial in 1977, but the charges were dropped after he successfully argued that he had not been properly mirandized, disqualifying statements Massino gave to police from being used in trial.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the shooting, Scully {{reasons that}} at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, {{it would have been}} {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E

5|$|Hunt {{sustained}} a foot {{injury in the}} Broncos Round 15 match and was sidelined for eight weeks. While out injured, {{early in the morning}} on 30 July 2006, Hunt was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> a fight outside a Brisbane night club in Brisbane's CBD. The media, notably Channel 7 and Channel 10, alleged Hunt was the instigator of the incident, claiming he squirted water on a woman. The Broncos denied he had any involvement in the incident although a woman gave his name to police. Hunt also denied involvement, insisting he was merely a bystander.|$|E
5|$|Many {{accounts}} {{claim that}} Cascioferro personally killed Petrosino. Legend {{has it that}} Cascioferro excused himself from a dinner party among the high society {{at the home of}} his political patron De Michele Ferrantelli, took a carriage (that of his host according to some), and drove to Piazza Marina in Palermo's city centre. He and Petrosino engaged in a brief conversation, then Cascioferro killed Petrosino and returned to join the dinner again. Historical reconstructions have dismissed this version and cannot locate Cascioferro <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the crime.|$|E
5|$|The dagger {{taken from}} Beauchamp at his arrest {{did not match}} the wound on Sharp's body. (In his Confession, Beauchamp claimed to have buried the murder weapon by {{the bank of the}} river near where the murder took place. That knife was never found). Beauchamp's shoe did not match a track found outside Sharp's house the morning of the murder. The posse lost a {{handkerchief}} found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the crime and believed to belong to the murderer. (Beauchamp later claimed to have stolen and burned it after the posse had gone to sleep one night).|$|E

5|$|When a Catholic {{priest is}} burnt {{at the stake}} in Lander, Wyoming, private investigative {{organisation}} the Millennium Group despatch offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Ardis Cohen (Lindsay Crouse) who had previously worked together on a case involving the murders of three clerics several years earlier. Black sees similarities between the murders and the methods of torture employed by the medieval Inquisition. This is confirmed when a Protestant minister is drowned in imitation of another ritual torture. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the drowning, two wedding rings are found—a man's in the stomach of the victim and woman's nearby.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp {{rode with}} a sheriff's posse and tracked the Bisbee stage robbers. Virgil had been {{appointed}} Tombstone's town marshal (i.e., chief of police) on June 6, 1881, after Ben Sippy abandoned the job. However, Virgil {{at the same time}} continued to hold his position of deputy U.S. marshal, and it was in this federal capacity that he continued to chase robbers of stage coaches outside Tombstone city limits. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the holdup, Wyatt discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel. The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee known to provide widened boot heels and were able to link the boot print to Stilwell.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> Marks' game, Detective Allison Kerry finds {{a message}} for her former partner, Eric Matthews, and calls him in. Despite {{not wanting to be}} {{involved}} with the case, already dealing with a divorce and estrangement from his son Daniel, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks' trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; arsonist Obi Tate, his only known survivor Amanda Young, business man Gus Colyard, gangster Jonas Singer, Laura Hunter, drug dealer Xavier Chavez, prostitute Addison Corday, and Daniel. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that following his own game, simply sitting and chatting with John, will see his son Daniel returned to him unharmed. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.|$|E

5|$|Chaos;Head follows Takumi Nishijou, a {{high school}} student living in a cargo crate atop a {{building}} in Shibuya, Tokyo. One day, he is sent pictures over the internet, depicting a murder in an alley; he later witnesses a murder resembling the one in the pictures, and believes the killer to be a pink-haired girl he sees at the crime scene. Because of his presence <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the crime, he is suspected of being the murderer, and starts suffering from paranoia and experiencing delusions. More murders – referred to as the New Generation serial murders – occur, while Takumi meets a number of girls who have an interest in him, but who he suspects of being linked to the murders. One of them is the pink-haired girl, named Rimi, who claims to be friends with him despite him not having any previous memory of her.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E

After ascertaining Tim’s password, Veronica {{finds out}} that Tim is also {{investigating}} the Dean’s suicide {{and that he was}} browsing a site named “Neptune Women’s Clinic”. Veronica visits the ministry of Bonnie’s father, Ted (Chris Ellis) as well as the clinic, although neither really help in the case. She also questions Anthony, one of the witnesses of the Dean’s death (he heard the gunshot). Returning home, Veronica is greeted by Keith, who has received a letter with images of Veronica exiting the clinic. For revenge, they visit the publisher of the photos, but it doesn’t go well. Nevertheless, she does see a picture of one of Dick’s paramours, although she was not as intimate with him as Veronica thought. In the middle of the night, Mindy O’Dell (Jaime Ray Newman) contact Keith, telling him to hurry. It turns out that Steve Botando (Richard Grieco) was trying to break in, and while he is there, Keith {{finds out that}} Cyrus was planning on sending the O’Dell son to a disciplinary school and that Mindy was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> Dean O’Dell’s death.|$|E

5|$|In {{remembrance of}} the victims there have been erected {{numerous}} memorial sites, funded by private initiatives and public bodies on the orders of the Berlin boroughs, the Berlin House of Representatives or the federal government, which are placed over various places in Berlin. The oldest {{date back to the}} days when the Wall was still standing. They include monuments, crucifixes and memorial stones, and were visited by foreign politicians during state visits. Together with the border installations, there were also some memorial sites that were removed when the Wall fell. Sites for fallen border guards were especially affected by this. Until the tenth anniversary of the building of the Wall, for every victim the private Berliner Bürger-Verein ("Berlin Citizen Association") placed a white wooden cross <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the event. They were aided in their effort by the senate of West-Berlin. On 13 August 1971, the memorial site Weiße Keuze ("White Crosses") was inaugurated {{on the east side of}} the Reichstag building.|$|E

Truman and Cooper arrive {{to speak with}} Packard, who had employed Palmer as an English tutor. Packard admits to sensing that Palmer was troubled but cannot help further; Cooper picks up {{on the fact that}} Truman has been having a relationship with Packard. Catherine calls Packard to tell her that the latter's sawmill lost $87,000 the day before; Catherine is having an affair with Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), with whom she is conspiring a hostile takeover of the mill. That same day, Hayward visits Palmer's mother Sarah (Grace Zabriskie), attempting to console her. However, Sarah has a vision of a sinister man (Frank Silva) crouching {{in the corner of the}} room, and panics. Meanwhile, Laurence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), Laura's psychiatrist, listens to an audio tape she had made for him, and sobs as he toys with half of a golden heart necklace, the other half of which was found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the crime.|$|E

After Max saves the sisters, and is {{involved in a}} further fight with Quicksilver (Johnny Trí Nguyễn), he is contacted by the leader of the criminals, Aya (Marie Matiko), who is also Eiko's lesbian lover. The Black Dragons explain that the jade dragon is actually an urn containing the ashes of their former leader, Yoshida, and that they believe it holds mystical value and will stop at nothing to get it back. Max and the sisters agree to return the dragon at noon the following day in return for their own personal safety. They are helped by locals, including beach vendor Debbie (Carmen Electra) and Moko, with whom Max reconciled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> Tahsi's killing. Nevertheless, Jane is torn between returning the figurine and protecting their lives, and ensuring that her sister finishes her M.D. The deal falls through as Jane's cell phone battery dies, and she does not arrive at the meet in time. Max escapes the angry henchmen on a jet ski.|$|E

5|$|Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes {{that travel}} {{throughout}} the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly {{as a result of}} bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and: (i) produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and cytokines, while they can also (ii) act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.|$|E

When {{the body of the}} original Brown is discovered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the SPC crash, it dawns on White that the President {{is in the hands of}} an impostor, and that the person whom he believed to be Scarlet is not human. Ignoring instructions to return to Cloudbase, with his Spectrum Jet under fire from the Angel fighter squadron, the Scarlet duplicate ejects himself and the President over southern England; on the ground, both the duplicate and the President, the latter being held hostage, set off towards London in a stolen car.|$|E

In the street, he almost bumps into an inconspicuous man (Stuart Charno), who heads to a gypsy palm reader named Madame Zelma (Karin Konoval). After seeking his fortune, the inconspicuous man attacks and kills her. A few days later, the eyes and entrails of a tea leaf reader, {{who was also a}} doll collector, have been found in her apartment, her body being missing. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> that murder to help the local cops, who have recruited the help of a psychic, the eccentric Stupendous Yappi (Jaap Broeker).
