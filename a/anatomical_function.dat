40|$|Abstract Background Several {{biomedical}} ontologies {{cover the}} domain of biological functions, including molecular and cellular functions. However, there is currently no publicly available ontology of <b>anatomical</b> <b>functions.</b> Consequently, no explicit relation between anatomical structures and their functions is expressed in the anatomy ontologies that are available for various species. Such an explicit relation between anatomical structures and their functions would be useful both for defining the classes of the anatomy and the phenotype ontologies accurately. Results We provide an ontological analysis of functions and functional abnormalities. From this analysis, we derive an approach to the automatic extraction of <b>anatomical</b> <b>functions</b> from existing ontologies which uses a combination of natural language processing, graph-based analysis of the ontologies and formal inferences. Additionally, we introduce a new relation to link material objects to processes that realize the function of these objects. This relation is introduced to avoid a needless duplication of processes already covered by the Gene Ontology in a new ontology of <b>anatomical</b> <b>functions.</b> Conclusions Ontological considerations {{on the nature of}} functional abnormalities and their representation in current phenotype ontologies show that we can extract a skeleton for an ontology of <b>anatomical</b> <b>functions</b> by using a combination of process, phenotype and anatomy ontologies automatically. We identify several limitations of the current ontologies that still need to be addressed to ensure a consistent and complete representation of <b>anatomical</b> <b>functions</b> and their abnormalities.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a novel algorithm for segmenting the high resolution CT {{images of the}} left ventricle (LV), particularly the papillary muscles and the trabeculae.

These fine structures, however, are extremely challenging to capture due to their delicate and complex nature in both geometry and topology. Our algorithm computes the potential missing topological structures of a given initial segmentation. Using techniques from computational topology, e. g. persistent homology, our algorithm find topological handles which are likely to be the true signal. To further increase accuracy, these proposals are measured by the saliency and confidence from a trained classifier. Handles with high scores are restored in the final segmentation, leading to high quality segmentation results of the complex structures. ...|$|E

Fracture stabilisation by pinning with K-wire is an easy and less traumatic procedure, which helps to prevent dislodgement of the fracture thereby minimising complications. The aim of study is to evaluate functional and anatomical results of the Colles fractures treated by two methods a) closed reduction and percutaneous Kirschner wire (K-wire) fixation and plaster cast, b) closed reduction and immobilisation with short-arm plaster cast for 6 weeks.

40|$|International audienceMultiple {{models of}} anatomy have been {{developed}} independently and for different purposes. In particular, 3 D graphical models are specially useful for visualizing the different organs composing the human body, while ontologies such as FMA (Foundational Model of Anatomy) are symbolic models that provide a unified formal description of anatomy. Despite its comprehensive content concerning the anatomical structures, the lack of formal descriptions of <b>anatomical</b> <b>functions</b> in FMA limits its usage in many applications. In addition, the absence of connection between 3 D models and anatomical ontologies makes it difficult and time-consuming {{to set up and}} access to the anatomical content of complex 3 D objects. First, we provide a new ontology of anatomy called My Corporis Fabrica (MyCF), which is conform to FMA but extends it by making explicit how anatomical structures are composed, how they participate to functions, and also how they can be related to 3 D complex objects. Second, we have equipped MyCF with automatic reasoning capabilities that enable model checking and complex queries answering. We illustrate the added-value of such a declarative approach for interactive simulation and visualization as well as for teaching applications. The novel vision of ontologies that we have developed in this paper enables a declarative assembly of different models to obtain composed models guaranteed to be anatomically valid while capturing the complexity of human anatomy. The main interest of this approach is its declarativity that makes possible for domain experts to enrich the knowledge base at any moment through simple editors without having to change the algorithmic machinery. This provides MyCF software environment a flexibility to process and add semantics on purpose for various applications that incorporate not only symbolic information but also 3 D geometric models representing anatomical entities as well as other symbolic information like the <b>anatomical</b> <b>functions...</b>|$|R

International audienceThe extremely specialised <b>anatomical</b> <b>function</b> of citrate inside the prostate, make it one of the preferred biomarkers for early stage detection of prostate cancer. However, current detection methods are seriously limited due to the very low citrate concentrations that need to be measured in order to follow disease progression. In the present work, we report a novel citrate-selective μ-sensor based on iron (III) phthalocyanine chloride-C-monoamido-Poly-n-Butyl Acrylate (Fe(III) MAPcCl-P-n-BA) modified gold μ-electrodes for the electrochemical determination and estimation of the pathophysiological range of citrate. The newly synthesised ionophore has been structurally characterised using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV–vis spectroscopy. Contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been used to investigate the adhesion and morphological properties of the membrane. The developed citrate-selective μ-electrodes had a Nernstian sensitivity of − 19. 34 ± 0. 83 mV/decade with a detection limit of about 9 × 10 − 6 M and a linear range from 4 × 10 − 5 M to 10 − 1 M, which covered the pathologically important clinical range. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed very high sensitivity with a lower Limit of detection ≈ 1. 7 × 10 − 9 M and linear detection range (10 − 8 – 10 − 1 M), which is very important not only for the early-stage diagnosis and screening procedures, but also in mapping the stage of the cancer too.

The first portion of this thesis is dedicated to investigating whether a supervised, corrective pre-habilitation programme of the kinetic chain, conducted twice a week for 10 weeks, would reduce these predisposing factors. A group of 19 marathon paddlers were assessed {{before and after the}} intervention, with nine of them receiving the intervention. The 10 -week intervention programme was found to significantly improve scapular position and kinesis, thoracic spine extension and single arm pulling ability, thus suggesting improved shoulder function and reduced risk of injury. The second portion of the thesis involved novel biomechanical analysis of kayaking on the water and on a kayaking-ergometer. It is the first objective description of the three dimensional movements of the kayak in the literature. Sprint and marathon paddlers performed a 180 metre time trial using an instrumented paddle with an accelerometer and gyroscope attached to the boat for analysis of boat movement characteristics and paddler-generated forces. Similar patterns for paddle torque, boat acceleration and pitch were observed between male sprint paddlers and male marathon paddlers. However, the direction and timing of the roll and the yaw of the boat during the water phase of the kayak stroke differed between these groups of paddlers. In addition, substantial individual variation existed within the group of male marathon paddlers. On the kayaking ergometer, activation patterns of the trunk and pelvic muscles were measured using electromyography during a maximal 200 metre time trial. Gluteus medius, lower trapezius and erector spinae were measured {{for the first time in}} maximal kayaking. The latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major and external oblique muscles were more active during the contralateral phase than has previously been reported. When these paddlers performed a single arm pull test on the same day, the muscle activation patterns changed, and muscle groups were active according to their <b>anatomical</b> <b>function</b> and what has previously been described. First, variation of movement, flexibility and segmental training of the kinetic chain may be advantageous when incorporated with kayaking training to prevent shoulder injury risk factors in paddlers. Second, individual evaluation of three-dimensional boat kinematics and muscle recruitment timing provides objective insight into an individual's kayak technique, with potential benefits for improving technical performance and mechanical efficiency...|$|E

To clarify the underlying mechanisms of motor control using muscle synergies, it is important to examine the spatiotemporal contribution of muscle synergies in the task space. In this study, we quantified the mechanical contribution of muscle synergies as considering spatiotemporal correlation between the activation of muscle synergies and endpoint force fluctuations. Subjects performed isometric force generation in the 3 -dimensional force space. The muscle-weighting vectors of muscle synergies and their activation traces across different trials were extracted from EMG data using decomposing technique. We then estimated mechanical contribution of muscle synergies across each trial based on cross-correlation analysis. The contributing vectors were averaged for all trials and the averaging was defined as action direction (AD) of muscle synergies. As a result, we extracted approximately 5 muscle synergies.

Dynamic DNA methylation across the developing embryo guides a program of repression, switching off genes in most cell types. Thus, {{the majority of the}} tissue specific differentially methylated sites (TS-DMS) must be un-methylated CpGs. Methodology and Principal Findings: Comparison of expanded Methyl Sensitive Cut Counting data (eMSCC) among four tissues (liver, testes, brain and kidney) from three C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, identified 138, 052 differentially methylated sites of which 23, 270 contain CpGs un-methylated in only one tissue (TS-DMS). Most of these CpGs were located in intergenic regions, outside of promoters, CpG islands or their shores, and up to 20 % of them overlapped reported active enhancers. Indeed, tissue-specific enhancers were up to 30 fold enriched in TS-DMS. Testis showed the highest number of TS-DMS, but paradoxically their associated genes {{do not appear to be}} specific to the germ cell functions, but rather are involved in organism development. In the other tissues the differentially methylated genes are associated with tissue-specific physiological or <b>anatomical</b> <b>functions.</b> The identified sets of TS-DMS quantify epigenetic distances between tissues, generated during development.

We considered several morphometric variables (31 linear, 1 volumetric and 1 surface area measurements). In addition, we identified, measured and compared two nonmorphometric variables, namely, the bone densities of selected areas obtained using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) device. The high correlation coefficient of all variables indicated continuous growth {{with the onset}} of age. The ranking of the hierarchical cluster analysis identified the presence of three main groups containing individuals of similar sizes: lactating pups and yearlings; subadult individuals and adult females; and adult males. Smaller groups were identified within these clusters, and their respective allocations into two subgroups were argued on the basis of skull development and other factors. The discriminant analysis of the three main groups indicated a discriminant diagnostic key, based on condilobasilar length (CBlr-L); maximum mandibular branch height (MB-H); and surface area of the bulla tympanica. The proposed diagnostic key is useful to classify monk seal skulls of unidentified age and sex. The data reported here suggest that in this species certain adult skull growth features (enhanced tympanic bullae surface area extension, occipital bone density) are sexually dimorphic and possibly related to specific <b>anatomical</b> <b>functions.</b> These functions may include an enhanced auditory capacity; an increased development of the cranial musculature capable of supporting a large skull and guaranteeing the mandibular strength necessary for mastication; and male to male social interactions...|$|R
