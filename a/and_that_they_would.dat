5|$|The {{courage and}} obstinacy {{with which the}} Americans fought were the astonishment of everyone, and we now became fully {{convinced}} {{that they are not}} that contemptible enemy we had hitherto imagined them, incapable of standing a regular engagement <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> only fight behind strong and powerful works.|$|E

5|$|A made-for-television movie, Farewell to Manzanar, {{directed}} by John Korty, aired on March 11, 1976, on NBC. It {{was based on}} the 1973 memoir of the same name, written by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston, who was incarcerated at Manzanar as a child, and her husband James D. Houston. The book and the movie {{tell the story of the}} Wakatsuki family and their experiences behind the barbed wire through young Jeanne's eyes.

5|$|After the Free State {{government}} dismissed {{an ultimatum}} from Pretorius to cease what he {{regarded as the}} marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have to make terms.|$|E
5|$|Egwene {{begins to}} expose the Black Ajah among the rebels, {{requiring}} every sister to re-swear her allegiances. Fifty sisters are exposed and executed, while twenty are able to escape. Taking advantage of the weakened White Tower defenses following the Seanchan raid, the rebels prepare an immediate attack. Just before the attack is mounted, the Tower Aes Sedai announce that Elaida was captured in the Seanchan raid, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have Egwene as their leader, the Amyrlin Seat. The rebels return and they begin rebuilding the Tower.|$|E
5|$|Hermética {{remained}} a popular {{band in the}} Argentine heavy metal scene, even among the younger fans who {{had never seen the}} band live. Since their disbandment, the band's members have not attempted any reunion. At the 2011 reunion of Malón, Claudio O'Connor said that their personal conflicts with Iorio would not allow it <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not reunite the band if the four members do not have a good personal relationship.|$|E

5|$|In March 2012, 20th Century Fox stopped {{production}} before filming could begin. Budgetary issues remained unresolved and Sutherland's narrow {{time frame}} for filming were cited as reasons for halting production. However, in July 2012, Sutherland assured {{the film was}} still in plans <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> begin filming in summer 2013. The film was eventually suspended in May 2013 after the announcement that the show would return as a limited series.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} hypothesized that Pachycephalosaurus and its relatives were the bipedal equivalents of bighorn sheep or musk oxen, where male individuals would ram each other headlong, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> horizontally straighten their head, neck, and body {{in order to}} transmit stress during ramming. However, {{there have also been}} alternative suggestions that the pachycephalosaurs could not have used their domes in this way.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 2009, it was {{announced}} that the new album title would be In This Light and on This Evening <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be the first band to play at the new O2 Academy Birmingham. Through producer Flood's heavy usage of synthesisers, the album provided a synthpop/post-punk sound to Editors' production. Flood, who is famous for collaborating with electronic music influenced bands like U2, Depeche Mode, The Killers and Erasure, helped develop synthetic elements on the album, which resulted in a mixed reception from long-term fans as to the group's new direction.|$|E
5000|$|On 24 November 2007 the Bavarian Regional Railway {{rented the}} Passau-Hauzenberg railway and the Erlau-Obernzell section, <b>and</b> {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be opened again.|$|R

5|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson {{did not work}} {{much more on the}} game until 1984, when the journalist Erik Fichtelius conducted an interview about the game for the Swedish airline Linjeflyg's magazine Upp, which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985. In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have to find a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version.|$|E
5|$|As the United States {{expanded}} westward in {{the early}} 19th century, government officials sought to buy as much Native American land as possible. In 1804, territorial governor William Henry Harrison negotiated a treaty in St. Louis in which a group of Sauk and Meskwaki leaders supposedly sold their lands east of the Mississippi for more than $2,200, in goods and annual payments of $1,000 in goods. The treaty became controversial because the Native leaders had not been authorized by their tribal councils to cede lands. Historian Robert Owens argued that the chiefs probably {{did not intend to}} give up ownership of the land, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not have sold so much valuable territory for such a modest price. Historian Patrick Jung concluded that the Sauk and Meskwaki chiefs intended to cede a little land, but that the Americans included more territory in the treaty's language than the Natives realized. According to Jung, the Sauks and Meskwakis did not learn the true extent of the cession until years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{as the price}} of silver rose, Treasury Department vaults were {{depleted}} of silver dollars by the public. No silver dollars had been minted in the United States since 1935, and a shortage developed in the Western United States, especially in areas in which gambling was common. As a result, Congress voted to authorize production of 45 million new silver Peace dollars on August 3, 1964. However, the move drew strong condemnation from critics who believed that the issuance of the coins was influenced by special interests, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be quickly removed from circulation. The dollars were subsequently melted, and the Coinage Act of 1965, enacted on July 23, 1965, forbade all production of dollar coins for a period of five years.|$|E

5|$|John of Bohemia's heir, Charles, Margrave of Moravia, visited Charles in Visegrád {{in early}} 1338. The margrave {{acknowledged}} {{the right of}} Charles's son, Louis, to inherit Poland if CasimirIII died without a son in exchange for Charles's promise to persuade CasimirIII not to invade Silesia. Two leading Polish lords, Zbigniew, chancellor of Cracow, and Spycimir Leliwita, also supported this plan and persuaded CasimirIII, who lost his first wife on 26May 1339, to start negotiations with Charles. In July, Casimir came to Hungary and designated his sister (Charles's wife), Elizabeth, and her sons as his heirs. On his sons' behalf, Charles promised that they would {{make every effort to}} reconquer all lands that Poland had lost <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> refrain from employing foreigners in Poland.|$|E
5|$|Martínez Pérez {{was murdered}} {{early in the}} morning of 28 April 2012 in her home in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto {{neighborhood}} in Xalapa, the capital of Veracruz. When police went to her home to investigate in response to a neighbor's call about her door being open all day, Martínez Pérez's corpse was found on the bathroom floor. According to official reports, she had been severely beaten around her face and ribs, and then strangled to death. The cause of death was asphyxia by strangulation. At the time of her death, the Mexican authorities said they were investigating all the possible motives behind her assassination, including personal motives and theft, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> investigate whether the killing was work-related.|$|E
5|$|Miners of the Pittston Coal Company {{were glad}} that a {{settlement}} {{had been reached}} <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> once again be receiving health and retirement funds. However, because they were without benefits {{for such a long}} time, many people had gone into financial trouble. During the strike, the costs of health care had to be paid out of pocket and many miners did not have the resources to do so. As a result, many miners had accumulated debt. Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act. This act was established in 1992. This act made it mandatory by law for mining companies to provide health and retirement benefits for its workers.|$|E
