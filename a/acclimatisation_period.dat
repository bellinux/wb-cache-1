40|$|Abstract: In Spathiphyllum floribundum 'Petite', {{which was}} cultured on medium {{containing}} benzyladenine (BA), uptake of this cytokinin and its conversion to 9 -beta-D-ribofuranosyl-benzyladenine (9 R-BA) or 9 -beta-glucopyranosyl-benzyladenine (9 G-BA) was monitored. BA and extremely {{large quantities of}} 9 G-BA were exclusively located in the basal part of the plant (callus and meristems). 9 R-BA {{was found in the}} basal part, the petioles and the leaf blades. After an <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period</b> of 9 weeks the plants still contained high levels of 9 G-BA, but BA and 9 R-BA could no longer be detected after one week.

40|$|Anaerobic {{treatment}} {{has historically been}} considered unsuitable {{for the treatment of}} domestic wastewaters. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the incorporation of membranes into the anaerobic bioreactor to uncouple solid retention time and hydraulic retention time. This in turn prevents biomass washout and allows sufficient <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>periods</b> for anaerobes. However, the exposure of membranes to anaerobic biomass comes with its own inherent problems namely fouling. Fouling was found to take place in two stages; a rapid phase characterised by solid and bacterial cell deposition and a slow phase characterised by the travel of colloidal matter to the membrane surface. Gas sparging was also found to attenuate fouling to a considerable extent despite the fact that biomass characteristics were critical factors in the fouling of the system. In addition, side stream membranes showed differing characteristics to submerged membranes. A comparison of anaerobic membrane bioreactors to conventional anaerobic systems and aerobic membrane bioreactors highlighted the advantage of this system over other comparable technologies. The anaerobic membrane bioreactor is less energy intensive than the aerobic membrane bioreactor, fouls differently to this system and achieves much better performance than would be seen if conventional anaerobic systems were used in the treatment of domestic or municipal wastewaters...|$|R
40|$|Background: Wheelchair {{research}} {{includes both}} {{qualitative and quantitative}} approaches, primarily focuses on functionality and skill performance and is often limited to short testing periods. This is the first study to use {{the combination of a}} performance test (i. e. wheelchair propulsion test) and a multiple-day mobility assessment to evaluate wheelchair designs in rural areas of a developing country. Objectives: Test the feasibility of using wheel-mounted accelerometers to document bouts of wheeled mobility data in rural settings and use these data to compare how patients respond to different wheelchair designs. Methods: A quasi-experimental, pre- and post-test design was used to test the differences between locally manufactured wheelchairs (push rim and tricycle) and an imported intervention product (dual-lever propulsion wheelchair). A one-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to interpret propulsion and wheeled mobility data. Results: There were no statistical differences in bouts of mobility between the locally manufactured and intervention product, which was explained by high amounts of variability within the data. With regard to the propulsion test, push rim users were significantly more efficient when using the intervention product compared with tricycle users. Conclusion: Use of wheel-mounted accelerometers as a means to test user mobility proved to be a feasible methodology in rural settings. Variability in wheeled mobility data could be decreased with longer <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>periods.</b> The data suggest that push rim users experience an easier transition to a dual-lever propulsion system...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{biofiltration}} {{system was}} designed using mature composts of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) or MSW mixed with pruning residues (MSW-P) as packing materials to treat vapours of α-pinene (a dominant volatile organic compounds (VOC) emitted during the MSW-P co-composting). Monitoring {{the efficiency of the}} biofiltration system was carried out using a photoionization analyser, a commercial electronic nose (e-nose) and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Using an EBRT of 66. s, removal efficiencies for both kinds of biofilters were greater than 90 % removal at different stages of the experiment. The <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>periods</b> were 10 and 25. days for the MSW biofilter and MSW-P biofilter, respectively. Removal efficiency of the system was strongly dependent upon the moisture content of the packing materials. As moisture content in the biofilters fell to below 66 % for the MSW and 51 % (dry basis) for MSW-P, the removal efficiency decreased to less than 90 %. E-nose and GC/MS data indicate a complete degradation of the α-pinene. The e-nose detected a characteristical background emission (odour fingerprint) of each type of biofilter. Results suggest that e-nose's will become a more powerful tool for monitoring VOCs in biofiltration and composting processes in the future.

A survey found that the athletes and support staff’s concerns included maintaining training load at altitude, reducing the <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period,</b> maximising haematological adaptations and when to compete on return to sea level. These challenges were prioritised and investigated further in the thesis.

40|$|A {{model system}} was {{developed}} to study Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and the susceptibility of Xiphophorus maculatus to this parasite. The experiments showed that infection levels on X. maculatus can be accurately quantified, thus overcoming existing problems encountered when investigating disease susceptibility using other disease causing organisms. The genetics of susceptibility of X. maculatus to ichthyophthiriasis was evaluated. This initial study, using limited numbers of fish, did not uncover any genetic variation, but did demonstrate the existence of large maternal effects affecting susceptibility. This is discussed. The question of whether more than one strain of I. multifiliis exists was also investigated and results indicate that genetic differences in virulence of different parasite isolates exists. Preservation of the parasite in liquid nitrogen was investigated, as a possible method of maintaining the isolates without genetic change, to enable formation of a parasite gene bank. No ciliate has successfully been preserved in this way. Some success was attained in preserving the encysted stage, when 1. 25 MDMSO {{was used as the}} cryoprotectant.

40|$|Background: A {{discrete}} time, stochastic, compartmental model simulating {{the spread}} of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae within a batch of industrially raised pigs was developed to understand infection dynamics and {{to assess the impact}} of a range of husbandry practices. A ‘disease severity’ index was calculated based on the ratio between the cumulative numbers of acutely and chronically diseased and infectious pigs per day in each age category, divided by the length of time that pigs spent in this age category. This is equal to the number of pigs per day, either acutely or chronically infectious and diseased, divided by the number of all pigs per all days in the model. The impact of risk and protective factors at batch level was examined by adjusting ‘acclimatisation of gilts’, ‘length of suckling period’, ‘vaccination of suckling pigs against M. hyopneumoniae’, ‘contact between fattening pigs of different age during restocking of compartments’ and ‘co-infections in fattening pigs’. Results: The highest ‘disease severity’ was predicted, when gilts do not have contact with live animals during their <b>acclimatisation,</b> suckling <b>period</b> is 28 days, no vaccine is applied, fatteners have contact with pigs of other ages and are suffering from co-infections. Pigs in this scenario become diseased/infectious for 26. 1 % of their lifetime. Logistic regression showed that vaccination of suckling pigs was influential for ‘disease severity’ in growers and finishers, but not in suckling and nursery pigs. Lack of contact between gilts and other live pigs during the acclimatisation significantly influenced the ‘disease severity’ in suckling pigs but had less impact in growing and finishing pigs. The length of the suckling period equally affected the severity of the disease in all age groups with the strongest association in nursery pigs. The contact between fatteners of different groups influenced the course of infection among finishers, but not among other pigs. Finally, presence of co-infections was relevant in growers and finishers, but not in younger pigs. Conclusion: The developed model allows comparison of different prevention programmes and strategies for controlling transmission of M. hyopneumoniae...|$|R
40|$|Background Poor interprofessional {{collaboration}} (IPC) can {{adversely affect}} {{the delivery of}} health services and patient care. Interventions that address IPC problems {{have the potential to}} improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes. Objectives To assess the impact of practice-based interventions designed to improve interprofessional collaboration (IPC) amongst health and social care professionals, compared to usual care or to an alternative intervention, on {{at least one of the}} following primary outcomes: patient health outcomes, clinical process or efficiency outcomes or secondary outcomes (collaborative behaviour). Search methods We searched CENTRAL (2015, issue 11), MEDLINE, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials. gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to November 2015. We handsearched relevant interprofessional journals to November 2015, and reviewed the reference lists of the included studies. Selection criteria We included randomised trials of practice-based IPC interventions involving health and social care professionals compared to usual care or to an alternative intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of each potentially relevant study. We extracted data from the included studies and assessed the risk of bias of each study. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis of study outcomes, given the small number of included studies and their heterogeneity in clinical settings, interventions and outcomes. Consequently, we summarised the study data and presented the results in a narrative format to report study methods, outcomes, impact and certainty of the evidence. Main results We included nine studies in total (6540 participants); six cluster-randomised trials and three individual randomised trials (1 study randomised clinicians, 1 randomised patients, and 1 randomised clinicians and patients). All studies were conducted in high-income countries (Australia, Belgium, Sweden, UK and USA) across primary, secondary, tertiary and community care settings and had a follow-up of up to 12 months. Eight studies compared an IPC intervention with usual care and evaluated the effects of different practice-based IPC interventions: externally facilitated interprofessional activities (e. g. team action planning; 4 studies), interprofessional rounds (2 studies), interprofessional meetings (1 study), and interprofessional checklists (1 study). One study compared one type of interprofessional meeting with another type of interprofessional meeting. We assessed four studies to be at high risk of attrition bias and an equal number of studies to be at high risk of detection bias. For studies comparing an IPC intervention with usual care, functional status in stroke patients may be slightly improved by externally facilitated interprofessional activities (1 study, 464 participants, low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether patient-assessed quality of care (1 study, 1185 participants), continuity of care (1 study, 464 participants) or collaborative working (4 studies, 1936 participants) are improved by externally facilitated interprofessional activities, as we graded the evidence as very low-certainty for these outcomes. Healthcare professionals’ adherence to recommended practices may be slightly improved with externally facilitated interprofessional activities or interprofessional meetings (3 studies, 2576 participants, low certainty evidence). The use of healthcare resources may be slightly improved by externally facilitated interprofessional activities, interprofessional checklists and rounds (4 studies, 1679 participants, low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on patient mortality, morbidity or complication rates. Compared to multidisciplinary audio conferencing, multidisciplinary video conferencing may reduce the average length of treatment and may reduce the number of multidisciplinary conferences needed per patient and the patient length of stay. There was little or no difference between these interventions in the number of communications between health professionals (1 study, 100 participants; low- certainty evidence). Authors’ conclusions Given that the certainty of evidence from the included studies was judged to be low to very low, there is not sufficient evidence to draw clear conclusions on the effects of IPC interventions. Neverthess, due to the difficulties health professionals encounter when collaborating in clinical practice, it is encouraging that research on the number of interventions to improve IPC has increased since this review was last updated. While this field is developing, further rigorous, mixed-method studies are required. Future studies should focus on longer <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>periods</b> before evaluating newly implemented IPC interventions, and use longer follow-up to generate a more informed understanding of the effects of IPC on clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{investigate how}} footwear design affects plantar pressure (PP) and ask participants {{to walk in}} unfamiliar footwear {{as part of their}} studies. However, there are no clear guidelines for the required period of time or number of steps a healthy participant requires to acclimatise to unfamiliar footwear. Nor are there clear guidelines for how many steps should be collected to produce data that is representative of gait in each particular shoe being tested. There were therefore two aims to this study: (1) to investigate the number of steps required to produce an average step that is representative of normal gait; (2) to investigate the number of steps required for a participant to acclimatise to a range of footwear types. PP data were collected in 20 healthy participants whilst they walked for 400 min a range of footwear. The results showed that the number of steps required for both acclimatisation and to ensure data quality are dependent on shoe type and the foot region being investigated. It is recommended that 30 steps from one foot are collected during data collection and an <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period</b> of at least 166 steps is given for each shoe condition.

40|$|Research trials {{with fresh}} forages often require {{accurate}} and precise measurement of digestibility and variation in digestion between individuals, and {{the duration of}} measurement periods needs to be established to ensure reliable data are obtained. The variation {{is likely to be}} greater when freshly harvested feeds are given, such as perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and forage rape (Brassica napus L.), because the nutrient composition changes over time and in response to weather conditions. Daily feed intake and faeces output data from a digestibility trial with these forages were used to calculate the effects of differing lengths of the measurement period and differing numbers of sheep, on the precision of digestibility, with a view towards development of a protocol. Sixteen lambs aged 8 months and weighing 33  kg at the commencement of the trial were fed either perennial ryegrass or forage rape (8 /treatment group) over 2 periods with 35  d between measurements. They had been acclimatised to the diets, having grazed them for 42  d prior to 11 days of indoor measurements. The sheep numbers required for a digestibility trial with different combinations of <b>acclimatisation</b> and measurement <b>period</b> lengths were subsequently calculated for 3 levels of imposed precision upon the estimate of mean dry matter (DM) digestibility. It is recommended that if the standard error of the mean for digestibility is equal to or higher than 5  g/kg DM, and if sheep are already used to a fresh perennial ryegrass or forage rape diet, then a minimum of 6 animals are needed and 4 acclimatisation days being fed individually in metabolic crates followed by 7 days of measurement...|$|R
40|$|Four {{horses were}} {{randomly}} fed a diet containing rolled, micronised or extruded barley; the barley intake was adjusted to supply 2 g starch/kg bodyweight per day.

The highest peak serum glucose and serum insulin concentrations were observed after feeding the extruded barley, lower concentrations were observed after feeding the micronised barley and the lowest concentrations were observed after feeding the rolled barley. Breath hydrogen increased within four hours of feeding all the barley diets, and the mean (sd) peak hydrogen concentrations were 98. 3 (55. 2) ppm for rolled barley, 59. 3 (31. 5) ppm for micronised barley and 96. 1 (51. 9) ppm for extruded barley.

Twenty-four Merino ewe weaners (6 months; initial BW 30. 8 ± 1. 0 kg) were selected and the treatment period lasted 21 days following a 14 day <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period.</b> Two levels of two factors were used. The first factor was alkaloid, fed at a nil (NilAlk) or moderate level (Alk; 80 μg/kg LW ergovaline and 20. 5 μg/kg·LW lolitrem B). The second factor was ambient temperature applied at two levels; thermoneutral (TN; constant 21 – 22 °C) or heat (Heat; 9 : 00 AM– 5 : 00 PM at 38 °C; 5 : 00 PM– 9 : 00 AM at 21 – 22 °C), resulting in four treatments, NilAlk TN, NilAlk Heat, Alk TN and Alk Heat. Alkaloid consumption reduced dry matter intake (p = 0. 008), and tended to reduce liveweight (p = 0. 07). Rectal temperature and respiration rate were increased by both alkaloid and heat (p < 0. 05 for all). Respiration rate increased to severe levels when alkaloid and heat were combined, indicating the short term effects which may be occurring in perennial ryegrass toxicosis (PRGT) areas during severe weather conditions, a novel finding. When alkaloid ingestion and heat were administered separately, similar physiological responses occurred, indicating alkaloid ingestion causes a similar heat stress response to 38 °C heat...|$|E
40|$|Phytoremediation is a green {{technique}} used to restore polluted sites through plant-initiated biochemical processes. Its effectiveness, however, {{depends on the}} successful establishment of plants in the contaminated soil. Soils that are contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), especially low molecular weight, mobile PAHs such as naphthalene pose a significant challenge to this. Plant roots growing in these soils exhibit changes to their structure, physiology and growth patterns. Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) roots grown in sand contaminated with either petroleum crude oil (10. 8 g total extractable hydrocarbons kg- 1 sand dw) or naphthalene (0. 8 g kg- 1 sand dw) exhibited a temporary inhibition in elongation with accelerated lateral growth (p< 0. 01), whilst also showing a deviation from the normal root orientation responses to gravity. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) revealed that the stele in the contaminated roots was located much further away from the root epidermis, because the cortex was larger (p< 0. 001) due to the cells being more isodiametric in shape.

A total of 32 layer hens (Bovans Brown strain at 27 weeks of age) were randomly allocated to one of 4 dietary treatments containing W-DDGS at 0, 60, 120 or 180 g/kg. Each treatment was fed to 8 replicate individually housed layer hens over a 5 -d <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period,</b> followed by a 4 -week trial. Individual feed intakes were monitored and all eggs were collected daily for weeks 2, 3 and 4 of the trial, weighed and an assessment of eggshell “dirtiness” made. All hens were culled on d 29 and caecal pH and SCFAs measured. Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the bacterial 16 S rDNA gene was used to assess total bacterial diversity of luminal caecal content from hens fed the 0 and 180 g W-DDGS/kg diets. Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrograms were generated from DGGE banding patterns. Increasing W-DDGS dietary concentrations resulted in a more acidic caecal environment. Caecal SCFAs were unaffected by diet aside from a quadratic effect for molar proportions of isobutyric acid. Diversity profiles of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene from luminal caecal contents were unaffected by W-DDGS inclusion. The results of the current study suggest that W-DDGS can be successfully formulated into nutritionally balanced layer diets (supplemented with xylanase and phytase) at up to 180 g/kg with no detrimental effects to the caecal environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of low-frequency lateral and roll motions experienced in tilting trains can provoke motion sickness. The incidence of sickness depends on vehicle design and subject demographics. Vehicle design affects {{the location of}} the centre-of-roll, which influences passenger perception of motion. Age and gender have large influences on susceptibility to sickness, but {{little is known about the}} effects of ethnicity and body size. This study investigated the influence of both the vertical position of the centre-of-roll and subject characteristics (ethnicity, weight, stature and sickness susceptibility) on sickness caused by fully roll-compensated lateral oscillation. It was hypothesised that sickness would be greater when full compensation occurred at the head than when full compensation occurred at the seat. Sixty subjects experienced a 0. 2 -Hz lateral oscillation combined with ± 7. 3 ° of roll, so that the lateral acceleration was fully compensated at either the seat surface or 800 mm above the seat (i. e. average head height). Illness ratings and symptom scores were recorded every minute for 50 min (i. e. during a 5 -min <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period,</b> a 30 -min exposure period and a 15 -min recovery period). Although the mean illness ratings were greater when full compensation occurred at the head than at the seat, the difference was not statistically significant. Weight and stature were not associated with motion sickness, but illness ratings were much greater in Asian subjects than in European subjects. It is concluded that differences in susceptibility between Asians and Europeans have a greater effect on motion sickness than the height of the centre-of-rotation during roll-compensated lateral acceleration. © IMechE 2012. </p...|$|E
40|$|Under {{stagnant}} conditions, {{the ability}} of 15 earth materials (non-lime) including various inorganic 2 : 1 and 1 : 1 layer silicates, an amorphous oxide, and two 'whole' soils were tested for their pH-buffering efficiency in an acid mine drainage (AMD) water. The purpose was to decrease AMD acidity to a level where sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) placed in it may be activated. Of all materials, a whole soil (a high cation-exchange capacity clayey mollisol containing 40 % clay, and 4 % soil organic matter) caused the greatest pH increases from 2. 5 up to 5. 5 units after 10 days in the AMD water. Influent AMD was then ameliorated at various speeds through an SRB driven bioreactor using a 50 / 50 weight over weight (w/w) combination of the mollisol and ryegrass (MR) as the pH buffer substrate. This substrate combination decreased the SRB <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period</b> (from 50 days in a previous experiment utilising sludge + ryegrass) to 6 units in 5 days, the buffer reduced the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the constant-flow reactor from 12 days at flow speeds of 100 ml/day to 2 days at 25 ml/day, respectively. After 10 days, soluble Fe, Al and sulfate were all decreased > 1, 800 -, > 40 - and 3 -fold, respectively. This was a more efficient performance than the no-flow bioreactor of a previous experiment using sludge + ryegrass. This method of AMD rehabilitation is an alternative for localities that lack cheap sources of calcium compounds for chemical treatment, but have a similar soil type and copious quantities of fresh decomposable plant wastes.

Following an <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period,</b> rats were divided into four groups and fed a control (C) diet or experimental diet containing 30  % of BR. DF content in the experimental diet was twice that of the C diet (total DF was 8 * 69  % in the C diet and 15 * 24  % in the BR diet). At 7 and 8 weeks of age, rats received two successive subcutaneous injections of AOM at 20  mg/kg body weight. At 12 weeks after the first injection, ten animals from each group were killed. The BR diet decreased colonic pH (P <  0 * 05) compared with the C diet. The total number of ACF observed decreased considerably in the BR/AOM group compared with the C/AOM group (P <  0 * 05). Comparison of similarity coefficients showed variability of colonic microbiota species between the different groups. In addition, we showed inter-individual variability within the same group. This similarity was affected by BR and AOM. The present results show that bifidobacteria numbers were lower in rats fed the BR diet compared with those fed the C diet. However, the number of enterobacteria in colonic content was increased (P <  0 * 05) in the BR group compared with the C group.

This study assesses what proportion of patients with OSA already on NCPAP can successfully use a MAD for short periods (up to 1 month) as a temporary alternative to NCPAP. METHODS: Fifty patients with OSA, already on NCPAP for at least 3 months, were recruited by invitation. They were provided with a simple fixed MAD estimated to provide 75 % of maximum mandibular protrusion. Sleep studies using a portable home recorder were performed on and after three nights without NCPAP to provide control data. Following acclimatisation to the MAD, sleep studies were also planned after 3, 7, and 28 days while using the MAD. If their overnight > 4 % SaO(2) dips per hour deteriorated to > 20 or the Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) rose to > 9 (or increased by > 4 over baseline) on nights 3 or 7, they were then deemed to have failed the trial and were withdrawn. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients entered, one had inadequate teeth for a MAD and 31 {{gave up trying to}} use the device during the <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period</b> because of side effects. Of the 18 prepared to use the device, two patients failed at night 3, five at night 7, and two at night 28. Thus, nine patients remained controlled by our criteria at night 28. On average, sleep study indices while using the MAD were poor compared with the night on NCPAP. CONCLUSIONS: Simple MADs are poorly tolerated by patients with OSA already on NCPAP. OSA was adequately controlled by our criteria in 32 % of those recruited for the equivalent of a weekend, in 22 % for 1 week, and in 18 % for up to 1 month. Better tolerated devices would be likely to improve on these figures...|$|E
40|$|During 1992 and 1993, 14 reintroduced Przewalski Horses or Takhi (Equus ferus przewalskii) {{were studied}} in the Hustain Nuruu Mountain Steppe reserve in Mongolia. Most of the {{individuals}} did not know each other before reintroduction. These Takhi were the first of five groups due {{to be released in}} the reserve after an <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period</b> of at least 1 year. During acclimatisation the Takhi, lived visually and acoustically separately, in fenced enclosures of approximately 45 ha each. The observations, mostly scan-sampling, were carried out in each season. The observation bouts were divided over six periods and over two harem herds. Two of the periods were in the Same consecutive seasons, so comparison over the years was possible. Social integration within the Takhi herds was very high from the beginning, as described by the spatial relation and synchronisation data. Between 50 and 89 % of the observation time, the behaviour of all herd members was synchronised, The amount of time spent grazing by the Takhi (30 - 68 % of the daylight period) was similar to that of feral horses and Takhi in captivity and semi-reserves. The Takhi tended to rest in the morning and have a bimodal period of grazing at dawn and in the afternoon. The Takhi displayed clear habitat preferences for certain activities, They had a strong preference to rest at the highest point in their enclosure. They fed preferably on two or three different vegetation types (with five types available in each enclosure), The amount of time spent grazing during the non-growing seasons (49 +/- 15 %) indicates that the feeding value and availability of food were sufficient. Health changes were detected adequately using condition scoring sheets. No supplementary food or water was supplied during the harsh winters. Moreover, low mortality rates and high reproductive success show that the mountain steppe is a habitat which is potentially suitable for establishing a healthy Takhi population. Takhi is the first species to return to its native habitat after living only in toes for so many generations...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether physiological responses to stress differed between ewes of calm and nervous temperament. Merino ewes were selected for temperament based on agitation score. This score involved placing the ewe inside a 1. 5 x 0. 7 x 1. 5 m isolation box for 30 seconds whilst objectively recording movement and sound. Ewes classified as calm had an average agitation score of 18. 1 ± 4. 8 (n = 15) whilst those deemed as nervous averaged 81. 3 ± 4. 3 (n = 15). Prior to sampling, ewes were group housed within a yard, fed {{at the same time and}} run through a race daily to accustom them to handling. After the <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period,</b> ewes were quietly restrained and a 9 ml venous blood sample was collected. At the same time the following day, ewes were placed inside a replica isolation box for two minutes after which time a 9 ml venous blood sample was collected once more. Blood samples were analysed for glucose, lactate, cortisol and differential blood cell counts. Analysis of data was performed using SAS software (version 8. 1) with temperament, treatment and the interaction between the two fitted as fixed effects. There was no effect of temperament on blood glucose, lactate or cortisol levels, however after the application of the isolation box test ewes displayed a 27 % increase in plasma glucose (4. 1 ± 0. 18 nmol/L prior to isolation and 5. 24 ± 0. 18 nmol/L post isolation; P < 0. 001) and a 70 % increase in plasma cortisol (47. 14 ± 8. 4 nmol/L prior to isolation and 80. 2 ± 8. 4 nmol/L post isolation; P < 0. 001). Plasma glucose and cortisol concentrations were related (r= 0. 6, P < 0. 05). Differential blood cell counts were not affected by temperament or isolation box test. It is concluded that a ewe's temperament cannot be predicted by the blood measures investigated in this study. Kate Lennon, Michelle Hebart, Philip Hynd[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Upon {{ascent to}} high altitude, {{cerebral}} blood flow (CBF) rises substantially before returning to sea-level values. The underlying mechanisms for these changes are unclear. We examined three hypotheses: (1) the balance of arterial blood gases upon arrival at and across 2 weeks of living at 5050 m will closely relate to changes in CBF; (2) CBF reactivity to steady-state changes in CO 2 will be reduced following this 2 week <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period,</b> and (3) reductions in CBF reactivity to CO 2 will be reflected in an augmented ventilatory sensitivity to CO 2. We measured arterial blood gases, middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv, index of CBF) and ventilation () at rest and during steady-state hyperoxic hypercapnia (7 % CO 2) and voluntary hyperventilation (hypocapnia) at sea level and then again following 2 – 4, 7 – 9 and 12 – 15 days of living at 5050 m. Upon arrival at high altitude, resting MCAv was elevated (up 31 ± 31 %; P < 0. 01; vs. sea level), but returned to sea-level values within 7 – 9 days. Elevations in MCAv were strongly correlated (R 2 = 0. 40) with the change in ratio (i. e. the collective tendency of arterial blood gases to cause CBF vasodilatation or constriction). Upon initial arrival and after 2 weeks at high altitude, cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia was reduced (P < 0. 05), whereas hypocapnic reactivity was enhanced (P < 0. 05 vs. sea level). Ventilatory response to hypercapnia was elevated at days 2 – 4 (P < 0. 05 vs. sea level, 4. 01 ± 2. 98 vs. 2. 09 ± 1. 32 l min− 1 mmHg− 1). These findings indicate that: (1) the balance of arterial blood gases accounts for {{a large part of}} the observed variability (∼ 40 %) leading to changes in CBF at high altitude; (2) cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia and hypocapnia is differentially affected by high-altitude exposure and remains distorted during partial acclimatisation, and (3) alterations in cerebrovascular reactivity to CO 2 may also affect ventilatory sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of a cochlear implant (CI) filterbank determine the coding of spectral and temporal information in it. Hence, {{it is important to}} optimise the filterbank parameters to achieve optimal benefit in CI users. The present thesis aimed at modelling how the manipulation of the filterbank analysis length and the assignment of spectral channels may effect CI speech perception, using CI acoustical simulation techniques. Investigations were carried out to study the efficacy of providing additional spectral information in low and/or mid frequency channels using a longer filterbank analysis window, with respect to CI processed speech perception in various types of background noise. However, the increase of filterbank analysis length has an associated trade-off, which is a reduction in temporal information. Only a few CI acoustic simulations studies have modelled the {{characteristics of}} the FFT filterbank, the most commonly used filterbank in commercial CI processors. An initial experiment was carried out to validate the CI acoustical simulation technique used in the present thesis that implemented an FFT filterbank analysis. Next, the effect of a reduction in temporal information with the increase of the FFT analysis window length was studied. A filterbank with 16 ms analysis window, without the implementation of its finer spectral coding abilities, performed marginally poorer to that of a 4 ms analysis window in a sentence recognition test. The finer spectral coding abilities of the filterbank with 16 ms analysis window, when implemented, revealed that CI processed speech perception in noise could be significantly improved if additional spectral information is provided in the low and mid frequencies. The assignment of additional spectral channels to the low and mid frequencies led to a corresponding reduction in spectral channels assigned to high frequencies. However, no detrimental effect in speech perception was observed as long as at least two spectral channels represented information above 3 kHz. The assignment of additionallow and mid frequency spectral channels also led to significant levels of spectral shift. The significant benefits from additional low and mid frequency information, however, were lost when the effects of spectral shift were introduced in acute experiments, without any training or <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period.</b> The findings of the present thesis highlight that a longer filterbank analysis, such as 16 ms, may be implemented in CI devices without the fear of any perceptual cost due to a reduction in temporal information, at least for tasks that do not require talker separation. Providing additional low and mid frequency spectral information with a longer filterbank analysis has the potential to improve CI speech perception. However, to obtain potential benefits, the effects of spectral shift should be overcome. The findings of this thesis, however, need to be interpreted considering the limitations of CI acoustical simulation experiments...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Msc Food Sc (Food Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Distilleries are {{an example}} of an {{agricultural}} industry that generates large volumes of wastewater. These wastewaters are heavily polluted, and due to the seasonal nature of the product, the amount and composition of the wastewater may exhibit major daily and seasonal variations. Wine-distillery wastewaters (WDWWs) typically are acidic (pH 3. 5 - 5. 0) and have a high organic content (sugars, alcohol, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids), a COD range of 10 000 – 60 000 mg. L- 1, have a high suspended solids content as well as containing various inorganic compounds. Additionally refractory compounds present in these wastewaters, such as polyphenols, can be toxic for biological processes, making the selection of a suitable treatment process problematic. Wetlands {{have been shown to be}} a feasible treatment for effluent originating from wine, however, they are normally used as a secondary treatment method and not well suited for high volume, high COD (> 5 000 mg. L- 1) wastewaters. Ozone has been successfully used as a pre-treatment for WDWW due to its oxidising capabilities to partially biodegrade organics and non-biodegradable organics, and reduce polyphenols, which results in an increase in biodegradability. Currently a wetland system is being used on its own at a distillery to treat wastewater from a series of stabilisation dams, but the legal requirement for discharge into a natural resource (COD < 75 mg. L- 1) is not being met. Additional treatments suited for WDWW are therefore being considered. Wine-distillery wastewater was characterised and found to show a large variation over time (COD ranging from 12 609 - 21 150 mg. L- 1). Ozonation of WDWWs was found to be effective in decreasing COD over a wide range of organic loads. For pre-wetland wastewater from the distillery, an average COD reduction of 271 mg COD. g O 3 - 1 was found, and for post-wetland effluent, an average of 103 mg COD. g O 3 - 1. The effect of ozone on the biodegradability of the wastewater was monitored by activity tests, and a low ozone dose (200 - 400 mg O 3. L- 1) was found to increase activity in terms of biogas, methane and cumulative gas volumes. By showing an increase in the biodegradability of WDWW, it was concluded that ozone has potential as a pre-treatment step to increase the effectiveness of a biological wetland system. Lab-scale wetlands were used in trials to determine the effect of pre- and post-ozonation on WDWW. It was found that the efficiency of the wetland receiving the pre-ozonated “off-season” WDWW (2 200 mg COD. L- 1) had a higher COD reduction (73 %) than the wetland fed with untreated (62 % COD reduction) WDWW, and the total polyphenol content was reduced by 40 and 31 %, respectively. Treatment efficiency in terms of the reduction of colour, total solids, suspended solids and phosphates were also greatly improved for the pre-ozonated WDWW. Similar results were found when treating high COD “peak season” (7 000 mg COD. L- 1) WDWW, with higher reduction rates for the wetland treating pre-ozonated WDWW (84 % COD reduction) than for the wetland fed with untreated WDWW (74 % COD reduction), and the total polyphenol content was reduced by 76 and 72 %, respectively. Post-ozonation was also shown to be beneficial in that it improved the final effluent quality leaving the wetland system. Increasing the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the wetlands from 9 days to 12 days resulted in similar COD reductions for the control and experimental wetland, highlighting the benefits that pre-ozonation has on reducing the <b>acclimatisation</b> <b>period.</b> Therefore using ozone as a pre-treatment could help in reducing the wetland size, HRT and allow increased volumes of wastewater to be treated. In this study ozone was successfully utilised to reduce COD levels in wine-distillery wastewater, and increase the biodegradability of the wastewater. This study also showed that ozone, used as a pre-treatment to a wetland system, can contribute to improving the performance of a wetland system in terms of higher removal efficiencies. Wetlands are, however, unsuited for treating high strength COD wastewater, and the final effluent was still well above the South African legal limit for direct discharge into a natural resource. The results obtained during this study contributed to developing a method to achieve a more efficient treatment system utilising wetlands for the distillery industry, and can be of value in facilitating efficient environmental management...|$|E
