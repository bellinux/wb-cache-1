Results visualization is an important step towards successful interpretation of NDT data. This step is a prerequisite in order to proceed with efficient structural integrity assessment and fitness for service. In addition to that, visual combination of NDT data from different methods is becoming increasingly important as modern NDE techniques produce large amounts of results within short inspection time. The need to merge, review and manipulate this data together has pushed towards software that is capable of working with data from various techniques. In this paper the necessity for advanced centralized data viewing and integration to asset management databases is discussed. In other words, the real issue of finding a way to integrate traditional NDT data gathered on daily basis with NDT data gathered from modern on-stream techniques, in a user friendly form that will permit data fusion and structure visualization, is discussed and software based solution is presented.

The nature of these incidents has varied from major spills, to the partial or total destruction of a facility with serious environmental implications and human cost. During this period there have been almost five hundred fatalities and numerous injuries {{as a result of}} accidents within the bulk storage industry. The fact that nobody was killed or seriously injured at the Buncefield site can only be only be looked upon with amazement considering it has been claimed to have been the largest explosion in Europe since the second world war.

40|$|<b>Above</b> <b>ground</b> liquid <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> have {{suffered}} serious damage during earthquakes. The damage of tanks {{can vary from}} local yielding or buckling of the tank wall, to loss of contents, or to collapse which leads to an unrepairable tank. Considerable work {{has been carried out}} on this problem with varying degree of success. However, the results are largely directed toward response rather than failure prediction. The information on failure mechanisms is very limited. The present work consists of scale model testing, correlation with existing analysis and failure prediction with laboratory verification. The scale model testing incorporates dynamic similarity of the fluid/structure interaction problem. The model study shows that small plastic models can be useful in studying the dynamics and buckling of liquid-filled tanks under ground excitation even though the model does not display complete similitude, The buckling criterion proposed in this study is based upon static considerations and the complex stress field in the shell wall is supplanted by a simple field for which analytical/ experimental results are available. Harmonic buckling tests demonstrate that the static buckling criterion is satisfactory even though the prebuckling stress field is time dependent, The harmonic buckling tests, when correlated with the stresses from a response analysis, also indicate that the buckling is largely dependent upon the n= 1 response, Transient buckling tests are also carried out and the results show that the linear analysis together with the static buckling criterion gives a good prediction of the failure of a full fluid-filled tank. The test parameters in these buckling tests include water depth, title angle, thickness of tank wall, top end condition, ground excitation pattern, etc. In addition, buckling tests of unanchored tanks are conducted to study the influence of changing the anchorage of the tank base. An analytical model is suggested to predict the response of an unanchored tank due to overturning moment. The current design criterion of an unanchored tank is also. assessed in this study.

40|$|The {{performance}} of coastal infrastructure {{is threatened by}} natural hazards such as hurricanes and floods. The intensity and frequency {{of many of these}} climate related hazards are expected to be influenced by climate change, which will add uncertainty to the {{performance of}} coastal infrastructure. Furthermore, coastal regions are experiencing rapid population growth, which is expected to continue in the future as well. Therefore, in view of multiple hazards, uncertainty due to climate change, and increasing coastal population, comprehensive performance assessment of regional portfolio of coastal infrastructure is essential for managing the existing infrastructure and ensuring adequate performance after extreme events such as hurricanes and earthquakes. Therefore, this study focuses on the development of a methodology and supporting tools {{that can be used to}} facilitate comprehensive multi-hazard performance assessment of regional portfolios of costal infrastructure. Particularly, this study focuses on <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> (ASTs) and bridges since they are crucial components of the energy and transportation infrastructure, respectively, and they have been observed to fail in past events with severe economic and environmental impact. First, in order to describe and effectively communicate the effects of multiple hazards on the performance and design decisions of infrastructure systems, taxonomy for multi-hazard combination is developed. For understanding the effects of different hazards on the performance and design of structures and classifying hazards according to the taxonomy this study develops a dual layer metamodel based fragility assessment methodology. The proposed method harnesses statistical learning techniques to enable efficient response and reliability assessment of structures with a broad range of design details when subjected to hazardous conditions. Using the dual layer fragility assessment methodology, fragility functions are developed for most common failure modes of ASTs: due to strong winds and storm surge. For bridges, the fragility assessment framework is used to develop fragility function for most common causes of bridge failure such as: scour, scour and vehicular loads, barge impact, barge impact and scour, hurricanes, earthquakes, and vehicle loads and earthquakes. This study also develops frameworks for ASTs and bridges to facilitate resilience assessment, i. e. their post event functionality and recovery time, which is essential for comprehensive performance assessment of ASTs and bridges. For ASTs subjected to storm surge and strong winds, the estimates of repair costs, repair time, and estimates of potential spill volumes due to tank failures are developed. Similarly, for bridges, a methodology is developed to assess the entire distribution of repair costs considering uncertainties in damage to bridge components, repair costs, and repair actions. Additionally, empirical seismic damage data is used to develop decision trees that can determine the traffic restrictions and their duration for given the damage state of bridge components such as columns, bearings, and abutments. Finally, in order to develop structure specific performance targets from regional level performance targets this study develops a simple heuristic methodology which determines the performance targets for individual structures commensurate to their performance. All the fragility and resilience assessment frameworks are applied to individual structures and regional portfolio of structures which has provided several valuable insights in to the performance of ASTs and bridges. The application of the fragility functions for ASTs for tanks in the Houston Ship Channel shows that tanks are more vulnerable to storm surges than strong winds. Additionally, application of the fragility functions show that mitigation measure such as anchoring tanks can lead to contradictory effects on the performance of ASTs for different failure modes such as flotation and buckling. For bridges, application of the fragility functions highlights that earthquakes and hurricanes can have competing effects on selection of column height. Furthermore, estimation of seismic repair costs highlights the multi-modal nature of the distribution of repair costs. The use of decision trees to determine traffic restrictions and their duration highlights the influence of damage to different bridge components on traffic restrictions. Finally, the application of the heuristic methodology to determine structure specific performance targets for all the ASTs in the Ship Channel shows that anchoring of tanks and simple procedural measures can significantly reduce the spill volumes. Similarly, application of the heuristic methodology for a portfolio of bridges in the Charleston region shows the framework can be used to obtain bridge specific performance targets which can significantly improve the performance of the entire bridge network...|$|E
40|$|The UK {{became a}} net {{importer}} of gas during 2004 and faces an increasing dependency on imports, yet {{has very little}} gas storage capacity. The UKs capacity to import, transport and store gas and liquid natural gas (LNG) has to be improved, requiring greater investment in new gas supply infrastructure. Construction of appropriately sited onshore underground gas storage (UGS) facilities is needed. However, local groups oppose most proposed UGS sites {{on the grounds of}} safety, citing the dangers of gas migration and rare fatal events, mostly in America. This paper summarizes 228 reported events of widely varying cause, nature and severity at underground fuel storage (UFS) facilities; the majority at USA SPR facilities. Since UGS was first undertaken in 1915, reports of 13 fatalities, around 72 injured and the evacuation of at least 6700 people are found at UFS sites. Some communities have experienced multiple evacuations. In the context of the danger posed to the general public, three of those killed were staff at two UFS facilities. UGS (including LPG) has led to 10 civilian deaths, 25 injured and c. 1250 evacuated. In other areas of the energy supply chain, casualties are orders of magnitude greater, with at least 1525 dead, 6826 injured and the evacuation of over 7000 at incidents involving <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> fuel <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> since 1951. When considering UK UGS applications, the risk of UGS and wider UFS experiences should be put into context. Worldwide, over 90 years experience in UGS now exists, with around 630 facilities of different types currently operational. Technologies used are often those of, or derived from, a well-regulated oil and gas exploration industry. In contrast to public perception, industry and academia recognize that UGS has an excellent health, safety and environmental record. Although it should not be claimed that gas will never be found outside the intended well or storage facility area, UFS casualty figures appear to corroborate claims by supporters of the technologies that salt caverns provide one of the safest answers to the problem of storing large amounts of hydrocarbons and that even in urban areas underground gas storage, oil and gas production can be conducted safely if proper procedures are followed. If gas is found outside the intended system, then after recognition of the problem, mitigation and safe operating procedures can and have been developed. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Above</b> <b>ground</b> steel <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> {{are widely}} used to store liquids {{in a variety of}} industries. The design and fitness for service {{procedures}} for such tanks are a concern for international standards and need to be continually improved upon to ensure better safety and serviceability. Several important aspects about tank design and assessment are studied in this thesis. The bottom plate material near the shell to bottom joint in the tank is generally in plastic range. It is a critical failure point in many modes of tank failure. The effect of increasing the bottom plate projection length at this joint for tanks with rigid ring wall foundations is studied both theoretically and numerically. A theoretical beam model is validated using finite element analysis (FEA) and extended to determine the length of bottom plate projection needed for maximum effect. The formation of plastic hinges in the bottom plate on the inside and outside of this joint is discussed in detail using FEA. Tanks operating at elevated temperatures (200 ﾟF to 500 ﾟF) need to consider additional stresses due to thermal expansions and restraints from the tank shell and bottom plate interactions. The frictional forces from the foundation cause significant stresses at the tank bottom. The design guidelines by API 650 standard address this issue using a factor named ‘C’ that defines the ratio of actual expansion against free expansion of the tank bottom. At present, an empirical range of ‘C’ values (0. 25 – 1. 0) is allowed without clear guidelines for selecting a suitable value. This thesis evaluates the current procedure and suggests an alternate method by incorporating the friction coefficient directly in the stress equations, instead of the C-factor. The fill/draw down cycle of the stored liquid could lead to low cycle fatigue near shell to bottom joint. The peak alternating stress (strain) at this location determines the fatigue life of the tank. The widely used API 650 procedure employs beam on elastic foundation theory to determine the fatigue life for all tanks. The thesis shows that this is incorrect for tanks on concrete ring wall. The appropriateness of using this theory is studied and an alternative beam model is proposed. It is verified using FEA. Damage due to corrosion in the form of local thin area (LTA) is a widespread problem in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> Fitness for service (FFS) methods are quantitative engineering evaluations used to demonstrate the structural integrity of an in-service tank containing damage like LTA and make run, repair or replace decisions. The mα-tangent method is a simplified limit load procedure {{that can be used for}} such FFS evaluations. This thesis uses a modified reference volume for mα-tangent method applied to tanks and reports initial results for FFS evaluations. The study also finds that for large cylinders like tanks with very high R/t ratio, the circumferential decay lengths will be smaller than those previously reported (2. 5 Rt rather than 6. 3 Rt) ...|$|R
