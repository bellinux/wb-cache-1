5|$|Nightcrawler is a 2014 American thriller film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Dan Gilroy. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Lou Bloom, a stringer who records violent events late at night in Los Angeles, and sells the footage to a local television news station. Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton also star. <b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> in the film is the symbiotic relationship between unethical journalism and consumer demand.|$|E
5|$|The sea plays a {{major role}} in Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, {{describing}} the ten-year voyage of the Greek hero Odysseus who struggles to return home across the sea, encountering sea monsters along the way. In the Middle Ages, the sea appears in romances such as the Tristan legend, with motifs such as mythical islands and self-propelled ships. Pilgrimage is <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> in stories and poems such as The Book of Margery Kempe.|$|E

5|$|Travel is <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> in American {{autobiography}} as a whole; McPherson {{writes that}} it {{is something of a}} national myth to Americans as a people. This is also the case for African-American autobiography, which {{has its roots in the}} slave narrative. The Heart of a Woman has three primary settings—the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Egypt—and two secondary ones—London and Accra.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> in Humphrey de Bohun's actions was his fierce {{protection}} {{of what he}} regarded as his feudal privileges. His career was marked by turbulence and political strife, particularly in the Marches of Wales, but eventually he left a legacy of consolidated possessions there. In 1297, {{at the height of}} the conflict between Edward I and rebellious barons, the king had actively tried to undermine Hereford's authority in the Marches, but failed due to the good relations the earl enjoyed with the local men.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> in {{the fantasy}} genre is {{the battle between}} good and evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> {{throughout}} Zobel's work is {{the issue}} of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account {{presented}} as a parody of the game designer Peter Molyneux. Created by game artist Adam Capone in 2009, it posts audacious game design ideas {{in the style of}} Molyneux. The account presents Molyneux as a tragicomic character with unrelenting, creative ideas that are continually received by an apathetic audience. Over time, the account evolved from a Molyneux-based persona into a list of potential game concepts. <b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> of the tweets is the untapped potential of emotional game experiences. Molyneux came to appreciate the parody, and has since met Capone in person.|$|E
5|$|The poet Eka Budianta {{notes that}} <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> in Soeman's works was the {{strength}} of love {{and its ability to}} overcome obstacles. Soeman wrote of the power of romance and marriage for love in response to the treatment of women in adat (traditional) culture. Among the Malays of Riau, arranged marriages were common, and women would sometimes be married to men older than their father. Before marriage, young women would be secluded and unable to interact with any men except for the ones chosen to be their husbands. Similarly, Soeman used Kasih Tak Terlarai to criticize the mistreatment of orphans after adoption.|$|E

5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. This episode {{is a series of}} short stories—concerning BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), Finn and Jake, Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch), the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), and Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Pendleton Ward)—all {{centered}} on <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> of the five senses, hosted by a mysterious man named Cuber from the future.|$|E
5|$|The sermon {{relies on}} scripture to emphasise the divine will in calling people {{to serve their}} fellow men, which is <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> in Swift's sermons. This calling, as Swift claims, is based on {{historical}} events that reinforce scripture and allow mankind to know of the divine will. In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are parallel to each other, and England may soon be entering into a decline. However, Swift emphasises that man is imperfect, and that sin is a symbol of this imperfectness.|$|E
5|$|Thom {{wished to}} examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He {{believed}} that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. <b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge {{on the other side}} for a 'double sunset'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a hypothetical site, one the day before the summer solstice and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.|$|E
25|$|The griffin (Greek: γρύφων, grýphōn), {{a legendary}} {{creature}} {{with the body}} of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle, is <b>a</b> <b>common</b> heraldic <b>theme</b> of Central Asia.|$|R

5|$|According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived {{between the}} times of King Solomon {{and the time of}} Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic {{commentators}} viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept for a hundred years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr {{to be one of the}} prophets. However, Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar (predestination). Ibn Hazm, al-Samaw'al and other scholars put forth the view that Uzair (or one of his disciples) falsified the Torah, and this claim became <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> in Islamic polemics against the Bible. Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra, an apocryphal text which seems to have been partially known to Muslim readers.|$|E
5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E
5|$|Kidnapping is also <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> in such folklore. Encantados {{are said}} to be fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, {{children}} born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among {{people who live in the}} Amazon river area that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water-bodies alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, although in fact, the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.|$|E
50|$|The {{style is}} early Gothic, {{suggesting}} it was {{painted in the}} late thirteenth century. Its main part depicts the Last Supper, <b>a</b> fairly <b>common</b> <b>theme</b> for what {{is regarded as a}} typical, if rare, piece of village church art.|$|R
