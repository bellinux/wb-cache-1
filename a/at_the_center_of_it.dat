500|$|Matejko {{combined}} {{three key}} {{parts of the}} battle into one tableau: an opportunistic attack by German knight Kökeritz on Jagiełło, {{the death of the}} Grand Master, and the taking of the Teutonic camp (in the top left corner). Unlike many other paintings of battles, the Battle of Grunwald does not separate the viewer from the action; instead it places him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Matejko said he felt like a [...] "possessed man" [...] while he made the painting.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} that Loeb had taken advice from a [...] "number of real Wall Street movers and shakers" [...] to ensure [...] "horrifying accuracy" [...] for the film's script. Of the re-writes done to script, Stone said: [...] "We sort of started over {{with the story of}} a young man who is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and how he needs Gordon Gekko's help to navigate those waters." [...] In a reference to the GEICO Gecko commercial, which was suggested by New York Governor David Paterson, Gekko says [...] "even a caveman could do it" [...] in the movie. At the request of Mulligan and LaBeouf, the filmmaker cut some dialogue from the character's break-up scenes, which he at first was initially hesitant to do.|$|E
500|$|For {{her work}} as Sue Ellen, Gray was {{nominated}} for a Primetime Emmy Award in the category [...] "Best Actress in a Drama Series" [...] in 1981 (Barbara Bel Geddes who played Miss Ellie Ewing was also nominated in that category for Dallas that year). Gray was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of [...] "Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama" [...] respectively. The character of Sue Ellen was well received by television critics. The Biography Channel said, [...] "Who could ever forget Dallas with the gin-swilling Sue Ellen Ewing, replete with shoulder pads long before Dynasty, staggering around Southfork Ranch with a permanently tearful expression as she suffered the brunt of J.R. Ewing's evil ways?" [...] The Boulevard Magazine said, It may be 2009 and seventeen years since the primetime drama Dallas went off the air, but memories of the Ewing family still linger. Corruption and betrayal, lies, greed, affairs and scandal – all were just part of another day at the Southfork Ranch. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all was one of our favorite Ewings, the person we couldn't help but root for each week as she drank and slept her way through one ordeal after another. This, of course, was the tortured and (sometimes) villainous Sue Ellen Shepard Ewing, former Texas beauty queen and trophy wife of the womanizing rogue J.R. Ewing, played to perfection by actress Linda Gray.|$|E
