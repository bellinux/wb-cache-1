50|$|<b>Anode</b> <b>effect</b> is a {{situation}} where too many gas bubbles form {{to the bottom of the}} anode and join together forming a layer. This increases the resistance of the cell when smaller areas of the electrolyte touch the anode. These areas of the electrolyte and anode heat up when the density of the electric current of the cell focuses to go through only them. This heats up the gas layer and causes it to expand thus further reducing the surface area where electrolyte and anode are in contact with each other. <b>Anode</b> <b>effect</b> decreases the energy-efficiency and the aluminium production of the cell. It also induces the formation of tetrafluoromethane (CF4) in significant quantities, increased formation of CO and to lesser extent also causes the formation of hexafluoroethane (C2F6). CF4 and C2F6 are CFCs which, although not detrimental to the ozone layer, are still potent greenhouse gases. <b>Anode</b> <b>effect</b> is mainly a problem in Söderberg technology cells, not in prebake.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two primary}} {{technologies}} using the Hall-Héroult process: Söderberg technology and prebake technology.In Söderberg or self-baking anodes using cells, {{there is a}} single anode per electrolysis cell. The anode is in a frame and as the bottom of the anode turns mainly into CO2 during the electrolysis the anode loses mass and being amorphous it slowly sinks within its frame. More material {{to the top of the}} anode is continuously added in the form of briquettes made from coke and pitch. The lost heat from the smelting operation is used to bake the briquettes into the carbon form required for reaction with alumina. This baking process in Söderberg anodes during electrolysis releases more carcinogenic PAHs and other pollutants than electrolysis with prebaked anodes and partially for this reason prebaked anodes using cells have become more common in aluminum industry. More alumina is added to the electrolyte from the sides of the Söderberg anode after the crust on top of the electrolyte mixture is broken.Prebake technology is named after its anodes, which are baked in very large gas-fired ovens at high temperature before being lowered by various heavy industrial lifting systems into the electrolytic solution. There usually are 24 prebaked anodes in two rows in one cell. Each anode is lowered vertically and individually by a computer as the bottom surfaces of the anodes are eaten away during the electrolysis. Compared to Söderberg anodes computer controlled prebaked anodes can be brought closer to the molten aluminium layer at the bottom of the cell without any of them touching the layer and interfering with the electrolysis. This smaller distance decreases the resistance caused by the electrolyte mixture and increases the efficiency of prebaked anodes over Söderberg anodes. Prebake technology also has much lower risk of the <b>anode</b> <b>effect</b> (see below) happening, but cells using it are more expensive to build and labor-intensive to use as each prebaked anode in a cell needs to be removed and replaced once it has been used. Alumina is added to the electrolyte from between the anodes in prebake technology using cells.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{aluminum}} {{industry is}} continually {{working to improve}} production efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and enhance environmental performance. As part of EPA's Voluntary Aluminum Industrial Partnership (VAIP) Program, eleven U. S. primary producers are focusing on reducing the duration and frequency of <b>anode</b> <b>effects</b> (AEs), which reduce production efficiency and generate two perfluorocarbons (PFCs), CF 4 and C 2 F 6. PFCs effectively trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. To better understand PFC emissions and key factors influencing their generation, VAIP has sponsored two PFC measurement programs. The results {{of the first round}} of measurements were reported at the 1998 TMS meeting in San Antonio and appeared in Light Metals 1998, pp 277 - 285. This paper reports on the second, data-intensive program, which was conducted in 1999 at six primary production facilities. At each facility, PFCs were measured from the potroom exhaust ducts using continuous mass spectrometry. Fugitive emissions were sampled from roof exhausts and measured by FTIR spectrometry. Emissions were related to facility operational parameters such as AE frequency, AE duration, and AE over-voltage. The real-time measurement capability of the mass spectrometer provides the ability to generate highly time- resolved emissions profiles of individual <b>anode</b> <b>effects.</b> This information gives new insights into the factors influencing emissions, in addition to estimating overall facility emissions.

40|$|Improvements in the Hall-Héroult {{process for}} {{electrowinning}} of aluminium have drastically reduced the <b>anode</b> <b>effect</b> duration, frequency {{and its associated}} perfluorocarbon (PFC) evolution, especially over the past 50 years. Not too long ago it was desirable {{to have at least}} one <b>anode</b> <b>effect</b> (AE) per cell day to be sure no sludge had formed under the metal pad, however, with the advent of modern process control this became unnecessary and the frequency is today less than 0. 1 AE per cell day for modern cells. With improved process control and better analysis equipment PFCs were also found be evolved outside of the traditional AE phenomena, and at normal electrolysis potentials. Albeit small in magnitude, the cumulative emissions could be substantial. To be able to visualise the phenomena in the laboratory a system with more than one anode was created. It was found that low cell-voltage PFC evolution is not specific to any cell size or technology, but can develop {{all the way from the}} large industrial cell with 40 plus anodes and down to the smallest laboratory cell with a single anode. The probability and recurrence are, however, very much related to cell properties such as the number of parallel anodes and electrolyte/alumina mixing. With a smaller cell there is less room for redistribution of current between the parallel segments without an abrupt increase in voltage, and at the extremity of one anode, redistribution can only occur by introducing a current gradient within that segment. Similarly, sheer cell size and electrolyte mixing may further enhance such a redistribution of current. With a lower possibility of redistribution it is less likely with small bursts of PFC from one or a few anodes, and the cell will instead enter the conventional <b>anode</b> <b>effect</b> accompanied by high voltage. The initiation of the low cell-voltage <b>anode</b> <b>effect</b> looks to develop in the same manner as that of the conventional <b>anode</b> <b>effect</b> with the aforementioned properties of the cell dictating if it will be a passing evolution of PFC, or if it will propagate into a full conventional <b>anode</b> <b>effect.</b> Anodic passivation potential was found to increase with alumina content in the electrolyte. PFC was in some cases found to be evolved before full passivation, and at the earliest from 2. 8 V against the aluminium pseudo-reference electrode. With the increased electrolyte convection observed on a purely vertical sample PFC was not observed until the potential reached 5. 2 V. The incipience potential of PFC is in all likelihood somewhat lower as it has been identified that some PFC gets decomposed by the electrolyte, temperature and surrounding materials. This is arguably also why PFC is often not detected until the transition to full passivation develops. Wetting of graphite under different polarisation regimes were investigated by the immersion/emersion technique. The results show the graphite/electrolyte wetting to improve with polarisation potential, even well past the potential where PFCs could thermodynamically be produced. De-wetting was observed only upon passivation. De-wetting is thus arguably not the cause of an <b>anode</b> <b>effect,</b> although it helps to maintain passivation by making less anode area available for reaction...|$|E

40|$|The work {{addressed}} the {{greenhouse gas emission}} and electrical energy consumption of the aluminum industry. The objective {{was to provide a}} means for reducing both through the application of wireless instrumentation, coupled to mathematical modeling. Worldwide the aluminum industry consumes more electrical energy than all activities in many major countries (e. g. the UK) and emits more greenhouse gasses (e. g. than France). Most of these excesses are in the 'primary production' of aluminum; that is the conversion of aluminum oxide to metal in large electrolytic cells operating at hundreds of thousands of amps. An industry-specific GHG emission {{has been the focus of}} the work. The electrolytic cells periodically, but at irregular intervals, experience an upset condition known as an 'anode effect'. During such anode effects the cells emit fluorinated hydrocarbons (PFCs, which have a high global warming potential) at a rate far greater than in normal operation. Therefore curbing anode effects will reduce GHG emissions. Prior work had indicated that the distribution of electrical current within the cell experiences significant shifts in the minutes before an <b>anode</b> <b>effect.</b> The thrust of the present work was to develop technology that could detect and report this early warning of an <b>anode</b> <b>effect</b> so that the control computer could minimize GHG emissions. A system was developed to achieve this goal and, in collaboration with Alcoa, was tested on two cells at an Alcoa plant in Malaga, Washington. The project has also pointed to the possibility of additional improvements that could result from the work. Notable among these is an improvement in efficiency that could result in an increase in cell output at little extra operating cost. Prospects for commercialization have emerged in the form of purchase orders for further installations. The work has demonstrated that a system for monitoring the current of individual anodes in an aluminum cell is practical. Furthermore the system has been installed twice on a smelter in the US without exposing workers to hazards usually associated with running signal wires in aluminum plants. The results display the early warning of an <b>anode</b> <b>effect</b> that potentially can be used to minimize such anode effects with their excessive GHG emissions. They also point to a possible, but substantial, economic benefit that could result in improved current efficiency by anode adjustment based on individual anode current measurements...|$|E

40|$|Improvements in the Hall Héroult {{process for}} {{aluminium}} electrolysis has {{lead to a}} reduction in energy consumption from 20 - 25 kWh/kg Al 70 years ago, down to around 13 - 14 kWh/kg Al on average today. In order to further reduce energy consumption, it is important to look into bubble formation on the anode surface, and the shielding effect caused by this. The shielding of surface by the bubbles is amongst others related to how well the cryolite wets the anode surface. In addition to reducing energy consumption, it is also necessary to look into reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases from the electrolysis process. One of the most important type of greenhouse gases produced in aluminium electrolysis is the perfluorocarbons. Perfluorocarbons are produced during <b>anode</b> <b>effect,</b> which may occur if the alumina concentration in the melt becomes too low. Though the exact mechanism causing anode effects is not known, it appears related to the ability of the electrolyte to wet the anode. In this project, a lab scale electrolysis cell with a weight sensor on the anode was used to investigate trends in wettability during and after polarization both at normal operating voltages and at <b>anode</b> <b>effect</b> inducing ones. The electrolyte consisted of a cryolite melt with a cryolite ratio of 2. 3 and 1 wt% Al 2 O 3. Various anode designs and carbon in the form of graphite, glassy carbon and industrial pitch and coke were used. It was found that both bubble coverage and average size of detaching bubbles decreased with increasing current density on the anode. This is believed to be mostly due to increased stirring of the melt caused by the extra bubbles formed. However, {{it is also possible that}} parts of the reduction came from improved wettability. In addition, it was found that the wettability of anodes improved during polarization for normal operating voltages. A sizable fraction of the improvement in wettability occurred in the first few seconds of polarization, but it still took several minutes of polarization to obtain the best wettability. For voltages inducing <b>anode</b> <b>effect,</b> the wettability dropped quickly and a stable poor wettability is obtained already after a few seconds. This change preceded any changes in surface roughness of the anode, suggesting that it was caused by creation of CF-bonds on the surface.

40|$|The work {{undertaken}} {{in this thesis}} addresses the use of individual anode current measurements for stat and parameter estimation and fault detection in aluminium electrolysis cells. The work has focused on different methods where measurements of anode current distribution {{could be used to}} infer major changes in alumina concentration, and possibly detect abnormal process conditions like faulty feeding  equipment and oncoming  anode effects. Two main approaches have been pursued, a physical model based approach and a pure data driven approach.   The main part of the work has focused on the model based approach. Based on physical principles and empirical correlations from the literature, several models have been developed that use measurements of current through the individual anodes in a cell as input and estimate cell voltage and distribution of alumina concentration in the electrolyte. The models are implemented in Extended Kalman Filters allowing states and a number of process parameters to be updated based on measured cell voltage.   Experimental data from real aluminium electrolysis cells are used to validate the models and estimate the unknown model parameters. The Extended Kalman Filter estimates are compared to measured outputs, and turning and robustness of the estimator for different operating conditions are discussed. In general the estimates of alumina concentration and cell voltage fit the measurements reasonably well for the available measurement data. The performance and robustness of the Kalman Filter depend on how well the Kalman Filter gain matrix is tuned to blen model and measurement information, as well as the identifiable and observability of the parameters and the states given the available input and measurement data. All states and parameters can rarely be estimated simultaneously, an in practice we must determine what states and / or parameters to estimate based on the available data.   The experimental data typically involve some manipulation of feed rate to excite the concentration of the raw material alumina outside of the normal operating fange, and provoke an abnormal condition known as <b>anode</b> <b>effect.</b> The data have been used to study the performance of the Kalman Filter in situations where the actual feed rate of alumina in the cell is different from what is assumed by the process control system. When the inout feed rate to the model is faulty, updating the model states or a few chosen model parameters from the measured cell voltage (or cell resistance) can significantly improve the estimates of alumina concentration. This can be used to detect faulty input feed rate and abnormal changes in alumina concentration distribution in the cell. The results suggest that using the Kalman Filter to generate faults, anode effects in the experimental data could be detected 10 - 20 minutes ahead.   Detection of anode effects and abnormal distribution of alumina concentration has also been studied using the data based fault detection method Principle Component Analysis. This method also shows some potential for improved detection of <b>anode</b> <b>effect,</b> but in general, detection is closer to the oncoming <b>anode</b> <b>effect</b> than for the model based approach. A weakness of data based methods is that they in general cannot explain variation in the data not represented by the training data, and therefore the frequency of false alarms can be high. An advantage with the model based approach is that this method can relate the abnormal situation directly to a specific parameter or state (s), thereby giving a better indication of the cause of the fault. Only faults related to abnormal feed rates are evaluated here, and further work are necessary to assess the robustness and performance for the two methods with other common operating conditions and faults in the data.

40|$|During {{two-phase}} electrolysis processes, {{for example}} for hydrogen production, there are bubbles which are created at&# 13; electrodes. This implies a great vertical motion {{source in the}} normal earth gravity field and then a quite important&# 13; natural two-phase convection. All other fields are then affected. Heat, mass and electricity transfers are modified due&# 13; to both bubbles screening (at surface and in volume) and to bubbles transport promotion. Many numerical modeling&# 13; for two-phase processes such as kerosene pulverization in engines or coal combustion sciences have shown the&# 13; difficulties of these multi-physics processes. Both particles and reactor scales must be considered according with a&# 13; strong coupling modeling. In these processes the particles injection is “in the flow”. In boiling or electrolysis&# 13; processes, a new difficulty is added: particles birth or injection is strongly coupled to the local flow properties and&# 13; leads to a complex boundary condition at surfaces. Electrical and electrochemical properties and processes are&# 13; disturbed. This disturbance {{can lead to the}} modification of the local current density and to <b>anode</b> <b>effects</b> for example. &# 13; There is few works concerning the local modelling of electrochemical processes during a two-phase electrolysis&# 13; process. There are also few local experimental measurements in term of chemical composition, temperature or current&# 13; density which will allow the numerical calculations validation. The present work shows the started numerical&# 13; modeling strategy and the first results, both experimental and numerical obtained...|$|R

Late pulses occurring in PMTs are attributed to the photoelectron backscattering and distinguished from pulses due to an <b>anode</b> glow <b>effect.</b> The late pulses are measured {{in a number of}} PMTs and HPs with various photocathode sizes covering 1 - 50 cm range and different types of the first dynode materials and construction designs. It is shown that the late pulses are a generic feature of all vacuum photodetectors - PMTs and PHs and they don't deteriorate dramatically amplitude and timing responses of vacuum phototubes...|$|R
