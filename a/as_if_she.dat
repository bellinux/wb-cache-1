In between cuts, they are shown in bed caressing each other. Johansson jumps into a pool outside the house, and floats below the surface <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is drowning. Timberlake runs out and pulls her up; she laughs at Timberlake and kisses him.|$|E
5|$|Father McCue (Arnie Walters) {{contacts}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and asks}} for her help in the case. Scully visits the Kernofs, and learns that Dara was adopted six years earlier. Due to her severe spinal deformities, there is no explanation as to how Dara {{walked out of the}} house. Lance is convinced that it was the Devil that stood over her in the street. Scully examines Dara's body with a pathologist Vicki Belon (Lorraine Landry), who notes her surgically removed extra fingers. Belon reluctantly proposes that the girl was struck down by God, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was a mistake.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Ye Qianyu met {{the dancer}} Dai Ailian in Hong Kong. An {{overseas}} Chinese born in Trinidad, Dai {{had come to}} Hong Kong to support the war effort. Although Dai could not speak Chinese and Ye spoke little English, {{they fell in love}} and got married within a few weeks. Soong Ching-ling, the widow of President Sun Yat-sen, presided over their wedding. Because of a botched surgery in Hong Kong, Dai was unable to have children. According to Ye Qianyu's daughter Mingming, who lived with her father and was initially hostile to her stepmother, Dai treated her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been her own child.|$|E

5|$|The Balaramayana {{mentions}} {{that after the}} war, Trijata accompanies Sita to her kingdom Ayodhya in the Pushpaka Vimana; Rama uses the Pushpaka Vimana to return to Ayodhya. In the Ananda Ramayana, both Trijata and Sarama journey to Ayodhya in the Pushpaka Vimana. Later, when Sita visits Lanka, she tells Sarama to treat Trijata <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would her. The Kakawin Ramayana mentions how Trijata is honoured with rich gifts by Sita at Ayodhya as her loyal companion and solace, {{and the one who}} saved her life twice.|$|E

Upon {{returning}} home, Pardi calls Abdul Sidik and asks him to take Tati in <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were his daughter and educate her. Tati is a fast learner, and is soon comparable to any woman from a wealthy family.|$|E
5|$|Claire goes on {{a miserable}} double date with Vicky and her boyfriend Ethan (Travis Schuldt), and his ill-mannered friend Benny (Bailey Chase). With Kevin still away, Noah calls Claire over to help him cook. She ends up having dinner with him, during which he unashamedly flirts with her. Despite Claire's hesitation, she lets Noah seduce her and they have sex. Claire tells Noah that she regrets their night together, causing him to punch a wall in rage. The school year begins, with Noah joining an uncomfortable Claire's class after hacking into her computer, making it appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had {{requested}} this. Noah manipulates Kevin into hating his father, causing him to lash out at Garrett. Later, Kevin overexerts himself at the gymnasium and goes into shock; Noah saves his life by injecting him with Kevin's EpiPen. Claire receives flowers from Noah, and she confronts him about this. Noah witnesses Claire and Garrett on a date together, which escalates his obsession with her.|$|E

5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that {{she did not want to}} be late for school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, {{it is virtually impossible to}} link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E

She's personally drawn to Mircea, but sometimes suspects that his interest might {{have more to do with}} her power than with her person.|$|R
5|$|The White House is {{the oldest}} {{building}} on President's Park. An {{integral part of the}} planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous East Room. With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied by the smell of soap or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt {{it was fun to}} fly on the harness, but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E
5|$|They {{eventually}} {{find and}} purchase Vanilla, who acts <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> suffers from psychological trauma. While {{on a date}} with the sexaroid, Vanilla recovers her memories of having been ordered to bury her master's corpse by her mistress. Meanwhile, Ichiro is captured by agents of the SG Corporation. Learning of this, the sexaroid leaves to rescue him, against the wishes of another reprogrammer, Psycho Candy. Captured, tagged for destruction, and reunited with Ichiro, the sexaroid finds himself ordered by Ichiro to switch places with him and escape. Ichiro then gives the sexaroid a name, Itsuki. With Itsuki's tag for destruction, Ichiro is killed at the moment his father finally recognizes him. Doll concludes with SG Corporation's scandal and subsequent bankruptcy, as Motohiko and his wife are content with knowing that they left Dolls in the world, while Vanilla and Itsuki live together in a house purchased by Ichiro.|$|E
5000|$|The album {{received}} a negative reception from critics.

This awkwardness extends into her conversational rhythm, which is angular - possibly free-jazz in origin." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E
