50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{had four}} types of brakes: an automatic Knorr <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>brake</b> system (for use with railroad equipment), a Hardy vacuum brake (used {{in combination with the}} Knorr system when pulling LTM equipment), a direct working air pressure switching brake controlled from two control points {{on both sides of the}} cabin, a hand brake to be operated together with a steam brake in case of emergencies.|$|E
5000|$|In 1957, the Magirus Deutz [...] "Muni" [...] was {{manufactured}} as Fire engine. It has permanent {{all-wheel drive}} with compensation, from the driver's seat from lockable (longitudinal differential) terrain reduction and an independently acting transverse differential lock. A trailer hook for carrying, if required, various trailers with firefighters equipment. The tires consist of Firestone 1100R20 16 PR U300 0160F, {{each with a}} pneumatic pressure of 7.5 bar at the front and 7.0 bar at the rear. The braking system is based on pure air brakes, equipped with inductor, indirect trailer <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>brake.</b> The carrying capacity of the DEMAK crane is 7 tons, the rear two support rollers, and a further support can be mounted on the side. The cable winch at the front has a maximum pulling force of 5.0t {{by means of a}} scissor pin, a cable length of 60 meters and 100 meters on the additional pulley. At the vehicles tail can be pulled max 5.0t, secured by a slip clutch. The emergency power generator delivers 3x 380/220V 20kVA. The light mast can be extended to 8.5m over terrain with three headlights each 1000W 7220V fed by the emergency power unit. The fire brigade Bern used such a vehicle. After they passed it on to the volunteer fire brigade of Zug. This Magirus-Deutz Muni is now located in the :de:Zuger Depot Technikgeschichte (Zug depot of technical history).|$|E

50|$|An {{air brake}} or, more formally, a {{compressed}} air brake system, {{is a type}} of friction brake for vehicles in which compressed air pressing on a piston is used to apply the <b>pressure</b> to the <b>brake</b> pad needed to stop the vehicle. Air brakes are used in large heavy vehicles, particularly those having multiple trailers which must be linked into the brake system, such as trucks, buses, trailers, and semi-trailers in addition to their use in railroad trains. George Westinghouse first developed air brakes for use in railway service. He patented a safer air brake on March 5, 1872. Westinghouse made numerous alterations to improve his <b>air</b> <b>pressured</b> <b>brake</b> invention, which led to various forms of the automatic brake. In the early 20th century, after its advantages were proven in railway use, it was adopted by manufacturers of trucks and heavy road vehicles.|$|R
40|$|Wheel slide {{protection}} devices (WSPD) {{are destined to}} avoid important sliding of wheels during braking actions in case of temporarily impaired wheel-rail adhesion by correspondent reductions of <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> in <b>brake</b> cylinders. Accordingly, longer braking distances and higher longitudinal in-train forces occur, potentially affecting the traffic safety and the passengers comfort. A general analyse and evaluation of these effects are the main targets of the present study. The theoretical considerations are sustained by simulations of braking process, considering situations of normal, respectively diminished wheel-rail adhesion determining random actuations of WSPD. The <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> evolution in <b>brake</b> cylinders of was experimentally determined on a computerized brake system test stand and adequately used as input in simulations. The results indicate an increase of in-train forces and a more complex evolution of the longitudinal dynamic actions between the vehicles {{in the case of}} degraded wheel-rail adhesion, when the random actuation of WSPD have major influence in the whole braking process...|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} cabin contains {{seating for}} driver and two passengers. An extended cabin with a bed was available as an option. The cabin includes upholstery and insulation. The heating system incorporates air nozzles to provide, in particular, windscreen demisting. Dashboard instruments include a speedometer and odometer {{along with an}} ammeter and gauges showing water temperature, oil pressure, fuel levels and, separately {{for each of the}} two <b>braking</b> circuits, <b>air</b> <b>pressure.</b> The <b>braking</b> system also has a separate alarm light triggered by low <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> in the circuits or a too long stroke of the air brake actuators.|$|R
5000|$|The simple vacuum system. An ejector on the {{locomotive}} created a vacuum {{in a continuous}} pipe along the train, allowing the external <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> to operate <b>brake</b> cylinders on every vehicle. This system was very cheap and effective, but it had the major weakness that it became inoperative if the train became divided or if the train pipe was ruptured.|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} of low bridges on {{almost all of}} the city routes implemented by 1927 prevented the use of double-deckers, and so attention turned to 6-wheeled single-deckers to meet the needs for extra capacity in rush hour. An batch of six such vehicles were bought from Karrier Motors, bodied by Hall, Lewis and Co. Designated the Type WL6/1, the chassis was the mandated maximum 30' length, but specially built with a longer 19' wheelbase to meet the requirement for comfortably seating 39. A 61-80hp six-cylinder engine powered single tyres on both rear axle, with <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>braking</b> applying on all four driving wheels. These were half-cab buses, with the driver sitting in his own compartment to the front, beside the engine. The two doors were automatically controlled by the driver. A smoking area was still in use - achieved by a division in the body, with 17 smokers sitting in the rear section. The interior featured bucket seats, upholstered in green leather, with generous leg room. Comparative trials of the six-wheelers with the shorter single-deckers on the East Road had shown that, based on a working life of 8 years, the increased revenues generated by the larger buses offset the increased capital, licensing and petrol costs. This led to eight more being ordered.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} verify the {{accuracy}} and reliability of the function and control strategy of the pneumatic electronic parking brake(EPB) system, a test platform of the pneumatic EPB system is designed. The working principle of the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> type EPB test platform is introduced, {{the composition of the}} platform is confirmed, including air press storage module, braking module, man-machine interaction module, signal imitation module, data collection module, and fault diagnosis module, and the function of rapid charging and discharging of the pneumatic EPB system is carried out. The results show that, compared with manual control valve, the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> EPB <b>braking</b> process is more sensitive, and the test platform can meet the test requirements of the pneumatic electronic brake system...|$|R
50|$|Other {{protective}} equipment {{includes the}} voltage relay (which trips if the voltage in the high-voltage circuit falls below 2400 V), the dynamotor/compressor overload relay, the heating circuit overload relay, and the automatic control shutoff switch. This last {{shuts off the}} traction motor controls when the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> in the <b>brake</b> pipe falls below a preset level, which prevents the train from starting with inoperative brakes.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the driver}} now moves his {{control to the}} [...] "brake" [...] position, air is {{admitted}} to the train pipe. According to the driver's manipulation of the control, {{some or all of}} the vacuum will be destroyed in the process. The ball valve closes and there is a higher <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> under the <b>brake</b> pistons than above it, and the pressure differential forces the piston upwards, applying the brakes. The driver can control the amount of braking effort by admitting more or less air to the train pipe.|$|R
40|$|A {{proprietary}} air brake-balance analysis {{system for}} trucks gathers five {{sets of data}} relating <b>air</b> <b>pressure,</b> time, <b>braking</b> force, and temperature. Each test produces a complex, color graph plotted against axes chosen from pressure, time, and temperature. A human expert can make im-pressive diagnoses about the brake and air systems after studying these graphs. I describe five artificial neural networks that are trained to ren-der a judgment about these graphs and a knowledge-based system that accepts these judgments and combines them with additional informa-tion {{to arrive at a}} precise problem identification and a procedure to solve the problem. The brake-balance system is innovative because it uses a rare approach to a real problem: cooperative problem solving and diagnostics between a knowledge-based system and a suite of neu-ral networks. Success rates are 90 percent for the neural nets and 100 percent for the knowledge-based system. The annual savings is at leas...|$|R
5000|$|The first ETD use is {{attributed}} to Florida East Coast Railway in 1969, soon after which other Class I railroads began using ETD's as well. By the mid-1980s they were common equipment. [...] Early models {{were little more than}} a brake line connection / termination, a battery and flashing tail light. As their use became more widespread through the 1980s, ETD's were equipped with radio telemetry transmitters to send <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> data to a receiver in the locomotive. To reduce the cost of battery replacements, ambient light sensors were added so the flashing light on the ETD would illuminate only during dusk and after dark. Later models have a small turbine-powered electrical generator using <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> from the <b>brake</b> line to power the ETD's radio and sensors.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the primary suspension of rubber chevron spring and oil dampers, secondary suspension is provided by two air bellows per bogie - flow into each bellows is controlled independently by a levelling valve and arm assembly that allows the suspension to inflate/deflate when {{the weight of the}} coach is increased or decreased by passenger loading. The air suspension is linked to the braking system via a Variable Load Valve (VLV), which increases <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> when the coach is more heavily loaded to compensate for the additional weight.|$|R
50|$|Railroads {{proposed}} the end-of-train device as an alternative. An ETD could {{be attached to}} the rear of the train to detect the train's <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> and report any problems to the locomotive. The ETD also detects movement of the train upon start-up and radios this information to the engineers so they know all of the slack is out of the couplings and additional power could be applied. The machines also have blinking red lights to warn following trains that a train is ahead. With the introduction of the ETD, the conductor moved up to the front of the train with the engineer.|$|R
5000|$|Modern WSP {{systems are}} {{microprocessor}} controlled and employ two stage valves that permit fine {{control over the}} <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> in the <b>brake</b> cylinders. This is essential {{to be able to}} capture and control a sliding wheel and to minimise the amount of air resource used by the WSP. When the brake is applied, the WSP first applies the dynamic brake. If that is not successful it then “blends” the friction and dynamic braking systems. If control is still not established the system reverts to friction braking only where blowdown valves rapidly cycle the air in the brake cylinders [...] Examples of this kind of equipment are manufactured by Knorr Bremse (EP compact, EP2002) Faiveley Transport (EPAC) and POLI Wabtec (ATHENA).|$|R

50|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1980s various railroads experimented with the RoadRailer concept to {{determine}} if the equipment would be durable enough to endure railroad use. The positive attributes of the RoadRailer were its exceptionally smooth ride, light weight and low capital costs to set up a rail yard. Since no flatcars were involved, no crane systems were needed to transfer the trailers between modes. In fact during one demonstration test a train of RoadRailers was broken {{down in the middle of}} an industrial street in Portland Oregon which happened to have track in the street, demonstrating the flexibility of the system. Another note was that a RoadRailer train did not have a caboose car which at the time was still required for freight trains. A box was designed with a yellow strobe light, and equipment for monitoring <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> through the <b>brake</b> line was designed to be installed in the unused coupler of the last car. Later, as cabooses were phased out, railroads moved to their current use of a similar strobe to mark the end of the train (the so-called flashing rear-end device or FRED).|$|R
