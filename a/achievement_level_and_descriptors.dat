The purposes of this study were to determine whether there are differences in the processing of males and females, or of students of different <b>achievement</b> <b>levels</b> as measured by the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC). Caucasian, English-speaking third-grade students from a large urban school district outside Chicago, Illinois, were randomly selected to be participants in the study. Students (N = 91) were divided into high (N = 30), average (N = 31), and low (N = 30) achievement groups based upon Total Battery scores of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS). Within each <b>achievement</b> <b>level</b> there were approximately equal numbers of males and females. The K-ABC was then individually administered to all subjects. Multiple-paired t-tests were used to show that {{there were no significant differences}} between the Simultaneous score and the Sequential score of the K-ABC for students in high, average, <b>and</b> low <b>achievement</b> <b>levels.</b> For males in the high and average achievement groups, there was a significantly higher Simultaneous than Sequential score, but females in all <b>achievement</b> <b>levels</b> had approximately equal Simultaneous and Sequential scores. Analyses of variance were used to determine if there was a significant relationship between <b>achievement</b> <b>level</b> <b>and</b> gender with the Simultaneous score of the K-ABC, <b>and</b> between <b>achievement</b> <b>level</b> <b>and</b> gender with the Sequential score of the K-ABC. Both analyses produced a main effect for <b>achievement</b> <b>level</b> <b>and</b> gender, with no interaction. Within the limitations of the study, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) there are no differences in the processing profiles of students in the study when considered by achievement levels; however, there are differences in the profiles exhibited by males and females, and (2) there is a significant relationship between <b>achievement</b> <b>level</b> <b>and</b> performance on both the Simultaneous scale and the Sequential scale which is consistent across gender...|$|R

Finally, children withdrew answers that they believed to be incorrect.
