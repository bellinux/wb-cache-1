5|$|The {{range of}} social {{scientific}} methods has also expanded. Social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, {{the end of the}} 1990s and the beginning of 2000s have seen the rise of new <b>analytically,</b> mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{energy levels}} cannot be solved <b>analytically</b> {{for more than}} one {{electron}} (see n-body problem) because the electrons are not only affected by the nucleus but also interact with each other via the Coulomb Force.|$|E

25|$|Extreme values like maximum one-day {{rainfall}} and river discharge per month or per year often follow a log-normal distribution. The log-normal distribution, however, needs a numeric approximation.

25|$|The {{archaeologist}} Helen Geake {{noted that}} the burials of this period could be <b>analytically</b> divided into four groups: furnished, unfurnished, princely, and deviant.

25|$|In {{the real}} ocean, the {{condition}} of helicity equal to zero is not generally satisfied exactly. Therefore, {{and because of the}} non-linear terms in the equation of state, it is impossible to create <b>analytically</b> a Well-defined neutral density surface.

25|$|Many modern bridges, made {{of steel}} or {{reinforced}} concrete, often bear some of their load by tension within their structure. This reduces or eliminates the horizontal thrust against the abutments and allows their construction on weaker ground. Structurally and <b>analytically</b> they are not true arches but rather a beam with {{the shape of an}} arch. See truss arch bridge for more on this type.|$|E
25|$|The Hodgkin–Huxley {{model can}} be thought of as a {{differential}} equation with four state variables, v(t), m(t), n(t), and h(t), that change with respect to timet. The system is difficult to study because it is a nonlinear system and cannot be solved <b>analytically.</b> However, there are many numeric methods available to analyze the system. Certain properties and general behaviors, such as limit cycles, can be proven to exist.|$|E
25|$|Instrumentation {{engineering}} {{deals with}} the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as pressure, flow, and temperature. The design of such instrumentation requires {{a good understanding of}} physics that often extends beyond electromagnetic theory. For example, flight instruments measure variables such as wind speed and altitude to enable pilots the control of aircraft <b>analytically.</b> Similarly, thermocouples use the Peltier-Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two points.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{projection model}} for the atom probe is an emitter geometry that is based upon a revolution of a conic section, such as a sphere, hyperboloid or paraboloid. For these tip models, solutions to the field may be approximated or obtained <b>analytically.</b> The magnification for a spherical emitter is inversely proportional to the radius of the tip, given a projection directly onto a spherical screen, the following equation can be obtained geometrically.|$|E
25|$|When viewing {{pieces of}} art in an experiment, {{participants}} in a solo context rated art in an improving sequence significantly higher than when the targets are presented in a declining sequence. When viewing the art in a joint context, participants evaluated {{the first and last}} pieces similarly in both kinds of sequence. Simply priming viewers to feel like they were in solo or joint contexts or to process <b>analytically</b> or holistically was enough to produce the same viewing effects.|$|E
25|$|The Gaussian {{distribution}} {{belongs to}} the family of stable distributions which are the attractors of sums of independent, identically distributed distributions whether or not the mean or variance is finite. Except for the Gaussian which is a limiting case, all stable distributions have heavy tails and infinite variance. It {{is one of the few}} distributions that are stable and that have probability density functions that can be expressed <b>analytically,</b> the others being the Cauchy distribution and the Lévy distribution.|$|E
25|$|In astrophysical {{systems with}} strong {{gravitational}} fields, {{such as those}} near the event horizon of a black hole, -body simulations {{must take into account}} general relativity; such simulations are the domain of numerical relativity. Numerically simulating the Einstein field equations is extremely challenging and a parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), such as the Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations, is used if possible. The two-body problem in general relativity is <b>analytically</b> solvable only for the Kepler problem, in which one mass is assumed to be much larger than the other.|$|E
25|$|According to Mary Guy, Public {{administration}} does not only {{focus on the}} business side of administration but also on the personal side as well. It is not just about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and <b>analytically,</b> while emotional work means to think more practically and with more reason.|$|E
25|$|The SDS {{model was}} {{intended}} as a computationally simple version of the full Baer and Rinzel model. It was designed to be <b>analytically</b> tractable and have as few free parameters as possible while retaining those of greatest significance, such as spine neck resistance. The model drops the continuum approximation and instead uses a passive dendrite coupled to excitable spines at discrete points. Membrane dynamics in the spines are modelled using integrate and fire processes. The spike events are modelled in a discrete fashion with the wave form conventionally represented as a rectangular function.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} atomic orbitals {{are those}} that are calculated for systems with a single electron, such as the hydrogen atom. An atom of any other element ionized down to a single electron is very similar to hydrogen, and the orbitals take the same form. In the Schrödinger equation for this system of one negative and one positive particle, the atomic orbitals are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator for the energy. They can be obtained <b>analytically,</b> meaning that the resulting orbitals are products of a polynomial series, and exponential and trigonometric functions. (see hydrogen atom).|$|E
25|$|Because {{ecological}} systems are typically nonlinear, they often cannot be solved <b>analytically</b> {{and in order}} to obtain sensible results, nonlinear, stochastic and computational techniques must be used. One class of computational models that is becoming increasingly popular are the agent-based models. These models can simulate the actions and interactions of multiple, heterogeneous, organisms where more traditional, analytical techniques are inadequate. Applied theoretical ecology yields results which are used in the real world. For example, optimal harvesting theory draws on optimization techniques developed in economics, computer science and operations research, and is widely used in fisheries.|$|E
25|$|Single 20– to 40-mg oral doses {{generally}} {{give rise}} to peak plasma esomeprazole concentrations of 0.5-1.0mg/l within 1–4 hours, but after several days of once-daily administration, these levels may increase by about 50%. A 30-minute intravenous infusion of a similar dose usually produces peak plasma levels {{on the order of}} 1–3mg/l. The drug is rapidly cleared from the body, largely by urinary excretion of pharmacologically inactive metabolites such as 5-hydroxymethylesomeprazole and 5-carboxyesomeprazole. Esomeprazole and its metabolites are <b>analytically</b> indistinguishable from omeprazole and the corresponding omeprazole metabolites unless chiral techniques are employed.|$|E
