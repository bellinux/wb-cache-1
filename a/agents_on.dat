5|$|The {{controller}} {{is central}} to the correct function of an Xgrid, as this node is responsible for the distribution, supervision and coordination of tasks on agents. The program running on the controller can assign and reassign tasks to handle individual agent failures on demand. The number of tasks assigned to an agent depend on two factors: the number of <b>agents</b> <b>on</b> an Xgrid and the number of processors in each node. The number of <b>agents</b> <b>on</b> an Xgrid determines how the controller will assign tasks. The tasks may be assigned simultaneously for a large number of agents, or queued for a small number of agents. When a node with more than one processor is detected on an Xgrid, the controller may assign one task per processor; this only occurs if the number of <b>agents</b> <b>on</b> the network is lower than the number of tasks the controller has to complete.|$|E

5|$|Charing Cross {{railway station}} {{was built on}} the Strand in 1864, {{providing}} a boat train service to Europe, which stimulated the growth of hotels in the area to cater for travellers.

The philatelist Stanley Gibbons opened a shop at No.435 in 1891. It moved to No.391 in 1893, and is now currently based at No.399.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} studios generally take numerous precautions {{to protect the}} health of the person being pierced and the piercer. Piercers are expected to sanitize the location to be pierced as well as their hands, even though they will often wear gloves during the procedure (and in some areas must, as it is prescribed by law). Quite frequently, these gloves will be changed multiple times, often one pair for each step of setup to avoid cross contamination. For example, after a piercer wearing gloves has cleaned the area to be pierced on a client, the piercer may change gloves to avoid recontaminating the area. Wearing sterile gloves is required by law for professional piercing procedures in some areas, such as the states of Florida and South Carolina. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in autoclaves, and non-autoclavable surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectant <b>agents</b> <b>on</b> a regular basis and between clients.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{were among}} the {{earliest}} terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection <b>agents</b> <b>on</b> plants. Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects, in turn, evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins. Many insects make use of these toxins {{to protect themselves from}} their predators. Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors. This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics. Over time, this has led to complex groups of coevolved species. Conversely, some interactions between plants and insects, like pollination, are beneficial to both organisms. Coevolution has {{led to the development of}} very specific mutualisms in such systems.|$|E

Mulder has Krycek confined at the high rise apartment of Assistant Director Walter Skinner before having the rock analyzed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Dr. Sacks, a NASA scientist, tells Mulder and Scully that the rock is a prehistoric meteorite fragment that might contain fossilized alien bacteria.|$|E

FBI agent Emma Hollis (Klea Scott) remarks to the agents that Watts failed to mention of the Millennium Group or those opposed to it in his briefing, and that her partner Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who has been investigating the Group, is absent.|$|E

Reyes says that Doggett has spent the last few years convincing himself he did not see it. Reyes believes it was a psychic clue, and now with the other crime scene, she has seen it again.|$|E

5|$|Several Jews {{and other}} {{survivors}} of the Holocaust dedicated themselves to finding Eichmann and other Nazis. Among them was the Jewish Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. Wiesenthal learned from a letter shown to him in 1953 that Eichmann had been seen in Buenos Aires, and he passed along that information to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954. When Eichmann's father died in 1960, Wiesenthal made arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of the family, as Eichmann's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance {{and there were no}} current photos of the fugitive. He provided these photographs to Mossad <b>agents</b> <b>on</b> 18 February.|$|E
5|$|Several {{changes to}} the roster were made before the 2007–08 {{campaign}} as Toronto sought to reproduce the same form as the previous campaign. Most notably, the Raptors acquired Carlos Delfino in a trade with Detroit for two second round draft picks, and signed Jamario Moon and three-point specialist Jason Kapono as free <b>agents.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, veteran swingman Morris Peterson joined the New Orleans Hornets. Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles. However, Toronto quickly fell behind Boston in the division, as Bargnani's inability to play well consistently, along with injuries to Garbajosa (75 games), Bosh (15 games) and Ford (31 games), derailed {{the possibility of a}} smooth campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{offer of}} {{defection}} is received by MI6 in London, ostensibly from Romanova, but is conditional that Bond collects {{her and the}} Spektor from Istanbul. MI6 is unsure of Romanova's motive, but the prize of the Spektor is too tempting to ignore; Bond's superior, M, orders {{him to go to}} Turkey. Once there, Bond forms a comradeship with Darko Kerim, head of the British service's station in Turkey. Bond meets Romanova and they plan their route out of Turkey with the Spektor. He and Kerim believe her story and the three board the Orient Express. Kerim quickly discovers three Russian MGB <b>agents</b> <b>on</b> board, travelling incognito. He uses bribes and trickery to have two of them taken off the train, but he is later found dead in his compartment with the body of the third agent.|$|E

5|$|The {{narrative}} of Miracle Day focuses on {{an event in}} which death ceases to occur across {{the world and the}} gravely-wounded continue to remain alive. On the first day of this phenomenon, the so-called Miracle Day, Oswald, a former schoolteacher who molested, raped, and murdered one of his students, survives his own execution. His survival draws global attention, and he subsequently is released from prison on a legal technicality. After being offered both exposure and protection by Public Relations expert Jilly Kitzinger (Lauren Ambrose), he becomes her client, which helps him gain more publicity. Following a series of events he ends up aiding Torchwood, a team composed of two former alien-hunters and two former CIA <b>agents,</b> <b>on</b> their mission to restore death to the world. Danes is killed off in the final episode of the series; when death is restored he takes one of the Torchwood team's enemies out in a murder–suicide.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal {{learned from}} a letter shown to him in 1953 that Eichmann had been seen in Buenos Aires, and he passed along that {{information}} to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954. Fritz Bauer, prosecutor-general {{of the state of}} Hesse in West Germany, received independent confirmation of Eichmann's whereabouts in 1957, but German agents were unable to find him until late 1959. When Eichmann's father died in 1960, Wiesenthal made arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of the family, as Eichmann's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance and there were no current photos of the fugitive. He provided these photographs to Mossad <b>agents</b> <b>on</b> 18 February. Zvi Aharoni, one of the Mossad agents responsible for Eichmann's capture in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960, said the photos were useful in confirming Eichmann's identity. On 23 May Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion announced Eichmann was under arrest and in Israel. The next day Wiesenthal, while he was being interviewed by reporters, received a congratulatory telegram from Yad Vashem. He immediately became a minor celebrity, and began work on a book about his experiences. Ich jagte Eichmann: Tatsachenbericht (I Chased Eichmann: A True Story) was published six weeks before the trial opened in spring 1961. Wiesenthal helped the prosecution prepare their case and attended a portion of the trial. Eichmann was sentenced to death and was hanged on 1 June 1962.|$|E
