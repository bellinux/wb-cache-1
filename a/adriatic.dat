5|$|Fisheries {{and tourism}} are {{significant}} {{sources of income}} all along the <b>Adriatic</b> coast. <b>Adriatic</b> Croatia's tourism industry has grown faster economically {{than the rest of}} the <b>Adriatic</b> Basin's. Maritime transport is also a significant branch of the area's economy—there are 19 seaports in the <b>Adriatic</b> that each handle more than a million tonnes of cargo per year. The largest <b>Adriatic</b> seaport by annual cargo turnover is the Port of Trieste, while the Port of Split is the largest <b>Adriatic</b> seaport by passengers served per year.|$|E
5|$|In the Croatian {{part of the}} <b>Adriatic</b> Sea, {{there are}} 718 islands, 389 islets and 78 reefs, making the Croatian {{archipelago}} {{the largest in the}} <b>Adriatic</b> Sea and the second largest in the Mediterranean Sea, the Greek archipelago being the largest.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 29 November 1811 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} fought {{between two}} frigate squadrons in the <b>Adriatic</b> Sea during the <b>Adriatic</b> campaign of the Napoleonic Wars. The action {{was one of a}} series of operations conducted by the British Royal Navy and the French Navy to contest dominance over the <b>Adriatic</b> between 1807 and 1814. During this period the <b>Adriatic</b> was surrounded by French territory or French client states and as a result British interference was highly disruptive to the movement of French troops and supplies.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Adriatic</b> Sea {{sits on the}} Apulian or <b>Adriatic</b> Microplate, which {{separated}} from the African Plate in the Mesozoic era. The plate's movement contributed {{to the formation of}} the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian plate. In the Late Oligocene, the Apennine Peninsula first formed, separating the <b>Adriatic</b> Basin {{from the rest of the}} Mediterranean. All types of sediment are found in the <b>Adriatic,</b> with the bulk of the material transported by the Po and other rivers on the western coast. The western coast is alluvial or terraced, while the eastern coast is highly indented with pronounced karstification. There are dozens of marine protected areas in the <b>Adriatic,</b> designed to protect the sea's karst habitats and biodiversity. The sea is abundant in flora and fauna—more than 7,000 species are identified as native to the <b>Adriatic,</b> many of them endemic, rare and threatened ones.|$|E
5|$|The Coast and Maritime Traffic Command {{comprised}} three naval commands for the northern, {{central and}} southern sections of the <b>Adriatic</b> coast, headquartered at Crikvenica (later Sušak), Makarska (later Split) and Dubrovnik respectively. These commands were further divided into naval districts; North <b>Adriatic</b> Naval Command was divided into the Kraljevica and Senj Naval Districts, Central <b>Adriatic</b> Naval Command comprised the Omiš, Supertar, Makarska, Metković and Hvar Naval Districts, and South <b>Adriatic</b> Naval Command consisted of the Trpanj, Orebić and Dubrovnik Naval Districts. The naval districts consisted mainly of naval and weather stations, and were only responsible for coast guard and customs duties.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Waldeck-Rousseau joined the main French fleet that blockaded {{the southern end of}} the <b>Adriatic</b> to prevent the Austro-Hungarian Navy from operating in the Mediterranean. In October and November, Waldeck-Rousseau was twice attacked by Austro-Hungarian U-boats but she escaped unscathed in both engagements. She thereafter alternated between stints in the southern <b>Adriatic</b> and patrols in the eastern Mediterranean once the Ottoman Empire joined the war in November.|$|E
5|$|Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet {{was largely}} {{obsolete}} at {{the outbreak of}} World War I, and over {{the first two years}} of the war the Austro-Hungarian Navy focused its efforts on building a U-boat fleet for local defense within the <b>Adriatic.</b> With boats to fill that need either under construction or purchased from Germany, efforts were focused on building ocean-going submarines for operation in the wider Mediterranean, outside the <b>Adriatic.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} this ship, Rivoli, was launched, the Royal Navy had {{achieved}} dominance over the French in the <b>Adriatic</b> Sea. Not only had the regional commander Bernard Dubourdieu been killed and his squadron destroyed at the Battle of Lissa in March 1811, but French efforts to supply their scattered garrisons were proving increasingly risky. This was demonstrated by {{the destruction of a}} well-armed convoy from Corfu to Trieste at the Action of 29 November 1811. Rivoli's launch was therefore seen by the French Navy as an opportunity to reverse these defeats, as the new ship of the line outgunned the British frigates that operated within the <b>Adriatic</b> and would be able to operate in the <b>Adriatic</b> without the threat of attack by the frigate squadron based on Lissa.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Zrínyi saw {{action in}} the <b>Adriatic</b> Sea. She served with the Second Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's battleships and shelled Senigallia {{as part of the}} {{bombardment}} of the key seaport of Ancona, Italy, during May 1915. However, Allied control of the Strait of Otranto meant that the Austro-Hungarian Navy was, for all intents and purposes, effectively bottled up in the <b>Adriatic.</b> Nonetheless, the presence of the Zrínyi and other battleships tied down a substantial force of Allied ships.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle <b>Adriatic</b> Basin, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of Permian volcanism in the area of Komiža on the island of Vis, in addition to the volcanic islands of Jabuka and Brusnik. Earthquakes are frequent in the area around the <b>Adriatic</b> Sea, although most are too faint to be felt; an earthquake doing significant damage happens every few decades, with major earthquakes every few centuries.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May, Prince of Wales, {{along with}} the battleships Implacable, London, and Queen, was {{transferred}} to the <b>Adriatic</b> to form the 2nd Detached Squadron and Prince of Wales arrived at her new base on 27 May. The ship became the flagship of the squadron in March 1916. She ended her flagship duties in June 1916, when she went to Gibraltar for a refit and then returned to the <b>Adriatic.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>Adriatic</b> {{campaign}} of 18071814 {{was a struggle}} for supremacy in the <b>Adriatic</b> Sea between the French Navy and the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. The {{early stages of the}} campaign saw extensive activity between rival frigate squadrons, climaxing at the Battle of Lissa in 1811 at which the last major French force was destroyed and its commander killed. The subsequent campaign was characterised by sustained raids by British warships on French and Italian convoys, warships and coastal positions across the <b>Adriatic,</b> culminating in the capture of several key French port cities in 1813, during the War of the Sixth Coalition.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Pirano (also {{known as}} the Battle of Grado) on 22 February 1812 was a minor naval action of the <b>Adriatic</b> {{campaign}} of the Napoleonic Wars fought between a British and a French ship of {{the line in the}} vicinity of the towns of Piran and Grado in <b>Adriatic</b> Sea. The French Rivoli, named for Napoleon's victory 15 years earlier, had been recently completed at Venice. The French naval authorities intended her to bolster French forces in the <b>Adriatic,</b> following a succession of defeats in the preceding year.|$|E
5|$|The Naval Coastal Command of the KJRM was {{organised}} into three sectors along the <b>Adriatic</b> coast of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} developed {{following the}} Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, {{in which the}} Russian Navy agreed {{to withdraw from the}} <b>Adriatic.</b> For the next seven years, the Royal Navy sought to disrupt French and Italian military and commercial sea traffic, as well as the movement of troops and supplies to the Illyrian Provinces. Command of the <b>Adriatic</b> partially rested on control of the Ionian Islands, which lie outside the Straits of Otranto but could be used to blockade the passage if properly garrisoned. To this end, the French heavily fortified the island of Corfu, but were unable to consistently maintain an effective naval squadron to dispute British operations in the <b>Adriatic.</b> Exploiting French weakness at sea, British cruisers were able to defeat successive French squadrons sent to reinforce the region and exerted total dominance in the <b>Adriatic</b> and Ionian seas.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclusion}} of the War of the Fifth Coalition in late 1809 had changed the political situation in the <b>Adriatic,</b> confirming French possession of the Illyrian Provinces and removing any threat to the <b>Adriatic</b> seaports from Austrian-held territory. It also freed the French Army to operate against the Ottoman Empire, as intended in the Treaty of Tilsit. It did not however affect the British frigates raiding in the <b>Adriatic</b> {{under the command of}} William Hoste, who was now launching coordinated raids against coastal convoys, towns and forts along the Italian coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects on}} the <b>Adriatic</b> itself were slight, the action only {{confirming}} the already overwhelming British dominance in the region. The French Navy would continue to seek reinforcements for their squadrons, concentrating {{on the construction of}} several new ships in Italian seaports that would not be ready until 1812. As a result, this was the last significant action {{of the year in the}} <b>Adriatic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} British {{deployment}} into the <b>Adriatic</b> came in May 1808, when the frigate HMS Unite under Captain Patrick Campbell arrived off Venice. During May, Campbell severely disrupted French and Italian shipping off the busiest <b>Adriatic</b> seaport and captured three ships sent against {{him by the}} Italian Navy. The French response to these depredations was to despatch the small frigate Var to Venice, an action which {{had little effect on}} British operations. British activity in the <b>Adriatic</b> was however curtailed during the year by the British war with the Ottoman Empire, which absorbed the scant British naval resources in the Eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The museum's {{permanent}} display encompasses mineralogical and petrographical collections, {{as well as}} {{a collection}} of animals, the bulk of which dates back to the 19th century. The zoological collection is {{on the second floor of}} the museum. It includes the skeleton of a Mediterranean monk seal, a basking shark native to the <b>Adriatic</b> Sea and an Atlantic puffin, a bird today native to the Arctic area, which is believed to have nested in the <b>Adriatic</b> in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, {{the ship}} was reassigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron, and had been {{transferred}} to the 8th Light Cruiser Squadron in the <b>Adriatic</b> by December. Gloucester was detached to the Indian Ocean in March 1917 {{to search for the}} German commerce raider , but was recalled on 23 May. She remained in the <b>Adriatic</b> {{until the end of the}} war in November 1918. The ship was placed in reserve the following April, listed for disposal in March 1920 and was sold for scrap on 9 May 1921 to Thos W Ward, of Portishead and Briton Ferry.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Doria, {{named for}} the 16th century Genoese admiral of the same name, was laid down at the La Spezia {{shipyard}} in Naples on 24 March 1912. She was launched on 30 March 1913 and completed by 13 March 1916. The Austro-Hungarian Navy, which had been Italy's primary rival for decades, was the primary opponent in the conflict. The Austro-Hungarian battle fleet lay in its harbors directly across the narrow <b>Adriatic</b> Sea and did not emerge {{for the duration of}} the conflict. In addition, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the <b>Adriatic.</b> The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the <b>Adriatic</b> with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.|$|E
5|$|Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet {{was largely}} {{obsolete}} at {{the outbreak of}} World War I, and over {{the first two years}} of the war the Austro-Hungarian Navy focused its efforts on building a U-boat fleet for local defense within the <b>Adriatic.</b> Beginning in 1916, the Navy began building larger, ocean-going vessels for operation in the wider Mediterranean, outside the <b>Adriatic.</b> With six of the larger submarines under construction, the Navy considered either building German Type UB III submarines under license or implementing the Type 1916 S 1 design submitted by Ungarische Unterseebotsbau AG (UBAG) of Fiume.|$|E
5|$|Between 1797 and 1809 the First French Empire {{gradually}} {{occupied the}} entire eastern <b>Adriatic</b> coastline and {{a substantial part}} of its hinterland, ending the Venetian and the Ragusan republics, establishing the Illyrian Provinces. In response the Royal Navy started the blockade of the <b>Adriatic</b> Sea leading to the Battle of Vis in 1811. The Illyrian Provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813, and absorbed by the Austrian Empire following the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This led to formation of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and restoration of the Croatian Littoral to the Kingdom of Croatia, now both under the same crown.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{participated in}} the Italo-Turkish War of 191112. Vettor Pisani {{supported}} operations in the <b>Adriatic</b> and Aegean Seas and in the Dardanelles while Carlo Alberto {{took part in the}} assaults on Tripoli and Zuara and thereafter provided gunfire support to Italian forces in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|By 29 May, the battalions of <b>Adriatic</b> Command were {{in their}} {{garrison}} locations: the 6th Battalion at Mostar, the 7th Battalion at Trebinje, and the 10th Battalion in the Dubrovnik area. The other two <b>Adriatic</b> Command battalions were deployed to Knin and Sinj far to the west. The 18th Battalion was allocated as a reserve and was garrisoned in Mostar. Main Ustaše Headquarters was tasked to recruit one battalion for duties within the <b>Adriatic</b> Command area. Home Guard battalions had a standard structure, consisting of a headquarters company, three infantry companies, a machine gun platoon and a communications section, while battalions of the Ustaše Militia consisted of a headquarters, three companies and a motorised section. Even after the establishment of NDH authorities in eastern Herzegovina, Italian forces maintained {{their presence in the}} region. The 55th Regiment of the 32nd Infantry Division Marche remained garrisoned in Trebinje, with the 56th Regiment based in Mostar. The 49th MVSN Legion (Blackshirts) were also stationed in Bileća. The Italians maintained a troop presence in Nevesinje until 17 June, and conducted almost daily motorised patrols throughout eastern Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff {{arrived at}} Portsmouth on 11 January {{to begin a}} refit that lasted until 27 February. Her conning tower may have been removed at this time and the bridge enlarged. On 10 March, she sailed for Malta to join her squadron, which had been renumbered as the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron (3rd LCS) and {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet while the ship was refitting, where she arrived on six days later. The squadron was assigned peacekeeping duties in the <b>Adriatic</b> for most of 1919 and Cardiff spent the time visiting various <b>Adriatic</b> ports or in Malta. She became the flagship of Rear-Admiral George Hope on 1 September.|$|E
5|$|Coastal Defence Command was {{commanded}} by Armijski đeneral Živko Stanisaviljević, and {{was responsible for}} the defence of the <b>Adriatic</b> coast from the Bay of Kotor to Gospić.|$|E
5|$|Conte di Cavour, {{named after}} the statesman Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, was laid down at La Spezia Arsenale, La Spezia, on 10 August 1910, and {{launched}} on 10 August 1911. She was completed on 1 April 1915, {{and served as a}} flagship in the southern <b>Adriatic</b> Sea during World War I. She saw no action, however, and spent little time at sea. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the <b>Adriatic.</b> The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the <b>Adriatic</b> with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as MAS torpedo boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.|$|E
5|$|Even without British intervention, French {{losses in}} the <b>Adriatic</b> mounted. In November 1811 the Flore, veteran of Lissa, was wrecked off Chioggia while in September 1812, the Danaé {{suddenly}} exploded with heavy loss of life at Trieste. For the French Navy, these losses were irreplaceable; French frigates were increasingly unable to escape the blockades of their home ports to reach the <b>Adriatic</b> and ensure the protection of their convoys. In early 1813 the first significant British squadron was detached to the <b>Adriatic,</b> {{under the command of}} Admiral Thomas Fremantle. This force had wide-ranging orders to seize or destroy all French islands, forts and outposts, disrupt coastal trade wherever possible and assist the allied armies of the Sixth Coalition. Under Fremantle's orders the islands or coastal towns of Lagosta, Curzola, Carlopago, Cherso, Dignano, Giuppana and others were systematically invaded, to be either held by British forces or have their shore facilities slighted to prevent their use by the French.|$|E
5|$|Giulio Cesare, {{named after}} Julius Caesar, was laid {{down at the}} Gio. Ansaldo & C. {{shipyard}} in Genoa on 24 June 1910 and launched on 15 October 1911.

5|$|In late August {{and early}} September 1943, the {{division}} redeployed again, {{this time to}} Bihać, relieving the 114th Jäger Division which redeployed to the <b>Adriatic</b> coast. The move was difficult, with several significant ambushes resulting in numerous casualties {{and the loss of}} several vehicles and guns.|$|E
5|$|In stage 4, the peloton nearly {{reached the}} <b>Adriatic</b> coast, ending in Chieti in Abruzzo {{just a few}} {{kilometers}} away. The course was hilly, with a climb and a descent early on and several short but steep climbs toward the finish.|$|E
5|$|In the Balkan frontier, the Treaty of Devol {{marked the}} end of the Norman threat to the {{southern}} <b>Adriatic</b> littoral during Alexios' reign and later; the efficacy of the frontier defenses deterred any further invasions through Dyrrachium for most of the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} summer of 1810 the French Navy made their first serious effort to contest British {{operations}} in the <b>Adriatic,</b> with the despatch of Bernard Dubourdieu from Toulon in Favorite. Dubourdieu {{was considered one of}} the more successful frigate commanders in the French Navy, and he collected the French and Italian forces scattered across the <b>Adriatic</b> into a squadron that significantly outnumbered Hoste's forces. Hoste was aware of Dubourdieu's movements and maintained a careful watch on the French-led squadron in its base at Ancona.|$|E
