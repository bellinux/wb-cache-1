Each man owned his portion, or inheritance, or stewardship, with an <b>absolute</b> <b>title,</b> which he could alienate, or hypothecate, or otherwise treat as his own.

60|$|De Lescure {{was unable}} to give him any actual {{assistance}} in his work; but his thoughtful brain, reflecting on all the difficulties of Henri's situation, conceived how much they would be increased by the want of any <b>absolute</b> <b>title</b> to authority; he therefore determined, ill as he was, to invest him with the command-in-chief of the shattered army.|$|E
6000|$|One {{proposal}} favoured by Mr. Gladstone, and also, I remember, commended by Mill, was {{the military}} neutralisation of Alsace and Lorraine, and {{the dismantling of}} the great border fortresses, without withdrawing the inhabitants from their French allegiance. The idea was worked out in a pamphlet by Count Gasparin. On this pamphlet Mr. Max Müller put what Mr. Gladstone called the fair question, whether its author was likely to persuade the European powers to guarantee border neutrality. “I will try to give you a fair answer,” Mr. Gladstone said (Jan. 30, 1871). “You will not think it less fair because it is individual and unofficial; for a man must be a wretch indeed, who could speak at this most solemn juncture, otherwise than from the bottom of his heart. First, then, I agree with you in disapproving the declaration, or reputed declaration, of Lord Derby (then Stanley) in 1867, about the Luxemburg guarantee. I have in parliament and in my present office, declined or expressly forborne to recognise that declaration.(231) Secondly, as to the main question. It is great. It is difficult. But I should not despair. I may add I should desire to find it practicable; for I {{think it would be a}} condition fair to both parties, and one on which Germany would have an <b>absolute</b> <b>title</b> to insist. Some of the most excusable errors ever committed,” he said, in closing the letter, “have also been the most ruinous in their consequences. The smallest in the forum of conscience, they are the greatest in the vast theatre of action. May your country, justly indignant and justly exultant, be preserved from committing one of these errors.” Three months later, when all was at an end, he repeated the same thought:— ...|$|E

It can be upgraded into <b>absolute</b> <b>title</b> after being in possession as proprietor for 12 years (s.62(1), (4)).|$|E
50|$|Ladbroke died at {{his house}} at Petworth, Sussex on 16 March 1847. His Notting Hill estate by this time brought in an annual revenue of around £3,000 in ground rents, a {{significant}} sum at the time.

50|$|Absolute Magnitude is a discontinued, semi-professional {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} started in 1993 {{under the name}} Harsh Mistress. However, in 1994 after only two issues the name was changed to Absolute Magnitude.

Absolute Magnitude was published by DNA Publications and edited by Warren Lapine. Although {{it was supposed to}} be a quarterly magazine its actual releases were irregular. After releasing twenty-one issues under the <b>Absolute</b> Magnitude <b>title</b> (plus two as Harsh Mistress), the magazine ceased publication in March 2006.|$|R

50|$|Six Activision-produced Atari 2600 titles {{were not}} {{included}} in Activision Anthology, likely due to outside ownership of their respective licenses. The excluded games are Commando, Double Dragon, Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters II, Kung Fu Master, and Rampage, although Capcom did give Activision rights to put Commando in the PlayStation 2, Windows, and Mac OS X versions of Activision Anthology. Ghostbusters II was cancelled before Activision could release it, but Salu released it in Europe under their name in 1992. The <b>Absolute</b> Entertainment <b>title</b> Pete Rose Baseball was renamed Baseball, presumably due to licensing rights regarding Pete Rose's name, as well.|$|R

5000|$|Historically {{the equity}} of {{redemption}} would naturally expire upon the mortgagor breaching the terms of repayment. However, in modern times, extinguishing the {{equity of redemption}} (and leaving the mortgagee with <b>absolute</b> <b>title</b> to the property) ordinarily requires a court order in most jurisdictions. For both legal and practical reasons, the use of foreclosure as a remedy has fallen into disuse. [...] Even where a mortgagee seeks an order for foreclosure from the courts, the courts will frequently order judicial sale of the property instead.|$|E

2500|$|Repudiation of <b>absolute</b> {{beneficial}} <b>title</b> of all lands: The {{majority in}} Mabo also rejected {{the proposition that}} immediately upon the acquisition of sovereignty, absolute beneficial ownership of all the lands of the Colony vested in the Crown.

Thus the court accepted that a modified doctrine of tenure operated in Australia, and that the law of tenure (as a product of the common law) could co-exist with the law of native title (as a product of customary laws and traditions), though where there had been a [...] valid grant of fee simple by the Crown the latter title would be extinguished.|$|R

50|$|Torrens {{title is}} a system of land registration, in which a {{register}} of land holdings maintained by the state guarantees an indefeasible title to those included in the register. Land ownership is transferred through registration of title instead of using deeds. Its main purpose is to simplify land transactions and to certify to the ownership of an <b>absolute</b> <b>title</b> to realty. It has become pervasive around the countries strongly influenced by Britain, {{especially those in the}} Commonwealth of Nations. It is named after Sir Robert Richard Torrens, GCMG (1814 - 31 August 1884), who was the third Premier of South Australia.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} an action for conversion, the plaintiff must {{have an interest in}} the thing converted.

[...] <b>Absolute</b> and unqualified <b>title</b> is sufficient, but it is not necessary. [...] A mere right of possession is generally regarded as an interest sufficient to maintain an action.|$|R
50|$|Very few BL {{games have}} been officially {{translated}} into English. In 2006, JAST USA announced {{they would be}} releasing Enzai as Enzai: Falsely Accused, the first license of a BL game in English translation. Some fan communities have criticized the choice of such a dark and unromantic game as the US market's first exposure to the genre. JAST USA subsequently licensed Zettai Fukujuu Meirei under the <b>title</b> <b>Absolute</b> Obedience, while Hirameki International licensed Animamundi; the later game, although already nonexplicit, was censored for US release to achieve a 'mature' rather than 'adults only' rating, removing some of both the sexual and the violent content.|$|R

Lord Kelvin's aetheric atom theory (1860s) led Peter Guthrie Tait, in 1885, to publish a topological table of knots with up to ten crossings known as the Tait conjectures. In 1893, Heinrich M.
