2500|$|The {{correlation}} between the increasing intensity of storms and the progression of climate change was discussed by climate scientists. [...] "Typhoons, hurricanes and all tropical storms draw their vast energy from {{the warmth of the}} sea. We know sea-surface temperatures are warming pretty much around the planet, so that's a pretty direct influence of climate change {{on the nature of the}} storm," [...] said Will Steffen, director of the Australian National University climate change institute. Myles <b>Allen,</b> <b>head</b> of the climate dynamics group at the University of Oxford, said that [...] "The current consensus is that climate change is not making the risk of hurricanes any greater, but there are physical arguments and evidence that there is a risk of more intense hurricanes." [...] The Huffington Post made the point that the 70% deforestation of the Philippines since 1900, as reported by the national Forest Management Bureau, made far more lethal flooding from cyclones like Haiyan more likely. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report had stated in September of the same year that [...] "Time series of cyclone indices such as power dissipation, an aggregate compound of tropical cyclone frequency, duration, and intensity that measures total wind energy by tropical cyclones, show upward trends in the North Atlantic and weaker upward trends in the western North Pacific since the late 1970s." ...|$|E
