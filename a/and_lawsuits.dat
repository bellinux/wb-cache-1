5|$|As the Browns recaptured {{a hint of}} past {{success in}} 1994, all was not well behind the scenes. Modell was in {{financial}} trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: only enough to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes. Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the Browns and the Cleveland Indians, and rented it out for concerts and other events. While the deal worked fine {{for the city and}} Modell early on, the owner was later dogged by excessive borrowing <b>and</b> <b>lawsuits.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Sports Illustrated {{magazine}} estimated Vick's {{annual income}} between his NFL salary and endorsements at $25.4 million, ranking him just below NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in a listing of highest earning athletes. Vick's finances suffered, however, from poor management, bad investments <b>and</b> <b>lawsuits.</b> Certified Financial Planner Michael Smith advised Vick from 2003-2005, but resigned after Vick took bad advice from friends, made ill-conceived investments, overspent, and otherwise undermined the wealth-building plan that Smith had created. Smith's plan was for Vick to have a net wealth of $100 million by 2010; by that date Vick was actually an estimated $20million in debt.|$|E

5|$|The {{legal issues}} of Burger King include several legal {{disputes}} <b>and</b> <b>lawsuits</b> involving the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) as both plaintiff and defendant {{in the years}} since its founding in 1954. These have involved almost every aspect of the company's operations. Depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of these incidents, the company's responses to these challenges have ranged from a conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences. The company's response to these various issues has drawn praise, scorn, and accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years.|$|E
5|$|The {{war ended}} with Croatian victory, as it {{achieved}} the goals it had declared {{at the beginning}} of the war: independence and preservation of its borders. Approximately 21â€“25% of Croatia's economy was ruined, with an estimated US$37billion in damaged infrastructure, lost output, and refugee-related costs. A total of 20,000 people were killed in the war, and refugees were displaced on both sides. The Serb and Croatian governments began to progressively cooperate with each other but tension remains, in part due to verdicts by the ICTY <b>and</b> <b>lawsuits</b> filed by each country against the other.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Pentagon Papers, {{a secret}} United States Department of Defense {{history of the}} United States' {{political}} and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1967, were given ("leaked") to Neil Sheehan of The New York Times by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg, with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them. The New York Times began publishing excerpts {{as a series of}} articles on June 13. Controversy <b>and</b> <b>lawsuits</b> followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over Laos, raids along the coast of North Vietnam, and offensive actions taken by U.S. Marines well before the public was told about the actions, all while President Lyndon B. Johnson had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the credibility gap for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration to fight the ongoing war.|$|E

5|$|Public {{perception}} of the national flag varies. Historically, both Western and Japanese sources claimed the flag was a powerful and enduring symbol to the Japanese. Since the end of World War II (the Pacific War), {{the use of the}} flag and the national anthem Kimigayo has been a contentious issue for Japan's public schools. Disputes about their use have led to protests <b>and</b> <b>lawsuits.</b> The flag is not frequently displayed in Japan due to its association with ultranationalism. To Okinawans, the flag represents the events of World WarII and the subsequent U.S. military presence there. For some nations that have been occupied by Japan, the flag is a symbol of aggression and imperialism. The Hi no maru was used as a tool against occupied nations for purposes of intimidation, asserting Japan's dominance, or subjugation. Several military banners of Japan are based on the Hi no maru, including the sunrayed Naval Ensign. The Hi no maru also serves as a template for other Japanese flags in public and private use.|$|E
5|$|The city {{opened up}} bidding for the {{construction}} of the network in 2005, eventually receiving bids from eight different internet service providers. Of these eight, Atlanta-based EarthLink and Minnetonka-based US Internet were selected as semifinalists, and each company set up a trial program in Minneapolis before the final decision was made. During this process, outcry arose from both members of the Institute for Local Self Reliance about the lack of public hearings {{on the subject of the}} network, and from Qwest, another internet service provider who had placed a bid to build and run the network, about the city's plan to be involved in the wireless internet business at all. The deputy chief information officer of Minneapolis, Bill Beck, stated that the city was worried about legal restrictions <b>and</b> <b>lawsuits,</b> which were key reasons for the lack of transparency in the process.|$|E

25|$|Many {{colleges and}} {{universities}} earlier instituted free speech zone rules during the Vietnam-era protests of the 1960s and 1970s. In recent years, {{a number of them}} have revised or removed these restrictions following student protests <b>and</b> <b>lawsuits.</b>|$|E

25|$|Curry and two {{business}} partners founded the multimedia company United Resources of Jamby in 1999. It was {{to act as}} an incubator and cultivator for new internet-related businesses.

25|$|German occupying {{forces in}} France also requisitioned SNCF to {{transport}} nearly 77,000 Jews and other Holocaust victims to Nazi extermination camps.

25|$|These systems {{differed}} {{in how they}} located the data offered by their peers. Napster, the first large-scale P2P content delivery system, required a central index server: each node, upon joining, would send a list of locally held files to the server, which would perform searches and refer the queries to the nodes that held the results. This central component left the system vulnerable to attacks <b>and</b> <b>lawsuits.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{was around}} this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by {{merchandising}} offers and, underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away. Seltaeb was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles merchandising rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrneâ€™s favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes <b>and</b> <b>lawsuits</b> which eventually cost NEMS an estimated $100 million in licensing fees.|$|E
