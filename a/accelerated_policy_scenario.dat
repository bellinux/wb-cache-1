40|$|This study {{presents}} an internally consistent macroeconomic framework {{that could be}} used as a first step toward a more comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessment of the adjustment alternatives facing Uzbekistan. The three-gap frame work focuses on the major imbalances of the economy for evaluating policy choices facing Uzbekistan. It lays emphasis on both domestic and external factors that determine economic outcomes and welfare. An attempt is made to quantify two <b>policy</b> <b>scenarios</b> (gradual as against an <b>accelerated</b> <b>policy</b> implementation strategy). It turns out that an aggressive adjustment policy would indeed improve most perform ance and welfare indicators. Two major ingredients of such an aggressive adjustment strategy are the unification of the exchange rate and implementation of current account convertibility in the balance of payments. The study also draws attention to the relative importance of external financing and the sustainability of the balance of payments under alternative structural adjustment paths facing Uzbek istan. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Recent coastal {{disasters}} (e. g., Hurricane Sandy, Typhoon Haiyan) {{and chronic}} issues (e. g., Florida's "nuisance flooding") provide numerous examples of coastal communities struggling to adapt {{in the face}} of climate change impacts. Decision-makers and the public alike must reconcile the lack of "fit" between a rapidly changing environment and the effects of sea level rise, changes to storminess patterns, and possible variations in the frequency and magnitude of major El Niño events with relatively rigid and static governance structures. Work to reduce the impacts of coastal hazards and climate change has occurred periodically in disjointed and disconnected ways in many coastal communities, including those along the Oregon coast. In this thesis, I describe the efforts of a volunteer knowledge to action network within Tillamook County, Oregon, to comprehensively examine alternative future coastal climate and <b>policy</b> <b>scenarios</b> through the use of extensive stakeholder engagement and the spatially explicit modeling framework Envision. Six co-developed coastal adaptation <b>policy</b> <b>scenarios</b> and three climate change scenarios (with 15 random sub-climate simulations each) are evaluated here through a mixed-methods approach. First, the impacts of <b>policy</b> <b>scenario</b> implementation on stakeholder-identified metrics are statistically assessed in comparison to current land use policies (Status Quo). Next, I characterize the feasibility of implementing <b>policy</b> <b>scenarios</b> by reviewing current federal, Oregon state, Tillamook County, and local regulations and by interviewing relevant coastal organizations. The combination of stakeholder engagement, a powerful modeling framework, and the robust evaluation of <b>policy</b> <b>scenario</b> statistical significance and implementation feasibility provides a compelling opportunity to inform decision-making within the coastal communities of Tillamook County and elsewhere...|$|R

To this end, two scenarios are examined; namely, a Baseline Scenario, which assumes continuation of current policy measures, and a <b>Policy</b> <b>Scenario</b> where production support is eliminated. According to the results by 2010, EU tobacco consumption in the Baseline scenario is expected to show a modest decline and a more significant decrease in the <b>Policy</b> <b>scenario.</b> In addition, the EU self-sufficiency ratio is projected to decrease in the <b>Policy</b> <b>scenario</b> by almost 14 % compared to the Baseline.

Finally, this paper suggests that the Chinese government should incorporate consideration of adjustment of the energy consumption structure into existing energy policies and measures in the future.|$|R
