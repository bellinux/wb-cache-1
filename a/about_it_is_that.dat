5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E
25|$|Another way of {{thinking}} <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the problem is not}} about the chance that the other side is black, it's about the chance that you drew the all black card. If you drew a black face, then it's twice as likely that that face belongs to the black card than the mixed card.|$|E
25|$|The axis of {{symmetry}} of a two-dimensional figure is a line such that, if a perpendicular is constructed, any two points lying on the perpendicular at equal distances from the {{axis of symmetry}} are identical. Another way to think <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if the shape were to be folded in half over the axis, the two halves would be identical: the two halves are each other's mirror image. Thus a square has four axes of symmetry, because there are four different ways to fold it and have the edges all match. A circle has infinitely many axes of symmetry passing through its center, for the same reason.|$|E
50|$|As {{was bound}} to happen, the whole story came out, and Ben confessed to everything, the bigamy; the lies, the conniving. What <b>was</b> noble <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he took all the blame on himself, and spared Arlene any humiliation, which she appreciated.|$|R

"I {{really wanted}} <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> {{the first single}} but I never thought Capitol would agree to it, and I believe <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Punch (Andrews, Seger's manager and often co-producer) who talked them into it. What I liked <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> broke new ground for us. It really showed <b>that</b> we <b>were</b> unafraid to push the {{envelope}} of what we were doing before, which was basically pretty hot rock and roll, you know, with a few ballads thrown in." ...|$|R
2500|$|That afternoon, {{after the}} formal {{negotiations}} concluded, Brezhnev invited the American delegation {{on a tour}} of Vladivostok. Ford enjoyed what he described as a [...] "natural and uninhibited" [...] conversation with Brezhnev during the tour, and his only regret <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he did not have more time to see and explore the city: to him, Vladivostok was reminiscent of San Francisco. Kissinger also saw the resemblance, noting that Vladivostok [...] "bore little resemblance to the teeming, hyperactive metropolises of Japan and Korea" [...] he had seen before arriving in the Soviet Union.|$|R
25|$|Because the {{necropolis}} of Sekhemkhet {{was never}} finished, {{it is hard}} to say which planned cultic building had already existed. The pyramid courtyard was surrounded by a niched enclosure wall facing north-west. It was 1.850ft long, 607ft wide and 33ft high. The only archaeologically preserved cultic building is the Southern Tomb, its base measurement is estimated to be 105ft x 52ft. The subterranean structure included a tight corridor, beginning at the western site of the tomb and ending in a double chamber. In this chamber in 1963 Jean-Philippe Lauer excavated the burial of a 2-years-old toddler. The identity of this child remains a mystery, the only for sure known fact <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it cannot be king Sekhemkhet himself, since the king was always depicted as a young man.|$|E
25|$|My dear friend, {{what is this}} our life? A {{boat that}} swims in the sea, and all one knows for certain <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one day it will capsize. Here we are, two good old boats that have been {{faithful}} neighbors, and above all your hand has done its best {{to keep me from}} 'capsizing'! Let us then continue our voyage -- each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above all sun -- what I wish for myself, I wish for you, too, and am sorry that my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Heather Phares {{described}} the album as more consistent than most remix collections {{and noted that}} it functions well as a record in its own right. Priya Elan of NME explained that [...] "the results are pretty much all quality" [...] {{and that some of}} the tracks are better than the original songs on Silent Alarm. Rockfeedback's Thomas Hannan stated, [...] "It's all very clever, but the most intelligent thing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it makes you think about the original in a completely altered way." [...] Pitchfork Media's Nitsuh Adebe was impressed with the album and indicated that it is [...] "surprisingly good, and surprisingly often".|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} on the scene during the rescue of the 1856 Martin {{handcart}} company, Hanks provided buffalo meat to the starving party. As the company moved from day to day, Ephraim Hanks killed many buffalo. The most remarkable thing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I had traveled that road more than fifty times, and never before saw so many buffaloes {{in that part of the}} country. There was not a member of the party but what believed that the Lord had sent them to us in answer to prayer.|$|R

50|$|This {{cultural}} movement {{is referred to}} frequently within the novels. The main points <b>that</b> can <b>be</b> gleaned <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a cult among humans, the main object of which was to wipe out unbelievers. Cult members covered their bodies in tattoos. Unbelievers consisted of anyone who refused to be tattooed, anyone who created {{any other kind of}} art (like Joseph's father, a cave painter), and anyone unwilling to join in the killing. The cult seems to have existed for thousands of years across Eurasia and possibly Africa. Joseph's tribe in the Basque region of Spain was wiped out by it circa 18,000 BCE, as was Labienus's village in the Middle East 5000 years later.|$|R
500|$|In {{the first}} inning of Game 1 of the ALDS against the Angels he hit his first post-season home run. It was his first homer since {{returning}} from being hit by Wang, and Youkilis said his wrist [...] "felt a lot better as the days have progressed. I think the best thing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's playoff time, and adrenaline helps the most." [...] In the 7-game ALCS against the Indians he hit three more home runs, had 14 hits (tying the LCS record jointly held by Hideki Matsui and Albert Pujols since 2004), and scored 10 runs (bettering Matsui's 2004 ALCS record) while batting [...]500 (another new ALCS record, bettering Bob Boone's [...]455 in 1986) with a [...]576 OBP and a [...]929 slugging percentage.|$|E
500|$|Philip Stead, {{writing in}} The Times Literary Supplement {{considered}} the novel to be [...] "a morbid {{version of that}} of Beauty and the Beast". The review noted that once Bond arrives on the scene to find Michel threatened by the two thugs, he [...] "solves [...] in his usual way. A great quantity of ammunition is expended, the zip-fastener is kept busy and the customary sexual consummation {{is associated with the}} kill." [...] Stead also considered that with the words of the police captain [...] "Mr. Fleming seems to have summarized in this character's remarks some of the recent strictures on James Bond's activities." [...] Vernon Scannell, as critic for The Listener, considered The Spy Who Loved Me to be [...] "as silly as it is unpleasant". What aggrieved him most, however, was that [...] "the worst thing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it really is so unremittingly, so grindingly boring." ...|$|E
500|$|Overall, while fan {{reaction}} to her character had previously {{resulted in a}} backlash Gilsig found [...] "tough", she hoped that [...] "Mattress" [...] would be the episode in which [...] "anti-Terri fans joined Team Terri". Asked how she felt about Terri being a 'love to hate' character, Gilsig replied: [...] "As long as you love to hate her, that's OK. It would be a different show if there weren't characters like Terri or Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), otherwise you'd be at Disneyland. It would be the happiest place on Earth." [...] Gilsig {{does not know how}} long her character will feature in the series, and has explained [...] "When Terri was created, she was created obviously to be an obstacle between Emma and Will. They needed an obstacle, otherwise there's no show. What's been fun <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she's managed to emerge as a character unto herself with her own complexities." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Harrison said <b>that</b> Rubber Soul <b>was</b> his {{favourite}} Beatles album, adding: [...] "we certainly knew we {{were making}} a good album. We did {{spend more time on}} it and tried new things. But the most important thing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we <b>were</b> suddenly hearing sounds that we weren't able to hear before." [...] Starr described it as [...] "the departure record" [...] and said <b>that</b> the music <b>was</b> informed by the band members [...] "expanding in all areas of our lives, opening up to a lot of different attitudes". While Martin recalled <b>it</b> as having <b>been</b> [...] "a very joyful time", Smith said the sessions revealed the first signs of artistic conflict between Lennon and McCartney.|$|R
50|$|Borlet was a 14th- and 15th-century {{composer}} {{whose life}} we know extremely little <b>about.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> thought <b>that</b> his name <b>is</b> an anagram of Trebol, a French composer who served Martin of Aragon in 1409 {{at the same}} time as Gacian Reyneau and other composers in the Codex Chantilly.|$|R

500|$|D'Angelo was {{dissatisfied}} with the direction of R and soul music when conceiving the album. In an interview for Jet, he said that [...] "the term R doesn't mean {{what it used to}} mean. R is pop, that's the new word for R" [...] He also found contemporary R to be [...] "a joke", adding that [...] "the funny thing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the people making this shit are dead serious about the stuff they're making. It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. But I want to do it for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album. The natural progression of soul, the next step to soul is funk".|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{song and}} third single [...] "Break the Ice" [...] opens with Spears singing the lines [...] "It's {{been a while}} / I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting / But I'm here now". The song {{features}} a choir and Keri Hilson singing background vocals sounding almost like a duet. Hilson explained the song is about [...] "two people, a girl and a guy, [...] and the girl is saying, 'You're a little cold. Let me warm things up and [...]'" [...] After the chorus, the bridge begins with Spears saying [...] "I like this part" [...] mimicking Janet Jackson in [...] "Nasty" [...] (1986). The album's fifth track, [...] "Heaven on Earth", is a Euro disco love song with new wave influences. It is inspired by Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love" [...] (1977), with three vocal lines taking place over the beat. Nicole Morier commented that the song was written from a very dark place, saying, [...] "I was thinking of someone and thinking they were so perfect and that I have all these imperfections. [...] I think what's touching <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's {{from the perspective of}} someone who feels like they really need this person just to feel safe and feel good." [...] Spears named the song her favorite from Blackout. The sixth track, [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] is an uptempo R song about sex. It is a duet between Spears and Danja, who sings the chorus with his voice distorted to sound like a decaying moan. Spears contributes a series of gasps, sighs and chants and her voice is also distorted.|$|E
2500|$|Low {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} H5N1 (LPAI H5N1) also called [...] "North American" [...] H5N1 commonly occurs in wild birds. In most cases, it causes minor sickness or no noticeable signs of disease in birds. It {{is not known}} to affect humans at all. The only concern <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it is possible for}} it to be transmitted to poultry and in poultry mutate into a highly pathogenic strain.|$|E

"Clean and unassuming, he {{had such}} a casual, no-nonsense way <b>about</b> him. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> quality that we all find so hilarious, his {{delightful}} ability to poke fun at himself and at life with a tongue-in-cheek attitude comparable to, say, Tim Conway or Mel Brooks or Carol Burnett." [...] —Nancy Cartwright.|$|R
50|$|Bruce Beresford {{claimed the}} film was often {{misunderstood}} as the story of men railroaded by the British:But that's not what <b>it's</b> <b>about</b> at all. The film never pretended {{for a moment that}} they weren't guilty. <b>It</b> said they <b>are</b> guilty. But what <b>was</b> interesting <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> analysed why men in this situation would behave as they had never behaved before in their lives. <b>It's</b> the pressures <b>that</b> <b>are</b> put to bear on people in war time... Look at all the things that happen in these countries committed by people who appear to <b>be</b> quite normal. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> what I was interested in examining. I always get amazed when people say to me <b>that</b> this <b>is</b> a film about poor Australians who were framed by the Brits.|$|R

40|$|Consider this chess puzzle. White to checkmate in two. It {{appeared}} {{recently in}} the Boston Globe, and what startled me <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I had thought <b>it</b> had <b>been</b> proven <b>that</b> you can’t checkmate with a lone knight (and a king, of course). I was wrong; as David Misialowski (personal correspondence) has pointed out to me, what had been proven <b>is</b> just <b>that</b> you cannot checkmate your opponent's king when only his king and your king and knight are on the board. The fact that the proposition you can never checkmate with a lone knight and king is not a truth of chess is a higher-order truth of chess. Now let’s consider chmess (I made up the term); it’s the game that you get by allowing the king tomove two spaces, not one, in any direction. a...|$|R
