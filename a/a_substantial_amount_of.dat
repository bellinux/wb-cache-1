In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace. Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.|$|E

50|$|Expressive {{suppression}} {{is generally}} considered to be a maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to reappraisal, it is correlated positively with many psychological disorders, associated with worse interpersonal outcomes, is negatively related to wellbeing, and requires the mobilization <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relatively <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> cognitive resources. However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts suppression may be adaptive.|$|R
5|$|As well {{as these}} molecules, {{emission}} from heavy atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances {{consistent with what}} would {{be found in a}} cometary nucleus. Although <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> water was detected spectroscopically, it was not as much as predicted beforehand, meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.|$|E
5|$|Concentrations {{of heavy}} metals below the crust are {{generally}} higher, with most being {{found in the}} largely iron-silicon-nickel core.

40|$|The light {{curve of}} GW 170817 is {{surprisingly}} blue and bright. Assuming {{that the event}} is a binary neutron star merger, we argue that blueness and brightness of the light curve {{is the result of}} ejecta that contains <b>an</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> thermal energy. To achieve this, the ejecta must be reheated at <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> distance (1 to 2000 solar radii) from the merger to avoid losing the energy to adiabatic cooling. We show that this reheating can occur if the merger occurs in a hierarchical triple system where the outer star has evolved and filled its Roche lobe. The outer star feeds mass to the inner binary, forming a circumbinary disc, driving the inner binary to merge. Because the outer star fills its Roche lobe, <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> fraction of the dynamical ejecta collides with the evolved star, reheating the ejecta in the process. We suggest that the process of mass transfer in heirarchical triples tends to form coplanar triple systems such as PSR J 0337 + 1715, and may provide electromagnetic counterparts to binary black hole mergers.

In 1951, the Supreme Court ruled that manufacturers could not establish minimum prices unless the retailer agreed to the arrangement.

Contrary to this, <b>A</b> invested <b>substantial</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> its scarce capital to expand manufacturing, including $25 million to construct the world's largest food plant in Horseheads, New York.
