An intuitive explanation could be that not all the Gaussian components should be adapted if the phonetic contents of enrollment and test are the same, only those components which are observed in speaker frames need to be adapted. Extended from text-dependent verification to text-independent verification, a rational inference could be that considering the sparsity in the real-world application and imbalanced distribution of speaker frames, it is better not to adapt those Gaussian components which contribute least in modeling speaker frames. Like we used to do in the traditional MAP adaptation, as it is uncertain to perform a full adaptation to those Gaussian components without enough observation speaker frames, those Gaussian components with minimum zero-order Baum-Welch statistics are not chosen to join in the adaptation process.|$|R

Compared to this level, we can improve our F-score by around 10 % introducing {{a small number of}} language-specific changes. This shows that, with a modular coreference resolution platform, such as BART, one can straightforwardly develop a family of robust and reliable systems for various languages. We hope that our experiments will encourage researchers working on coreference in other languages to create their own full-scale coreference resolution systems – <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>above,</b> at the moment such modules exist only for very few languages other than English. 1...|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{restriction}} of {{many kinds of}} influencing factors, the risk identification of the logistic enterprises is complex, fuzzy, and difficult to quantify completely.

Therefore finding the lecturer’s inclination to a specific type is more interesting, mainly when we realize the benefits and risks of such inclination. Each lecturer should know his/her typical methods of learning which are significant for his/her inclination to specific methods of training. Lecturer should be aware of such inclinations and work with them so that his/her lecturing activity will be effective for the participants of training. We are sure that the experience as a source of learning is an inevitable condition of successful lecturer’s work. The fact, that some types of lecturers learn from experience “naturally” and “easily” while the other types of lecturers have to strive more cognitively to exploit experience as a source of learning, is equally important. Lecturer’s ability to apply experience as a source of learning is his/her individual advantage.|$|R

30|$|The above {{equation}} {{suggests that}} the average speed of a microengine is mainly determined by the geometrical parameter X under the certain H 2 O 2 concentration, as plotted by the red dashed curve in Fig.  4 b. One {{can see that the}} Pt nanoparticle-decorated SiO/SiO 2, Ti/SiO 2, and SiO 2 /Ti microengines exhibit higher speeds compared with the theoretical prediction (1.38, 2, and 1.18 times, respectively), mainly due to the increase in the surface areas. If the surface areas are normalized (red, blue, and black squares in Fig.  4 b), the experimental results can fit theoretical prediction very well if one notices that the surface areas were calculated by a simple approach (Additional file 1 : Figure S 3). This further proves that the larger surface area of the Pt nanoparticles (as calculated before) is mainly responsible for the highly efficient propulsion behavior of microengines, although the nanoparticle geometry may also affect the catalytic activity [32, 33]. Whereas in the case of Pt nanoparticle-decorated Ti/Co microengine (green square in Fig.  4 b), the motion speed is slower than the theoretical prediction if the surface area is normalized. The surface area increased 1.42 times, but the speed increased only 1.26 times compared to the theoretical calculation. We assign this deviation to different surface morphology: the surface of the Ti/Co is unflat compared to other three samples, especially those with pure oxide bilayer nanomembrane, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>above</b> (see Fig.  2 g). This may significantly influence the nucleation of gaseous microbubbles in the tubular chamber during catalytic motion and may also influence the dynamics of the microengine when it moves with high speed at low Reynolds number. In addition, we cannot rule out the possibility of the existence of electrochemical process in the O 2 production. The Ti/Co microengine is {{the only one in the}} current four samples with conductive tube wall. Although this needs further investigation, we consider that the electrochemical process therein may be one of the possible reasons leading to smaller O 2 productivity and corresponding slow motion speed.|$|R
30|$|In the following, we further {{compared}} {{the contribution of}} atom diffusion with that of atom evaporation to the structure changes under different current densities. As also shown in Fig.  3, the diffused volume was always larger than the evaporated volume at a lower current density of 1  A/cm 2. What is more, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>above,</b> the real diffused volumes should be larger than the as-calculated values due to a further evaporation of the previously diffused atoms to the wire sidewall. Both demonstrate that at a relatively lower current density such as 1  A/cm 2, the diffusion of atoms contributes more to the structural changes or dominates over the evaporation of atoms. However, when the current density was increased to 10  A/cm 2, as shown in Fig.  3, the evaporated volume was larger than the diffused volume on the contrary. Although the real diffused volume was still unclear, we could suppose the extreme case that when the e-beam was highly focused with current density high enough, it has been experimentally demonstrated that only evaporation of atoms could be observed [1 – 4]. Accordingly, we could conclude that at a relatively higher current density such as 10  A/cm 2, the evaporation of atoms plays a more {{important role in the}} structure changes or dominates over the diffusion of atoms. After the irradiation, the different resulting wire morphologies of the wire sidewall in Fig.  1 a showed a hump-like shape, while the wire segment in Fig.  1 b seemed to keep its cylinder sidewall shape that can well confirm the above beam current density-dependent contribution mechanisms of atom diffusion and evaporation. That is, the accumulation effect of diffused atoms on the wire sidewall was especially more pronounced in the case of Fig.  1 a, where under the irradiation with a lower beam current density, the atom diffusion obviously dominated over the atom evaporation to a much higher degree than in the case of Fig.  1 b.|$|R
40|$|Let p be {{a unitary}} {{representation}} of the subgroup K of the finite group 0, with inclusion map /. Then, if /, and / # denote the transfer maps for representation theory and cohomology respectively, Knopfmacher [8] has proved that, for all k ^ 1, there exist positive integers Mk such that Mk(k(fiP)) =U(Mkk(P)). Here ch & denotes the fcth component of the Chern character, so that k! chfc is an integral class, the kth Newton polynomial in the Chern classes. In the same paper he mentions the conjecture that the best value for Mk is k x JJ Ztfc/tf- 1) !, where the product is taken over all primes I; this {{is known to be}} true for k = 1, 2 [8, Theorem 6]. The conjectured value is suggested by the rational Riemann-Roch theorem; one interesting point being that, in contrast to Knopfmacher's much larger estimate, (Mk, p) = 1 for p prime and k < p — 1. Hence for representations of ^-groups, the equation above would hold in low dimensions without the factor Mki and could be used to investigate the integral cohomology of the group. In this paper we shall show that Knopfmacher's estimate may be replaced by [2 Mk = lowest common multiple! T. —rr-f n l [i/ll 1) ] i even, i^k I (* *) U prime under the assumption that p is 1 -dimensional.

But our numerical factor does share the ^-divisibility property above with that suggested by the rational Riemann-Roch theorem. This is used in § 3 to prove a weak cohomological analogue of Blichfeldt's theorem. The proof of the main theorem occupies § § 1 and 2, and falls into two parts. We first adapt arguments of Evens [4], to show that, when p is 1 -dimensional and K is a subgroup of 0 of index r, k(fiP) =U(k(P)) plus correction terms.
