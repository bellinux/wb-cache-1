25|$|Thus we {{have the}} President of the Reorganized Church and son of Joseph Smith admitting, as well as apologizing for the rash {{statements}} {{of his father and}} other leaders in the old church, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> Joseph F. Smith of the Utah church using about the same argument to excuse the language and murderous conduct of the Danites in Utah. All we care to say is reply to both of these descendants of the original prophet and organizer of the Danite Band is, that when the leading members and officers of the church for many years teach and practice, by threats and murders, ascribed to the Danite Band, then we believe the public is justified in denouncing such language and conduct, and affirming it to be the doctrine of the church.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing of}} the album did not start until a year after La Dispute's debut album, Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair, was released. Part {{of the reason for}} the delay was the band's {{continuous}} touring and promotion of the debut across the United States and Canada, with rare tour and festival appearances in Europe and Australia. When commenting on the delay between the band's album releases, singer Jordan Dreyer said he {{and the rest of the}} band members require [...] "an absurdly long gestation period with these types of things <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to really sit down and be as meticulous as we all want to be". The band decided to use lyrical elements that they had intended to use in the first album but that were not included because they did not seem fully developed at the time. While writing La Dispute, the band had very specific goals; they projected the album to have 14 tracks and knew exactly what they wanted from each song.|$|E
500|$|For {{the final}} twelve episodes of the season, Marvel once again ran the [...] "Art of..." [...] initiative, {{in which a}} {{different}} image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being [...] "The Art of Evolution". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. On how what is shown on each poster is chosen, Bell said, [...] "maybe we'll show [...] the script or let them watch the episode and let them respond to it emotionally and see what's interesting to them. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a conversation with them about how we'd like to portray that, and then we try to lean into the strengths that they have. Some are more graphic, some are more character based, some are more composite, and some are cleaner. And that's {{one of the things}} [...] really look forward to each week, getting the initial sketches back from the artists and seeing their interpretation." [...] The art once again appeared as variant covers to select titles published by Marvel Comics in June 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Nothing threatens America, it's far away. But Eastern Europe {{countries}} will place themselves under {{the threat of}} total annihilation. Only they themselves will be to blame. Because we cannot allow missiles and planes to be aimed at Russia from their territories. We have to destroy them {{half an hour before}} they launch. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to do carpet bombing so that not a single launch pad remains or even one plane. So -- no Baltics, no Poland. Let NATO immediately ask for negotiations with our Foreign Ministry. Then we'll stop. Otherwise well have to teach them the lessons of May 1945." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Hagen {{delivered}} {{a speech at}} a convention of the independent Christian organisation Levende Ord, where he stated that [...] "we Christians are very much concerned with children. Jesus said, let the small children come to me. I can't understand that Muhammad could have said the same. In the case {{that he could have}} said the same, it would have been: Let the small children come to me, so that I can exploit them in my struggle to Islamify the world." [...] He also said that if Israel lost the fight in the Middle East, Europe would [...] "bow under to Islam," [...] if Muslim fundamentalists get it as they want. [...] "They have, {{in the same manner as}} Hitler, long ago made it clear that the long-term plan is to Islamify the world. They have come a long way, they have pierced deep into Africa, and have come a long way into Europe – <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to fight back." [...] He was because of the speech criticised by politicians and religious leaders within Norway. Some days later, the ambassadors of Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and Morocco, and chargé d'affaires of Tunisia made an unusually strong attack on Hagen in a letter in the newspaper Aftenposten.|$|E

The word came that Marilyn wanted the part <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to have Marilyn."
