5|$|By {{the time}} Heraclius died, much of Egypt had been lost, and by 637638 {{the whole of}} Syria was {{in the hands of}} the armies of Islam. With 3,5004,000 troops under his command, 'Amr ibn al-A'as first crossed into Egypt from Palestine at the end of 639 or the {{beginning}} of 640. He was progressively joined by further reinforcements, notably 12,000 soldiers by Al-Zubayr. 'Amr first besieged and conquered Babylon, and then attacked Alexandria. The Byzantines, divided <b>and</b> <b>shocked</b> by the sudden loss of so much territory, agreed to give up the city by September 642. The fall of Alexandria extinguished Byzantine rule in Egypt, and allowed the Muslims to continue their military expansion into North Africa; between 643644 'Amr completed the conquest of Cyrenaica. Uthman succeeded Caliph Umar after his death.|$|E

According to the official PAVN history, by March the North Vietnamese had managed to amass three infantry divisions (2nd, 304th, 308th), the 64th Regiment of the 320th Division and two independent infantry regiments (27th and 28th), eight regiments of artillery, three engineer regiments, three tank battalions, six anti-aircraft battalions, and eight sapper battalions – approximately 35,000 troops, in the battle area.|$|E
40|$|The {{patient was}} a 78 -year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy. His cardio-thoracic ratio was 60. 4 % and left {{ventricular}} ejection fraction (LVEF) was 33 %. He had been repeatedly admitted for congestive heart failure. He underwent implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular fibrillation. We compared {{the values of}} BNP <b>and</b> <b>shock</b> impedance stored by the ICD. The correlation coefficient (p-value) between BNP <b>and</b> <b>shock</b> impedance was − 0. 700 (p < 0. 0005), increase of BNP <b>and</b> <b>shock</b> impedance was − 0. 778 (p < 0. 0001), percent increase of BNP <b>and</b> <b>shock</b> impedance was − 0. 767 (p < 0. 0005).

5|$|In 2016, a {{scientific}} drilling project drilled {{deep into the}} peak ring of the Chicxulub impact crater, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by immense heat <b>and</b> <b>shocked</b> by immense pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; {{the fact that the}} peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, it originates much deeper in the earth and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact; that gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and must therefore have been almost entirely vaporized and entered the atmosphere, and that the event was immediately followed by a huge megatsunami (a massive movement of sea waters) sufficient to lay down the largest known layer of sand separated by grain size directly above the peak ring.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} in November 2016 that pink granite, usually found deep in the Earth's crust, {{had been found in}} drilling samples. It suggests the impact was so great it shocked and melted rocks found deep in the crust, causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings. The granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite, a result of the shock and extreme conditions of the impact. The findings confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had originated deep in the earth, and was ejected to the surface. It had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by heat <b>and</b> <b>shocked</b> by pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, originating much deeper in the earth, and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact. Gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and likely vaporized to enter the atmosphere, an event immediately followed by a megatsunami sufficient to lay down the largest known layered bed of sand, around 100 m deep and separated by grain size, directly above the peak ring. These types of sand deposits are caused by extreme water movement, where the larger and heavier sand grains settle first, followed by lighter and smaller grains.|$|E

40|$|A {{product that}} is {{characterized}} by fatigue-induced failure always suffers from complex fatigue loads, and {{the damage caused by}} fa-tigue loads accumulates with time. The existence of shocks not only directly increases the risk of failure but also affects the magnitude of damage caused by fatigue loads. This study analyzes the reliability of a product when fatigue loads <b>and</b> <b>shocks</b> are both involved. The features of fatigue damage <b>and</b> <b>shock</b> damage are investigated, and the coupling relationship between them is discussed. With assump-tions of high cycle fatigue <b>and</b> low-energy <b>shocks,</b> the effect of shocks on fatigue damage is expressed as the degradation of the ultimate strength of the product. An overall reliability model with fatigue <b>and</b> <b>shock</b> failures is developed. Two conditions are considered for the reliability model: shocks with fixed period <b>and</b> <b>shocks</b> with a homogeneous Poisson process. Three important cumulative damage theo-ries are adopted. An engineering case of actuator cylinder is provided to demonstrate the proposed approach...|$|R
