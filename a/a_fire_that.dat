5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Along the coast, large waves damaged 15 to 20boats in Falmouth, Maine harbor. Total boat {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at $250,000. Coastal residents in low-lying beach areas of Cumberland and York counties were evacuated in Maine. Several counties lost power during the storm. In Southwest Harbor, lightning struck the Dirigo Hotel, causing <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> resulted in $100,000 in damages. Winds caused a lost of telephone and electrical services in the Auburn-Lewiston area due to falling trees or tree branches. Television antennas were damaged, as were several signs, including a Sears sign. In addition, 25% to 40% of the apple crop was destroyed.|$|E
5|$|At bedtime on Christmas Eve, {{the family}} makes last-minute {{preparations}} at home, Marge tells everyone {{that no one}} can open presents until 7 AM and confiscates all of the alarm clocks. However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to wake up early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it. Bart hides the evidence outside beneath the snow in the front yard.|$|E

5|$|Much of what {{is known}} about Barbauld's life comes from two memoirs, the first {{published}} in 1825 and written by her niece Lucy Aikin, the second published in 1874 and written by her great-niece Anna Letitia Le Breton. Some letters from Barbauld to others also exist, however, a great many Barbauld family documents were lost in <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> {{was the result of the}} London blitz in 1940.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1998, an ammonia leak and {{explosion}} at the Seward Fisheries plant caused <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> {{led to the}} evacuation of Homer Spit and the ultimate destruction of the facility, which until then had been the major supplier of fish remains for Keene's feeding operation. But Keene was able to report when winter came that she had found other sources and {{was ready for the}} eagles when they returned.|$|E
5|$|Race {{relations}} were tense during the Reconstruction era, as whites resisted freedmen {{being allowed to}} choose their labor, vote, and have freedom of movement. Following <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> damaged many businesses, the riot of 1871 erupted, with whites attacking blacks in the community. The black community had expanded after the war, as people moved to the city for more opportunity and to create community away from white supervision.|$|E

50|$|A very {{commonly}} displayed {{example is}} 3YE on petrol tankers. This means <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> must be fought using foam or dry agent (if <b>a</b> small <b>fire),</b> <b>that</b> it can react violently and is explosive, <b>that</b> <b>fire</b> fighters must wear a portable breathing apparatus at all times, or if a white on black Y, {{only if there}} is <b>a</b> <b>fire,</b> and <b>that</b> the run-off needs to be contained.

5|$|The hostage-takers {{and their}} cause were largely {{forgotten}} after the Iran–Iraq War broke {{out later that}} year and the hostage crisis in Tehran continued until January 1981. Nonetheless, the operation brought the SAS to the public eye {{for the first time}} and bolstered the reputation of Thatcher. The SAS was quickly overwhelmed by the number of applications it received from people inspired by the operation and experienced greater demand for its expertise from foreign governments. The building, having suffered major damage from <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> broke out during the assault, was not reopened as the Iranian embassy until 1993.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Air Force {{aircraft}} flew 60weather reconnaissance missions {{into the}} typhoon, making Tip {{one of the}} most closely observed tropical cyclones. Rainfall from Tip indirectly led to <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> killed 13 Marines and injured 68 at Combined Arms Training Center, Camp Fuji in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan. Elsewhere in the country, the typhoon caused widespread flooding and 42 deaths; offshore shipwrecks left 44 people killed or missing.|$|E

5|$|As {{the combat}} raged {{at the head}} of the line, the {{remainder}} of both squadrons strained to join the battle. The British eastern division under Louis reached the battling Alexandre and Spencer at 10:35, the two ships locked together to the south of the main engagement. As they passed, Canopus, Donegal and Atlas all raked the French ship, bringing down all of her masts and leaving her in a crippled state. Canopus then steered directly towards the battle around Impérial, as Donegal and Atlas turned northwest to intercept Brave and Jupiter respectively. At 11:00, Spencer followed Canopus while Alexandres crew were preoccupied with extinguishing <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> had broken out on board. Alexandre was so badly damaged that she was unable to either escape or continue the action; she formally surrendered ten minutes later.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on December29 and {{continuing}} for three days, the storm system {{associated with the}} tornado outbreak caused strong winds across the Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico. The winds were further enhanced by isolated showers, and gusts peaked at 79mph (127km/h) in Tatum, New Mexico. Approximately 7mi (11km) west of Levelland, Texas, the winds downed four power poles, sparking <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> burned nearly 2,000acres (800hectares) of grassland before it was finally contained; the fire caused US$20,000in damage. In Allen, Oklahoma, strong winds associated with one supercell caused an estimated US$20,000 in damage after damaging the carport, chimney, and roof of a house. Hail and strong winds were also reported elsewhere in eastern Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas. Widespread and damaging wind gusts and hail later crossed into northwestern Arkansas, causing US$175,000in damage. Several buildings and homes were destroyed by the strong winds; similar impacts were seen in Missouri and Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{known as}} the Convict Establishment (or just The Establishment), Fremantle Prison was {{constructed}} between 1851 and 1859, using convict labour. It was initially used for convicts transported from Britain, but {{was transferred to the}} colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. Royal Commissions were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security Casuarina Prison.|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus felt Uppsala was {{too noisy}} and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, {{he bought a}} {{neighbouring}} farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added. In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants {{that could not be}} grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. <b>A</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 551, the Phoenician {{coastal cities}} were devastated by a high-magnitude {{earthquake}}. In Beirut the earthquake {{was followed by}} a tsunami and <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of Sidon, pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the Arab conquest in 635.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{is one of}} {{the largest}} ports on the United States west coast and {{waterfront}} fires have been a continual concern for the city. Since 1891 the Seattle Fire Department has regularly operated at least two fireboats, which can be augmented by ships and small craft with fire suppression capabilities from the U.S. Coast Guard, Seattle Police, and neighboring municipalities. One of the worst maritime fires in the city's history occurred in 1968 when an electrical malfunction at Todd Shipyards sparked <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> took 14 engine companies, two fireboats, two U.S. Coast Guard cutters, and several conscripted Foss Maritime tugboats more than half-a-day to extinguish.|$|E

40|$|This thesis briefly {{describes}} {{my current}} body of work, both formally and conceptually. The section titled Pattern Within Form, describes the concepts behind {{the use of}} stamps and molds, {{and the process of}} separately throwing segments of a single form and attaching them together. It also discusses the visual influences of industrial materials that I have translated onto the surface of the vessel. Process and Material describes a typical reduction cool <b>firing</b> within <b>a</b> wood kiln. It explains the differences between cottonwood, elm, box elder, and pine, as well as the comparisons between <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> <b>that</b> is shut off at peak temperature, and <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> <b>that</b> is <b>fired</b> through its cooling to 1400 °F. This section also describes my continual research within ceramic materials.
