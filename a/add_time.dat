25|$|Free Parking {{card game}} (1988) A more complex card game {{released}} by Parker Brothers, with several similarities to the card game Mille Bornes. Uses cards to either <b>add</b> <b>time</b> to parking meters, or {{spend the time}} doing activities to earn points. Includes a deck of Second Chance cards that further alter game-play. Two editions were made; minor differences in card art and Second Chance cards in each edition.|$|E
25|$|Sine Mora {{does not}} use a {{traditional}} player health mechanic. It instead plays on the aspect of time. Each level is given a set amount of time which continues to tick downwards. Taking damage will temporarily speed up this process, while eliminating enemies will <b>add</b> <b>time</b> back. Powerups in the game can provide bonuses such as shielding, extra time, and upgraded weapon. Players can choose from multiple characters and planes, and the combination of choices determines the vital statistics during play. Characters are not tied to a specific plane, rather characters and planes each have unique attributes, the combination of which determines the statistics.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Volcano" [...] {{episode was}} in {{production}} when South Park debuted on August 13, 1997. Comedy Central executives did {{not object to}} most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed because nothing happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was what made it funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt around the campfire, the flames from the fire stop moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in. A cat featured in the background of one of the outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like Parker's cat, Jake. The scene in which Ned catches fire was based on an experience Parker had during a Colorado camping trip where he tried to do an [...] "Indian Fire Trick", in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames. Although nobody caught fire, Parker said the trick misfired and he nearly burned down the forest. After finishing the episode, Parker and Stone realized [...] "Volcano" [...] was about two minutes shorter than the time length required for the episode. In order to <b>add</b> <b>time</b> to the episode, Parker and Stone added the scene with Ned singing the song [...] "Kumbaya" [...] around the fire, as well as the long freeze-frame on a shocked Chef and Mayor McDaniels reacting to the news of the volcano's imminent eruption.|$|E

Patient throughput times in Kosair’s emergency room {{have a significant effect on}} patient satisfaction. This thesis will evaluate the emergency room at Kosair Children’s Hospital through a time study. The time study analyzes value <b>added</b> <b>time</b> and non-value <b>added</b> <b>time</b> in the emergency room. The majority of the patient throughput <b>time</b> is non-value <b>added</b> <b>time</b> and needs to be minimized.

2500|$|There is extra music, {{such as in}} [...] "Hold Me Tight", to {{have more}} {{opportunity}} for things such as dance sequences. In [...] "Come Together" [...] on the special features, there is extra music for a dance solo and a well-planned [...] "Six Degrees of Separation" [...] which connects the main characters as they enter New York lifestyle. [...] "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" [...] is also extended to <b>add</b> <b>time</b> for Max's medical check-up that is shown and for the dialogue about Max eating cotton balls and other theories {{to get out of}} the draft. The extended music is used as underscoring for dialogue after [...] "Dear Prudence", [...] "Something", and [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps". Some songs are not extended, but also have dialogue, such as [...] "Revolution" [...] and [...] "All My Loving." [...] Other extended songs include [...] "I Am the Walrus", [...] "Oh! Darling", [...] "Across the Universe", and [...] "Helter Skelter".|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{taught that}} in {{conducting}} the self-denial required in [...] and [...] one adds {{a little time}} from the surrounding ordinary weekdays to the holy day. [...] Rabbi Ishmael derived this rule from what had been taught in a Baraita: [...] One might read [...] "And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth day," [...] literally to mean that one begins fasting the entire day on the ninth day of the month; [...] therefore says, [...] "in the evening." [...] One might read [...] "in the evening" [...] to mean [...] "after dark" [...] (which the Hebrew calendar would reckon {{as part of the}} tenth day); [...] therefore says, [...] "in the ninth day." [...] The Gemara thus concluded that one begins fasting while it is still day on the ninth day, adding some time from the profane day (the ninth) to the holy day (the tenth). [...] The Gemara read the words, [...] "from evening to evening," [...] in [...] to teach that one adds some time to Yom Kippur from both the evening before and the evening after. [...] Because [...] says, [...] "You shall rest," [...] the Gemara applied the rule to Sabbaths as well. [...] Because [...] says [...] "your Sabbath" [...] (your day of rest), the Gemara applied the rule to other Festivals (in addition to Yom Kippur); wherever the law creates an obligation to rest, we <b>add</b> <b>time</b> to that obligation from the surrounding profane days to the holy day. Rabbi Akiva, however, read [...] "And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth day," [...] to teach the lesson learned by Rav Hiyya bar Rav from Difti (that is, Dibtha, below the Tigris, southeast of Babylon). [...] Rav Hiyya bar Rav from Difti taught in a Baraita that [...] says [...] "the ninth day" [...] to indicate that if people eat and drink on the ninth day, then Scripture credits it to them as if they fasted on both the ninth and the tenth days (because [...] calls the eating and drinking on the ninth day [...] "fasting").|$|E

50|$|As {{for studies}} that {{considered}} {{the effects of}} <b>adding</b> <b>time</b> to schools {{for the express purpose}} of improving educational outcomes, a meta-analysis examined 15 empirical studies of extended school days and/or years and found that <b>adding</b> <b>time</b> was, more often than not, associated with improved student outcomes, noting stronger effects for schools serving large populations of at-risk students. The authors of this research point out that quantity of time cannot be considered an independent variable, however, because the ways in which the time is used by educators and students is what actually matters for learning.|$|R
