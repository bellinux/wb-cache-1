40|$|Abstract. Liver {{sections}} from 32 psittacine {{birds with}} multifocal to coalescing hepatocellular necrosis were examined {{to determine the}} cause of disease. Avian polyomavirus (APV) infection (19 of 32 birds), bacterial hepatitis (5 of 32 birds), and chlamydiosis (3 of 32 birds) were major causes of hepatic disease. The presence of APV inclusions or nucleic acid was demonstrated using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, DNA in situ hybridization, and DNA amplification with Southern blotting. Amphophilic intranuclear inclusions, suggestive of APV infection, were observed in HE-stained liver sections from 5 of 32 birds. Hepatocellular karyomegaly was present in liver tissues from 10 birds (5 birds with typical APV inclusions and 5 birds without discernable inclusions). DNA in situ hybridization recognized intranuclear <b>APV</b> nucleic <b>acid</b> in liver sections of 18 of 32 birds. DNA amplification with Southern or dot blots also identified <b>APV</b> nucleic <b>acid</b> in processed, paraffin-embedded livers of 18 of 32 birds. This study demonstrates that acute APV infection is a frequent cause of multifocal to coalescing hepatocellular necrosis in psittacine birds. Furthermore, APV infection is best diagnosed using DNA probes, especially when typical intranuclear inclusions are not observed microscopically. Avian polyomavirus (APV) (formerly budgerigar fledgling disease virus or papovavirus) infection is caused by a 40 - 50 -nm-diameter icosahedral, nonen...|$|R

The ionotropic gluta-mate N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) is critical for CNS functions, but its expression and function in astrocytes is still a matter of research and debate. Here, we re-port immunofluorescence (IF) labeling in rat cultured cortical astrocytes (rCCA) of all NMDAR subunits, with phenotypes suggesting their intracellular transport, and their mRNA were detected by qRT-PCR. IF and Western Blot revealed GluN 1 full-length synthesis, sub-unit critical for NMDAR assembly and transport, and its plasma membrane localization. Functionally, we found an iCa 2 + rise after NMDA treatment in Fluo- 4 -AM labeled rCCA, an effect blocked by the NMDAR competitive inhibitors D(-) - 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> and Kynurenic <b>acid</b> (KYNA) and dependent upon GluN 1 expression as evi-denced by siRNA knock down. Surprisingly, the iCa 2 + rise was not blocked by MK- 801, an NMDAR channel blocker, or by extracellular Ca 2 + depletion, indicating flux-independent NMDAR function.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the role of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors in synaptic plasticity in regular-spiking cells of rat frontal cortex. Intracortical stimulation, at levels subthreshold for elicitation of action potentials, evoked a late excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in layer II III neurons that was sensitive to the selective NMDA antagonist - 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV).</b> This late EPSP showed marked short-term frequency-dependent depression, suggesting that it is polysynaptic in origin. Polysynaptic late EPSPs were selectively enhanced following high-frequency stimulation. This sustained increase in synaptic efficacy, or long-term potentiation, was expressed in regular spiking cells and appeared to result from activation of NMDA receptors on excitatory interneurons. These data demonstrate {{the existence of an}} NMDA-modulated polysynaptic circuit in the neocortex which displays several types of use-dependent plasticity. ...|$|R

Carbachol {{concentrations in the}} 4 [...] 13 #M range produced regular synchronized CA 3 discharges at 0. 5 [...] 2 Hz (carbachol-delta). Higher concentrations (13 [...] 60 #M) produced short episodes of 5 [...] 10 Hz (carbacholtheta) oscillations separated by nonsynchronous activity. Concentrations of carbachol ranging from 8 [...] 25 #M also produced irregular episodes of high-frequency discharges (carbachol-gamma, 35 [...] 70 Hz), in isolation or mixed with carbachol-theta and carbachol-delta. At carbachol concentrations sufficient to induce carbachol-theta, low concentrations of APV reversibly transformed carbachol-theta into carbachol-delta.

40|$|There is {{conflicting}} evidence regarding {{the issue of}} whether NMDA receptors in the basolateral amygdalar complex (BLA) are critically involved in the expression of conditioned fear.

APV infusion into the BLA was reported to block the expression of conditioned fear when measured by freezing but not when measured by fear-potentiated startle response to a loud noise. To examine this issue further, here we used multiple indices of conditioned fear, including analgesia, 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalization (USV), defecation, and freezing. Rats with bilateral BLA cannula implants underwent fear conditioning consisting of 10 tone–footshock pairings. Before context and tone fear-retention tests, animals received intra-BLA infusions with APV (2. 5 �g/side) or artificial CSF. Both tone and contex...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The dorsal and ventral subregions of the {{hippocampus}} likely play dissociable roles in {{some forms of}} learning. For example, we have previously demonstrated that temporary inactivation of ventral, but not dorsal, hippocampus dramatically impaired the acquisition of trace fear conditioning, while temporary inactivation of dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampus impaired spatially guided reinforced alternation (Czerniawski et al. (2009) Hippocampus 19 : 20 – 32). Importantly, emerging data suggest that lesions, temporary inactivation, and NMDA receptor antagonism within these subregions can produce quite different patterns of behavioral effects when administered into the same region. Specifically, while neither lesions nor temporary inactivation of dorsal hippocampus impair the acquisition of trace fear conditioning, learning in this paradigm is severely impaired by pre-training administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist dl- 2 -phosphonovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> in dorsal hippocampus; the effect of NMDA receptor antagonism within ventral hippocampus on the acquisition and expressio...|$|R

The present study sought to explore whether signals transmitted via the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors and via dopamine D 2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are critical for the determination of reaction times (RTs) of instrumental responses by the expectancy of future reward. A simple RT task for rats demanding conditioned lever release was used in which the upcoming reward magnitude (5 or 1 pellet) was signaled in advance by discriminative stimuli. In trained rats, RTs of conditioned responses with expectancy of a high reward magnitude were found to be significantly shorter. The shortening of RTs by stimuli predictive of high reward to be obtained was dose-dependently impaired by bilateral intra-NAc infusion of the competitive NMDA antagonist DL- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> (1, 2, or 10 �g in 0. ...|$|R
40|$|The optic tecta of surgically {{produced}} three-eyed tadpoles were chronically {{exposed to}} the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist aminophosphonovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV),</b> or to NMDA itself, to assess the influence of NMDA receptor/channels on the eye-specific segregation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) terminals that occurs whenever two retinas innervate one tectal lobe. Exposure of the tectum to the active isomer of APV produces desegregation of the RGC terminals without blocking electrical activity in the afferents or altering their terminal arbor morphology. Exposure to the inactive isomer of APV causes no perturbation of the normal stripe pattern. APV-induced desegregation is completely reversible within 2 weeks of removal of the APV. In addition, exposure of the optic tectum to NMDA results in stripes with sharper borders and fewer forks and fusions than untreated animals.

40|$|Various {{synthetic}} analogues of quinolinic acid {{have been}} tested for agonist and antagonist properties when applied by microiontophoresis to neurones in the rat cerebral cortex. Quinolinic acid 2 -methylester was a weak antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and quinolinic acid, but also showed agonist activity, being about half as active as quinolinic acid. The excitant effects of the compound could be antagonized by the NMDA receptor blocker, 2 -amino- 7 -phosphonoheptanoic acid (2 APH). N-methyl-quinolinic acid 2, 3 -dimethylester showed very weak agonist and antagonist activity. Homoquinolinic acid was a potent excitant of cortical neurones, being about five times more active than quinolinic acid and approximately equipotent with NMDA. The excitations were blocked by 2 APH or its pentanoate analogue (2 <b>APV).</b> Homoquinolinic <b>acid</b> 2 -methylester was also active as an agonist. N-methyl-DL-glutamic acid was also tested, since homoquinolinic acid is a rigid analogue of this compound. Although it did cause excitation of 5 of the 16 units tested, N-methyl-glutamate was a weaker agonist than NMDA or homoquinolinate. Phthalic acid, ejected as an anion caused excitation of 14 out of 16 units. It is therefore concluded that the ring nitrogen of quinolinic acid is not essential for excitant activity. Since homoquinolinic acid is a rigid analogue of glutamic acid, but causes excitation by acting apparently on the NMDA receptor, the {{results are consistent with}} the suggestion that activation of the NMDA receptor may require the carboxyl groups to be held in a relatively extended configuration...|$|R

In superficial layers (II and Ill), D-APV reduced visual responses substantially at all ages. lontophoresis of D-APV with 10 nA of ejecting current for 2 - 3 min was sufficient to reduce the response to approximately one third of control levels. The magnitude of the reduction did not vary with age. In granular and deep layers (IV, V, and VI), D-APV affected the visual response in young animals but only spontaneous activity in older animals.

It has previously been hypothesized that potential viral and bacterial infections may be causing this disorder 3, 4. To test for this, Avian Polyomavirus (<b>APV)</b> nucleic <b>acids,</b> Budrigars Beak and Feather Disease Virus (BFDV) nucleic acids, and any bacterial nucleic acids were attempted to be isolated from the blood of affected penguins.

The samples were shipped to St. John Fisher College in Rochester, NY during the winter of 2011. Nucleic acids were then extracted from the blood using a QIAamp Blood DNA Mini. After confirmation of DNA via gel electrophoresis, PCR was performed using 2 X OneTaq Megamix, water, and primers specific to the targeted viral and bacterial DNA. Gel electrophoresis was run on the PCR products. If DNA was observed at an expected range, then the PCR product was purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit using the protocol included.

Both consolidation and reconsolidation require protein synthesis, {{but it is}} not yet known how similar these processes are in terms of molecular, cellular, and neural circuit mechanisms. Whereas most previous studies focused on aversive conditioning in the amygdala and the hippocampus, here we examine the role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in consolidation and reconsolidation of object recognition memory. Object recognition memory is the ability to discriminate the familiarity of previously encountered objects. We found that microinfusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin or the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D,L- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> into the vmPFC, immediately after training, resulted in impairment of long-term (24 h) but not short-term (3 h) recognition memory. Similarly, microinfusion of anisomycin or APV into the vmPFC immediately after reactivation of the long-term memory impaired recognition memory 24 h, but not 3 h, post-reactivation. These results indicate that both protein synthesis and NMDA receptors are required for consolidation and reconsolidation of recognition memory in the vmPFC...|$|R

The localization (presynaptic and/or postsynaptic) of changes underlying LTP has been difficult to resolve with current electrophysiological techniques. Using a biochemical approach, we have addressed this issue and attempted to identify specific molecular mechanisms that may underlie LTP. We utilized a novel multiple-electrode stimulator to produce LTP in {{a substantial portion of the}} synapses in a hippocampal CA 1 minislice and tested the effects of such stimulation on the presynaptic protein synapsin I. LTP-inducing stimulation produced a long-lasting 6 -fold increase in the phosphorylation of synapsin I at its Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) sites without affecting synapsin I levels. This effect was fully blocked by either the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist d(−) - 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> or the CaM kinase II inhibitor KN- 62.

In rodents, CR cells are transient, being present only up to 2 – 3 weeks after birth. Although previous electrophysiological studies have demonstrated the presence of NMDA and GABAA receptors in CR cells, {{little is known about}} the functional properties of these receptors. Using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques in neocortical slices, we confirmed the presence of D-aminophosphonovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> - and ifenprodil-sensitive NMDA receptors, and found that the functional expression of this receptor subtype is strain specific. The NMDA-induced response was consistently accompanied by overriding current transients that were blocked by APV and ifenprodil. In addition, bicuculline readily abolished these transients without affecting the NMDA-induced current response. The generation of these overriding current transients was dependent upon intracellular Ca 2 + and was prevented by dialysis with the high-affinity Ca 2 +-chelator BAPTA. Overall, this study uncovered a synergistic interaction between these receptors, whereby activation of NMDA receptors leads to enhanced GABAA receptor-mediated activity through a Ca 2 +-dependent mechanism...|$|R

The current study used the organotypic hippocampal slice culture model to examine the time-dependent loss of the synaptic vesicular protein synaptophysin and the loss of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor NR 1 subunit availability following an excitotoxic insult (20 µM NMDA) to provide {{a better understanding of the}} topographical nature of neuronal death following NMDA receptor activation. Significant NMDA-induced cytotoxicity in the CA 1 region of the hippocampus (as measured by propidium iodide uptake) was evident early (15 minutes after exposure) while significant loss of the NR 1 subunit and synaptophysin was found at later timepoints (72 and 24 hours, respectively), suggesting delayed downregulation or degradation in axons and dendrites as compared to the soma.

Higher concentrations (13 – 60 �M) produced short episodes of 5 – 10 Hz (carbacholtheta) oscillations separated by nonsynchronous activity. Concentrations of carbachol ranging from 8 – 25 �M also produced irregular episodes of high-frequency discharges (carbachol-gamma, 35 – 70 Hz), in isolation or mixed with carbachol-theta and carbachol-delta.

When an animal consumes a new taste and no negative consequences follow, it becomes recognized as a safe signal, leading to an increase in its consumption in subsequent presentations (attenuation of neophobia, AN). It has been shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) has an important role in taste learning. To elucidate the involvement of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and muscarinic receptors in the NAcc during safe and aversive taste memory formation, we administrated bilateral infusions of DL- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> or scopolamine in the NAcc shell or core respectively.

Binding of neurexin- 1 β to neuroligin- 1 triggers the postsynaptic clustering of the scaffold postsynaptic density protein 95, but the composition and timing of accumulation of glutamate receptors at those nascent contacts remain unclear. Using glutamate iontophoresis and patch-clamp recordings, we identified functional AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and NMDA receptors at postsynaptic density protein 95 clusters induced by neurexin- 1 β coated microspheres on primary hippocampal neurons. The recruitment of AMPARs occurred as early as 2 h after initial contact, and was not blocked by TTX/ 2 -amino- 5 -phosphovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> treatment. The differential recruitment of recombinant subunits GluR 1 and GluR 2, {{as well as the}} absence of rectification in voltage/current curves, further indicate that neurexin/neuroligin contacts primarily recruit GluR 2 -containing AMPARs. Finally, by using glutamate un-caging and calcium imaging, we show that AMPARs participate in calcium entry at neurexin- 1 β induced post-synapses, most likely through the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. Such rapid and activity-independent accumulation of functional AMPARs at neurexin- 1 β-induced postsynapses points to a new role of AMPARs in synaptogenesis...|$|R

L-Glutamic acid also enhances the formation of the initial products of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, 3 H-inositol di-(3 H-IP 2) and triphosphate (3 H-IP 3). In the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, L-glutamic acid fails to enhance 3 H-IP 1 formation, but still increases 3 H-IP 2 and 3 H-IP 3 formation. The stimulation of 3 H-IP 1 formation elicited by L-glutamic acid is reduced by DL- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> and gamma-glutamylglycine and, to a lesser extent, by 2, 3 -cis-piperidindicarboxylic acid (PDA). The stimulation of 3 H-IP 1 formation by kainic acid is antagonized by PDA and gamma-glutamylglycine, but it is almost unaffected by APV. The increase in 3 H-IP 1 formation elicited by quisqualic acid is not reduced by any of the dicarboxylic amino acid receptor antagonists that we have tested.

In the present study, rats with a pretraining injection of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic <b>acid</b> (<b>APV),</b> into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) were found to be impaired in two-way active avoidance learning. During multitrial training in a shuttle box, the APV-injected rats were not different from the controls in sensitivity to shock or in acquisition of freezing to contextual cues. However, APV injection led to impaired retention of contextual fear when tested 48 h later, along with an attenuation of c-Fos expression in the amygdala. These results are consistent with the role of NMDA receptors of the BLA in long-term memory of fear, previously documented in Pavlovian conditioning paradigms. The APV-induced impairment in the active avoidance learning coincided with deficits in directionality of the escape reaction and in attention to conditioned stimuli. These data indicate that normal functioning of NMDA receptors in the basolateral amygdala is required during acquisition of adaptive instrumental responses in a shuttle box but is not necessary for acquisition of short-term contextual fear in this situation...|$|R

APV inhibited, and RGD enhanced, microglial activation and neuronal C 1 q expression. However, addition of Aβ 10 – 20 to slice cultures significantly reduced Aβ 42 uptake and microglial activation, but did not alter the Aβ 42 -induced neuronal C 1 q expression. Furthermore, Aβ 10 – 20 alone triggered C 1 q production in neurons, demonstrating that neither neuronal Aβ 42 accumulation, nor microglial activation is required for neuronal C 1 q upregulation. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that multiple receptors are involved in Aβ injury and signaling in neurons.

The mPFC has been implicated in the acquisition of trace fear conditioning, a task that requires the association of a conditional stimulus (CS) and an aversive unconditional stimulus (UCS) across a temporal gap. In both rat and human subjects, frontal regions show increased activity during the trace interval separating the CS and UCS.

These EPSPs had one or two components, and the second component had several characteristics of NMDA receptor-mediated events.

Similar results were obtained with intra-BLA infusions of APV before contextual fear conditioning in rats that had been fear-conditioned to a different context. Additional experiments showed that intra-BLA APV infusions substantially interfere with the expression and extinction of conditioned fear to tone, light, and context stimuli. Together, these results indicate that NMDA receptors in the BLA are crucial for the encoding of new fear memories (i. e., the formation of specific conditioned stimulus–unconditioned stimulus association), the expression of conditioned fear responses, and the extinction of acquired fear.

40|$|Afferent {{olfactory}} information, in vivo and in vitro, can be rapidly {{adapted to}} through a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) –mediated attenuation of synaptic strength. Specific cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying olfactory learning and habituation at the cortical level remain unclear. Through whole-cell recording, excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) {{were obtained from}} piriform cortex (PC) principal cells. Using a coincidental, pre- and postsynaptic stimulation protocol, long-term depression (LTD) in synaptic strength was induced at associative, excitatory synapses onto layer II pyramidal neurons of themouse (P 15 - 27) PC. LTD was mimicked and occluded by mGluR agonists and blocked by nonselective mGluR antagonist (RS) -a-methyl- 4 -sulfonophenylglycine (MSPG) but not by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV).</b> Analysis of the paired-pulse ratio, a-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) /NMDA current ratio, and spontaneous EPSCs indicate that electrically induced LTD was mediated predominantly by postsynaptic mechanisms. Additionally, presynaptic mGluRs were involved in agonist-mediated synaptic depression. Immunohistochemical analysis sup-ports the presence of multiple subclasses of mGluRs throughout the PC, with large concentrations of several receptors present in layer II. These observations provide further evidence of activity-dependent, long-term modification of associative inputs and its underlying mechanisms. Cortical adaptation at associative synapses provides an additional link between cortical olfactory pro-cessing and subcortical centers that influence behavior.

40|$|Abstract Expression of C 1 q, {{an early}} {{component}} of the classical complement pathway, {{has been shown to}} be induced in neurons in hippocampal slices, following accumulation of exogenous Aβ 42. Microglial activation was also detected by surface marker expression and cytokine production. To determine whether C 1 q induction was correlated with intraneuronal Aβ and/or microglial activation, D-(-) - 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV,</b> an NMDA receptor antagonist) and glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine-proline peptide (RGD, an integrin receptor antagonist), which blocks and enhances Aβ 42 uptake, respectively, were assessed for their effect on neuronal C 1 q synthesis and microglial activation. APV inhibited, and RGD enhanced, microglial activation and neuronal C 1 q expression. However, addition of Aβ 10 – 20 to slice cultures significantly reduced Aβ 42 uptake and microglial activation, but did not alter the Aβ 42 -induced neuronal C 1 q expression. Furthermore, Aβ 10 – 20 alone triggered C 1 q production in neurons, demonstrating that neither neuronal Aβ 42 accumulation, nor microglial activation is required for neuronal C 1 q upregulation. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that multiple receptors are involved in Aβ injury and signaling in neurons. Some lead to neuronal C 1 q induction, whereas other(s) lead to intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ and/or stimulation of microglia. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} characteristic {{changes in}} the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor on neurons following axotomy, subunit expressions and functional features of the NMDA receptor were examined in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus (DMV) of rats receiving vagal axotomy at the neck. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that the expression of NR 2 A decreased 2 – 3 days after in vivo axotomy, while expression of NR 1 and NR 2 B, NR 2 C and NR 2 D subunits did not change significantly. To examine the functional changes, patch clamp recordings in whole-cell mode were employed on the axotomized DMV neurons identified by retrograde labelling with fluorescent dye. The amplitude ratios of ifenprodil-sensitive components of NMDA response and d,l- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> -sensitive evoked postsynaptic current increased after axotomy. In addition, APV-sensitive postsynaptic currents exhibited a longer decay time in identified axotomized vagal motoneurons than in control neurons. No {{significant differences in the}} current density of the NMDA response and the peak amplitude of APV-sensitive synaptic currents were observed between axotomized and intact DMV neurons. In conclusion, a decrease in NR 2 A expression results in the appearance of functional characteristics of the NMDA receptor predominantly containing the NR 2 B subunit. This might lead to a long-term increase of the susceptibility of neurons to excitotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|The {{competitive}} antagonist 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonoeptanoic <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> was injected intracerebroventricularly {{to determine}} the involvement of NMDA receptors in different stages of memory consolidation. Subsequent experiments used local injections to determine possible sites of drug action. Rats were trained in a rapidly learned olfactory task to find palatable food in a hole in a sponge impregnated with the target odor {{in the presence of}} two other sponges with nonrewarded odors. APV injections were made intracerebroventricularly 5 min or 2 hr {{after the end of the}} training, and a retention test was given 48 hr later. The results showed that blockade of NMDA receptors immediately after training induces a profound and enduring amnesia with no effect when the treatment is delayed at 2 hr after training. To address the question of the effective sites of action of the intracerebroventricular treatment, APV injections into the hippocampus and into the prelimblic region of the frontal cortex (PLC) were made. Blockade of NMDA receptors into the PLC but not into the hippocampus impaired memory formation of the odor-reward association. The amnesia is not transient, because the retention tests were made 48 hr after training. These results underlie the role of NMDA receptors in the early stage of consolidation of a simple odor-reward associative memory and confirm the role of the PLC in the consolidation of long-term memory...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{evaluated}} {{the hypothesis that}} N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity {{is essential for the}} development of kindling and/or the maintenance of the kindled state in male hooded rats. Kindling was produced by the infusion of carbachol, a muscarinic cholinergic agonist, directly into either the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala or the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The infusions of carbachol took place over 70 seconds and were given every 2 days. At a previously determined time before the infusion of carbachol, either <b>APV</b> (DL-aminophosphonovaleric <b>acid,</b> infused into the site of recording) or NPC 17742 (2 R, 4 R, 2 S-(2 -amino- 4, 5 (cyclohexyl) - 7 -phosphonoheptanoic acid, i. p.) was given. Both APV and NPC 17742 are competitive NMDA antagonists and the interval between the administration of the NMDA antagonist and carbachol was previously found to be effective in maximally blocking NMDA receptor activity. The results indicated that seizure activity progressed in both sites, but that there was some retardation in the development of convulsions in the NMDA antagonist-treated rats as compared to their controls. There was no effect of APV or NPC on previously kindled seizures. As there was a limited effect of NPC 17742 on seizure activity and convulsions, a further study examining the effects of NPC 17742 on electrical kindling was undertaken. NPC 17742 retarded the development of seizure activity and convulsions, although it did not affect the expression of previously kindled seizures. Thus, NPC 17742 has an effect similar to other NMDA antagonists on electrical kindling. However, NPC 17742 did not completely retard the development of seizures, as all NPC-treated rats exhibited some form of convulsive activity. These results indicate that the blockade of NMDA receptor activity, through the preadministration of the NMDA antagonists, APV or NPC 17742, did not completely block kindling with carbachol, although they did retard the development of convulsions. As well, the blockade of NMDA receptor activity did not affect the expression of previously kindled seizures. Thus, NMDA-receptor activity is not essential for the development of kindling, although it {{may play a role in}} the development of seizures...|$|R
40|$|Auditory filial {{imprinting}} in {{the domestic}} chicken {{is accompanied by a}} dramatic loss of spine synapses in two higher associative forebrain areas, the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale (MNH) and the dorsocaudal neostriatum (Ndc). The cellular mechanisms that underlie this learning-induced synaptic reorganization are unclear. We found that local pharmacological blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the MNH, a manipulation that has been shown previously to impair auditory imprinting, suppresses the learning-induced spine reduction in this region. Chicks treated with the NMDA receptor antagonist 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> during the behavioral training for imprinting (postnatal day 0 – 2) displayed similar spine frequencies at postnatal day 7 as naive control animals, which, in both groups, were significantly higher than in imprinted animals. Because the average dendritic length did not differ between the experimental groups, the reduced spine frequency can be interpreted as a reduction {{of the total number of}} spine synapses per neuron. In the Ndc, which is reciprocally connected with the MNH and not directly influenced by the injected drug, learning-induced spine elimination was partly suppressed. Spine frequencies of the APV-treated, behaviorally trained but nonimprinted animals were higher than in the imprinted animals but lower than in the naive animals. These results provide evidence that NMDA receptor activation is required for the learning-induced selective reduction of spine synapses, which may serve as a mechanism of information storage specific for juvenile emotional learning events...|$|R
40|$|Aconitine {{effects on}} the hippocampal slice {{preparation}} have been well documented and include acute inhibitory and prolonged excitatory effects. To date, the effect of aconitine on neocortical activity has not been investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterise the acute and long term effects of aconitine on cortical local field potential activity. Neocortical slices from juvenile Sprague–Dawley rats were perfused at room temperature with aconitine in normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) (n = 10). Spontaneous local field potential activity was recorded from the somatosensory cortex. The calcium dependence of aconitine-induced activity was investigated using low-calcium aCSF (n = 8). To isolate sodium and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) channel effects, phenytoin (n = 4) and 2 -amino- 5 -phosphono-pentanoic <b>acid</b> (<b>APV)</b> (n = 6) were co-administered with aconitine, respectively. Aconitine consistently induced a dramatic increase in population “spike” activity after prolonged (89. 5 ± 36. 6 min) application in normal aCSF. This activity surge was eliminated in low-calcium aCSF and when aconitine was co-administered with phenytoin and APV. The acute effects of aconitine application were variable and included an increase in the frequency of population spikes, appearance of oscillatory seizure-like activity and prolonged bursts of multiunit activity. No acute inhibitory effects were observed. Aconitine has acute and prolonged excitatory effects on neocortical activity. The latter is effected by calcium-dependent mechanisms, in keeping with known effects of aconitine on hippocampal slices. Both sodium and NMDA channels are involved in mediating the calcium-dependent aconitine effects...|$|R
40|$|Exposures to {{uncontrollable}} stress {{have been}} shown to alter ensuing synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and interfere with hippocampal-dependent spatial memory in rats. The present study examined whether stress, which impairs hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), also affects (nonspatial) hippocampal-dependent object-recognition memory, as tested on the visual paired comparison task (VPC) in rats. After undergoing an inescapable restraint–tailshock stress experience, rats exhibited markedly impaired recognition memory at the 3 -h (long) familiarization-to-test phase delay but not at the 5 -min (short) delay. In contrast, unstressed control animals showed robust recognition memory (i. e., they exhibited reliable preferences for novel over familiar objects) at both short- and long-delay periods. The impairing effect of stress on long-delay recognition memory was transient because 48 h after undergoing stress experience, animals performed normally at the long delay. Similar to stress, microinfusions of DL- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV),</b> a competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist that blocks LTP, into the dorsal hippocampus selectively impaired object-recognition memory at the long-delay period. Together, these results suggest that stress and intrahippocampal administration of APV affect recognition memory by influencing synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. [The following individuals kindly provided reagents, samples, or unpublished information as indicated in the paper H.

40|$|Tetanic {{stimulation}} of the Schaffer collateral inputs into area CA 1 of the hippocampus causes N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, an effect {{that contributes to the}} induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in this region. The present studies demonstrate that LTP-inducing tetanic stimulation in rat hippocampal area CA 1 elicited increased levels of cAMP. The elevation of cAMP was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist DL- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric <b>acid</b> (<b>APV).</b> Bath application of NMDA also resulted in an increase in cAMP in CA 1, an effect that was blocked by both APV and removal of extracellular Ca 2 +. These findings suggest that activation of NMDA receptors elicits a Ca(2 +) -dependent increase in cAMP, and taken together with the data from tetanic stimulation, suggest that NMDA-receptor-mediated increases in cAMP could {{play a role in the}} induction of LTP in area CA 1. One role for cAMP may be to increase Ca 2 + influx through voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels, as it was observed that application of either 8 -bromo-cAMP or NMDA increased the fractional open time of high-threshold Ca 2 + channels in CA 1 pyramidal cells. Our results raise the possibility that a positive-feedback loop for Ca 2 + influx in area CA 1 exists. In this model, NMDA receptor-mediated Ca 2 + influx leads to an enhancement of further Ca 2 + influx via intermediate steps of increased cAMP and subsequent increased voltage-gated Ca 2 + channel activity...|$|R
