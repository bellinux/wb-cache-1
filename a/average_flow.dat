5|$|The CVP {{also has}} several dams on the San Joaquin River—which has far less <b>average</b> <b>flow</b> than the Sacramento—in order to divert its water to {{southern}} Central Valley aqueducts. The Friant Dam, completed in 1942, {{is the largest}} component of the Friant Division of the CVP. The dam crosses the San Joaquin River where it spills out of the Sierra Nevada, forming Millerton Lake, which provides water storage for San Joaquin Valley irrigators {{as well as providing}} a diversion point for a pair of canals, the Friant-Kern Canal and the Madera Canal. The Friant-Kern Canal sends water southwards through the Tulare Lake area to its terminus at Bakersfield on the Kern River, supplying irrigation water to Tulare, Fresno, and Kern counties. The Madera Canal takes water northwards to Madera County, emptying into the Chowchilla River.|$|E

Conventionally, most of the mold filling analyses {{have been based on}} a macroscopic flow model utilizing Darcy's law. While Darcy's law is successful in describing the <b>averaged</b> <b>flow</b> field within the mold cavity packed with a porous fiber preform, it requires experiments to obtain the permeability tensor and is limited to the case of porous fiber preform-it {{can not be used to}} model the resin flow through a double porous fiber preform. In the current approach, the actual flow field is considered, to which the homogenization method is applied to obtain the <b>averaged</b> <b>flow</b> model. The advantages of the current approach are: parameters such as the permeability and effective heat conductivity of the impregnanted fiber preform can be calculated; the actual flow field as well as <b>averaged</b> <b>flow</b> field can be obtained; and the resin flow through a double porous fiber preform can be modelled. In the presentation, we first derive the <b>averaged</b> <b>flow</b> model for the resin flow through a porous fiber preform and compare it with that of other methods. Next, we extend the result to the case of double porous fiber preform. An <b>averaged</b> <b>flow</b> model for the resin flow through a double porous fiber preform is derived, and a simulation program is developed which is capable of predicting the flow pattern and temperature distribution in the mold filling process. Finally, an example of a three dimensional part is provided...|$|R
40|$|In the {{increasing}} need for energy saving worldwide, the designing process of turbomachinery, {{as an essential}} part of thermal and hydroenergy systems, goes in the direction of enlarging efficiency. Therefore, the optimization of turbomachinery designing strongly affects the energy efficiency of the entire system. In the designing process of turbomachinery blade profiling, the model of axisymmetric fluid flows is commonly used in technical practice, even though this model suits only the profile cascades with infinite number of infinitely thin blades. The actual flow in turbomachinery profile cascades is not axisymmetric, and it can be fictively derived into the axisymmetric <b>flow</b> by <b>averaging</b> <b>flow</b> parameters in the blade passages according to the circular coordinate. Using numerical simulations of flow in turbomachinery runners, its operating parameters can be preliminarily determined. Furthermore, using the numerically obtained flow parameters in the blade passages, <b>averaged</b> axisymmetric <b>flow</b> surfaces in blade profile cascades can also be determined. The method of determination of <b>averaged</b> <b>flow</b> parameters and <b>averaged</b> meridian streamlines is presented in this paper, using the integral continuity equation for <b>averaged</b> <b>flow</b> parameters. With thus obtained results, every designer can be able to compare the obtained <b>averaged</b> <b>flow</b> surfaces with axisymmetric flow surfaces, as well as the specific work of elementary stages, which are used in the procedure of blade designing. Numerical simulations of flow in an exemplary axial flow pump, used {{as a part of the}} thermal power plant cooling system, were performed using Ansys CFX.

5|$|Notwithstanding the {{increased}} prosperity in the 1860s, this decade {{was also the}} scene of a series of natural disasters. In the Great Flood of 1862, heavy rains dropped by a series of winter storms caused the Santa Ana to burst its banks, flooding thousands of acres of land and killing 20 to 40 people in the greatest flood it had experienced in recorded history. The levees along the river burst in many places, flooding part of the Inland Empire into a continuous body of water several miles wide stretching from the mouth of Santa Ana Canyon to where the river cuts through the Santa Ana Mountains. Downstream in Orange County, the river overwhelmed nearly all the existing floodworks and transformed the coastal plain into a transient inland sea. The flow, now calculated as a 1,000-year flood, peaked at roughly , over half the <b>average</b> <b>flow</b> of the Mississippi River. Even after the flood, detrimental conditions continued in the region. For the two years following the flood, an intense drought caused the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} head of livestock. Despite all of the hardships experienced in the three years, after conditions finally returned to normal, the Santa Ana River watershed again became a prospering agricultural region. The cities of Santa Ana and Riverside were established in 1869 and 1870, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{major river}} {{flowing into the}} sea is the Burdekin River, which has its delta {{southeast}} of Townsville. Owing to the seasonal and annual variations in occurrence of cyclones and in precipitation (typically between 200 and 1600mm/year), its annual discharge can vary more than 10 times between the two succeeding years. In particular, in the period 1920–1999, the <b>average</b> <b>flow</b> rate near the delta was below 1000 m3/s in 1923, 1931, 1939, 1969, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1993 and 1995; it was above 25,000 m3/s in 1927, 1940, 1946, 1950, 1951, 1959, 1968, 1972, 1974 and 1991, and reached about 40,000 m3/s in 1946.

25|$|Many {{existing}} hydroelectric dams {{are fairly}} old (for example, the Hoover Dam {{was built in}} the 1930s), and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades. A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide baseload power will have its generators sized according to the <b>average</b> <b>flow</b> of water into the reservoir. Uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity, thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit. The United States Bureau of Reclamation reports an investment cost of $69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam, compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators. While an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel – incoming river water – during periods of high output from other generating units. Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way, the uprated dam {{is one of the most}} efficient forms of energy storage, because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir, only increased losses to evaporation and leakage.|$|E
