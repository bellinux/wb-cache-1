40|$|Objectives The study {{examined}} the course of neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain among a cohort of technical school students entering working life. We also aimed to identify work-related and individual risk factors for neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain during this transition period. Methods The study {{was designed as a}} prospective cohort study following 420 technical school students (167 student hairdressers, 118 student electricians, and 135 media/design students) from school, through their apprenticeship and into working life. Every 4 th month over a 6. 5 year period (2002 – 2009), the participant`s neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain for the preceding four weeks was assessed. Mechanical and psychosocial workplace factors as well as individual factors were evaluated at baseline and/or during the follow-up period. Data were analyzed by generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results We found a significant increase in neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain over time in the transition from technical school to working life. High mechanical workload was associated with neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain among women, while a high level of shoulder muscle endurance capacity was associated with lower rates of neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain among men. Perceived muscle tension and ethnicity were the most consistent predictors for neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain, found among both women and men. Conclusion Increased neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain was found in the transition from technical school to working life, and both work-related and individual factors were associated with pain development.

5|$|The Maine Coon {{is a long}} {{or medium}} haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, {{although}} texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter on the head <b>and</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and longer on the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming {{is required for the}} breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{coloring}} of the addax's coat {{varies with}} the season. In the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, <b>and</b> <b>shoulders.</b> In the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde. Their head is marked with brown or black patches that form an 'X' over their noses. They have scraggly beards and prominent red nostrils. Long, black hairs stick out between their curved and spiralling horns, ending in a short mane on the neck.|$|E
5|$|The tail is {{moderately}} {{short and}} does not have large thorn-like structures called dermal denticles that are normally found on skates. This lack of denticles distinguishes it from all but two species of skates that {{are found in the}} western Atlantic. Larger individuals do have three rows of smaller denticles on the tail, and mature females also possess denticles on the head <b>and</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and along the dorsal midbelt of the disk and tail. Denticles are completely absent on small individuals.|$|E
40|$|Repetitive and {{monotonous}} work is frequently associated with neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain <b>and</b> negative psychosocial factors inducing stress reactions. The present thesis concerns {{the relations between}} psychophysiological and subjective stress reactions, muscle activity measured by surface electromyography (SEMG) in the trapezius muscle, <b>and</b> neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain in women performing repetitive and {{monotonous work}}. In Study I cardiovascular and subjective stress reactions were investigated during computer work in a laboratory setting. The findings indicated that heart rate variability is a more sensitive and selective measure of mental stress compared with blood pressure recordings. Study II explored the relations between stress reactions and muscle activity during supermarket work. The results showed that perceived negative stress reactions may have a specific influence on muscle activity in the neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> region, which can be of importance for work-related musculoskeletal disorders in repetitive and monotonous work. In Study III the association between SEMG activity patterns <b>and</b> neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain was investigated during cash register work. It was found that pain-afflicted women had a different muscle activation pattern (more static, more co-contraction, less muscle rest) compared with pain-free women. Study IV was a follow-up study evaluating the introduction of job rotation among female cashiers. The results indicated positive effects on diastolic blood pressure, muscle activity, and partly on neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain, although perceived stress was unchanged. It was concluded that job rotation {{seems to have a}} limited effect on chronic neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain, but may be an effective preventive measure. The empirical findings are particularly relevant for women who, compared with men, more often perform repetitive and monotonous work and are also more often affected by neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain...|$|R

5|$|Beth Phoenix {{became the}} number one {{contender}} for the Women's Title after winning a Diva battle royal at SummerSlam. At the Unforgiven pay-per-view, however, Candice successfully retained her title in their match by countering one of Phoenix's moves with a crucifix pin. Their feud continued when Phoenix pinned Candice during a non-title mixed tag team match on Raw on September 24. At No Mercy on October 7, Candice dropped the title to Phoenix, ending her reign as Women's Champion.

5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of IIH is headache, which occurs {{in almost all}} (92–94%) cases. It is {{characteristically}} worse in the morning, generalized in character and throbbing in nature. It {{may be associated with}} nausea and vomiting. The headache can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure, such as coughing and sneezing. The pain may also be experienced in the neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Many have pulsatile tinnitus, a whooshing sensation in one or both ears (64–87%); this sound is synchronous with the pulse. Various other symptoms, such as numbness of the extremities, generalized weakness, loss of smell, and loss of coordination, are reported more rarely; none are specific for IIH. In children, numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{native to}} Australia. Found in drier regions {{across much of the}} continent, it inhabits scrub and open woodland. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family Petroicidae, it is sexually dimorphic. Measuring 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) in length, the robin has a small thin black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to advertise territories and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.|$|E
