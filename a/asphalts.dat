It is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing. It may be blended with the hot asphalt in tanks, but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants. Other typical applications include the production of mastic <b>asphalts</b> for sidewalks, bridges, car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for {{the oil and gas}} industry. Selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags.|$|E
25|$|Ballarat rose to {{prominence}} as a goldrush boomtown, though gold no longer plays {{a pivotal role}} in the economy of the city. Nevertheless, deep underground mining continues to the present date with a single main mine operating. There are still thought to be large, undiscovered gold reserves in the Ballarat region, with investigations being made by local and national companies. Lihir Gold invested in Ballarat Goldfields in 2006, however it downscaled its operations in 2009 due to the expense of extraction before selling its stake in 2010 to Castlemaine Goldfields. Along with gold, lignite (coal), kaolin (clay) and iron ore have also been mined in the Ballarat region and nearby Lal Lal however many of the resource deposits have since been exhausted. An active quarrying industry with large enterprises including Boral Limited extracts and manufactures building materials from the Ballarat region, including clays, aggregates, cements, <b>asphalts.</b>|$|E

Surface millings are recommended over full depth millings when choosing <b>asphalt</b> millings to recycle. Full depth millings usually contain sub-base contaminants such as gravel, mud and sand. These sub base contaminants will leach oil away from original <b>asphalt</b> and dry out the material in the recycling process. <b>Asphalt</b> milled from <b>asphalt</b> is better than <b>asphalt</b> milled from concrete.

The test {{results show that the}} dynamic moduli of DCLR and DCLR-composite <b>asphalt</b> mixtures are higher than those of the SK- 90 and SBS modified <b>asphalt</b> mixtures. Based on the viscoelastic parameters of CAM models of the <b>asphalt</b> mixtures, the high- and low-temperature performance of DLCR and DCLR-composite modified <b>asphalt</b> mixtures are obviously better than the SK- 90 and SBS modified <b>asphalt</b> mixtures.
