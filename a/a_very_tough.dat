5|$|On 5 December 1908, Sunderland {{achieved}} {{their highest}} ever league win, against north-east rivals Newcastle United. They {{won the game}} 9–1; Billy Hogg and George Holley each scored hat-tricks. The club won the league again in 1913, but lost their first FA Cup final 1–0 to Aston Villa, in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough</b> loss. This was the closest the club has come to winning the league title and the FA Cup in the same season. Two seasons later the First World War brought the league to a halt. After the league's resumption, Sunderland came close to winning another championship in the 1922–23 season, when they were runners-up to Liverpool. They also came close the following season, finishing third, four points {{from the top of}} the league. The club escaped relegation from the First Division by one point in the 1927–28 season despite 35 goals from Dave Halliday. The point was won in a match against Middlesbrough, and they finished in fifteenth place. Halliday improved his goal scoring to 43 goals in 42 games the following season, an all-time Sunderland record for goals scored in a single season.|$|E
25|$|The rivalry {{continued}} on {{in to the}} 2017 finals with yet another elimination final, as the Sharks hosted a injured and battered Cowboys at Allianz Stadium. The Cowboys went in massive under-dogs, but {{would go on to}} upset the Sharks 15-14 in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough</b> contest. Ironically, it would be the Cowboys who ended the Sharks hopes of having back-to-back grand final success.|$|E
25|$|Team GB {{took part}} in the 1991 European Championship {{finishing}} 9th out of 10 teams. Placed in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough</b> Group B, they lost their first three games to Sweden (0–16), Denmark (0–4) and Germany (0–6) before surprising the Czech Republic with a 2–2 draw in their final game.

25|$|Contrary to his expectations, the Congress party {{soon after}} {{resuming}} power in India made Sir Sikandar's life extremely {{difficult in the}} Punjab. The Punjab Congress and their allies like the Khaksars, Majlis-e-Itihad-e-Millat and the Ahrars pooled their resources to give Sir Sikander <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough</b> opposition. He and his party {{could no longer afford}} to be politically isolated and some sort of alliance with the Punjab Muslim League, no matter how loose it may be, was essential for the survival of Sikandar Ministry.|$|E
25|$|The new Romano-Latin {{military}} alliance proved {{strong enough}} to repel the incursions of the Italic mountain tribes, but it was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough</b> struggle. Intermittent wars, with mixed fortunes, continued until c. 395 BC. The Sabines disappear from the record in 449 BC (presumably subjugated by the Romans), while campaigns against the Aequi and Volsci seem to have reached a turning point with the major Roman victory on Mount Algidus in 431 BC. In the same period, the Romans fought three wars against their nearest neighbouring Etruscan city-state, Veii, finally reducing the city in 396 BC. Although the annexation of Veii's territory probably increased the ager Romanus by c. 65%, this seems a modest gain for a century of warfare.|$|E

25|$|UHMWPE is {{polyethylene}} with {{a molecular}} weight numbering in the millions, usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The {{high molecular weight}} makes it <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough</b> material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the crystal structure as evidenced by densities of less than high-density polyethylene (for example, 0.930–0.935nbsp&g/cm3). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent chemical resistance, UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and bottle-handling machine parts, moving parts on weaving machines, bearings, gears, artificial joints, edge protection on ice rinks, and butchers' chopping boards. It is commonly used {{for the construction of}} articular portions of implants used for hip and knee replacements. As fiber, it competes with aramid in bulletproof vests.|$|E
25|$|There {{were more}} than 20 people in Lanying’s family. But in her life, {{her mother and father}} {{influenced}} her most. Jianhua Lin, Lanying’s father, was a great educator. When Lanying was young, he stayed far from home and studied at the university. Although he did not stay with Lanying, he often wrote letters to Lanying and bought some books for her. So it was Jianhua that led Lanying into studying. Lanying’s mother was Shuixian Zhou. She was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough</b> woman because she had to hold the whole family. Because of her personality, Lanying learned from her and became persistent. Although Shuixian was deeply influenced by the gender schema, she helped Lanying to be a persistent person, so Lanying could conquer many difficulties in her life. Lanying had two brothers. After she came back from America, she helped raise two nieces because she had no child.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, the Old Etonians {{entered the}} FA Cup {{for the first}} time. They started their {{campaign}} against the Swifts, which proved <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough</b> match. After two drawn games, the Etonians managed {{to pull off a}} 3–0 victory. In the second round they received a bye which led them into the Quarter Finals. Following a win against Maidenhead, they played Shropshire Wanderers; in an extremely close match, the Old Boys came through by a single goal to nil. Thus, the Old Boys reached the FA Cup Final at their first attempt, where they came up against a strong team from the Royal Engineers who were in the final {{for the third time in}} the first four years of the competition. The final was played in a strong wind, which favoured the Old Etonians who had the wind at their backs for all but ten minutes of the 90, and all 30 minutes of extra time (teams in this period only changed ends after a goal was scored). The teams finished level after 90 minutes, with a goal from Capt Henry Renny-Tailyour being cancelled out by one from Alexander Bonsor.|$|E

In the Western Conference Finals, they faced the number one seed in the West and Presidents' Trophy winner, the Chicago Blackhawks. After dropping the first two games, the Kings won Game 3 with Jeff Carter suffering an injury from Blackhawks defenseman Duncan Keith, who was suspended for Game 4 as a result. After losing Game 4, the Kings battled the Blackhawks through two overtime periods in Game 5, with Patrick Kane eventually scoring the game-winning goal that won the game and the series, sending the Blackhawks to the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals and ending the Kings' season.|$|E
25|$|Wisniski debuted as a {{professional}} wrestler in 1947, wrestling Karl Nowena in Buenos Aires. In {{order to make the}} matches as believable as possible Wisniski insisted the men he faced in the ring hit him as hard as possible. From that he earned a strong reputation as being <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough</b> man. On New Year's Day, 1950, Buddy Rogers defeated Wisniski in the finals of a United States title tournament. He also competed in the NWA's Capitol Wrestling territory. Jerry Graham, who was a co-holder of the Northeast version of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship, selected Wisniski in November 1959 to take over the title from Graham's injured partner. They were beaten for the title belts the following April, but Wisniski took on a new partner, Buddy Rogers, to regain the championship by defeating The Fabulous Kangaroos on November 19, 1960. Wisniski's rivalry with the Kangaroos continued, as the Kangaroos regained the belts in a rematch one week later. Wisniski went over one year without holding a championship before teaming with a new partner, this time Bob Ellis, to defeat the Kangaroos and take back the championship. Wisniski & Ellis lost the belts to Buddy Rogers & Handsome Johnny Barend in a match where Arnold Skoaland subbed for Ellis, but the belts were still up, on Washington, DC TV. Rogers & Barend then defeated the real team of Wisniski & Ellis 2 pins to 1 in a main event at Madison Square Garden.|$|E

It wasn't a great script...it was a lot of schtick. But it would've been a lot better if I'd been more familiar with that world of burlesque in the 20's, which I wasn't. So because of that I think the film suffers to a great degree from that." ...|$|R
