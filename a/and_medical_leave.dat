5|$|Clinton {{was inaugurated}} as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less {{than a month}} after taking office, he signed the Family <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act of 1993, which {{required}} large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support, and was popular with the public.|$|E
25|$|In {{what was}} to be a forerunner of the Family <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act of 1993, then teacher Ackerman {{successfully}} sued the Board in a landmark case which established the right of either parent to receive unpaid leave for child care. A quarter of a century later, now a Congressman, Ackerman in the House-Senate Conference Committee, signed the report of the Family <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act which became the law of the land.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{identifies}} several {{characteristics of}} individuals who report their physical and/or mental health as being adversely affected by summertime heat and humidity, within the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods of the nine largest cities of Québec (Canada). The study is cross-sectional by stratified representative sample; 3485 people were interviewed in their residence. The prevalence of reported impacts was 46 %, mostly physical health. Female gender <b>and</b> long-term <b>medical</b> <b>leave</b> are two impact risk indicators in people < 65 years of age. Low income and air conditioning at home are risk indicators at all ages. Results for having ≥ 2 diagnoses of chronic diseases, particularly for people self-describing as in poor health (odds ratio, OR< 65 = 5. 6; OR≥ 65 = 4. 2), and perceiving daily stress, are independent of age. The prevalence of reported heat-related health impacts is thus very high in those inner cities, with notable differences according to age, stress levels <b>and</b> long-term <b>medical</b> <b>leave,</b> previously unmentioned in the literature...|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 60 {{patients}} (32 receiving ORIF, 28 receiving nonoperative treatment) with closed intra-articular distal radius fractures were included.

25|$|Women in the {{workforce}} have tripled and as their numbers increase it has been hard for both mothers and fathers {{to be able to}} take care of their own newborn child or a sick family member. The Family <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act of 1993 has allowed for workers to have up to 12 weeks a year to leave work.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley {{pointed out}} many flaws {{with both the}} missionaries and the local Thai people. [...] In Bradley's view, the missionaries did not keep the Sabbath {{strictly}} enough <b>and</b> requested <b>medical</b> <b>leave</b> far too quickly. Bradley criticized Buddhism and numerous practices that he saw in Thai culture such as drunkenness, slavery, gambling, and polygamy. [...] Bradley, {{along with many other}} missionaries, viewed Western culture as superior to that of Thailand. [...] At the time of his death, Bradley's evangelistic work had directly contributed to the conversion of one person.|$|R

25|$|Some {{new mothers}} (and fathers) in the US will take unpaid time off, {{allowed by the}} Family <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act. The FMLA entitles {{eligible}} employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave.|$|E
25|$|The {{platform}} expresses {{support for}} raising the federal minimum wage to $15 {{an hour and}} indexing it to inflation, a plank supported by Sanders. The adoption of this point was a boost for the Fight for $15 movement. The platform also calls for ending the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and workers with disabilities, and for twelve weeks of paid family <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> <b>leave.</b>|$|E
40|$|Policy {{debates over}} {{proposed}} legislative labor policy changes include contentions that business investment will negatively respond to labor laws that favor labor. Research on labor policy, however, often assumes that investment is fixed. We present a sequential bargaining {{model in which}} labor policies that increase labor’s bargaining power and reduce management’s options during strikes are predicted to reduce investment. Using provincial data on investment for 1967 to 1999, a strike replacement ban and protections for workers who refuse to handle struck work are estimated to reduce new investment, especially within {{the first few years}} after the policy change. Budd thanks the Carlson School of Management’s McKnight- Business and Economics Research Grants Program for financial support. In the United States and Canada, companies, labor unions, and scholars devote considerable attention to monitoring, affecting, and understanding government regulation of the employment relationship. Well-known examples include minimum wage provisions, mandated family <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> <b>leaves,</b> <b>and</b> restrictions on the use of replacement workers during strikes.

25|$|A {{majority}} opinion in Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development, 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under the Family <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act {{against the state}} of Pennsylvania. States are free to maintain sovereign immunity under the U.S. Constitution. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee’s claims.|$|E
25|$|Altmire gained {{national}} attention with {{his effort to}} guarantee enlistment bonuses of combat-wounded veterans and was the principal author {{of the law that}} expands the Family <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act to cover military guard and reserve families.

25|$|Historically {{significant}} {{pieces of}} legislation have been enacted {{at the federal level}} to address the sex disparities in the workplace. These {{pieces of legislation}} attempt to address the wage gap in the U.S., gender discrimination in hiring and firing, and the occupational rights of workers in taking family <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> <b>leave.</b> Despite these significant legislative efforts, the U.S. still lags behind other developed countries in progressive family-friendly work policies.|$|E
50|$|The 2014 {{election}} {{resulted in}} a hung parliament with 23 Labor seats, 22 Liberal seats, and two independents.

Such did not indicate who he would support in a minority government before he was diagnosed and hospitalised with a brain tumour <b>and</b> took <b>medical</b> <b>leave.</b> With 24 seats required to govern, Brock backed Labor. He accepted the cabinet positions of Minister for Regional Development and Minister for State and Government Local Relations. Brock agreed to support the Labor government on confidence and supply while retaining the right to otherwise vote on conscience.|$|R

25|$|If {{government}} support for workplace family-friendly policies or childcare subsidies was stronger, more solutions could be attempted. For example, child care subsidies {{by the government}} actually result in less childcare and work disruptions and could impact low-income families as well by making childcare more affordable. However, {{government support}} is not {{at the level of}} other developed countries. Legislation such as the Family <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act had little impact on gender inequality in care work and was strongly opposed by businesses.|$|E

50|$|The AMA gave Bradley limited {{resources}} and money for mission work. Thus Bradley had to focus energy away from missionary work {{to focus on}} making money. Bradley worked as a doctor and also as a mercantile to support his mission.

25|$|The Family <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act of 1993 {{requires}} {{employers to}} provide job-protected unpaid leave for certain {{family and medical}} reasons. Legitimate reasons include pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, foster care placement, and care for an ill family member. However, this legislation is limited: coverage is only extended for twelve weeks and for employees who have worked for at least twelve months at the same job. Short-term medical illness and routine medical checkups were not covered until the FMLA, and family members other than parents, spouses, and children are not covered. Some states have extended the definition of family on their own, and therefore extended the coverage of FMLA.|$|E
500|$|The Baird {{nomination}} was emblematic of other difficulties Clinton had {{during the transition}} period and his early days in office, including most prominently the dropping of a promised middle-class tax cut and resistance to his proposal to allow gays in the military. [...] Stephanopoulos later wrote that [...] "We should have never let the Baird nomination get {{as far as it}} did, but our systems failed us at every crucial step." [...] And the timing of the announcement of the Wood withdrawal detracted attention from the signing of the Family <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act of 1993, the first legislative achievement of the Clinton administration. While a Gallup Poll showed that only 22percent of the public said that Clinton's difficulties in naming someone for Attorney General decreased their confidence in his ability to lead the country, overall, Clinton experienced the highest disapproval ratings at the start of any presidency since such polling began.
