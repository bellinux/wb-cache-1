5|$|A {{subdivision}} rule takes a tiling of {{the plane}} by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a tile type. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge <b>also</b> <b>gets</b> subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that {{are made up of}} polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called subdivision complexes for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide {{it over and over again}} to get a sequence of tilings.|$|E

Due to facial freckles and round glasses, Makoto is not able to appear as cute as Shuichi when wearing feminine clothes. Makoto's primary reason for wanting to be a girl may be due to an attraction to men, something Shuichi cannot relate to; Makoto is a romantic who wants to be in a relationship with a cool, adult man.

Talion eventually realizes that the wizard Saruman is possessing Marwen, and assists Lithariel in freeing her from his control. Talion, however, still carries out Saruman's plan, leading an army of mind-controlled orcs in an assault against the Black Hand's stronghold at Ered Glamhoth. However, rather than the Black Hand, Talion finds the Tower of Sauron waiting for him.
