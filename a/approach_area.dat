25|$|The Russian {{report was}} {{published}} on 12 January 2011, and the Polish report was published on 29 July 2011. Both reports placed {{the majority of}} the blame for the accident on the pilots for descending too low without being able to see the ground. The Polish report also placed harsh criticism on the organization of Poland's special aviation regiment and its leaders, as well as finding deficiencies in the performance of the Russian air traffic controllers and in the airport's lighting and <b>approach</b> <b>area.</b> In Polish discourse, there remained wider questions and unease about the potential causes of the crash. This prompted a Warsaw court and a separate military investigation. Some of the unease subsequently fueled conspiracy theories revolving around aspects of the investigation, such as Russia's decision not to return the Polish plane wreckage to Poland. In the aftermath of the accident, Russia published a large number of restricted documents on the Katyn massacre, and declassified and published many more. Additionally, the Russian State Duma issued a declaration blaming Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and other leaders for ordering the Katyn massacre. Subsequent Katyn memorials have been joint Russian/Polish affairs attended by the leaders of both countries.|$|E
2500|$|A candlepin bowling lane, almost {{identical}} to a tenpin bowling lane, has an <b>approach</b> <b>area</b> of [...] for the player to bowl from, and then the lane proper, a maple surface approximately [...] wide, bounded on either side by a gutter (or [...] "channel", or trough.) The lane is separated from the approach by a [...] "foul line" [...] common to almost all bowling sports, which must not be crossed by players. At {{the far end of}} the lane are the pins, [...] from the foul line to the center of the headpin (or pin #1), placed by a machine called a pinsetter which occupies space both above and behind the pins. Unlike a tenpin lane, which has a level surface all the way from the foul line end of the lane's approach to the back end of the lanebed's [...] "pin deck", a candlepin lane has a hard-surfaced [...] "pin plate" [...] where the pins are set up, with the pin plate depressed [...] below the lanebed forward of it. The pin plate can be made from hard-surfaced metal, [...] "phenolic", [...] "high density plastic", or a [...] "synthetic" [...] material. Behind the pin plate area of a candlepin lane is a well-depressed [...] "pit" [...] area for the felled pins and balls to fall into. A heavy rubber backstop, faced with a black curtain, catches the flying pins and balls so they may drop into the pit. Generally there is seating behind the <b>approach</b> <b>area</b> for teammates, spectators, and score keeping.|$|E
2500|$|Closer {{investigations}} of Jarlsberg {{showed that the}} airport was not suitable for expansion. The airport had been expanded in 1950, receiving a [...] runway. An air station for Republic F-84 Thunderjet fighter jets would require a [...] runway, and due to surrounding hills this was not possible at Jarlsberg. Instead, the military looked at Langåker and Torp as possible locations. However, the military did note that Jarlsberg {{would be easier to}} defend, but that the defensibility was correlated to the rugged terrain that made expansion difficult. Torp was also preferred due to its close proximity to the European Route E18, and the Vestfold Line and Råstad Station. The choice of location was approved by NATO on 6 September 1952, and by the Cabinet of Norway on 12 September. It was unanimously passed by Parliament on 18 October, with only Torgeir Andreas Berge speaking up against the location. Berge, who lived within the <b>approach</b> <b>area</b> of the airport, was concerned about noise pollution affecting the local population.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{obstacle to}} the development of a generalized sump design is the variability of flow conditions in <b>approach</b> <b>areas.</b> The geometry and alignment of the areas immediately upstream of the sumps are so closely tied to the requirements of the specific site that it is virtually impossible to standardize their design. Flow conditions in <b>approach</b> <b>areas,</b> therefore, have to be evaluated on a case by case basis to determine their impact on the hydraulic performance of the respective pump sumps. This paper presents a case study of one particular sump design, developed through hydraulic model testing, which was highly dependent on approach flow conditions. The case study illustrates the effect on hydraulic performance and sump configuration of several design features and site constraints prevalent in <b>approach</b> <b>areas.</b> The study concludes that significant deviations from current design practices will be required to attain a generalized sump design...|$|R

The cruise not only mapped the variable morphology of the SW <b>Approaches</b> <b>area,</b> but also investigated the biological communities within the canyon system {{for the assessment of}} potential Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) under the EC Habitats and Birds Directive (Annex I) (Johnston et al. 2002). The cruise also tested the application of the survey standards and protocols developed under the MESH project.

2500|$|A {{separate}} elevator {{next to the}} turntable transports {{the balls}} to the ball return system, which has a near-vertical ramp that the balls roll down to gain enough momentum to roll through either an above-lane or submerged trough back up the alley, entering the ball return rack next to the <b>approach</b> <b>area</b> where players can grab them. Bowl Mor pinsetters are stocked with 24 to 27 pins, and are deemed substantially more reliable than typical Ten-pin bowling pinsetters. Due to the playing rules of candlepin bowling allowing fallen [...] "dead wood" [...] pins {{to remain on the}} lane between each ball's roll, no provision has ever been made for [...] "spotting cells" [...] in a candlepin pinsetter's spotting table, simplifiying the machines' design. Most parts of the machine are driven by chains – especially the sweep board's drive system, on two L-shaped tracks {{on either side of the}} unit – or belts. A Bowl Mor unit weighs approximate , and draws 24 amperes at 110 volts from three-wire 110-220 volt service mains. The ICBA lists the cost of a refurbished Bowl Mor unit at approximately $5000.|$|E

Based on cockpit conversations and weather data, the NTSB also concluded that while light snow and 1-mile visibility was reported to the pilots from the Bradford airport, weather conditions and visibility may have been substantially worse in the final <b>approach</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
