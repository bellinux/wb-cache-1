5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan did not believe in either global or strongpoint containment; he simply wanted to restore the balance of power between the United States <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E

5|$|In {{the postwar}} era, Poland, Spain, and Germany {{developed}} or re-established many well-respected Arabian stud farms.

During the 1950s, the Russians also obtained additional horses from Egypt to augment their breeding programs.|$|E
5|$|The 1945 Allied {{conference in}} San Francisco {{established}} the multi-national United Nations (UN) {{for the maintenance}} of world peace, but the enforcement capacity of its Security Council was effectively paralyzed by individual members' ability to use veto power.

5|$|The wartime Allies {{initially}} {{worked together}} {{under the auspices of}} the Allied Control Council (ACC) for Germany.

In May 1949, the three western occupation zones were merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) with a freely elected government. The Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR), under communist rule.|$|E
5|$|East–West {{tensions}} rapidly subsided {{through the}} mid-to-late 1980s, culminating {{with the final}} summit in Moscow in 1989, when Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush signed the START I arms control treaty. During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along {{with the cost of}} maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain. In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> officially declared that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of allied states in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|In the Soviet Union, {{both the}} Germans <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> spent {{the spring and}} early summer of 1943 {{preparing}} for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences and, {{for the first time in}} the war, Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success. This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month. Also, in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over 40,000 people.|$|E

Willy Brandt {{was a strong}} advocate of Speer's, supporting his release, sending flowers to his daughter {{on the day of}} his release, and putting an end to the de-Nazification proceedings against Speer, which could have caused his property to be confiscated. A reduced sentence required the consent of all four of the occupying powers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> adamantly opposed any such proposal. Speer served his full sentence, and was released at midnight on October1, 1966.|$|E
5|$|The east–west interzonal border became {{steadily}} more tense as {{the relationship}} between the Western Allies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> deteriorated. From September 1947, an increasingly strict regime was imposed on the eastern Soviet zone boundary. The number of Soviet soldiers on the boundary was increased and supplemented with border guards from the newly established East German Volkspolizei ("People's Police"). Many unofficial crossing points were blocked with ditches and barricades. The West Germans also stepped up security with the establishment in 1952 of the Federal Border Protection force of 20,000 men– the Bundesgrenzschutz, or BGS; however, Allied troops (the British in the north, the Americans in the south) retained responsibility for the military security of the border.|$|E
5|$|Volia was {{surrendered}} to the Germans in 1918, but {{they were forced to}} turn her over to the British by the terms of the Armistice. The British turned her over to the White Russians in 1919 and they used her to help evacuate the Crimea in 1920. She was interned in Bizerte by the French and ultimately scrapped by them in 1936 to pay her docking fees. Her guns were put into storage and were later used by the Germans and Finns for coastal artillery during World War II. The Finns <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> continued to use them throughout the Cold War.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Supreme <b>Soviet</b> {{consisted}} of two chambers: <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> of <b>the</b> Union <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> of Nationalities; both chambers had equal rights. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> of <b>the</b> Union <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> of Nationalities had {{an equal number of}} deputies. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> of <b>the</b> Union was elected by constituencies with equal populations; <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> of Nationalities was elected {{on the basis of the}} following representation: 32 deputies from each Union Republic, 11 deputies from each Autonomous Republic, five deputies from each Autonomous Region, and one deputy from each Autonomous Area. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> of <b>the</b> Union <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> of Nationalities (upon submission by the elected credentials commissions) had the power to decide the validity of the elected deputies' credentials, and (in cases where election law had been violated) would declare <b>the</b> election null <b>and</b> void.

5|$|Bure {{competed in}} his second World Juniors in 1990, winning a silver medal in Helsinki, Finland, and scoring seven goals in seven games. Later that year, he made his senior debut with the Soviet {{national}} team as a 19-year-old at the 1990 World Championships in Switzerland. He scored two goals and four assists in ten games to help the Soviets to a gold medal finish. The Soviet team also won silver in the European Championship, which was decided from games played among the European teams at the tournament. Several months later, in July, Bure took part in his third international tournament {{of the year at}} the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle. Bure scored four goals and an assist in five games, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> won the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of Operation Uranus, Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov {{deployed}} eleven Soviet armies. In an effort to bolster the offensive capabilities of the Stalingrad Front, over 420 tanks, 111,000 soldiers and 556 artillery guns were shipped over the Volga River {{in a period of}} three weeks. The Red Army and Red Air Force were able to amass over one million soldiers, 13,500 artillery guns, 890 tanks and 1,100 combat aircraft, organized into 66 rifle divisions, five tank corps, 14 tank brigades, a single mechanized brigade, a cavalry corps, and 127 artillery and mortar regiments. As the encirclement closed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> continued with secondary operations, the 51st Army was positioned {{on the edge of the}} outer encirclement with 34,000 men and 77 tanks. South of them was the 28th Army, with 44,000 soldiers, 40 tanks and 707 artillery guns and mortars. Concurrently, the Red Army began building its strength for Operation Saturn, in which it would aim to isolate and destroy German Army Group A in the Caucasus.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Bure {{appeared}} in his third and final World Junior Championships.

He finished his three-year World Junior career with a tournament-record 27 goals, to go with 39 points, in 21 games. Bure later competed in the 1991 World Championships, his second international appearance of the year. He improved on his previous year's total with 11 points in 11 games, tied for the team lead with Valeri Kamensky, and helped the Soviets to a bronze medal finish. Bure {{was named to the}} tournament's Second All-Star Team. The 1991 team marked the last World Championships for the USSR, as the country was dissolved later that year.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, Somali army {{officers}} led by Siad Barre {{carried out a}} bloodless coup in 1969, creating the socialist Somali Democratic Republic. The Soviet Union vowed to support Somalia. Four years later, the pro-American Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in a 1974 coup by the Derg, a radical group of Ethiopian {{army officers}} led by the pro-Soviet Mengistu Haile Mariam, who built up relations with the Cubans <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> When fighting between the Somalis and Ethiopians {{broke out in the}} 1977–1978 Somali-Ethiopian Ogaden War, Barre lost his Soviet support and turned to the Safari Club—a group of pro-American intelligence agencies including Iran, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia—for support and weapons. The Ethiopian military was supported by Cuban soldiers along with Soviet military advisors and armaments.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1969, Chinese forces {{started the}} Sino–Soviet border conflict. The Sino–Soviet split had chagrined Premier Alexei Kosygin a great deal, {{and for a}} while he refused to accept its irrevocability; he briefly visited Beijing in 1969 due to the {{increase}} of tension between the USSR and China. By the early 1980s, both the Chinese <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> were issuing statements calling for a normalisation of relations between the two states. The conditions given to the Soviets by the Chinese were the reduction of Soviet military presence in the Sino–Soviet border and the withdrawal of Soviets troops in Afghanistan and the Mongolian People's Republic and to end their support for the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. Brezhnev responded in his March 1982 speech in Tashkent where he called for the normalisation of relations. Full Sino–Soviet normalisations of relations would prove to take years, until the last Soviet ruler, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Soviet {{offensive}} {{continued in}} the north. The offensive liberated Kalinin <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> reached Klin on 7 December, overrunning {{the headquarters of the}} LVI Panzer Corps outside the city. As the Kalinin Front drove west, a bulge developed around Klin. The Soviet front commander, General Ivan Konev, attempted to envelop any German forces remaining. Zhukov diverted more forces to {{the southern end of the}} bulge, to help Konev trap the Third Panzer Army. The Germans pulled their forces out in time. Although the encirclement failed, it unhinged the German defenses. A second attempt was made against the Second Panzer Army near Tula, but met strong opposition near Rzhev and was forced to halt, forming a salient that would last until March 1943. In the south, the offensive went equally well, with Southwestern Front forces relieving Tula on 16 December 1941. A major achievement was the encirclement and destruction of the German XXXIX Corps, protecting Guderian's Second Panzer Army's southern flank.|$|E
