5|$|In 1981, {{around the}} time of U2's second, spiritually charged album, October, <b>a</b> <b>rift</b> was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members.

However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, and so was more of an outsider.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea that}} this {{gathering}} agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested {{that it was an}} important step in the gaelicisation of the lands east of Druim Alban.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>rift</b> {{opened and}} {{subsequently}} flooded {{the region as}} part of the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic (by about 755million years ago) and the creation of the Pacific Ocean. A shoreline similar to the present Atlantic Ocean margin of the United States lay to the east. An algal mat-covered carbonate bank was deposited, forming the Noonday Dolomite. Subsidence of the region occurred as the continental crust thinned and the newly formed Pacific widened, forming the Ibex Formation. An angular unconformity (an uneven gap in the geologic record) followed.|$|E
5|$|After Busch {{had spent}} six months with his uncle Kleine at Lüthorst, he {{expressed}} an aim to continue study in Munich. This request caused <b>a</b> <b>rift</b> with his father who, however, eventually funded this move; - see for comparison Busch's illustrated story of Painter Klecksel. Busch's expectations of the Munich Academy of Fine Arts were not met. His life became aimless; there were occasional return visits to Lüthorst, but contact with his parents had been broken off. In 1857 and 1858, as his position seemed to be without prospects, he contemplated emigration to Brazil to keep bees.|$|E

5|$|By early 1844, <b>a</b> <b>rift</b> {{developed}} between Smith {{and a half}} dozen of his closest associates. Most notably, William Law, Smith's trusted counselor, and Robert Foster, a general of the Nauvoo Legion, disagreed with Smith about how to manage Nauvoo's economy. Both also said that Smith had proposed marriage to their wives. Believing the dissidents were plotting against his life, Smith excommunicated them on April 18, 1844. These dissidents formed a competing church and the following month, at Carthage, the county seat, they procured indictments against Smith for perjury and polygamy.|$|E
5|$|By some accounts, Smith {{had been}} {{teaching}} a polygamy doctrine {{as early as}} 1831, and there is unconfirmed evidence that Smith was a polygamist by 1835. Although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy, in 1837 there was <b>a</b> <b>rift</b> between Smith and Oliver Cowdery over the issue. Cowdery suspected Smith had engaged {{in a relationship with}} his serving girl, Fanny Alger. Smith never denied a relationship, but insisted it was not adulterous, presumably because he had taken Alger as a plural wife.|$|E

5|$|De Gaulle {{decided that}} France, though {{formally}} remaining a member, {{would no longer}} participate in the NATO military organization. This caused <b>a</b> <b>rift</b> between France and West Germany, which then started to emphasize standardization with American equipment, especially in armament, and to follow the new NATO policy to use multifuel diesel engines. German defence minister Franz Josef Strauss began to oppose the common tank project. In July 1963, the defence committee of the German Bundesrat decided to procure a purely national tank. In response, the same month the French government decided likewise.|$|E
5|$|Del Valle {{was born}} in Jalisco, Mexico.

Ygnacio joined the army as a cadet in 1825 at the Presidio of Santa Barbara. In 1828 he was {{promoted}} to second lieutenant and transferred to the Presidio of San Diego. In 1832, his commander became involved in a power struggle with the commandant of the Presidio of Monterey, where Antonio served. Ygnacio's side won the conflict on the battlefield, causing <b>a</b> <b>rift</b> between father and son, and they never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, and {{particularly}} in the late 1950s, the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China adopted a strategy of destabilisation of Western powers by disruption of their hold on African colonies. Nikita Khrushchev, in particular, viewed the 'underdeveloped third of mankind' as a means to weaken the West. For the Soviets, Africa represented a chance to create <b>a</b> <b>rift</b> between western powers and their colonial assets, and create pro-communist states in Africa with which to foster future relations.|$|E

40|$|The MacLellan Au-Ag deposit, {{located in}} the Paleoproterozoic Lynn Lake greenstone belt of the Trans-Hudson Orogen, Manitoba, is hosted by a package of plagioclase-amphibole, chlorite-amphibole, and quartz-plagioclase-biotite schists that are {{considered}} to be representative of the geodynamic evolution of the northern section of the Lynn Lake greenstone belt. A combination of field and petrographic observations and high-precision trace element chemistry have identified the protoliths to the host rock sequence as transitional aluminous basalt with subordinate picrite and biotite-altered aluminous basalt, respectively. The Th-Nb-La-REE systematics of these rocks are consistent with <b>a</b> <b>rifted</b> continental margin environment. Volcanic rocks with similar Th-Nb-La-REE systematics to those from the MacLellan host rock sequence have been identified throughout the Lynn Lake region. Therefore, it is proposed that the Lynn Lake greenstone belt represents <b>a</b> <b>rifted</b> continental margin and based on this revised geodynamic model, the mineral potential of the belt should be reassessed...|$|R
5|$|From its inception, the Progressive League {{was plagued}} by {{internal}} conflict between Progressives (former Moderate Conservatives) and Historicals (former Liberals). All of the cabinets formed by the League after 1862 were short-lived. The Paraguayan invasion in 1864 led to a conflict far longer than expected, increasing tensions within the party. By 1868, <b>a</b> <b>rift</b> had opened between the Marquis of Caxias (then Commander-in-Chief of Brazilian forces in the war) and the Progressive Cabinet. With its credibility for prosecuting the war now vanished, the Cabinet resigned and the Emperor called the Conservatives back into power on 16 July 1868. Once again Paranhos—who was extraordinary member of the Council of State since 18 August 1866—became Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died.

He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 against the advice of his brothers John and William. <b>A</b> <b>rift</b> between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help account for this surprising decision.

5|$|In 1984, Sinatra {{worked with}} Quincy Jones {{for the first}} time in nearly two decades on the album, L.A. Is My Lady, which was well {{received}} critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, which had to be abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, <b>a</b> <b>rift</b> developed between them and the two never spoke again.|$|E
