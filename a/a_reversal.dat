5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E
5|$|Decorated rustication. Sebastiano Serlio had {{decorated}} the blocks of ashlar in his rustication; {{by the end}} of the 16th century, Sicilian architects were ornamenting the blocks with carvings of leaves, fish-scales, and even sweets and shells; shells were later to become among the most prevalent ornamental symbols of Baroque design. Sometimes the rustication would be used for pillars rather than walls, <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> of expectations and almost an architectural joke (illustration 2).|$|E
5|$|For the Americans, Laos {{became almost}} {{exclusively}} an air war, one which saw <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> {{of the role}} it played in the conflict in neighboring South Vietnam. In Laos, the Air Force applied conventional air power in the support of an unconventional ground war. The mission of the U.S. Air Force was to seal off the southern Mekong River Valley, thus providing a buffer for Thailand; insulating the Vientiane government from direct communist threat; draining PAVN manpower and resources; and interdiction of the approaches to the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E

5|$|Guillemin was {{a member}} of the team that beat Scotland at Colombes in 1911 and won France's first victory in the Five Nations. After all the {{previous}} French losses to the Home Nations teams, the Scottish were favourites to win, and France's unexpected win was considered a great occasion by the French press. It proved <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> of the defeats, accompanied with humiliating press commentary which suggested that the French were too idle and debauched to produce a team worthy of their British opponents.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{twenty years}} after the battle, President Ivo Josipović {{presented}} the Charter of the Republic of Croatia to the commanders and units involved in the battle, commending their military achievements. That was the first such move in twenty years, and <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> of the official stance towards the offensive which had originally declared it as an unauthorised deployment of the HV.|$|E
5|$|In August 1954 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{sponsored}} {{a tour of}} the south by Buth Diu of the Southern Liberal Party. In his speeches Buth Diu quoted NUP campaign promises supporting a Federal system in which the southern provinces would have considerable autonomy. Prime minister Azhari described this as seditious talk and threatened to use force to prevent secession from Sudan by the south. In May 1955 Isma'il al-Azhari announced that Sudan would seek complete independence, <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> of the earlier NUP position in favor of union with Egypt.|$|E

5|$|In the Treaty of Roskilde {{two years}} earlier, Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} to cede the Danish provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge, the island of Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces Trøndelag and Båhuslen. The Treaty of Copenhagen reaffirmed the Swedish rule over Scania, Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän, while Bornholm and Trøndelag were returned. It was a {{significant}} victory for Denmark-Norway, but it did not result in <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> of the costly earlier peace. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present.|$|E
5|$|Later, Gil {{is taken}} to a {{solarium}} to receive the sun's healing rays. While he naps, he transforms into a reptilian creature, horrifying the other patients. Fleeing from the scene, Gil discovers his new appearance. Stern notifies Ann and Dr. Buckell about the incident, theorizing that the exposure to radiation caused <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> of evolution, transforming Gil into a prehistoric reptile after exposure to sunlight. Stern suggests that Gil can control his symptoms by staying {{in the dark and}} remaining in the hospital, but admits that the patient cannot be held against his will.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 2008, it was {{announced}} that the pro-Western Boris Tadić won the 2008 Serbian presidential election. The 2008 elections were particularly important to Serbia's relations with the United States, as the main challenging party which lost the election, SRS, disintegrated when Tomislav Nikolić split with Vojislav Šešelj over integration into the European Union. When Nikolić split from SRS and began pursuing a pro-European profile (<b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> from SRS's eurosceptic position), he was being advised by American lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie & Associates.|$|E

5|$|Reagan {{escalated}} the Cold War, accelerating <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> {{from the}} policy of détente which began in 1979 after the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Reagan ordered a massive buildup of the United States Armed Forces and implemented new policies towards the Soviet Union: reviving the B-1 Lancer program that had been canceled by the Carter administration, and producing the MX missile. In response to Soviet deployment of the SS-20, Reagan oversaw NATO's deployment of the Pershing missile in West Germany.|$|E
5|$|Soma Bringer was the {{creation}} of producer and studio co-founder Tetsuya Takahashi. Initially a standard role-playing game before transitioning to action role-playing due to hardware restrictions, the aim was to create an engaging multiplayer experience: this resulted in the gameplay being developed before the story, <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> of the development style used for earlier Monolith Soft titles. It featured returning staff from Takahashi's earlier titles, including Xeno series writer Soraya Saga, and Chrono series composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Development took approximately two years.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{geophysical}} event which can affect [...] production: geomagnetic reversals and polarity excursions. In <b>a</b> geomagnetic <b>reversal,</b> the Earth's geomagnetic field weakens and stays weak for thousands of years during the transition to the opposite magnetic polarity and then regains strength as the <b>reversal</b> completes. <b>A</b> polarity excursion, which can be either global or local, is a shorter-lived version of <b>a</b> geomagnetic <b>reversal.</b> <b>A</b> local excursion would not significantly affect 14C production. During either <b>a</b> geomagnetic <b>reversal</b> or <b>a</b> global polarity excursion, [...] production increases during the period when the geomagnetic field is weak. It is fairly certain, though, that in the last 50,000 years there have been no geomagnetic reversals or global polarity excursions.|$|R
5|$|The {{agreements}} to containerise Cunard's freight operations had returned the overall Cunard group to profitability, with the shipping line now profitable and the passenger ships losing money, <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> {{of the situation}} Smallpeice had inherited in 1965. The company returned profits of £2 million in 1968 and £3 million in 1969 and the share price rose accordingly. The downturn {{in the economy and}} shipping industry in 1970 resulted in Cunard once again incurring a loss and a drop in the share price, resulting in the company becoming a takeover target.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was last}} {{referred}} to in active use in 1316, after which it was probably allowed to decay; further stonework {{was taken by the}} keeper of Rockingham Forest in 1373, by which time the castle had probably been abandoned. By the 15th century, Sauvey formed a subsidiary property of Withcote manor - <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> of the old land holding pattern.

5|$|With {{the basic}} concept proven, the team then {{looked for a}} {{suitable}} aircraft to carry the receiver. Martlesham provided a Handley Page Heyford bomber, <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> of duties from the original Daventry Experiment {{that led to the}} development of CH in which a Heyford was the target. One reason for the selection of this design was that its Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines had a well-shielded ignition system which gave off minimal electrical noise.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>reversal</b> {{agent for}} benzodiazepines exists, {{flumazenil}} (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought <b>a</b> <b>reversal</b> of the territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E
