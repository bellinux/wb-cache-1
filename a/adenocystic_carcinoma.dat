40|$|Cancer complicates {{approximately}} 0. 1 % of all pregnancies. Primary tracheal carcinoma {{is one of}} {{very rarely}} seen tumors {{and the rate of}} its being seen makes up approximately % 0, 2 of all tumors of respiratory tract. The patient, 28 years old, who has 28 -weeks-pregnant, was diagnosed with primary tracheal <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> Patient was made operation as thoracotomy and tracheal tumor was removed at the 28 th week of pregnancy. Patient was delivered with sectio abdominale at the 39 th week of pregnancy. Primary tracheal <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinoma</b> is very rarely seen tumors and it is the first tracheal ACC with pregnancy case in literature to have been detected and surgically treated during pregnancy. We discussed primary tracheal <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and tracheal tumors during pregnancy with literature...|$|E
40|$|This {{case report}} of an <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the palatal glands draws {{attention}} to the marked pleomorphism which lesions of this type may display histologically. Throughout much of the tumor tissue the microscopic features appeared benign, whereas in the deepest parts the more classic histologic appearance of adenocystic carcinomas was in evidence. Small incisional biopsy specimens, representing only superficial portions of the tumor, may mean very little in these cases. The use of a planned biopsy-excision technique is advocated and is illustrated in the case described here...|$|E
40|$|Samples from medullary, intraductal, tubular and <b>adenocystic</b> breast <b>carcinomas</b> {{were studied}} ultrastructurally, with {{emphasis}} on the patterns of myoepithelial differentiation and basal lamina deposition. Myoepithelial cells, while prominent in the intraductal and <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> were rarely found in the medullary neoplasms and appeared absent in the tubular neoplasms. Parallel to the above, basal laminae were most abundant and evenly deposited in the intraductal and adenocystic tumors, but were infrequent in the medullary tumors and seemingly absent in the tubular carcinomas. Well-defined myoepithelial cells and retention of the capability to synthesize basal lamina are evidence of differentiation in neoplastic cell populations. Thus, their presence in intraductal and <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (generally associated with a good prognosis) is not surprising. However, their scarcity or absence in the similarly favorable group of medullary and tubular carcinomas suggests that other factors may also influence the invasive and metastasizing ability of breast carcinomas...|$|R
40|$|Background: Head {{and neck}} cancers {{are among the}} top ten {{malignancies}} worldwide. Their true extent is lacking in Ghana. There is no known published data covering the subject among Ghanaians. Aim: To determine the incidence of primary head and neck cancers seen at Korle Bu Teaching hospital, Ghana. Methods: A retrospective study of histopathological records of diagnosed head and neck cancers from 1989 - 2008. Results: 2, 041 of 4, 546 reports were malignant. 1342 were primary cancers. These were studied further in detail. The male: female ratio was 1. 84 : 1. The oldest patient was 95 years and the youngest less than 1 year. The mean age was 45. 08 years with a peak age-group of 51 to 60. The incidence of tumours in female exceeded that of male in only one age-group (81 - 90), with a ratio of 0. 62 : 1. There were 59 different tumours. 45 of these occurred less than 5 times. Of those diagnosed, more than 5 times <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma occurred more frequently in females than males. 23 occurred only once. Squamous cell carcinoma (n= 624) was the commonest pathology, followed by non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n= 256), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (n= 100), Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n= 97) and <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (n= 55). Conclusion: We observed a rising incidence of head and neck cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma is the commonest, occurring more commonly in men than women. The gender ratio {{is similar to that}} seen in most countries. This study offers a benchmark for future studies, planning resources and monitoring the efficiency of efforts to manage the different pathologies...|$|E
40|$|Ectopic thyroid rest {{can be seen}} {{anywhere}} {{along the}} path of descent of the gland. The most ectopic thyroid tissue is a thyroglossal duct cyst associated with normal thyroid gland. Sublingual location is less common than a lingual ectopia. True malignant transformation in ectopic thyroid tissue is extremely rare. Such a malignancy is virtually always diagnosed only after surgical excision of the lesion at pathological examination. This report discusses a case of ectopic thyroid follicular carcinoma in the right submandibular region {{in the absence of}} orthotopic thyroid, discovered by chance after the surgical excision performed for a preoperative ultrasonically and cytologically misdiagnosed submandibular gland <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> The possible aetiology of such an unusual anatomical relationship is discussed as well as the importance of thyroid scanning, ultrasound and/or CT in neck lumps...|$|E
40|$|MUCH {{attention}} {{has recently been}} given to the aetiology and treatment of lower respiratory tract tumours, particularly lung cancer. Possible aetiological factors have been related to histological appearances by some pathologists, particularly Kreyberg (1961), while others have declared that histological typing of such tumours is of little value (Barnard, 1938; Phillips, Basinger and Adams, 1950; Willis, 1960; Umiker and French, 1960). It therefore seemed necessary to determine whether these differences in histological structure were of importance. This has been carried out by comparing the biological features of each histological type. The study has been based upon 694 tumours submitted for examination to the Department of Pathology, University of Birmingham, during the years 1948 - 1954 inclusive. The tissue came from bronchial biopsies, surgical resections and autopsies. It was classified histologically in the manner previously described (Shinton, 1961), the main groups being squamous-cell carcinoma, basal (oat) -cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> carcinoid tumours, adenochondromas, benign and malignant mesenchymal tumours. Classification was made accordin...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} frequency of oral cancer in Congo (Zaire) was 2. 1 %. 2. Anatomical sites and histological type Table 1 {{shows that the}} palate (26. 4 %) and the tongue (20. 1 %) were the most affected sites by oral cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma (57. 6 %) was the most frequent histological type, followed by <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (12. 5 %) and Kaposi’s sarcoma (10. 4 %). 3. Age and sex distribution of oral cancer Table 2 shows that the most affected age group by oral cancer was between 50 and 59 years (27 %) with a means of 42. 39 ± 15. 43 years (Range: 6 months- 76 years). The six-month-old patient was diagnosed with Kaposi’s sarcoma. Concerning the sex, we had 32 male and 68 female cases representing a sex ratio MF 0. 47 / 1. The sex was not reported in 44 cases. Squamous cell carcinoma in particular showed the same figure. People between 50 And 59 years (19 %) {{with a mean of}} 46. 20 ± 13. 41 (Range: 10 - 76 years) were more affected. More females were recorded than males (M/F = 0. 5 / 1) ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (ACC) of {{the head}} and of the neck is rather uncommon. It is {{characterized}} by a very slow biological behaviour, which leads to locoregional recurrences and distant metastasis. Most reports concentrate on the unpredictable long-term behaviour of this tumor, whereas lymph nodes metastasis are not usually discussed in detail. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the difficulties connected with the lymph node metastasis in ACC. A group of 33 patients from 1980 to 1998, was observed. These patients have been subjected to surgical treatment in the Maxillo-Facial Surgery Department of the Policlinico-Umberto I of Rome. Among 33 patients with ACC, 10 patients (30 %) revealed, initially or during observation, cervical lymph node metastasis, which is a most common event in male subjects (70 %). The lymph node involvement is much more common in carcinomas localized in the parotid and in the sublingual glands with a solid rather than a tubular histologic pattern. Direct correlation between age and metastasis lymph node involvement have not been documented. Surgery for node disease has a very little impact on the locoregional and on the distant metastasis evolution of the tumor. Thus, our protocol of treatment of lymph nodes metastatic lesions follows the trend of most of the international authors, considering that the neck dissection should be performed only with a lymph adenopathy clinically evident or strongly suspected...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} It {{is very difficult}} to deal with the comprehensive central airway diseases, especially the malignant airway obstruction. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the clinical effects of multiple interventional bronchoscopies for the treatment of 112 cases with comprehensive malignant central airway diseases so as to evaluate the clinical applications of thermoablation and cryosurgery. Methods The 112 cases with malignant airway diseases retrospectively reviewed for bronchoscopic interventions performed in more than two lesions of carina and/or bifurcation. The age was from 22 to 90 years, which including 55 cases with squamous carcinoma (SQ), 16 adenocarcinoma (AD), 15 <b>adenocystic</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (ACC), 10 metastasis tumor (MT), 8 small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and 8 mixed carcinoma (MC). All bronchoscopic interventions such as argon plasma coagulation (APC), cryosurgery, electronic snare and stenting were performed under rigid bronchoscopy combined with electric bronchoscopy in general anesthesia. Results The 460 bronchoscopic procedures were successfully performed in 112 cases. Cryosurgery and APC were the most used in every group. Stent was more common in patients with MT, balloon dilation was more common in patients with ACC and AD. Electric snare and radioactive seeds implantation were frequently used in cases with SCLC. Trachea stricture is more severe in MT than that in others, while bronchus stricture is more severe than that of trachea in SQ and ACC group. Karnofsky performance score (KPS) is lower and shortness of breath score (SBS) is higher in MC, MT and SCLC group. Trachea and bronchus stricture is improved after comprehensive treatment in 5 groups except of mixed group. KPS increased and SS decreased significantly in 5 groups except of adenocarcinoma. In follow-up, the overall survival time (OS) is 15 months and median survival time is 10 months, especially OS is 28. 4 months in ACC and 21. 7 months in AD, 8. 9 months in SCLC and 7. 4 months in mixed group. Conclusion APC combination with Cryosurgery and other bronchoscopic interventions are indicated for the treatment of complex or difficult airway diseases whether they are located in trachea or bronchus. It is a safe and rapid during procedure...|$|E
