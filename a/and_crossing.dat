5|$|August 28, 1968– A {{tropical}} depression stalls {{along the western}} coastline near Tampa before turning to the northeast <b>and</b> <b>crossing</b> the state. It drops heavy rainfall, including 15inches (381mm) in Jacksonville, resulting in extensive localized flooding. The depression also spawns a tornado near Daytona Beach which destroys a motel and several houses.|$|E

An excavation in 1930 found evidence of road ditches on this alignment.|$|E

40|$|Many {{transportation}} agencies maintain grade as {{an attribute}} in roadway inventory databases; however, {{the information is}} often in an aggregated format. Cross slope is rarely included in large roadway inventories. Accurate methods available to collect grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope include global positioning systems, traditional surveying, and mobile mapping systems. However, most agencies {{do not have the}} resources to utilize these methods to collect grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope on a large scale. This report discusses the use of LIDAR to extract roadway grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope for large-scale inventories. Current data collection methods and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. A pilot study to extract grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope from a LIDAR data set, including methodology, results, and conclusions, is presented. This report describes the regression methodology used to extract and evaluate the accuracy of grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope from three dimensional surfaces created from LIDAR data. The use of LIDAR data to extract grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope on tangent highway segments was evaluated and compared against grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope collected using an automatic level for 10 test segments along Iowa Highway 1. Grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope were measured from a surface model created from LIDAR data points collected for the study area. While grade could be estimated to within 1...|$|R

5|$|While in {{most cases}} a Norman church entirely {{replaced}} a Saxon one, at Ripon the cathedral uniquely retains its early Saxon crypt, while a similar crypt also survives below the former cathedral of Hexham. At Winchester the excavated foundations of the 10th-century cathedral – when built, the largest church in northern Europe – are marked on grass of the cathedral close. At Worcester, a new cathedral {{was built in the}} Norman style from 1084, but the crypt contains re-used stonework and columns from its two Saxon predecessor churches. Elsewhere, the abbey church of Sherborne preserves much masonry from the former Saxon cathedral, in the west front, transepts <b>and</b> <b>crossing,</b> so that the nave <b>and</b> <b>crossing</b> of present late medieval abbey retains the proportions of the previous Saxon structure.|$|E

5|$|Another {{significant}} human {{impact is}} roadkill—dead turtles, especially females, are commonly seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads genetically isolate some populations. Localities {{have tried to}} limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway barriers, <b>and</b> <b>crossing</b> signs. Oregon has introduced public education on turtle awareness, safe swerving, and safely assisting turtles across the road.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} sketch {{interpreter}} system with shading <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> section lines for 3 D freeform design. The input strokes are classi¯ed into three types: outlines (contour lines), shading lines <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> section lines. The outline {{is used to}} generate the basic rounded shape. The shading lines <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> section lines are used as control lines that are drawn inside the contour to modify the 3 D shape. In order to e®ectively extract 3 D information from the shading <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> section lines, we analyze di®erent representations and deformations of the shading <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> section lines <b>and</b> classify them into three cases: convex, concave and `upheaving'. Each deformation is drawn by hand and transferred to a 3 D shape {{according to the rules}} proposed in this paper. We evaluate our sketch interpreter system for various objects from concept sketches and present our results...|$|R

30|$|Global {{trend towards}} {{sustainable}} developments have brought natural, renewable biodegradable raw material into the focus, {{but due to}} lack of technical knowhow, {{only a small fraction of}} these non-conventional fibres are harvested and utilized. In this study we have developed parallel laid 100 % banana nonwoven fabric <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid banana/polypropylene (60 : 40) nonwoven fabric. Three varieties of banana fibers namely Mahalaxmi, Shrimanti and Graint Naine were used for needle punched non-woven fabric preparations. Analysis of physical properties is carried out in machine direction <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> direction. This paper concludes that cross laid nonwoven fabric show superior tensile properties as compared to parallel laid nonwoven fabric. Shrimanti fibre nonwoven fabric is stronger than Graint Naine and Mahalaxmi fibre nonwoven fabric for both the parallel laid <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid structure. Parallel laid Mahalaxmi banana nonwoven fabric <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid Graint Naine banana nonwoven fabric gives higher elongation% for machine <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> direction. Increased air permeability of cross laid (60 : 40) banana/polypropylene non-woven fabric observed than parallel laid 100 % banana non-woven fabric. Parallel laid Graint Naine non-woven fabric showed higher air permeability than Shrimanti and Mahalaxmi parallel laid non-woven fabric. Bursting strength of parallel laid nonwoven fabric is higher, both in the machine as well as in cross direction than cross laid nonwoven fabric for three varieties of banana fibres. Shrimanti banana non-woven fabric showed higher bursting strength for parallel laid <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid structure than Graint Naine and Mahalaxmi parallel laid <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid structure.|$|R
