With no information on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.|$|E

They <b>also</b> <b>realize</b> that their equipment will be mostly modernized versions of current {{equipment for the}} rest of the decade. Technologies from the GCV program are being explored, although development and procurement of a vehicle is not. By mid-November 2013, both BAE and General Dynamics designs had passed Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR), but neither company had commenced building prototypes. The Army was increasingly willing to slow down the GCV program or push it back from EMD to research and development. While the Army had said previously that it was their highest priority acquisition program, they had since shifted their main modernization priority to an integrated electronic command network. Short-term incremental upgrades will be applied to existing weapons systems to keep them from becoming obsolete, and advanced technologies available in the future will be used to build entirely new systems when funding is restored.|$|E

Kierkegaard had already discussed anger in his Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 where he quoted The Epistle of James, Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, because man’s anger does not work what is righteous before God. (James 1:17-22) Earlier in the same discourse he had discussed equality. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. He asks pointed questions, [...] "Did the woman who was a sinner feel her guilt more deeply when the scribes were accusing her than when there was no accuser anymore and she stood alone before the Lord! But you <b>also</b> <b>realize</b> that the most dangerously deceived person is the one who is self-deceived, that the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge, and, furthermore, that it is a lamentable weakness to have one’s consolation in another’s light-mindedness, {{but it is also a}} lamentable weakness to have one’s terror from another’s heavy-mindedness.

2500|$|The game {{takes place}} {{two years after}} the events of Ghostbusters II during Thanksgiving Day in 1991. The Ghostbusters, now {{official}} city contractors, are training a new recruit, whom Dr. Venkman insists they simply call [...] "Rookie" [...] so they don't get too attached in case something should happen to the new hire while testing out experimental equipment. A large PKE shockwave then hits New York City and sends the team on a variety of calls to capture ghosts that result from it, including Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Throughout these calls, they are hounded by Walter Peck, now head of the Paranormal Contracts Oversight Commission (PCOC, pronounced [...] "peacock") as appointed by Mayor Jock Mulligan, who warns them about causing too much damage in their ghost capturing activities. The Ghostbusters discover through a series of adventures and encounters with museum curator Dr. Ilyssa Selwyn (Alyssa Milano) that Ivo Shandor, the architect who designed the building at 55 Central Park West that was once used to summon Gozer, had also designed a network of tunnels to channel ectoplasmic slime through the city that was used by Vigo the Carpathian. The Ghostbusters <b>also</b> <b>realize</b> that Shandor placed personally-renovated buildings above the tunnels to act as nodes on a mandala to merge the real world with the Ghost World and bring forth another Great Destructor like Gozer. The Ghostbusters help to destroy the nodes and capture the node guardians at the Sedgewick Hotel, the New York Public Library, and the Museum of Natural History, which was hosting a Gozer exhibit with artifacts donated by Shandor's estate. At the last node {{in the middle of the}} Hudson River they discover a mansion on an island rising from the water. As they explore it, they find that the island belonged to Shandor and that Ilyssa is his descendant. They also discover machines pumping the slime into the tunnel network and disable them as well as the final Mandala node, and escape the island just before it sinks back into the water.|$|E
2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't know until we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you <b>also</b> <b>realize</b> he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
