5|$|Weakening as {{it crossed}} the peninsula, Dean emerged into the Bay of Campeche and re-strengthened {{before making a}} second {{landfall}} in Veracruz. Although the second landfall did not bring winds <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> as the first, it brought more rainfall and caused devastating landslides in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco. Between the two landfalls, Dean caused MXN$2billion (US$184million; 2007dollars) of damage and killed 13people.|$|E
5|$|Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese, {{a teenage}} refugee and admirer of John Connor and the Resistance. As portrayed by Michael Biehn in The Terminator, {{he was sent}} {{back in time to}} 1984 to protect Sarah Connor to ensure the {{survival}} of the human race, and fathered John with her. Yelchin said he wanted to portray Kyle as Biehn did and not make him appear weaker because it was a younger version of the character. The difference in his portrayal lies in showing Kyle <b>as</b> <b>intense,</b> but not concentrated until he joins the resistance proper. Yelchin tried to convey Kyle's intensity by focusing on how fast Biehn appeared when running in the original film.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Geralda (also known <b>as</b> <b>Intense</b> Tropical Cyclone Geralda) was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that caused catastrophic damage in Madagascar in late January 1994, among the strongest to hit the country. It originated from an {{area of low pressure}} over the Indian Ocean on January25. Over the following few days, the depression underwent gradual intensification, reaching its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph) on January 31. Cyclone Geralda made landfall near Toamasina, Madagascar after weakening from its peak intensity. Within hours of moving onshore, the system had substantially weakened, and by February5, Geralda had degenerated into a land depression, and it became extratropical three days later.|$|E
5|$|Due to Fort Corcoran's {{large size}} and {{proximity}} to Georgetown, duty {{as part of}} the fort's garrison was less of a hardship than it was at many of the more isolated forts in the defenses of Washington, such as Fort Greble. Morale and sanitation officers often visited Fort Corcoran, and leave to visit Georgetown or Washington was sometimes granted to both officers and enlisted men. Men at the fort served in regimental bands or played baseball in their spare time between periods of infantry and gunnery drill. Due to Fort Corcoran's location behind the Arlington Line, however, drill was not <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> as at many front-line fort.|$|E
5|$|Goldfrapp {{signed a}} {{recording}} contract with London-based record label Mute Records in August 1999. The pair began recording their debut album over a six-month period, beginning in September 1999, {{in a rented}} bungalow in the Wiltshire countryside. The recording process was difficult for Alison Goldfrapp, who was often alone and disturbed by the mice and insects in the bungalow. Gregory described their recording sessions <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> because he was unaccustomed to composing with others. Goldfrapp contributed the album's lyrics, and Gregory and Goldfrapp composed the music together. The lyrics are abstract obsessional tales inspired by films, Goldfrapp's childhood, and the loneliness she felt while recording the album. Musically, the album takes influence {{from a variety of}} styles including 1960s pop, cabaret, folk, and electronica.|$|E

5|$|The {{tropical}} depression initially moved northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a ridge over Mexico. Convection continued to develop {{to the west}} of the center, and late on August 23, a ship report confirmed the depression intensified Tropical Storm Julio. Initially, the persistent shear left the center partially exposed from the thunderstorm activity, though upper level conditions gradually became more favorable for strengthening. On August 24, Tropical Storm Julio attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> convection developed near the center. Shortly thereafter, the center became difficult to locate, and late on August 24 the storm moved ashore along the southwestern coast of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The volcano's {{observed}} {{history has}} mostly {{been one of}} effusive eruptions; however, this is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the first Europeans on the island, Kīlauea was the site of regular explosive activity, evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano's fickle nature, and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity. Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano, it is not <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> as it once was, and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more.|$|E
5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme weather events (such <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E

25|$|Water absorbs {{light of}} long {{wavelengths}}, so less light from these wavelengths reflects back {{to reach the}} eye. Therefore, warm colors from the visual light spectrum appear less vibrant at increasing depths. Water scatters light of shorter wavelengths, meaning cooler colors dominate the visual field in the photic zone. Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> {{as it is on}} the surface, and is only 1% <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> at 150 m as it is on the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light they are capable of absorbing, are better suited to different depths. Theoretically, some fish eyes can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the aphotic zone, the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} paper was to determine, from four model cheeses differing in fat content and {{firmness}} and consumed by fourteen well characterised subjects, the respective impacts of in vivo aroma release, bolus rheology, chewing activity, mouth coating and salivary composition on dynamic aroma perception. The originality of the approach is that it considers all the parameters together {{and is able to}} evaluate their relative contribution using multi-block partial least square (MB-PLS) regression. The fruity aroma perception of the more hydrophilic compound (ethyl propanoate) was related to its dynamic release parameters before swallowing whereas the blue cheese aroma perception of the more hydrophobic compound (nonan- 2 -one) was related to its dynamic release parameters after swallowing and was highly impacted by mouth coating. Moreover the MB-PLS approach made it possible to evidence the combined effects of saliva composition and cross-modal interactions to understand why in some cases dynamic aroma perception could not be explained by dynamic in vivo aroma release data. Subjects with a low sodium content in saliva perceived fruity aroma which is not congruent with saltiness <b>as</b> less <b>intense</b> and salt-congruent (blue cheese) aroma <b>as</b> more <b>intense,</b> which was explained by their higher sensitivity to salt. Subjects with high lipolysis activity perceived fruity aroma which is not congruent to fat <b>as</b> less <b>intense</b> and fat-congruent (blue cheese) aroma <b>as</b> more <b>intense,</b> which should be explained by the link between lipolysis activity and fat sensitivity. These results could be considered for the reformulation of foods towards specific populations taking into account nutritional recommendations...|$|R
