5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Takechi {{turned from the}} stage to the cinema. Though the {{mainstream}} film industry considered Takechi an amateur and an outsider, {{he would continue to}} produce ground-breaking films sporadically {{for the rest of his}} life. Some of the innovations and trends in Japanese erotic cinema which Takechi's films pioneered include big-budgets <b>and</b> <b>releases,</b> literary and artistic aspirations, fogging, political themes, and theatrical hardcore.|$|E

50|$|In the Republic of Ireland, catch <b>and</b> <b>release</b> {{has been}} used as a {{conservation}} tool for atlantic salmon and sea trout fisheries since 2003. A number of fisheries now have mandatory catch <b>and</b> <b>release</b> regulations. Catch <b>and</b> <b>release</b> for coarse fish {{has been used}} by sport anglers for as long as these species have been fished for on this island. However catch <b>and</b> <b>release</b> for Atlantic salmon has required a huge turn about in how many anglers viewed the salmon angling resource. To encourage anglers to practice catch <b>and</b> <b>release</b> in all fisheries a number of Government led incentives have been implemented.|$|R

5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is driven by}} the {{sympathetic}} nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion. Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses <b>and</b> <b>releases</b> its secretions directly into the blood.|$|E
5|$|After a fight, Storm Shadow and the Baroness {{retrieve}} the warheads {{and take them}} to Baron DeCobray, the Baroness's husband, for him to weaponize. Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue the Baroness and Storm Shadow, but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching one of the missiles. The missile hits the Eiffel Tower <b>and</b> <b>releases</b> the nanomites in it, destroying the tower and some of the surrounding area before Duke manages to hit the kill switch. However, in so doing, he is captured and taken to McCullen's base under the Arctic.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy <b>and</b> <b>releases</b> it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E

Of these, 4122 were recovered. The study concluded that, while tag <b>and</b> <b>release</b> programs have limitations, they provided important information about billfish that cannot currently be obtained by other methods.|$|R
5|$|At the school, Ged's skills inspire admiration {{among the}} {{teachers}} {{as well as}} students. He befriends an older student named Vetch, but generally remains aloof from his fellows. Another student, Jasper, acts condescendingly towards Ged and provokes the latter's proud nature. After Jasper needles Ged during a feast, Ged challenges him to a duel. He casts a powerful spell intended to raise {{the spirit of a}} dead woman, but the spell goes awry <b>and</b> <b>releases</b> a shadow creature, which attacks Ged and scars his face. The Archmage Nemmerle banishes the shadow and saves Ged's life, although it costs Nemmerle his own.|$|E

He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces Dr. Leonid Pavel, a Russian nuclear physicist he kidnapped from Uzbekistan, to convert the reactor core into an atomic bomb before killing him as well. Bane then uses the bomb to hold the city hostage and isolate Gotham from the world. Using Gordon's stolen speech, Bane reveals the cover-up of Dent's crimes to the public, <b>and</b> <b>releases</b> the prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, initiating anarchy. The wealthy and powerful are then taken captive and given show trials presided over by Jonathan Crane, where all are sentenced to death.|$|E
5|$|Ben aggressively pursues Clara. She finally asks Alan {{what his}} {{intentions}} are, {{and does not}} like what she hears. A defeated Jody finds his father alone in their barn.

5|$|NAD is also {{consumed}} by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2. These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme <b>and</b> <b>releases</b> nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly {{seem to be}} involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation of aging.|$|E
5|$|Observations made on Director's Discretionary Time {{are exempt}} from the {{proprietary}} period, and are {{released to the public}} immediately.

5|$|The Cruachan station {{temporarily}} stores {{energy at}} times of low demand, <b>and</b> <b>releases</b> it {{at times of}} high demand, when electricity prices are higher, reducing the maximum power that must be provided by power stations. It {{is also used to}} cope with sudden surges in the demand for electricity, such as at the end of television programmes. Despite the use of some rainwater, Cruachan is not a net generator of electricity: it uses more energy for pumping water and spinning its turbines than it generates.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline <b>and</b> <b>releases</b> them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E
5|$|The current match {{ball for}} the Copa Libertadores is the Total 90 Ascente Libertadores, {{manufactured}} by Nike. It {{is one of}} the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact <b>and</b> <b>releases</b> it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex air chamber improves acceleration.|$|E
