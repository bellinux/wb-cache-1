25|$|The oat (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa),</b> {{sometimes}} called the common oat, is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed, which is known by the same name (usually in the plural, unlike other cereals and pseudocereals). While oats are {{suitable for human consumption}} as oatmeal and rolled oats, {{one of the most common}} uses is as livestock feed. Oats are a nutrient-rich food associated with lower blood cholesterol when consumed regularly.|$|E
25|$|The wild {{ancestor}} of <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> and the closely related minor crop, A. byzantina, is the hexaploid wild oat A. sterilis. Genetic evidence shows the ancestral forms of A. sterilis {{grew in the}} Fertile Crescent of the Near East. Domesticated oats appear relatively late, and far from the Near East, in Bronze Age Europe. Oats, like rye, are usually considered a secondary crop, i.e., derived from a weed of the primary cereal domesticates wheat and barley. As these cereals spread westwards into cooler, wetter areas, this may have favored the oat weed component, and have led to its domestication.|$|E

50|$|Oat {{sensitivity}} {{represents a}} {{sensitivity to the}} proteins found in oats, <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa.</b> Sensitivity to oats can manifest {{as a result of}} allergy to oat seed storage proteins either inhaled or ingested. A more complex condition affects individuals who have gluten-sensitive enteropathy in which there is also a response to avenin, the glutinous protein in oats similar to the gluten within wheat. Sensitivity to oat foods can also result from their frequent contamination by wheat, barley, or rye particles.|$|E
50|$|The ER luminal {{domain of}} LiMETER {{contains}} a signal peptide and the transmembrane domain derived from STIM1, with GFP placed in between as a reporter. STIM1 is an ER-resident calcium sensor protein responsible for sensing calcium changes in internal calcium stores {{and communicate with}} ORAI calcium channels in the plasma membrane. The cytoplasmic region of LiMETER contains a flexible linker and a genetically encoded lightswitch LOV2 domain (light oxygen voltage-sensing domain, residues 404-546) derived from <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> phototropin 1, followed by a C-terminal PM-targeting polybasic tail that associates with negative charged phosphoinositides in the inner half of the leaflet of plasma membrane.|$|E

5000|$|Oat {{has been}} used for {{personal}} care purposes since antiquity. Indeed, wild oats (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa)</b> was used in skin care in Egypt and the Arabian peninsula 2000 BC. Oat bath was a common treatment of insomnia, anxiety and skin diseases such as eczema and burns. In Roman times, its use as a medication for dermatological issues was reported by Pliny, Columella, and Theophrastus. In the 19th century, oatmeal baths were often used to treat many cutaneous conditions, especially pruritic inflammatory eruptions. In the 1930s, the literature provided further evidence about the cleansing action of oat along with its ability to relieve itching and protect skin.|$|E
50|$|Avenanthramides (Anthranilic acid amides) are a {{group of}} {{phenolic}} alkaloids found mainly in oats (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa),</b> but also present in white cabbage, butterflies, eggs (Pieris brassicae and P. rapae) and in fungus infected carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus). A number of studies demonstrate that these natural products have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-itch, anti-irritant, and antiatherogenic activities. Oat kernel extracts with standardized levels of avenanthramides are ideal for skin, hair, baby and sun care products. The name “avenanthramides” was coined by Collins when he reported {{the presence of these}} compounds in oat kernels. It was later found that three avenanthramides were the open ring amides of avenalumins I, II and III which were previously reported as oat phytoalexins by Mayama and co-workers.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on {{a number}} of large plants in the grass family Poaceae; these include oats (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa),</b> {{citronella}} grass (Cymbopogon winterianus), Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), Java grass (Cyperus rotundus), jungle rice (Echinochloa colona), barley (Hordeum vulgare), rice (Oryza sativa), millet (Panicum), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and maize (Zea mays). Young larvae eat small holes in the leaves, particularly the leaf sheaths. As they grow, the larvae feed on the tips of the shoots, killing the growing points, and later still, they bore into the stems, creating galleries and producing frass which drops from the holes. The stems become brittle and the dead hearts of the plants are characteristic of this pest.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on a {{wide range}} of plants but prefer grasses. Recorded host plants include a number of {{economically}} important plants such as Phaseolus vulgaris, Beta vulgaris, Brassica oleracea var. capitata, Cucumis melo, Cyperus esculentus, Zea mays, Vigna unguiculata, Phaseolus lunatus, <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa,</b> Pisum sativum, Arachis hypogaea, Capsicum annuum, Oryza sativa, Secale cereale, Sorghum bicolor, Glycine max, Sorghum sudanense, Saccharum officinarum, Ipomoea batatas, Lycopersicon esculentum, Brassica rapa and Triticum aestivum. They tunnel into the crown of their host plant, severely weakening large plants and often killing young seedlings. They spin silken tubes near the soil surface for protection. On peanuts, they will feed on any portion of the plant that contacts the soil. The species overwinters as a larva or pupa in the soil.|$|E
50|$|Wheat yellow leaf virus (WYLV) is a wheat (Triticum spp. L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), rye (Secale cereale M.Bieb.), and oat (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> L.) {{pathogenic}} virus of {{the family}} Closteroviridae. WYLV virions are 1600-1850 nm in length and 10 nm in diameter. The virus, like other members of its genus, is transmitted by aphids. Identified vectors include Rhopalosiphum padi L. and R. maidis Fitch. (Aphididae). The virus has been identified in crop plants in Japan, China, and Italy. Native host plants include Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) in Europe and Agropyron tsukushiense var. transiens Ohwi in Japan. The virus proliferates in the phloem of its host plants, interfering with the plant's ability to produce sufficient chlorophyll (Chlorosis), causing the leaves to yellow and the plant to die.|$|E
5000|$|Puccinia coronata avenae is the {{variation}} of crown rust fungus which infects oat plants (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa).</b> Almost every growing region of oat has {{been affected by}} this pathogen {{at one point or}} another. During particularly bad epidemics, the worldwide crop yields have been reduced by up to 40%. One reason why P. coronata avenae has such a prominent effect is that the conditions which favor oat production also favor the growth and inoculation of the rusts- meaning that years in which the highest yields of crops are expected are the same years in which losses are the highest as well. P. coronata var. avenae uredospores germinate the best at temperature between 10-30 °C with germ-tube growth optimized at 20 °C.|$|E
50|$|Its {{caterpillars}} are pests of oat (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa)</b> {{and common}} wheat (Triticum aestivum).The miller moth is a seasonal nuisance {{in the spring}} in states including Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and Kansas, as they hatch in the low-lying farmlands, then migrate to higher elevations for the summer. They return as the weather cools but in smaller numbers. They are considered nearly impossible to control through normal pest extermination techniques because a new batch shows up every day as they migrate. With their very small bodies, they enter homes (attracted by the light) in the evening through any available crack or crevice (doorjamb, chimney, etc.) and residents in migration paths report dozens of moths per day entering their homes and garages. However, other than being a nuisance, they are not considered harmful.|$|E
50|$|The rose-breasted grosbeak forages in shrubs or {{trees for}} insects, seeds and berries, also {{catching}} insects in flight and occasionally eating nectar. It usually keeps to the treetops, and only rarely {{can be seen}} on the ground. In the winter quarters, they can be attracted into parks, gardens, and possibly even to bird feeders by fruit like Trophis racemosa. Other notable winter food includes Jacaranda seeds and the fruits of the introduced busy Lizzy (Impatiens walleriana). In grosbeaks from the north-central United States and southern Canada, it was found 52% of the stomach contents were comprised by invertebrates, predominantly beetles; 19.3% was made up of wild fruits; 15.7% by weed seeds; 6.5% by cultivated fruits and plants, including peas, corn (Zea mays), oats (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa)</b> and wheat (Triticum vulgare); and the remaining 6.5% by other plant material, including tree buds and flowers.|$|E

40|$|Aims: {{this study}} sought to assess the {{reproductive}} performance of sows inseminated with sperm treated with homeopathic medicines. Materials and methods: the semen of 2 sexually mature boars age 18 months Pietrain and Duroc cross-bred with similar genetic and reproductive performance were chosen, as well as 125 sows. Sixteen samples of semen were collected and standardized through semen evaluation. Three homeopathic preparations and a placebo (control) were tested on the sperm (n= 31 / 32 per group) : <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> 6 cH, Pulsatilla nigricans 6 cH and <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> 6 cH + Pulsatilla nigricans 6 cH. Sows were inseminated 3 times with the same estrous diagnostic procedures. Results: there was significant difference (p< 0. 05) between <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> 6 cH and the other 3 groups regarding the return to estrus and parturition rate.

40|$|Summary. The {{activity}} of guanylyl cyclase (GC) responsible for cGMP synthesis {{was found to}} be predominantly located in a fraction of plasma membranes in cells of <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> seedlings. The GC activity was shown to depend on light conditions of plant cultivation and seedlings age. The reversible regulation of the GC activity in etiolated seedlings by red/far red light was found. This suggests that photoregulation of GC activity is mediated by phytochrome in cells of oat seedlings.
