During her term, she worked to remove gender and race <b>as</b> <b>criteria</b> for {{determining}} pay. She championed a visiting teacher program for children with emotional problems and began art education programs in the schools for black students. Hogg declined to run for a second term.|$|E

In 1929, she founded the Houston Child Guidance Center, which provides counseling for children with mental health problems or diagnoses and their families. Through her brother's will, she established the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin in 1940. Hogg successfully ran for {{a seat on the}} Houston School Board in 1943, where she worked to remove gender and race <b>as</b> <b>criteria</b> for determining pay and established art education programs for black students. Hogg never married, and died in 1975. The Ima Hogg Foundation was the major beneficiary of her will, and carries on her philanthropic work today. Several annual awards have been established in her name, honoring her efforts to preserve cultural heritage in Texas.|$|E

25|$|As {{enrollment}} increased, so did {{the ethnic}} diversity of the student body. By 1995, fully 30% of UCR students were members of non-Caucasian groups, the highest proportion of any campus in the UC system at the time. The 1997 implementation of Proposition 209 — which banned the use {{of race and ethnicity}} <b>as</b> <b>criteria</b> for admissions, hiring, promotions and contracting by state agencies (including the University of California) — had the effect of further increasing ethnic diversity at UCR while reducing it at the most selective campuses in the system. By 2007, fully 69% of undergraduates were members of non-Caucasian groups. Faculty diversity statistics, however, remained relatively constant. 9.1% of UCR faculty were members of underrepresented minority groups in 1997, only 2% higher than the UC average. This percentage dropped to the UC average of 7.3% in 2002, but was back up to 9% in 2006, making it the third-most diverse faculty in the UC system behind Merced and Santa Cruz. Still, given the diversity of the student body and within the surrounding area, this relative lack of diversity at the faculty level remains controversial.|$|E

While the Rosh on many occasions based his decision on these sources, Isserles gave them more prominence in developing practical legal rulings. By incorporating these other opinions, Isserles actually addressed some major criticisms regarding what many viewed as the arbitrary selection of the three authorities upon whose opinions Karo based his work.|$|E
30|$|Seven {{of the ten}} {{groups in}} this study used the idea that ionic salts {{separate}} into ions when dissolved in water <b>as</b> a <b>criterion</b> (Table  4). This was the most frequent reasoning groups used to justify their selection of which chemical equation best represented the dissolution process. Because students used a molecular model kit in which they simulated the dissolution process of ionic salts by using magnetized NaCl and water molecules which upon mixing dissociate (opposite magnets get attracted to each other), it is feasible the molecular model kit influenced their view. Groups that proposed separation of salts into ions were also likely to justify their responses by reasoning that salts become aqueous when added to water. Four of the five groups that used ‘aqueous’ <b>as</b> <b>criterion</b> similarly used separation of ionic solids into ions <b>as</b> <b>criterion</b> (see Table  4). These two criteria combined describe the physical properties of dissolving ionic solids.|$|R

2500|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{feature of the}} Anglo-Saxon legal system is the apparent prevalence of legislation {{in the form of}} law codes. The early Anglo-Saxons were organised in various small kingdoms often corresponding to later shires or counties. The kings of these small kingdoms issued written Laws, one of earliest of which is that attributed to Ethelbert, king of Kent, ca.560–616. The Anglo-Saxon law codes follow a pattern found in continental Europe where other groups of the former Roman empire encountered government dependent upon written sources of law and hastened to display the claims of their own native traditions by reducing them to writing. These legal systems [...] should not be thought of as operating like modern legislation, rather they are educational and political tools designed to demonstrate standards of good conduct rather than act <b>as</b> <b>criteria</b> for subsequent legal judgment.|$|E

2500|$|A central {{reason for}} the {{utilization}} of performance appraisals (PAs) is performance improvement ("initially {{at the level of}} the individual employee, and ultimately {{at the level of the}} organization"). [...] Other fundamental reasons include [...] "as a basis for employment decisions (e.g. promotions, terminations, transfers), <b>as</b> <b>criteria</b> in research (e.g. test validation), to aid with communication (e.g. allowing employees to know how they are doing and organizational expectations), to establish personal objectives for training" [...] programs, for transmission of objective feedback for personal development, [...] "as a means of documentation to aid in keeping track of decisions and legal requirements" [...] and in wage and salary administration. [...] Additionally, PAs can aid in the formulation of job criteria and selection of individuals [...] "who are best suited to perform the required organizational tasks". [...] A PA can be part of guiding and monitoring employee career development. [...] PAs can also be used to aid in work motivation through the use of reward systems.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, {{the festival}} saw an {{increase}} in the number of bands and venues as well as public attention - a transformation that has not escaped criticism. In 2005, the festival included 107 acts featured on 10 stages across town, a number that led the festival manager, to call for a scaleback. Critical voices have focused more on the choice of venues and artists, claiming that venues have been spread too far out and the choice of musicians has gotten safer and less varied. Political interest in the festival has grown with the commercial successes of acts such as Mew, The Raveonettes and Junior Senior. In 2005, the minister for culture, Brian Mikkelsen, proclaimed it [...] "the most important musical event in Denmark" [...] due to its potential as a vehicle for [...] "networking and musical export". However, this attention has prompted questions about the relative weights given to artistic merit and marketability <b>as</b> <b>criteria</b> for band selection and claims that the new focus on big business has alienated the local music scene. The inclusion of by now well-established names (or at least names that were felt to have had their chance of international recognition) such as Saybia and Outlandish was greeted with muted enthusiasm in the music press and occasional hostility from audiences.|$|E
