[...] "I am so built, you must know, that when anything pushes <b>against</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> as my chin accidentally did just then, I make that silly noise.

60|$|At last, {{one of the}} Palace windows was opened, and we saw Fabrizio Tornielli {{standing}} in it, {{looking down on the}} piazza. Our opportunity has come. My heart beat so violently <b>against</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> that I had to put my hand to it. Besides Matteo and myself, Marco Scorsacana, Lodovico Pansecchi and Scipione Moratini were to accompany Checco into the Palace. Checco took my arm and we walked slowly up the steps while the others followed on our heels. The head of the Orsi had a key of gold, that is to say he was admitted to the ruler's presence whenever he presented himself, and without formality. The guard at the door saluted as we passed, making no question. We ascended to Girolamo's private apartments, and were admitted by a servant. We found ourselves in an ante-room, in one wall of which was a large doorway, closed by curtains....|$|E
6000|$|That thought {{flashed through}} my head, and I {{was on the}} point of desisting, when, all at once, she began to {{struggle}} with a sudden violence which all but freed her instantly, which revived my exasperation with her, indeed a fierce desire never to let her go any more. I tightened my embrace in time, gasping out: [...] "No--you don't!" [...] as if she were my mortal enemy. On her part not a word was said. Putting her hands <b>against</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> she pushed with all her might without succeeding to break the circle of my arms. Except that she seemed thoroughly awake now, her eyes gave me no clue whatever. To meet her black stare was like looking into a deep well, and I was totally unprepared for her change of tactics. Instead of trying to tear my hands apart, she flung herself upon my breast and with a downward, undulating, serpentine motion, a quick sliding dive, she got away from me smoothly. It was all very swift; I saw her pick up the tail of her wrapper and run for the door {{at the end of the}} verandah not very gracefully. She appeared to be limping a little--and then she vanished; the door swung behind her so noiselessly that I could not believe it was completely closed. I had a distinct suspicion of her black eye being at the crack to watch what I would do. I could not make up my mind whether to shake my fist in that direction or blow a kiss.|$|E

Spademan {{learned of}} a church member's lesbian relationship in 2000, and decided to split up the pair by sending {{one of the girls}} to live at the church in Connecticut. [...] "Syro told me she knew from God that I was doing this sinful and evil thing. I was shouted at and screamed at, shaken, prayed over and had a Bible pushed <b>against</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> I was upset, confused and scared," [...] said the girl that was moved to Connecticut. The girl eventually moved back to England and left the organisation.|$|E
40|$|Provocatively {{playful and}} deadly serious, “The Cannonisation of HRH. the” {{continues}} my concern to force body based subjectivity and textually fixed social meanings into a ‘telling’ synthesis (also epitomised by my dependence on a conceptual persona, HRH. the, through which I commit artistic ideas into material reality). In “The Cannonisation of HRH. the” words are taken -almost violently- at their imagistic implication: I employ {{an army of}} kitsch ornamental cannons to literally cannonise myself as a self-professed 'saintly' force exploding within the phallocentric ‘canon’ of Western art, releasing an intentioned romanticism around ‘art’ and the ‘miraculous. ’ In such a way, the agency of words is pushed beyond the cultural norm and rendered temporarily absurd whilst such agency is simultaneously underscored as the very touch base of artistic origination per se. The installation is composed of a projected performance-animation incorporating the artist’s own body holding and riffling {{through the pages of}} Janson’s canonical book ‘A History of Art’ (1962) which is framed by an army of miniature brass cannons. I hand drew on each photographic still to create animated cannon balls 'erupting out of the ornamental cannons' and landing <b>against</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> to spell the suffragette motto: "Deeds Not Words"</p...|$|E

40|$|Shortly {{after my}} son Ross was born we were visiting my partner's family in Canada. At {{a large family}} {{gathering}} Ross began to fuss and I picked him up and laid him <b>against</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> to quiet him down. I had been comforting Ross since {{he was born and}} {{only a small part of}} me recognized that this was a more public event than I had heretofore experienced. Needless to say that same small part of me wanted to show off my newly honed fathering skills. This time Ross would not be quieted. As time progressed painfully slowly and Ross's discomfort found new heights of vocalization, heads began to turn with looks that mixed sympathy with what I thought were smirks. Ross went from my chest to my shoulder, then the other shoulder, and then onto his stomach in my gently swaying arms. He continued to protest and the agitation in my gyrations and swings increased. Finally, my sister-in-law smiled sweetly and extended her arms towards the squirming bundle of baby. In frustration and with a sense that something insidious and beyond my grasp was occurring, I gave Ross up to her. Of course, he stopped crying immediately. She turned to me with an even more sickeningly sweet smile and cooed (half to Ross and half to me) ` ̀ Your Daddy just doesn't have the necessary accoutrements. ' ' To be bested in this way by my sister-in-law, a staunch supporter of traditional nuclear family values and a vehement antifeminist, was too much. How could Ross do this to me? Why was my frustration turning to outrage? Why was I overreacting? I folded my bony arms around my hard, breastless chest and smothered my anger and shame so as not to show my pain and ruin the rest of the evening. There is a strange immiscibility between fathering and child-care that I am not quite sure how to reconcile. Can it be that part of the problem relates to men's inability to bear children and provide them with `natural ' sustenance as infants? To suggest such is to return to a form of naturalism that is groundless in the light of contemporary Fathering and faltering: ` ̀ Sorry, but you don't have the necessary accoutrements'&apos...|$|E
