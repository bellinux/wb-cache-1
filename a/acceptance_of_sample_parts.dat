40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were (1) to map sensory {{attributes}} of vanilla ice cream with reduced fat and sugar, and (2) to determine drivers of liking by applying external preference mapping and reveal the relationship between descriptive attributes and hedonic judgments using the partial least squares method. Descriptive sensory profiles (n = 11) and consumer test (n = 117) <b>of</b> 6 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> vanilla ice cream (3 traditional and 3 with reduced fat and sugar) were determined. The attributes brightness and sweet aftertaste for sample and creaminess (appearance and texture) and sweet aroma contributed positively to the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> ice cream <b>samples.</b> The attributes aeration, powdered milk aroma and flavor, and white chocolate aroma and flavor contributed positively to the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the ice creams. The attributes hydrogenated fat aroma and flavor were responsible for the lower <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples.</b> The reduction in fat and sugar did not necessarily cause a decrease in acceptance. The most important factors were selection of the appropriate sweetener system and the use of good quality raw material. © 2012 American Dairy Science Association...|$|R

30|$|In the {{classical}} statistics, for the inspection {{of a final}} lot of the product, a decision is made either the lot has good quality or not using an acceptance <b>sampling</b> plan. The <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> using {{the classical}} statistics assumes that data are determinate. In some situations, the data may imprecise and even intermediate which leads to indecision {{about the quality of}} the submitted lot of the product. In this situation, neutrosophic statistics can be applied for the lot sentencing. In this paper, a new attribute sampling plan is proposed using the neutrosophic interval method. The lot acceptance, rejection, and indeterminate probabilities are computed using the neutrosophic binomial distribution at various specified parameters such as sample size and acceptance number.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to understand the sensory attributes that drive consumer liking for tea products and to investigate the effects of consumer age and product information on the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> tea products. Descriptive analysis and consumer taste testing were conducted with 10 canned tea products. In the descriptive analysis, the sensory characteristics of tea products were evaluated using 17 attributes. In the con-sumer taste testing, 500 tea drinkers were recruited from 5 age groups (that is, ages in the 10 ’s to 50 ’s). Each age group was divided into 2 subgroups and rated the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> with or without accompanying infor-mation about each sample. The General Linear Model was constructed to evaluate the effect of information and age on the liking of the tea products. Preference mapping was performed to understand the important sensory characteristics that drive consumer liking. The non-sensory factors significantly affected the acceptance for tea products. The younger consumers distinctly preferred black tea to green/oolong tea, but this tendency dimin-ished in the older groups. The majority of consumers liked lemon-flavored black tea when the product informa-tion was not provided. When the information was presented, the acceptance tended to shift to bitter/astringent-tasting green/oolong teas, which are marketed for their health benefits...|$|R

For ANOVA, test of averages, and preference map it was observed that the consumers' favorite "dulce de leche" were those of formulation 1 (10 % whey and 1 % coffee) and 2 (30 % whey and 1 % coffee), followed by formulation 9 (20 % whey and 1. 25 % coffee). The <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> 1 and 2 was influenced by the higher acceptability in relation to the flavor and for presenting higher pH, L*, and b* values. It was observed that samples 1 and 2 presented higher purchase approval score and higher percentages of responses for the 'ideal' category in terms of sweetness and coffee flavor. It was found that consumers preferred the samples with low concentrations of coffee independent of the concentration of whey thus enabling the use of whey and coffee in the manufacture of dulce de leche, obtaining a new product...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the association between the physicochemical properties and sensory <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> Brazilian red wines by applying chemometric techniques.

Significant differences could be identified amongst the physicochemical properties of the wines (P <  0. 001). The sensory results showed greater <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the wines made after pre-drying of the grapes or from the static pomace, as compared to commercial brands. Cluster analysis and Multidimensional Scaling were successfully applied and their results demonstrated the influence of the total phenolic content and color indexes on <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the appearance of the wines.
