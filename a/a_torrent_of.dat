5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> hail and thunder and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Japanese were {{gaining the}} upper hand over the hard-pressed and {{surrounded}} Chinese defenders. On December 12 the SEA captured Peak #2 of Zijinshan and {{from this vantage point}} unleashed <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> artillery fire at Zhongshan Gate where {{a large portion of the}} wall suddenly gave way. After sunset the fires that blazed out of control on Zijinshan were visible even from Zhonghua Gate in the south which was completely occupied by Japan's 10th Army on the night of December 12 to 13.|$|E
5|$|Yonekura {{and his men}} {{had reached}} Kaiapit after an {{exhausting}} night march. Yonekura was aware that the Australians had reached Kaiapit but his main concern {{was not to be}} caught in the open by Allied aircraft. Spotting Australian positions in the pre-dawn light, the Japanese column opened fire. <b>A</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> fire descended on the Australians, who replied sporadically, attempting to conserve their ammunition. Although he was running low on ammunition, King launched an immediate counter-attack on the Japanese, which took them by surprise.|$|E

5|$|Amid <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> Japanese fire, the Australians broke {{contact and}} made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out with them. The embarkation took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort to lighten the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float free. The other, however, remained stuck. Coming under attack from the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked {{the men in the}} vessel with grenades, the casualties mounted, with a number of men, including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E
5|$|The police {{arrive and}} Cecil is {{immediately}} arrested. Bob gloats over his victory, having gained the respect from Bart and Lisa, who now believed that Bob has truly changed. Unfortunately, Chief Wiggum suddenly arrives and arrests Bob, believing {{him to be}} involved in the plot as well, despite Bart and Lisa's protests. As they are taken away, Cecil tricks Bob into swearing revenge on Bart and incriminating himself. Upon realizing that he just made Bart his enemy again, Bob gets angry at Cecil for it. Just after the brothers are taken away, the dam crumbles and releases <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> water on Springfield, only to do apparently minimal damage. Wiggum muses on the evil the brothers could concoct while locked up together; in reality, the brothers merely continue to bicker childishly, as Bob is still angry at Cecil for making Bart his nemesis again.|$|E
5|$|The {{two cities}} were later pushed toward merger by a {{disaster}} that nearly {{wiped out the}} falls. The geological formation of the area consisted of a hard, thin layer of limestone overlaying a soft sandstone formation. As the sandstone eroded away, large blocks of limestone would fall off. The expansion of milling and industry at the falls accelerated the process of erosion. If the fragile limestone cap ever eroded away completely, the falls would turn into a rapids that would no longer provide water power. This process {{came to a head}} on October 4, 1869, when a tunnel under Hennepin Island and Nicollet Island collapsed and filled with water. With the limestone cap breached, the tunnel quickly created <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> water that blasted Hennepin Island and threatened to destroy the falls. The falls were shored up quickly, and over the next several years, the falls were repaired by building a wooden apron, sealing the tunnel, and building low dams above the falls to avoid exposing the limestone to the weather. This work was assisted by the federal government, and was eventually completed in 1884. The federal government spent $615,000 on this effort, while the two cities spent $334,500. Possibly {{as a result of the}} bonding needed to rehabilitate the falls, the cities of St. Anthony and Minneapolis merged on April 9, 1872.|$|E

40|$|<b>As</b> <b>torrents</b> <b>of</b> {{new data}} now emerge from {{microbial}} genomics, bioinformatic prediction of immunogenic epitopes remains challenging but vital. In silico methods often produce paradoxically inconsistent results: good prediction rates on certain test sets but not others. The inherent complexity of immune presentation and recognition processes complicates epitope prediction. Two encouraging developments – data driven artificial intelligence sequence-based methods for epitope prediction and molecular modeling methods based on three-dimensional protein structures – offer {{hope for the}} future...|$|R
25|$|More {{than two}} weeks after the Senate Hearings, Nixon was still upset about the Lavelle incident. In an Oct. 23, 1972 meeting with Haig in the Old Executive Office Building, Nixon {{unleashed}} <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> anger.|$|E
25|$|Earlier, the {{prominent}} conservative blog RedState barred users with accounts {{less than six}} months old from posting messages supporting Paul. This was due to <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> pro-Paul comment spam. Other blogs at least temporarily shut down their online polls due to concerns the results may have been stacked by Paul supporters.|$|E

25|$|Most musical Nativity narrations are not biblical and did {{not come}} about until church music assimilated opera in the 17th century. But {{thereafter}} there was <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> new music, e.g. Heinrich Schutz's 1660 The Christmas Story and Bach's Christmas Oratorio in the 18th century. And Lisz's Christus, etc. John Milton's classic 1629 poem Ode on the Morning of Christ's Nativity was used by John McEwan in 1901.|$|E
25|$|The Economist {{frequently}} receives {{letters from}} senior businesspeople, politicians, ambassadors, and from spokespeople for various government departments, non-governmental organisations and lobbies. Well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> letters. For example, {{the survey of}} corporate social responsibility, published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from Oxfam, the World Food Programme, United Nations Global Compact, the Chairman of BT Group, an ex-Director of Shell and the UK Institute of Directors.|$|E
25|$|The {{book also}} {{presents}} evidence {{which suggests that}} Justice Minister Judith Collins leaked the name of public servant, Simon Pleasants, to Cameron Slater. Pleasants worked in the ministerial property department at Internal Affairs, and Collins assumed {{he was responsible for}} leaking details of Mr English's accommodation payments to Labour in 2009. Slater then published a series of blog attacks on Pleasants – who subsequently received <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> abuse including death threats. Pleasants denies ever leaking any information about English.|$|E

Despite her past, she was not happy with their socialist leanings. Until {{the end of her}} life, however, she continued to campaign for India's independence, not only in India but also on speaking tours of Britain. In her own version of Indian dress, she remained a striking presence on speakers' platforms. She produced <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> letters and articles demanding independence.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the splash}} pool are several effects {{such as a}} giant water tower which {{periodically}} releases <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> water, {{and the sound of}} an organ coming from the spire of a supposedly submerged church. Until 2006, the effects included a damaged gas tank firing a large flame approximately every 10 minutes, but the gas tank no longer operates because the cylinders that were used to fuel the flame were removed {{to make way for the}} construction of Stealth. The other effects are also currently nonoperational and have been out of order for several years.|$|E
25|$|Sakuraba {{returned}} to the ring on 17 September 2007 at K-1 Hero's 10 against former NJPW pro wrestler Katsuyori Shibata. Prior to the bout, Shibata's trainer, Masakatsu Funaki had challenged Sakuraba {{on the basis that}} he their styles would make for an entertaining contest. Shibata came out striking aggressively, but was soon taken to the canvas by Sakuraba's trademark single leg. Shibata unleashed <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> blows off his back, but the more experienced Sakuraba responded with strikes of his own before transitioning into an armbar and finishing the bout.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, Kweisi Mfume {{was elected}} to the Baltimore City Council, serving there until 1986. His {{political}} stance was against that of then-mayor William Donald Schaefer, who Mfume believed had ignored the many poor neighborhoods of the city. It was a contentious matter, but despite his strong opinions he learned the art of political compromise. He was perceived by many to have had some success during his stay in office, a fact perhaps reflected by his subsequent election to the United States House of Representatives in 1986 despite <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> criticism, directed in no small part against his early past.|$|E
25|$|Ashur-etil-ilani (626–623 BC) {{ascended to}} the throne of the empire in 626 BC, but was {{immediately}} engulfed in <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> fierce rebellions instigated by rival claimants. He was deposed in 623 BC by an Assyrian general (turtanu) named Sin-shumu-lishir (623–622 BC), who was also declared king of Babylon. Sin-shar-ishkun (622–612 BC), the brother of Ashur-etil-ilani, took back the throne of empire from Sin-shumu-lishir in 622 BC, but was then himself faced with unremitting rebellion against his rule by his own people. Continual conflict among the Assyrians led to a myriad of subject peoples, from Cyprus to Persia and The Caucasus to Egypt, quietly reasserting their independence and ceasing {{to pay tribute to}} Assyria.|$|E
25|$|By 19 June, Herefordshire was {{affected}} by flooding. The M50 motorway near Ledbury was closed on 22 July due to flooding. More than 5,200 people in and around Bromyard, Herefordshire were without clean water on 22 and 23 July after the pumps at the Whitbourne works in Herefordshire failed. Once supply was restored residents were urged by Welsh Water to boil their tap-water until further notice. The village of Hampton Bishop, 3miles (5km) {{from the city of}} Hereford remains surrounded and flooded by water after the River Lugg burst its banks. On the afternoon of 24 July the Fire Service began pumping flood water out of the village, but not before 130 residents were evacuated. Houses, including the Herefordshire home of Daily Mail writer Quentin Letts, were flooded by <b>a</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>of</b> water gushing from what had previously been only a small, unnamed brook north of Ross-on-Wye.|$|E
