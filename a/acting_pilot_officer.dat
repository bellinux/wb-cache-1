5|$|Born in Cheshire, MacLachlan {{joined the}} RAF aged 17 in March 1937. He progressed quickly through flight {{training}} and {{was granted a}} commission as <b>acting</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> on 3 May 1937. He completed his flight training in early 1939 and had considerable time to gain experience in operational types upon {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. When the Battle of France began in May 1940 he was serving with No. 88 Squadron RAF flying the Fairey Battle light bomber he was credited with two enemy aircraft damaged and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC).|$|E
5|$|Finucane was {{now one of}} the 45 {{pilots in}} his class to have {{completed}} 100 hours of piloting time on aircraft since he joined the RAF. After completing basic flight training on 28 October 1938, Finucane was classed as an average pilot, but deemed to be competent enough to be assigned to advanced flying school. With effect from the following day, he was granted a short-service commission as an <b>acting</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> (on probation) and sent to 8 Flying Training School, RAF Montrose in Scotland. On 12 November, he left King's Cross railway station travelling on the Flying Scotsman to Glasgow, arriving at Montrose after a 10-hour journey.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 Horne {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on a {{part-time}} training scheme. He was commissioned as an <b>acting</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> in No. 911 (County of Warwick) Squadron, a barrage balloon unit in Sutton Coldfield, and was called up into the RAF full-time on the outbreak of war. In the initial months of the conflict—the Phoney War—Horne's duties were undemanding, and he formed a concert party from his friends and colleagues. In November 1940 {{he was promoted to}} flight lieutenant, and to squadron leader a year later. In early 1942, the BBC producer Bill McLurg asked whether the RAF station at which Horne was based could put on an edition of his programme Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer. Horne was ordered to put on the show, and he made his broadcasting debut on 16 April 1942, as the compere. Although the standard of the talent on the show was not high, McLurg was impressed with Horne's presentation, especially the way he hosted the programme's quiz; he invited Horne to be the programme's regular quizmaster, a role the latter fulfilled on over fifty Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer quizzes over the next two years. In January 1943 {{he became one of the}} show's regular comperes and presented the entire show for the first time.|$|E

25|$|The pilot, Captain James Thain, was {{a former}} RAF flight lieutenant. Originally a {{sergeant}} (later a warrant officer), he was given an emergency commission in the RAF as an <b>acting</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> on probation in April 1944, and promoted to pilot officer on probation in September that year. He was promoted to flight lieutenant in May 1948, and received a permanent commission in the same rank in 1952. He retired from the RAF to join BEA.|$|E
25|$|Following a Higher National Diploma in Business Studies at Trent Polytechnic (a {{predecessor}} of Nottingham Trent University), North {{was commissioned}} as an <b>acting</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> in July 1982 – initially on a Short Service Commission – having won two trophies during Initial Officer Training.

25|$|The {{following}} year, Cooke {{joined the}} Royal Air Force {{and passed out}} from the Royal Air Force College Cranwell as an <b>acting</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> on 23 March 1936. On 10 January 1937, he joined No. 46 Squadron RAF, a recently re-formed fighter squadron, flying Gloster Gauntlet Mark II aircraft, from RAF Digby in Lincolnshire.

5000|$|The rank of <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> {{does not}} imply that the officer is aircrew. Following recent reforms to the Royal Air Force's {{promotion}} system, wherein previously University graduates passed out of RAF Cranwell at a higher substantive rank than their non-graduate peers, <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> rank is now only applicable to ground branches. Aircrew and engineers receive their commissions as flying officers and skip the rank altogether. A ground branch officer will remain in the <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> rank for six months following commissioning, before an automatic promotion to flying officer. Because of the nature of Phase II training (professional training after the Phase I Initial <b>Officer</b> Training), a <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> will generally spend time in rank on a further training course, and {{is not likely to be}} operationally active.|$|R
50|$|There were 14 men {{on board}} the two aircraft. They were Flight Lieutenant Wilbur Lange, <b>Pilot</b> <b>Officer</b> Kenneth Alexander Ross (a former Wellington table tennis champion), Flying Officer Sydney Philip Aldridge, Flying Officer Jack Andrew Olsen, <b>Pilot</b> <b>Officer</b> Kenneth Brian Marshall, Flying Officer David Oliphant Stewart, Sergeant George Arthur Bryant, Flying Officer Norman Kitchener Baird, Sergeant Robert Bruce Gillespie, Warrant Officer Arthur Francis Dunstan, Sergeant Thomas Bryan Carey, <b>Pilot</b> <b>Officer</b> Ivan Russell Johnson, Flight Sergeant Thomas' Hartley Ward, and Flying Officer John Thomson Waugh.|$|R

He was {{commissioned}} as an <b>acting</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> in July 1979, being regraded to pilot officer in July 1980 following Initial Officer Training, and then promoted to flying officer in July 1981. He began his operational flying career in 1983 on the Tornado Ground Attack aircraft and served successively on front-line squadrons, including an exchange tour with the Royal Australian Air Force flying the F111, and operational deployments to the Middle East; being promoted to flight lieutenant in July 1984 and squadron leader in July 1989.|$|E

The two pilots {{responsible}} for the attack, <b>Pilot</b> <b>Officer</b> John Freeborn and Flying Officer Paddy Byrne were placed under arrest upon their return to Hornchurch. Freeborn had been the squadron adjutant and had distributed orders that single engined aircraft should not be engaged as {{it was assumed that}} enemy fighters would not have the fuel to be able to fly a return sortie from Germany and, therefore, any single engined aircraft would be friendly.|$|R

500|$|Lock {{completed}} his training in late May 1940. Officially qualified {{as a fighter}} pilot, he was posted to No. 41 Squadron at RAF Catterick as <b>acting</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>officer.</b> Lock spent several weeks with his Squadron before taking two weeks leave pass in July 1940 to marry his girlfriend Peggy Meyers, a former [...] "Miss Shrewsbury". Lock returned to his unit and soon began combat patrols over the North of England, defending British airspace against Luftflotte 5 (Air Fleet 5) based in Norway. Lock was bored by the patrols as it involved chasing lone enemy raiders without success.|$|E

The basic flight training {{came to an end}} and Pattle scored 88.5 percent. His advanced training began in November 1936 on the Gloster Gauntlet. He completed his training somewhat later than planned, in March 1937, owing to bad weather which curtailed flying. He was rated as [...] "exceptional" [...] in his final report.|$|E
500|$|Harper {{joined the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1937, and was {{commissioned}} as an <b>acting</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> on 5 September.

He flew solo {{for the first time}} on 9 March after rapidly coming to grips with his trainer. He wrote, [...] "You will be glad to hear I went solo today...Mr Sharp did a slow roll. It was pretty grim when we were upside down with nothing but 6,000 feet of air between us and the ground.....I simply love flying." [...] MacLachlan was the youngest trainee of the group and after 23 solo and 28 hours dual flight he passed as an average grade pilot on the 27 April. He had come second overall in his examinations. He travelled to RAF Uxbridge the following month. There, he was commissioned <b>acting</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>officer</b> service number 39639 on 18 May 1937. He was posted to No. 3 Flying Training School at Grantham in Lincolnshire. He flew the Hawker Hart and the Hawker Audax {{for the first time on}} 20 May 1938.
