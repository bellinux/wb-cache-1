40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} an implementation of audio conferencing using the ACTS T 1 -VSAT network. In particular, this implementation evaluates the use of the on-board switching capability of the satellite as a viable alternative for providing the multipoint connectivity normally provided by terrestrial <b>audio</b> <b>bridge</b> equipment The system that was implemented provides full mesh, full-duplex audio conferencing, with end-to-end voice paths between all participants requiring only a single hop (i. e. 250 msec. delay). Moreover, it addresses the lack of spontaneity in current systems by allowing a user to easily start a conference from any standard telephone handset connected to an ACTS earth station, and quickly add new members to the conference at any time using the 'hook flash' capability. No prior scheduling of resources is required and there is no central point of control, thereby providing the user with the spontaneity desired in audio conference control...|$|E

50|$|The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) {{was formed}} in 1963, through the merger of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (founded in 1884) and the Institute of Radio Engineers (founded in 1912). The two {{organizations}} merged because {{with the rise of}} electronics, many of their interests were beginning to overlap. In 1980, IEEE started project 802 to create standards for local area network (LAN) applications. In 1985, 802.3 became the official standard for Ethernet, a cable-based data transmission system originally developed by Xerox in the 1970s. <b>Audio</b> Video <b>Bridging</b> is the name given to a set of technical standards developed by the IEEE <b>Audio</b> Video <b>Bridging</b> Task Group of the IEEE 802.1 standards committee. The committee developed the original technical standards for AVB, a way to simplify audio and video streaming through the use of the Ethernet cable, rather than the complicated approach traditionally taken using an array of analog one-way, single-purpose and point-to-point cables.|$|R
50|$|Ethernet is {{a fairly}} simple {{protocol}} which has scaled {{to hundreds of thousands}} of times faster speeds and consistently been able to adapt to meet the needs and demands of new markets.

40|$|Wisconsin has a {{long history}} of {{extensive}} distance education, beginning with AM radio and correspondence courses, continuing through <b>audio</b> <b>bridges</b> and fixed (one-way) television networks, to current interactive videoconferencing technologies. By the mid- 1990 ’s, several pioneer networks had established a total of 113 interactive video classrooms in public schools. In the mid- 1990 ’s the State of Wisconsin committed extensive resources to provision a statewide videoconferencing facility to equalize opportunity across the state and allow for more efficient collaboration and sharing of courses. Wisconsin is currently updating the videoconferencing facility as part of the BadgerNet Converged Network (BCN) initiative, the largest state converged network of its kind in the United States. Wisconsin’s long experience with distance education has led to the establishment of collaborative structures for delivering instruction at a distance via technology. Unlike other states, where fragmentation is common, Wisconsin is organized around 25 regional networks that involve 285 high schools, technical colleges, the UW System including Extension, and some private institutions. The number of high schools with video circuits is expected to increase slightly for 2006 - 2007. These regional networks are autonomous, but utilize the state BadgerNet facility. The regiona...|$|R

50|$|The first {{classes at}} the ADE DLC began in August 2001. At that time, three schools participated, {{with a total of}} 65 {{students}} taking classes from the ADE DLC. During the 2009 - 2010 academic year, the ADE DLC will provide instruction to 3200 students from 100 schools in the state. During the first year of operation, most of the classes taught were delivered using Enhanced Audio Graphics technology. This technology enabled the content to be pushed to the desktop computer of the students and the audio communication was accomplished using <b>audio</b> <b>bridging</b> services from telephone companies. However, Compressed Interactive Video (CIV), was used in other classes, so that the teacher and students could see and speak to each other in real time and communicate more effectively. As distance learning in Arkansas grew, the state legislature apportioned funds to allow schools to buy CIV equipment. Currently, 243 out of 245 school districts have CIV systems connected to the state video network. Today, all ADE DLC classes are provided using CIV technology. In addition, the teachers push the class content to the student computers using the IBM/Lotus Sametime program. This program provides an online meeting room and whiteboard, to facilitate the presentation of materials and communication between the students and their teachers.|$|R

To address the challenge of long latency in data transfer by HomePlug GP, we propose two queuing enhancements to improve the real-time performance of HomePlug GP. Specifically, we introduce the virtual collision mechanism to improve the fairness of queuing. We further apply the principle of credit-based shaping in IEEE 802. 1 <b>Audio</b> Video <b>Bridging</b> over the HomePlug GP to meet the latency requirements of different network traffic.

40|$|Abstract—Clock {{synchronization}} is {{a necessary}} feature in in-vehicle time- and safety-critical networks. The reason is that exact timing information has to be maintained in nodes, for instance for time stamps of messages that are important for safety-critical functions. A common time base has to be established at start-up time before time-sensitive data handling can begin. In vehicular applications, this clock initialization phase is {{only one part of}} tasks that have to be finished before the vehicle is fully functional. To avoid lengthy delays after vehicle ignition, this start-up phase has to be very short depending on the requirements of functions. Advanced driver assistance systems require high-bandwidth communication such as Ethernet <b>Audio</b> Video <b>Bridging</b> (AVB). Its corresponding IEEE 802. 1 AS time synchronization protocol is, however, not able to guarantee fast synchronization start-up. This paper thus proposes and analyses several variants of the time synchronization protocol to achieve a shorter start-up time. Simulation-based performance analysis shows that start-up times can be reduced by a factor of 40 compared to the standard IEEE 802. 1 AS with the proposal, without considerably affecting synchronization error.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of geographically dispersed work teams present ever-increasing opportunities for new collaboration tools and services. Earlier this year, a geographically dispersed research team decided to prototype and informally evaluate an audio-only media-space, which was code-named The Corner Office. This prototype was built using an <b>audio</b> teleconferencing <b>bridge</b> augmented with web-based visual awareness information.

This allowed team members to determine when a colleague was {{at his or her}} desk, on the phone, alone, or with others. In addition, the desktop images were visually highlighted whenever someone was currently present in the shared audio space. The objectives of the field trial were twofold. First, to investigate the usability and usefulness of a lightweight audio-only media space. And second, to explore the benefits of augmenting an audio space with several types of social awareness information. The feedback from the trial users indicated that the social presence information was generally useful as a way t...|$|R
