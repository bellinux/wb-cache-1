[...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record.

500|$|The Intelligent Woman's Guide, Shaw's main {{political}} treatise of the 1920s, attracted both {{admiration and}} criticism. MacDonald considered it the world's most important book since the Bible; Harold Laski thought its arguments outdated {{and lacking in}} concern for individual freedoms. Shaw's increasing flirtation with dictatorial methods is evident in many of his subsequent pronouncements. [...] A New York Times report dated 10 December 1933 quoted a recent Fabian Society lecture in which Shaw had praised Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin: [...] "hey <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> something done, [...] are adopting methods by which {{it is possible to}} get something done". As late as the Second World War, in Everybody's Political What's What, Shaw blamed the Allies' [...] "abuse" [...] of their 1918 victory for the rise of Hitler, and hoped that, after defeat, the Führer would escape retribution [...] "to enjoy a comfortable retirement in Ireland or some other neutral country". These sentiments, according to the Irish philosopher-poet Thomas Duddy, [...] "rendered much of the Shavian outlook passé and contemptible".|$|E
500|$|Actor Mickey Rourke asked Bowie to be {{involved}} in one of the songs, the two having met in London where Rourke was based while filming the movie A Prayer for the Dying. Bowie had him perform the mid-song rap to the song [...] "Shining Star (Makin' My Love)." [...] Bowie jokingly referred to Rourke's performance as [...] "method rapping". Bowie described the song as one that [...] "reflects back-to-street situations, and how people <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> together in the face of so many disasters and catastrophes, socially around them, never knowing if they're going to survive it themselves. The one thing they have got to cling on to is each other; although it might resolve into something terrible, it's the only thing that they've got. It’s just a little love song coming out of that environment." [...] He rejected the notion that his [...] "high, little" [...] voice (which he attributed to Smokey Robinson) in the song was a new character (to follow behind Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke), instead saying it was just what the song needed, as he had tried the song in his regular voice and did not like the outcome: [...] "That never bothered me, changing voices to suit a song. You can fool about with it." [...] "Shining Star" [...] was one of Bowie's early choices to be a single for the album, but EMI had the final say and did not release the song as a single. A 12" [...] remix of the song was made available on iTunes when the [...] " [...] was released digitally {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E
