50|$|In Britain, {{roads of}} greater and medium {{importance}} are numbered {{according to a}} system in which the smaller number of digits indicates a more major route. The motorways are prefixed by M and the principal other roads by the letter A. The roads A1 to A6 radiate from London with A1 as the <b>axial</b> <b>route</b> of the country, running between London and Edinburgh. Roads with numbers beginning with 1 lie to the east of the A1, clockwise when viewed on a map. The details are explained under Great Britain road numbering scheme.|$|E
40|$|Thallium cation {{complexation}} by calix[4]tubes {{has been}} investigated {{by a combination of}} (205) Tl, (1) H NMR and ES MS demonstrating the solution formation of a dithallium complex in which the cations are held in the calix[4]arene cavities. In addition, the structure of the complex has been determined in the solid state revealing the cations to be held exclusively by pi-cation interactions. Furthermore, this crystal structure has been used as the basis for molecular dynamics simulations to confirm that binding of the smaller K(+) cation in the calix[4]tube cryptand like array occurs via the <b>axial</b> <b>route</b> featuring a pi-cation intermediate...|$|E
40|$|The {{historical}} garden {{complex of}} Mofakham {{was built in}} the late nineteenth century as a formal pavilion garden in the city of Bojnourd in north-east Iran for the Persian monarch's local governor (hakem) of the time. At least five main buildings and other secondary buildings of the garden complex have disappeared over the years. Although the surrounding context has changed totally, the <b>axial</b> <b>route</b> of the garden and two buildings of the complex remain. The documentation includes: 1.

2500|$|Prior to 1845, {{the urban}} {{transport}} network consisted primarily {{of a large}} number of omnibus lines, consolidated by the French government into a regulated system with fixed and unconflicting routes and schedules. The first concrete proposal for an urban rail system in Paris was put forward by civil engineer Florence de Kérizouet. This plan called for a surface cable car system. In 1855, civil engineers Edouard Brame and Eugène Flachat proposed an underground freight urban railroad, due to the high rate of accidents on surface rail lines. On 19 November 1871 the General Council of the Seine commissioned a team of 40 engineers to plan an urban rail network. This team proposed a network with a pattern of routes [...] "resembling a cross enclosed in a circle" [...] with <b>axial</b> <b>routes</b> following large boulevards. On 11 May 1872 the Council endorsed the plan, but the French government turned down the plan. After this point, a serious debate occurred over whether the new system should consist of elevated lines or of mostly underground lines; this debate involved numerous parties in France, including Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant, and the Eiffel Society of Gustave Eiffel, and continued until 1892. Eventually the underground option emerged as the preferred solution because of the high cost of buying land for rights-of-way in central Paris required for elevated lines, estimated at 70,000 francs per metre of line for a 20-metre-wide railroad.|$|R
40|$|The {{first two}} {{examples}} of cobalt phosphine PCP pincer complexes, [Co{ 2, 6 - (CH 2 PPh 2 -KPhC 6 H 3 -K[1 }(COh] and [Co{ 2, 6 -(CH 2 PPh 2 -KPhC 6 H 3 -KC 1 }(PMe 3 h] have been synthesised from the precursors [CoCl(PMe 3) 3] and [CO(CH 3) (PMe 3) 4]. Both pincer complexes possess pseudo-trigonal bipyramidal geometry with the coordinating pincer P atoms in equatorial sites and the pincer C atom in an <b>axial</b> site. A <b>route</b> to these pincer complexes has been discovered which involves a rearrangement with loss of PMe 3 from the cyclometallated complex [Co{ 2 -(CH 2 PPh 2 -KP) - 4 -(CH 2 PPh 2) C 6 H 3 -K[1 }(PMe 3) 3]. The mechanism for this rearrangement has been probed by both kinetic studies and deuterium-labelling studies, which suggests that two mechanisms operate, one of which involves a series of intramolecular C-H oxidative additions and reductive eliminations to effectively 'shuttle' protons around the complex. The other mechanism is suggested to involve a proton source, {{which may be the}} solvent, THF. The preparation of some rare examples of cobalt phosphinite PCP pincer complexes based on the diphosphinites 1, 3 -bis(diphenylphosphinooxy) benzene and 1, 3 -bis(diphenylphosphinooxy) - 4, 6 -(di-tert-butyl) benzene is also reported. The synthesis of these pincers proceeds via an isolated cobalt(III) pincer complex with hydride, chloride and PMe 3 ancillary ligands. The subsequent reduction to cobalt(l) pincer complexes proceeds using NEt 3 or LiAlH 4 as reducing agents. The new propane-backboned diphosphines 1, 3 -bis(SH-benzo[b]phosphindol-S- yl) propane and 1, 3 -bis(di- 2 -naphthylphosphino) propane were synthesised. These diphosphines were complexed with [{RhCl(COh}Z] to afford the corresponding dinuclear 12 -membered metallacycles [{RhCl(CO) (Il-diphosphine) } 2], the latter of which possesses two rotational isomers which involves the exchange of the positions of one Cl and one CO ligand. The diphosphines 1, 3 -bis(SH- benzo [b] phosphindol-S-yl) propane and o-di phenyl phosphino benzyldi phenyl- phosphine were complexed with [Rh(CODh]BF 4 to afford cis-chelating mononuclear Rh(l) complexes. The application of these phosphines and complexes as catalysts for methanol reductive carbonylation and homologation has been investigated. The catalyst involving the tetrahydrochloride salt of 1, 3 -bis(di- 2 -pyridylphosphino) propane exhibits methanol reductive carbonylatiori/homologation selectivity superior to the best previously reported literature system. Also, the catalyst involving the diphosphine 1, 3 -bis(SH-benzo[b]phosphindol-S-yl) propane exhibits promising stability and selectivity to acetic acid under reductive carbonylation conditions, signalling a potential application as a methanol carbonylation catalyst.

40|$|A {{new class}} of cryptand-like {{ionophore}} based on a bis calix[4]arene structure has been developed. These molecules proved highly selective for complexation of potassium over all group I metal cations and barium. A range of symmetric and asymmetric calix[4]tubes featuring either alkyl or phenyl substituents at the upper rim have been synthesized in exceptional yield. Alteration of the calix[4]arene upper rim environment enables fine-tuning of the rate of potassium uptake, which can be evaluated through the conformational change on binding by NMR studies. Selectivity of potassium complexation has been demonstrated using NMR and electrospray mass spectral techniques. Molecular modeling studies, derived from crystallographic data, confirm that the potassium metal cation is complexed via the <b>axial</b> <b>route,</b> passing through the calix[4]arene annulus, and provide evidence for complexation rate and selectivity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the current solid waste management practices in Damaturu town and provides a brief discussion on the future challenges. Damaturu town became a state capital in August 1991. Since then the population has been on a steady increase mainly due to influx of people and its strategic location along <b>axial</b> <b>route</b> to major cities in the northeast region. Wastes are being generated mainly from residential, commercial and institutional land uses. Waste collection bins are placed at strategic locations identified by the agency and termed as high waste generating points with wheeled plastic waste bins, metal waste bins and constructed waste bunkers. The contents of these bins are finally disposed of at a location 6 kilometers away from the generating points. Spatial data on waste distribution was collected using a global positioning system (GPS). The data was manipulated and processed using Geographic information system (GIS) to produce the waste distribution map. Findings revealed that the existing solid waste management system is inefficient as the present practice rely on monthly collection and disposal of waste using an open dump site...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the current solid waste management practices in Jimeta town and provides a brief discussion on the future challenges. Jimeta is the administrative headquarter of the Adamawa state. The population has been on a steady increase mainly due to influx of people and its strategic location along <b>axial</b> <b>route</b> linking major cities in the northeast region. Data for this study were obtained from the Adamawa State Environmental Protection Agency (ASEPA) and relevant literature. Records show that waste are neither sorted nor recycled but dumped in an open dumpsite 3 km away from the city. The performance of agency regarding waste evacuation from source of generation to final disposal point has improved but not been impressive from 2004 to date. Results shows that the agency performed below average as large tonnage of solid waste can be seen at designated dumpsites thereby blocking drainage channels and access road. Thus, 11, 747 tons of solid waste was collected over the period of 4 years from 2004 - 2008. However, this figure increased to 16, 151 tons in 2009 - 2013. This achievement was as a result of change in the leadership of the management team and better funding from the government. It is advocated that solid waste management should not be left in the hands of government agency alone. The public and related stakeholders should actively participate in the management of solid waste so as to have a functional environment for working, living and playing. Keywords...|$|E
