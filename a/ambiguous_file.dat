Urban Müller provided a new main mirror site and the backlog of packages were added in. The Amirepo interface of Nicolas Mendoza was integrated and Aminet was officially up and going again in February 2005. During 2005 the uploads started getting going again and in November 2005 most of <b>ambiguous</b> <b>files</b> and [...]readme files were sorted out finally sanitizing the repository. The team has been making lots of changes gradually.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} goals of most biological investigations is to classify and organize the experimental findings {{so that they are}} readily useful for deriving generalized rules. Although there is a huge amount of information on RNA structures in PDB, there are redundant <b>files,</b> <b>ambiguous</b> synthetic sequences etc. Moreover, a systematic hierarchical organization, reflecting RNA classification, is missing in PDB. In this investigation, we have classified all the available RNA crystal structures from PDB through a programmatic approach. Hence, it would be now a simple assignment to regularly update the classification as and when new structures are released. The classification can further determine (i) a non-redundant set of RNA structures and (ii) if available, a set of structures of identical sequence and function, which can highlight structural polymorphism, ligand-induced conformational alterations etc. Presently, we have classified the available structures (2095 PDB entries having RNA chain longer than 9 nucleotides solved by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy) into nine functional classes. The structures of same function and same source are mostly seen to be similar with subtle differences depending on their functional complexation.
