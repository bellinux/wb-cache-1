25|$|Solid {{contributions}} {{throughout the}} order (six men passed 20; Mortensen an unbeaten 55) guided Denmark to a good-looking 265/8 against Malaysia, despite Stevens' haul of 4-48, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> much for their opponents, {{who lost their}} first three wickets for 18 and were eventually dismissed off the penultimate ball for 178, 87 runs behind, despite V Vijiyalingam's 51, his only Trophy half-century. Anil Patel made 65 out of Kenya's 209/9 against local rivals East Africa, who had no chance once they had slumped to 33/5 and lost in the end by 63 runs.|$|E
25|$|The Austrians {{declined}} to launch any more serious assaults on Taponier's division and by 1:00 PM the contest degenerated into an artillery duel. Part of Lambert's brigade was rallied and reoccupied Heidenheim. The Austrians threatening the French right flank began withdrawing to Dillingen an der Donau. For {{the fourth time}} that day Moreau came to see Saint-Cyr, this time accompanied by Desaix. They informed their colleague that Delmas' division was not available yet <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late to attack the Austrian right that day. Everything would be ready the next day. Charles hoped that Moreau might concede defeat, but the morning of 12 August found the French army still in position. Charles then gave the order to fall back. Worried about the artillery ammunition shortage, Moreau did not attack Charles' right, but neither did he panic and retreat. Instead he held his position all day on the 12th waiting for confirmation that the Austrians were withdrawing across the Danube.|$|E

25|$|In March 1911, Captain Ritchie {{returned}} to the Chilco with his crew and began the salvage operations and temporary repairs that were necessary {{to get her back}} to Quesnel where she could be properly made ready for the season. In late April, Ritchie decided that the river was clear and started the trip downstream to Quesnel. Upon entering the head of the Cottonwood Canyon, he saw that the foot of the canyon was blocked solid with ice. The Chilco was rapidly speeding towards the deadly obstacle <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late to turn back. Fortunately, the captain and the crew escaped to the shore on the lifeboat and there were no injuries or loss of life. (Other reports were made in the local paper, then the Fort George Herald, that the escape was made onto the ice). Nonetheless, the end result was the same, the crew survived, but the Chilco did not. She was torn apart in the icy waters and not one piece of her was ever recovered.|$|E
25|$|As soon as White was arrested, he gave {{back the}} $5,500 he had saved in an {{envelope}} that he kept in his room. He was forced to miss the last few games of the season, {{and at that time}} he was averaging 27.7points per game and was the nation's leading scorer. He was only 77total points from setting the new NCAA single season scoring record. When his career came to an abrupt halt, White had scored 1,435points. On February 19, 1951—the day before his arrest—White was named The Sporting News Player of the Year. The only reason that he was still able to accept the honor was because The Sporting News had already mailed out their newest issue <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late to recall the magazine. Although he had been a Consensus Second Team All-American the year before, and was on track to be named a Consensus First Team All-American (and, probably, the Consensus National Player of the Year) as a senior, the NCAA refused to allow any awards or recognition to be bestowed upon any of the schools, players and coaches found {{to be involved in the}} match-fixing scandal that rocked college basketball in the late 1940s into 1951. LIU shut down its entire athletic program from 1951 to 1957 as a result of the scandal.|$|E

At the time, little was known about the new project other than that it was set on a ringworld—a massive ring-shaped habitat. As such, the site founders took aliases from Larry Niven's novel Ringworld; Errera assumed the name [...] "Louis Wu", after the novel's protagonist.

500|$|It {{turned out}} in this episode that the Samantha Mulder (Megan Leitch) who {{appeared}} was a clone. Carter did not {{want it to be}} the real Samantha, since that would have been [...] "straight science fiction" [...] <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> [...] "ridiculous" [...] to give too many answers. Spotnitz further explained that the production crew never saw The X-Files as a [...] "science fiction show", but more of a show that incorporated science fiction, and that this and previous episode [...] "Colony" [...] were more of a [...] "suspense thriller" [...] than any other genre. Chris Carter described the [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game" [...] two-parter as the [...] "backbone of the show, the romantic quest of Mulder for the truth and Scully as well", and that it led Scully to believe in the conspiracy.|$|E
500|$|Kutuzov would {{proclaim}} {{over the}} course of several days that the Russian Army would fight again before the wall of Moscow. In fact, a site was chosen near Poklonnaya Gora within a few miles of Moscow as a battle site. However, the Russian Army had not received enough reinforcements, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> risky to cling to Moscow at all cost. Kutuzov understood that the Russian people never wanted to abandon Moscow, the city which was regarded as Russia's [...] "second capital"; however he also believed that the Russian Army did not have enough force to protect that city. Kutuzov then called for a council of war at the night of September 1 at Fili village. In a heated debate that split five to four to give battle, Kutuzov, after listening to each General, endorsed retreat. Thus passed the last chance of battle before Moscow was taken.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher of {{politics}} Roger D. Masters reviewed {{the book for}} the American Political Science Review, stating {{that it was impossible}} both to review the book and not to do so, given the [...] "attention" [...] it had received. In his view, the book [...] "has the indisputable merit of showing that the existence of complex societies is a biological phenomenon. By emphasizing the relationships between animal behavior and population genetics, Wilson compels us to recognize the evolutionary significance of events which social scientists often treat without reference to Darwinian biology." [...] But there was [...] "a large gap" [...] between that and the work of most political scientists, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> early to attempt to apply sociobiology directly to human social issues in practice. He concluded that the book was fascinating, provocative, and the start of a return to the tradition [...] "as old as Aristotle" [...] where man is seen as [...] "a 'political animal'", since social behaviour had natural origins.|$|E

500|$|While Madero {{was ready}} to {{negotiate}} with Díaz and hold off from attacking, Villa and Orozco {{would have none of}} it. On May 8 the two generals launched an assault on the city without consulting Madero and blamed it on a [...] "spontaneous" [...] outbreak in fighting. The incident that served as an excuse for the offensive occurred when a federal officer insulted a female rebel on a bridge between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso. Madero attempted to halt the violence but Orozco and Villa pressed on. Both of them {{went to great lengths to}} avoid Madero so they wouldn't have to disobey a direct order. Even when Villa was eventually confronted by Castulo Herrera with explicit instructions to stop fighting, he simply ignored him. Likewise, when Madero finally managed to see Orozco in person, he was simply told that the battle was already raging <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late to stop it.|$|E
500|$|Occupancy {{issues at}} Constitution Center were further {{confused}} by legislative action. In October 2011, the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure voted 31-to-22 {{to permit the}} Federal Trade Commission to lease [...] of space at Constitution Center and vacate the Apex Building (which would {{be turned over to}} the National Gallery of Art). Although this legislation was not adopted by Congress, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in March 2012 directed the General Services Administration (GSA) to analyze space needs for the Federal Trade Commission and several other federal agencies in the District of Columbia and issue a report to the committee on how Constitution Center could meet these needs. GSA reported in June 2012 that Constitution Center held too little space to house the entire FTC, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> costly to do so (after accounting for moving expenses and rental prices). GSA instead proposed that the FTC lease additional space at 601 New Jersey Avenue NW and 1800 M Street NW (where it already leased space, and where additional room was available).|$|E
500|$|In January 1864, Confederate General Patrick Cleburne, of the Army of Tennessee, {{proposed}} emancipating and arming the slaves. [...] Davis, when {{he heard}} of it, turned it down and ordered it kept secret. Evans notes that Benjamin [...] "had been thinking in similar terms for much longer, and perhaps the recommendation of so respected an officer was just the impetus he needed." [...] The year 1864 was a disastrous one for the Confederacy, with Lee forced within siege lines at Petersburg and Union General William T. Sherman sacking Atlanta and devastating Georgia on his march to the sea. Benjamin urged Davis to send the secretary's fellow Louisianan, Duncan Kenner, to Paris and London, with an offer of emancipation in exchange for recognition. [...] Davis was only willing to offer gradual emancipation, and both Napoleon and Palmerston rejected the proposal. Benjamin continued to press the matter, addressing a mass meeting in Richmond in February 1865 in support of arming the slaves and emancipating them. [...] A bill eventually emerged from the Confederate Congress in March, but it had many restrictions, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late to affect {{the outcome of the}} war.|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of the season, Duchovny asked Carter [...] "wouldn't it be great if we had like an alien bounty hunter?" [...] Carter was positive towards the idea and acted upon it, creating with Spotniz the character of the Alien Bounty Hunter for the two-part episodes [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game". Actor Brian Thompson auditioned for the role in a casting session, where he was competing with another actor. Spotnitz and Carter did not have much time to cast the character, but they knew this casting would be important since they intended the character to become a recurring character. Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very [...] "distinctive look" [...] about him, most notably his face and mouth. Megan Leitch also appeared in [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game" [...] as a grown-up clone version of Samantha Mulder, and would return to play Samantha or one of her clones over the other seasons. Carter did not want it to be the real Samantha, since that would have been [...] "straight science fiction" [...] <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> [...] "ridiculous" [...] to give too many answers.
