40|$|Oman's public {{education}} system has expanded rapidly, {{with the number}} of teachers employed rising from 32 in 1970 to more than 36, 000 in 2006. Widespread educational reform is currently underway and a number of stakeholders have voiced concerns {{about the quality of the}} novice teachers being appointed. This thesis responds to these concerns through an exploration of the practices and processes used to recruit and select primary and secondary teachers for Oman's public schools. A review of related literature, exploratory analyses and field observations gave rise to a number of research and practical aims. These focuses on assessing the extent to which teacher recruitment and selection (R&S) in Oman corresponded, in theory and in practice, with the normative prescriptions found in the best practice literature; exploring the conflicting perceptions of different stakeholders about the effectiveness of these processes, and contributing to the development of theory-based educational policy in Oman. The empirical study employed both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analyses. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with recruiters, head teachers and school district officials. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to cluster samples of newly recruited teachers. 496 completed questionnaires were analysed representing about 8 % of the total population. The study produced two major findings. First, many of the techniques <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> the R&S of teachers in Oman deviate significantly from those that have been shown to be effective elsewhere. Second, there is a widespread feeling amongst novice teachers that their psychological contracts with their employer have been violated and almost half of all teachers surveyed wish to leave the profession. The findings challenge the widespread community assumption that there is a problem with the quality of new teachers and highlight the importance of managing the expectations and perceptions of appointees throughout the selection and recruitment process...|$|E

The paper draws on earlier research and published works in examining four specific questions about ambiguities of justice, from ethical and theological perspectives, and their relevance for policymakers in the global marketplace. Justice, including social justice, is a significant value impacting on decision and policymakers in government and other types of organizations in a global marketplace. However, the value "justice" exhibits ambiguity or uncertainty. Even if a claim that economic policies developed through prudential judgement are not subject to the moral or ethical code is accepted, it does not absolve individual participants in the policymaking and administrative processes from ethical and moral responsibility if the outcomes of the policies are deemed to be selfish and unjust. This paper is limited by the ability to examine all the literature in the field at a greater depth.

40|$|A {{doctoral}} Thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (Eng. D.) at Loughborough UniversityFollowing several years {{of research and development}} around the subject of BIM, its impact on the design and handover of buildings is now becoming visible across the construction industry. Changes in design procedures and information management methods indicate the potential for greater utilisation of a Common Data Environment in areas other than design. To identify how these changes are influencing the engineering design process, and adapt this process to the needs and requirements of building performance management requires consideration of multiple factors, relating mainly to the stakeholders <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> these procedures. This thesis is the culmination of a four year Engineering Doctorate exploring how BIM could be used to support non-domestic building energy performance management. It begins with an introduction to the research aim and objectives, then presents a thorough review of the subject area and the methodologies employed for the research. Research is split between eight sequential tasks using literature review, interviews, data analysis and case-study application from which findings, conclusions and key recommendations are made. Findings demonstrate disparity between different information environments and provide insight into the necessary steps to enable connection between BIM and monitored building energy performance information. They highlight the following factors essential to providing an information environment suitable for BIM applied performance management: Skills in handling information and the interface between various environments; Technology capable of producing structured and accurate information, supporting efficient access for interconnection with other environments; and Processes that define the standards to which information is classified, stored and modified, with responsibility for its creation and modification made clear throughout the building life-cycle. A prototype method for the linking of BIM and monitored building energy performance data is demonstrated for a case-study building, encountering many of the technical barriers preventing replication on other projects. Methodological challenges are identified using review of existing building design and operation procedures. In conclusion the research found that BIM is still in its infancy, and while efforts are being made to apply it in novel ways to support efficient operation, several challenges remain. Opportunities for building energy performance improvement may be visualised using the modelling environment BIM provides, and the ability to interface with descriptive performance data suggests the future potential for BIM utilisation post-handover...|$|E
40|$|This Ph. D. thesis {{critically}} {{reviews the}} relationship between activism and academe in the inquiry on fairly traded tourism {{and the role of}} reflexivity in assisting with that inquiry. It includes published material, part activist, part academic research outputs, on the concept of Fair Trade in Tourism (FTinT), spanning a time period from 2000 to 2013. From my present academic perspective, it critically engages with some of the personal and socio-political complexities surrounding the organisation, which initiated the investigation into FTinT, and my position within the organisation as a key actor and change agent. Applying reflexivity as a method for deconstruction and dialectical critique of my activist and academic engagement, this thesis uses the FTinT research to explore the interface between activism and academe in tourism research. Accordingly, the writing style is predominantly personal, interwoven with reflections on theoretical currents to inform the analysis. Such personal, reflexive engagement illuminates the underlying mechanisms <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> the quest for developing increased public awareness and tangible, applicable criteria and strategies for fairer trade in tourism at a time when such ideas were entirely original. The analysis in this thesis includes application of several approaches to reflexivity and application of concepts of trustworthiness in qualitative research to accredit the scholarly significance of such activist endeavour. Reflexivity and activism are generally under-researched areas in the tourism academy, even more so in relation to trade justice. In particular, {{there is no evidence of}} research on these areas as interconnected entities. This study therefore provides an original contribution to knowledge in tourism research on a number of different levels. In this inquiry, I am arguing the case for a more concentrated, though critical engagement with activist and participatory action research as a way of addressing issues of inequity and injustice in the tourism trade. In that context, reflexivity approaches can provide important insights into researchers’ underlying values and beliefs which inflect their choices and decision-making and their relationships within the research environment. However, my research also reveals some serious challenges, both in the application of reflexivity and in the engagement with the activist/academic interface. Such challenges relate to issues of ethical and political integrity, cultural sensitivity, memory-work, and the acceptance of the value of the reciprocal relationship between activism and academe within tourism scholarship...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} a 24 -week support group intervention programme which was designed to enhance adaptive behaviour of latent-phase children affected by maternal HIV/Aids. The meta-theoretical paradigms underlying the study were pragmatism and realism. The study was embedded in a concurrent nested (QUALquan) mixed-method design. The quantitative approach in the main study followed a quasi-experimental research design whereas the qualitative approach in this study, contributing to the largest part of the analysis in the study, followed a nested multiple case study design. The theory-driven outcome programme evaluation model applied in this study was the integrative process/outcome evaluation approach. The participants (n= 139) were purposefully selected from among previously identified HIV-positive women (n= 220) with children between the ages of 6 and 10 years at clinics in the Tshwane region, South Africa. Data were collected over a period of five years in multiple waves of intervention implementation. Prolonged, in-depth engagement by the researcher with participants was prioritized. The data collection strategies comprised of mother-and-child psychological questionnaires, group process notes, careworker focus groups, quality assurance questionnaires and field notes. The data were quantitatively analysed by means of a paired-sample t-test for within-group comparisons and descriptive statistics were furthermore applied. The qualitative text and narration obtained through the interviews, documents and focus groups were coded and analysed for themes. The themes of the emergent concepts were re-coded to establish improved defined categories. The different data sampling strategies assisted the researcher in triangulating the data for increased evaluation reliability. The PhD-study was conducted within a broader longitudinal study on resilience in South African mothers and children affected by HIV/Aids – the Promoting Resilience in Young Children Study. The findings of the Child Support Group Evaluation Study (e. g. PhD) showed that the content, methods <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> the group-based sessions were effective and culturally sensitive. The intervention sessions enhanced the children’s coping skills, internalised and externalised behaviour and daily living, communication and socialisation skills. The group provided a buffer for the children and supported them in coping with their mothers’ illness. The children displayed normative values through their religious coping styles, their quest for and display of respect and their unambiguous assertion of right and wrong. A specific finding of this study was that the children created a sphere or space in which to order their thoughts, behaviours and emotions within the intervention. This provided them with parameters in their adverse circumstances to display adaptive behaviour or resilience which they could use to function adequately. The study suggests that the use of support groups should be incorporated into intervention programmes dealing with latent-phase children affected by HIV/Aids.

40|$|Technology is knowledge, the {{technical}} "know-how" employed by a society to produce things that {{improve the quality}} of human life. Like other forms of knowledge, it is transferable; once developed, technology can be applied to uses different-and often remote-from the original application. Thus, the technology that NASA has developed in more than two decades of space and aeronautical research constitutes a valuable national resource, a bank of knowledge available for secondary utilization, or "spinoff. " NASA mainline programs, by their challenging nature, are particularly demanding of technological advance; meeting their goals has forced extraordinary advancements in virtually every scientific and technological discipline. For that reason, the wealth of aerospace-generated knowledge available for transfer is exceptionally diverse, and much of it is readily applicable to secondary use over a broad spectrum of public needs and conveniences. Through its Congressionally mandated Technology Utilization Program, NASA seeks to promote wider use of this technological resource. The program provides a link between the technology bank and those in either the private or public sectors who might be able to re-use the technology productively. Its aim is to accelerate the transfer process, to bring to the marketplace sooner those spinoffs which might eventually occur in the normal course of events, and to gain thereby more immediate economic benefit in terms of new products and new jobs. The program has been remarkably successful. Since its inception 17 years ago, thousands of spinoff products and processes have emerged. Some of these innovations bring only moderate increments of economic gain or lifestyle improvement, but many others amount to significant public benefits, with economic values often running to millions of dollars. Collectively, spinoffs provide a substantial bonus return on the funds invested in aerospace research. This publication is intended to increase public awareness of the resource that is NASA's technology bank and its potential for further public benefit. It is devoted primarily to the NASA technology transfer process, but in the interests of perspective it also describes related areas of NASA endeavor. Section 1 consists of a resume of NASA's current mainline programs. These programs are producing direct public benefit through direct application of technology; at the same time, they are contributing to indirect benefit-spinoff-by generating new technology which may find secondary application in the future. Section 2 is the focal point of this volume. It contains a representative sampling of spinoff products <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> various avenues of everyday life, and it describes briefly the NASA technology from which these transfers derived. Section 3 details the mechanisms of the technology transfer process, including the means by which NASA seeks to stimulate technology utilization. Also described are NASA's activities in a related area of technology transfer: provision of assistance to agencies interested in exploiting the benefit potential of satellite remote sensing technology...|$|E

In this review, we consider the evidence for this statement, and question the justification for using cryoprecipitate rather than virus-inactivated fibrinogen concentrate to support plasma fibrinogen levels. Haemophilia was historically treated with cryoprecipitate, but specific coagulation factor concentrates are now preferred. In contrast, primary fractions of allogeneic donor blood, including cryoprecipitate, are still commonly used to treat perioperative bleeding. When compared with cryoprecipitate and fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), freeze-dried fibrinogen concentrate offers standardised fibrinogen content, faster reconstitution and improved efficacy. Pasteurisation <b>and</b> purification <b>processes</b> <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> the preparation of fibrinogen concentrate {{reduce the risk of}} pathogen transmission and immune-mediated complications, in comparison with cryoprecipitate and FFP. When all costs associated with administration are taken into consideration, the cost of fibrinogen concentrate is not substantially different to that of cryoprecipitate. In conclusion, wider availability and use of fibrinogen concentrate may improve the management of perioperative bleeding. Further benefits may accrue from more rapid and accurate techniques for monitoring fibrinogen levels. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate methods of measuring fibrinogen and assessing fibrin polymerisation, and to define critical haemostatic plasma fibrinogen concentrations in different perioperative situations...|$|R

Occurs, however, that in Brazil and other countries of the world, many of the methods used for the design of pavements structures are deter-ministic in nature, in other words, they use the average parameters for mechanical structure characterization not bothering to quantify the damage caused by the variation of parameters from the executive process. In practice, as all industrial processes, construction processes are subject to vary that should always be measured and controlled to ensure product quality. Within this context, this work presents a methodology to carry out risk analysis of flexible pavements structures based on mechanistic criteria commonly used in Brazil. Based on the case studies {{it was found that the}} proposed methodology provides good practical application in both project design and quality control phases for new pavement structures...|$|R

Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63 {{highlights the importance of}} eight of our critical infrastructures and outlines a plan for action. Greatly enhanced physical security systems will be required to protect these national assets from new and emerging threats. Sandia National Laboratories has been the lead laboratory for the Department of Energy (DOE) in developing and deploying physical security systems for the past twenty-five years. Many of the tools, <b>processes,</b> <b>and</b> systems <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> the protection of high consequence facilities can be adapted to the civilian infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{wind farms}} {{are located in}} various {{different}} locations each with their own unique conditions. Notwithstanding, the <b>processes</b> <b>and</b> methodology <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> their structural design are typically similar. The paper therefore presents a generic introductory overview of the process involved in the structural design of the support structure for offshore wind turbine structures. This is done by considering the methodology employed for a monopile type support structure, since {{this is the most}} common form of foundation to date. Finally, a brief description of the manufacturing <b>process,</b> transport <b>and</b> installation stages is also provided. Bajada New Energy Ltd., CD Power Saving Co. Ltd., Energy Investment Co.

40|$|A {{structure}} is proposed {{to connect the}} decisions which a driver has to make before changing lanes. The model is intended to cover the urban driving situation, where traffic signals, obstructions and heavy vehicles all exert an influence. The {{structure is}} designed {{to ensure that the}} vehicles in traffic simulations behave logically when confronted with situations commonly encountered in real traffic. The specific mathematical expression of the questions embedded <b>in</b> the decision <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> the present implementation of the model are not critical and can be replaced by alternatives, but the heirarchy of the decisions is crucial. On the basis of experience to date, the lane changing model produces a realistic simulation of driver behaviour and has proved very robust under a wide range of conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|Proverbs are sayings, {{ideologies}} and beliefs {{derived from the}} popular wisdom and express, through a short sentence, a thought and arguments, which can be cultural, moral, social and religious, which wisely appropriate the function of teaching, advise and communicate. The anti proverbs are recreations of original sayings with change of direction. This research aims at investigating and reflecting on the possibilities of bringing these micro texts born in popular oral culture to the written culture context of children and adolescents, using proverbs and anti proverbs as a teaching resource for language teaching and literature. This research wants to emphasize the richness of folk wisdom and reflect on the many possibilities of their use in interpretation and text production activities. This paper is justified by the importance that have the language studies and literature in the school context and the first part {{will look at the}} terminology relating to these short texts, its origin, transmission and importance within popular culture <b>and</b> the <b>processes</b> <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> the creation of anti proverbs. The second step will be detailed aspects of the use of these micro texts in language and literature classes. The theoretical framework includes authors who address the matter in its multiple dimensions and projects related to language studies and literature and among them we cite Xatara & Succi (2008), PCN (1997), Donato (1994) and Sant'Anna (1988) ...|$|R
