She claimed that she had no role in the killing other than helping her brother, under duress, load the body into his car. She told investigators, [...] "I did not want him to die. I just wanted my brother to intimidate him so that he would continue to pay me my allowance. But he didn't want to have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> so a violent quarrel broke out. I left the room because I could not stand to see what was happening".|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{started the}} first few matches of the 2014–15 season, but with the loan signing of Jason Steele from Middlesbrough, he was dropped from the first team. On 15 November 2014, Robinson {{announced}} his intentions of leaving the club in the January transfer window. He said that, [...] "I'm pretty much surplus to requirements at Blackburn. I'm {{not even on the}} bench. I'm training hard at the moment though. My contract is {{up at the end of}} the season so I'm not sure if that's got <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> I want to keep playing and, I believe, I've got another two or three years left in me." [...] At the end of the season, it was announced that he would be released at the end of his contract.|$|E

500|$|Several suicides were {{connected}} to the campaign, including a Cuban gay activist in Miami named Ovidio [...] "Herbie" [...] Ramos, who was stunned at the vehemence against homosexuals. He and several other Cuban gay activists participated in a radio call-in show to hear people say homosexuals should be deported, forced into concentration camps, or executed. Ramos shot himself {{a few days later}} after telling a friend, [...] "I didn't know they hated us so much". Another Cuban gay activist named Manolo Gomez was fired from his job and severely beaten, after which he decided to leave Miami. Gay activists in New Orleans tried to discourage Bryant's performance with the New Orleans Pops orchestra by connecting local suicides to her campaign. Bryant responded to violence saying, [...] "It made me sad and shocked me that anyone would think I had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> but my conscience is clear. I can't be responsible for how people react to what happened in Dade County. My stand was not taken out of homophobia, but of love for them." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{positive}} {{response to the}} opening sequence by Banksy, creator Matt Groening and Jean came to Kricfalusi {{and asked him if}} he could do something similar. Originally, they only wanted him to do the storyboards and then let their regular crew animate it, but Kricfalusi insisted on doing the animation himself, explaining that [...] "If we had done it that way, no one would even have known that I had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> because it would have ended up on model and all pose to pose". [...] On The Simpsons, the animators draw key poses and then let tweeners interpolate between those poses. The interpolation however, is a straight a to b animation. That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose. Kricfalusi explains that on The Simpsons he [...] "wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways, not just looking funny each time they come to a stop", and further elaborated [...] "that the way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work. You can’t write visual performance. You have to actually draw it." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna was {{released}} in hardback in the United States in November 2001. It debuted at position 15 on The New York Times Best Seller list, and reached eight the next week, but was present there for only two weeks. Madonna was still livid that Morton wrote the book without her permission, even saying [...] "It's not a well-written book. We all know he wrote it for financial gain and the truth {{had little to do}} with it", after the book {{was released}}. With Jo Whiley from BBC Radio 1, she added that [...] " [...] really went through my Rolodex and that part was really annoying, and I ended up writing him a letter saying, 'I'm not interested in you writing this book, I don't want to have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> – and please leave my friends alone'." [...] The singer said that she had even sent Morton a book of philosophy—The Power of Kabbalah—to try to dissuade him from continuing. [...] "It's a beginner's crash course in what it's all about – that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him, but he either didn't read it or didn't care," [...] Madonna added.|$|E

2500|$|Bryan Roth, a {{psychiatrist}} and pharmacologist at the University of North Carolina who has led the research into how salvia's active constituent salvinorin A works, says it's difficult to say what role the drug might have played in Brett Chidester's suicide. Although [...] "it's tragic that this young guy killed himself," [...] he says, [...] "there's {{no way of knowing}} if salvia had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> It would seem, given the apparent widespread use of salvia, that if these are side effects, they don't occur at very high prevalence.

A youth, John Solyem, was brought forward. He said that he had been watching the Gunness place and that he saw Lamphere running down the road from the Gunness house just before the structure erupted in flames.

2500|$|On April 29, 2011, {{a retired}} police officer told the Sun News Network and the Toronto Sun {{newspaper}} that in 1996, Layton {{had been found}} in a massage parlour when police, looking for underage Asian sex workers, raided the establishment. The police informed Layton of the potentially questionable use of the business and recommended that he avoid it in the future. No charges were filed. The Sun later ran a follow-up piece, in which Toronto city councillor Giorgio Mammoliti criticized Layton. Layton has said there was no wrongdoing in the matter, saying that he simply [...] "went for a massage at a community clinic" [...] and did not return after the police advised him not to. He also referred to the release of the police report as a smear campaign against him. Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe also dismissed the claim. A columnist for the National Post suggested that it was a Liberal insider that leaked the story, although a Liberal Party spokesman denied that they had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Beria was no easy man to defeat, and his ethnicisation {{policies}} (that a {{local or}} republican leaders {{had to have}} ethnic origins, and speak {{the language of the}} given area) proved to be a tool to strengthen the MVD's grip on local party organs. Khrushchev and Malenkov, who had begun receiving information which stated that the MVD had begun spying on party officials, started to act in the spring of 1953. Beria was defeated at the next Presidium plenums by a majority against him, and not long after, Khrushchev and Malenkov started to plan Beria's fall from power. However, this was no easy task, as Beria was able to inspire fear in his colleagues. In Khrushchev's and Malenkov's first discussion with Kliment Voroshilov, Voroshilov did not want <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> because he feared [...] "Beria's ears". However, Khrushchev and Malenkov were able to gather enough support for Beria's ouster, but only when a rumour of a potential coup led by Beria began to take hold within the party leadership. Afraid of the power Beria held, Khrushchev and Malenkov were prepared for a potential civil war. This did not happen, and Beria was forced to resign from all his party posts on 26 June, and was later executed on 23 December. Beria's fall also led to criticism of Stalin; the party leadership accused Beria of using Stalin, a sick and old man, to force his own will on the Soviet Union during Stalin's last days. This criticism, and much more, led party and state newspapers to launch more general criticism of Stalin and the Stalin era. A party history pamphlet {{went so far as to}} state that the party needed to eliminate [...] "the incorrect, un-Marxist interpretation of the role of the individual in history, which is expressed in propaganda by the idealist theory of the cult of personality, which is alien to Marxism".|$|E
