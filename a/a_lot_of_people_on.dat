So there we are standing, a bunch of us, and we’re all looking at it, and the soldier standing next to me said, 'The comets of Kandahar.' So that became the title of the piece." ...|$|E

40|$|In present times {{coastal dunes}} are rapidly {{changing}} by human impact and by waves due to increasing sea level. The {{most important factors}} in natural dune development are aeolian processes, dune vegetation cover and wind factor. In Poland different dune development stages affected by every mentioned factor may be studied on Swina Gate Barrier localised on Wolin and Uznam Islands along 16 kilometres of dune coast. On this area investigations are carrying by author since 1996. The aim of undertaken researches is to discover relations and connection between natural and antropogenic processes that are influences on coastal dunes. Driven researches consist of: (i) dune relief changes, (ii) plant vegetation dynamics, (iii) human or animal influence, (iv) storm surges impact, (v) wind factor impact, (vi) sediment diversification and dynamics analyses (surface and structures dynamics). These investigations are repeated four times per year according to the different seasons. West winds (common during dune plants activity period) favour to dune development in contribution with dense plant cover in middle part of barrier. Strong Northeast winds (common in cold period) bring sandy material from abraded on NE cliffs. Storm surges are causing abrasion of the dunes but supply beach with material. Low thickness of sand helps in aeolian transportation along barrier beaches. Absence of mass tourism in middle part of barrier lead to natural development of this part and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> Świnoujście town beaches stops new dune development. Coast erosion and human presence in Międzyzdroje town lead to dune regression there. Since 1997 is observed increasing of the new dune ridge on developing beach on Wolin Island. ...|$|E
