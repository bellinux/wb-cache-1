5|$|Van der Weyden {{developed}} {{the conventions of}} northern portraiture and was hugely influential on the following generations of painters. Rather than merely follow van Eyck's meticulous attention to detail, van der Weyden created more abstract and sensual representations. He was highly sought after as a portraitist, yet there are noticeable similarities in his portraits, likely because he used and reused the same underdrawings, which met common ideals of rank and piety. These were then adapted to show the facial characteristics <b>and</b> <b>expressions</b> of the particular sitter.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{models of}} face {{perception}} emphasize distinct routes for processing face identity <b>and</b> <b>expression.</b> These {{models have been}} highly influential in guiding neural and behavioural research on the mechanisms of face perception. However, it is becoming clear that specialised brain areas for coding identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> may respond to both attributes and that identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> perception can interact. Here we use perceptual aftereffects to demonstrate the existence of dimensions in perceptual face space that code both identity <b>and</b> <b>expression,</b> further challenging the traditional view. Specifically, we find a significant positive association between face identity aftereffects <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> aftereffects, which dissociates from other face (gaze) and non-face (tilt) aftereffects. Importantly, individual variation in the adaptive calibration of these common dimensions significantly predicts ability to recognize both identity <b>and</b> <b>expression.</b> These results highlight the role of common dimensions {{in our ability to}} recognize identity <b>and</b> <b>expression,</b> <b>and</b> show why the high-level visual processing of these attributes is not entirely distinct...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and review the current legal boundaries of student speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> rights in public school, as developed and defined by the U. S. federal courts, to better enable educators to make informed decisions regarding student speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> when confronted with such situations. The study examined federal court student speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> decisions published between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 2008. Four Supreme Court decisions and numerous lower federal court decisions were reviewed and analyzed to identify the current legal boundaries of student speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> in school. The Supreme Court decisions in Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Sch. Dist. (1969), Bethel Sch. Dist. v. Fraser (1986), Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier (1988), and Morse v. Frederick (2007) were reviewed to identify the principles that express the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s perspective of student speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> in school. The study then focused on the lower federal courts 2 ̆ 7 interpretation and application of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s student speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> decisions to specific circumstances, and school leaders 2 ̆ 7 utilization of these principles in making informed decisions regarding student speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> rights under the First Amendment. The study concluded that the current constitutional boundaries of student speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> rights in school were identified by applying the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s student speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> principles to specific factual situations encountered by school leaders and addressed by the federal courts. The results of the study were condensed into a reference table that displays a spectrum of possible student speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> factual situations, identifies how the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s student speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> principles may be applied to specific sets of facts, and provides educators with an instrument that may be used to assist in making informed decisions regarding student speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> in school...|$|R
40|$|Whether facial {{identity}} <b>and</b> facial <b>expression</b> was processed independently {{has long}} been a controversy. Studies at levels of experimental, neuropsychological, functional imaging and cell-recording all failed to consistently support either independent or interdependent processing. Present study proposed that familiarity and discriminability of facial identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> was important variable in mediating the relation between facial identity <b>and</b> facial <b>expression</b> recognition. Effects of familiarity on recognition of facial identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> had been examined (e. g. Ganel & Goshen-Gottstein, 2004) but the role of the discriminability in recognition of facial identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> has not yet been carefully examined. To examine the role of discriminability of facial identity <b>and</b> <b>expression,</b> 8 experiments were conducted with Garner’s speeded classification task in recognition of identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> of unfamiliar faces. The discriminability of facial identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> was manipulated, <b>and</b> the measurements of Garner interference and facilitation indicated that: 1. The discriminability of facial identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> mediate the relation between facial identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> recognition. Four possible discriminability combinations between identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> predicted 4 interference patterns between them. Low discriminability accounted for the interference either in facial identity judgment or in facial expression judgment task. 2. The measurements of eye movements indicated that either in facial identity or in facial expression recognition low discriminability led to a narrowly-distributed eye fixation pattern while high discriminability led to a widely-distributed eye fixation pattern. 3. By combining the morphing technique with the Garner paradigm, study 2 successfully demonstrated the linar relation between discriminability and Garner facilitation effects, confirmed the discriminability effects in the measurements of Garner facilitation effects [...] 4. By providing the varying information of facial expression, study 2 revealed that varying information improved the discriminability of facial <b>expression,</b> <b>and</b> then enhanced the recognition of facial expression. All the results indicated that the discriminability of facial identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> could mediate the independent or interdependent processing between them, and the discriminability effects on recognition of identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> of unfamiliar faces was identified. The results from interference effects and facilitation effects both indicated that the dimensional relation between facial identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> was separable but not asymmetric claimed by previous studies（Schweinberger et al, 1998, 1999 ）. Absolutedly independent or interdependent processing between facial identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> recognition were both impossible, discriminability of identity <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> mediated the relation between them. The discriminability effects revealed in present study could explain the conflicts between existing findings well. 面孔身份识别与面部表情识别是彼此独立的还是相互影响的？研究者各持己见，神经心理学、认知神经科学和行为学三方面的研究均未得到肯定一致的结论。已有研究表明，熟悉度对身份识别加工与表情识别加工之间的关系具有重要影响。本研究认为，区分度也是影响二者之间关系的重要因素。本研究以不熟悉面孔图片为刺激材料，操纵身份的区分度与表情的区分度，采用Garner快速分类任务，分别测查Garner效应中的干扰效应与促进效应，系统地研究了身份识别加工与表情识别加工之间的关系。主要研究发现可以概括为以下 4 个方面： 1. 在 4 种可能的身份区分度与表情区分度的组合条件下，分别测查身份与表情之间的相互干扰效应，结果表明：区分度调节身份与表情之间的干扰效应，低区分度导致身份识别或表情识别的非独立加工。 2. 测量并比较高区分度与低区分度条件下的眼动注视模式，结果表明：无论是身份识别还是表情识别，低区分度都会导致相对集中的眼动注视模式，而高区分度则导致相对分散的眼动注视模式。 3. 结合使用morphing变形技术与Garner范式，测查身份与表情之间的促进效应，结果表明，区分度调节身份与表情之间的促进效应，低区分度导致身份识别或表情识别的非独立加工。 4. 以系列变形的分类边界为指标，通过序列无间隔呈现morphing变形图片提供表情的变化性信息，结果表明，表情的变化性信息会提高表情的区分度，从而促进表情的独立识别。这克服了以往研究只采用静态表情信息的不足。 上述发现表明，不熟悉面孔的身份与表情之间是一种可分离的维度关系，而不是已有研究所认为的不对称维度关系。身份识别加工与表情识别加工之间并非绝对的独立或者绝对的非独立关系，身份和（或）表情的区分度均可以调节二者之间的关系。本研究所揭示的身份识别与表情识别中的区分度效应，可较好地解释已有相关研究结果之间的不一致...|$|R

40|$|Adiponectin {{is intimately}} {{involved}} in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular functions. The circulating concentration of adiponectin is decreased in obesity and Type  2 diabetes. The present study attempts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of adiponectin secretion <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> in rat primary adipocytes. The β-agonist, isoprenaline, decreased adiponectin secretion <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> in a dose-dependent manner in primary adipocytes. Importantly, such an inhibitory effect could be blocked by insulin. The opposing effects of isoprenaline and insulin {{could be explained by}} differential regulation of intracellular cAMP levels, since cAMP analogues suppressed adiponectin secretion <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> in a fashion similar to isoprenaline, and insulin blocked the inhibitory effects of the cAMP analogue hydrolysable by PDE (phosphodiesterase). A specific PDE 3 inhibitor, milrinone, and PI 3 K (phosphoinositide 3 -kinase) inhibitors abolished the effects of insulin on adiponectin secretion <b>and</b> <b>expression.</b> In the same studies, leptin secretion <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> displayed a similar pattern of regulation to adiponectin. We conclude that insulin and β-agonists act directly at the adipocytes in opposing fashions to regulate the production of adiponectin and leptin, and that a PI 3 K-PDE 3 B-cAMP pathway mediates the effects of insulin to restore β-agonist/cAMP-suppressed secretion <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> of these two adipokines...|$|R
