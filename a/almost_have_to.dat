25|$|Yes, it was difficult. The chemo really {{knocked me}} down, but I guess they <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kill {{you before you}} can start in your recovery.

But there are times--not always, but now and again--when I <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> believe that Leslie doesn't--doesn't like me. Sometimes I {{surprise}} {{a look in}} her eyes that seems to show resentment and dislike--it goes so quickly--but I've seen it, I'm sure of that. And it hurts me, Captain Jim. I'm not used to being disliked--and I've tried so hard to win Leslie's friendship." ...|$|E

[...] "Lady Staveley," [...] said she, [...] "why does not your son go and hunt, or shoot, or fish, instead of staying in the house all day? It seems to me that his time is so heavy on his hands that he will <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hang himself." ...|$|E

6000|$|The weariness of dish-washing had {{increased}} {{her desire to}} go. She pictured herself looking at Emerson's manse, bathing in a surf of jade and ivory, wearing a trottoir and a summer fur, meeting an aristocratic Stranger. In the spring Kennicott had pathetically volunteered, [...] "S'pose you'd like {{to get in a}} good long tour this summer, but with Gould and Mac away and so many patients depending on me, don't see how I can make it. By golly, I feel like a tightwad though, not taking you." [...] Through all this restless July after she had tasted Bresnahan's disturbing flavor of travel and gaiety, she wanted to go, but she said nothing. They spoke of and postponed a trip to the Twin Cities. When she suggested, {{as though it were a}} tremendous joke, [...] "I think baby and I might up and leave you, and run off to Cape Cod by ourselves!"

50|$|Models have {{predicted}} that empirical relationships between temporal variation of community productivity and species diversity are indeed real, and that they <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be. Some temporal stability data can be almost completely explained by the averaging effect by constructing null models to test the data against. Competition, which causes negative covariances, only serves to strengthen these relationships.|$|E
5000|$|Blegvad {{said that}} he and Greaves {{deliberately}} created a gap between the words and the music to make the album more interesting. [...] "To understand the words you <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stop the record and read them, referring to the illustrations on the sleeve." [...] Blegvad also {{said in an interview that}} he created experimental and confusing lyrics as a way of coming to terms with Greaves's complicated music, which he found difficult to play.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, Cantwell voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), which angered many who opposed free trade agreements.

5000|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave a lacklustre review, stating: [...] "At a {{time when}} {{everything}} is uncertain ... you <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> admire a record like We Can't Dance. ... You know {{there will be a}} couple of fleeting moments when the band breaks out of its torpor - for instance, on the very polite primal stomp of 'I Can't Dance' - and that such moments will just as quickly be subsumed {{by the rest of the}} musical quicksand." ...|$|E
5000|$|You see, {{everybody}} {{always talk}} about Hitler exterminating 6 million Jews...but don't nobody ever asked {{what did they do}} to Hitler? What did they do to them folks? They went in there, in Germany, the way they do everywhere they go, and they supplanted, they usurped, they turned around, and a German, in his own country, would <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go to a Jew to get money. They had undermined the very fabric of the society.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{introduction}} to Skull-Face and Others (1945) editor August Derleth wrote [...] "In the tales concerning Solomon Kane, Bran Mak Morn, King Kull, and Conan, there is quite possibly more blood-letting and more lusty carnage {{than in any other}} group of stories which appeared in pulp magazines in America during the 1930s. There have come to Arkham House frequent requests for a collection of all the Conan stories; such a collection would <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be printed on blood-coloured paper." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Kim gave a simply {{astonishing}} performance. It is rare to hear {{a performer}} so aware of the possibilities for intimacy in the Albert Hall’s massive acoustic: Kim placed pianissimos always {{on the edge of}} disappearance so that the audience <b>almost</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> strain to hear; the effect was spellbinding, particularly in the simple but shattering cadenzas of the second movement."

5000|$|You {{held the}} {{position}} of archbishop of the Seattle diocese for 16 years. In that time, you had {{a huge impact on}} area Catholics {{as well as on the}} church as a whole. What do you think is the greatest legacy of your tenure?"You'd <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask that question to somebody else. If I have to respond, I have to say that I brought to the church, as I understood it, what the Second Vatican Council was inviting us to become." ...|$|E

According to the {{estimates}} of a priest of Tel Keppe's Sacred Heart Chaldean Rite Catholic Church, there were 10,000 worshipers in the late 1950s and this decreased to 2,000 around 2004.

By the time you finish the book, you <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wonder why anyone {{in their right mind}} could find any reason to admire or like Israel. ... They had an {{observation}} worth making and a position worth debating. But their argument is so dry, so one-sided — an Israel lobby that leads America around by the nose — they suggest that not only do they not know Israel, they don't know America, either." ...|$|E

My efforts are aimed at eroding the high ground that the intentionalist {{position}} appears to enjoy {{in the interpretation of}} state and federal constitutions.

This Article is an attempt to reverse this assumed burden of persuasion...|$|R
5000|$|As a {{child of}} the 1980s, Korine grew in the age of VHS. He remembers his first camera, given to him by his father, and reusing the tape over and over again. “There was {{something}} interesting about certain images or scenes bubbling up to the surface.” On the rationale for using VHS as the medium for Trash Humpers, Korine stated “There’s this obsession nowadays with technology and the fact that everything looks so clear. Everything needs to be so high-definition. There was a strange beauty in the analog. You <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> squint to see things through the grain and the mist. There’s something sinister about it.” ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{then became}} a {{supporting}} character in the monthly Batman titles, eventually taking {{over the role of}} Batman through the [...] "Knightfall," [...] "Knightquest," [...] and [...] "KnightsEnd" [...] story arcs. One of the creators, Denny O'Neil, admitted to having difficulties with Azrael's transition from villain to hero: [...] "If I'd known he was to become a monthly character, I might have set him up differently ... The problem is that I had to turn a bad guy into a real hero, not just an anti-hero or lead. It's possible to do that, but it's difficult to retain the original characterization. You <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change his personality." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hooray for Boobies has {{received}} moderately favorable reviews. Many reviewers complimented the album's duncical, but ultimately enjoyable, humor. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas wrote, [...] "on one hand, it's easy {{to hate the}} Bloodhound Gang. ... On the other hand, you <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> admire the lengths that they go to be, well, defiantly stupid." [...] Many reviewers also complimented the album's eccentric plunderphonic-esque approach to music. Popmatters reviewer Patrick Schabe compared the Bloodhound Gang to Beck, saying, [...] "if anomalous characterization, synthesis, and a popular culture repertoire make Beck the big brother of postmodern music, then surely he’s part of a family? If so, then perhaps the Bloodhound Gang are the snotty, juvenile, teenage brother in that family." ...|$|E
5000|$|Frank Patrick {{suffered}} a heart attack and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sell his interest in the Montreal Canadiens, and the Habs <b>almost</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> move to Cleveland. But Tommy Gorman kept the team alive. They added Emile [...] "Butch" [...] Bouchard to start his great career on defence and another very good player, Buddy O'Connor, at centre. Montreal had goaltending problems as Bert Gardiner slumped, and rookie Paul Bibeault replaced him. He showed flashes of brilliance, but his inexperience showed. Joe Benoit starred with 20 goals, the first Canadien to do that since 1938-39, when Toe Blake did it.|$|R

5000|$|Gibb also {{performed}} [...] "Saved by the Bell" [...] in Auckland, New Zealand. As he recalls: It was quite chaotic {{because there was}} {{a whole lot of people}} and not a lot of security. I <b>almost</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> climb a tree, it was frightening. It got quite dangerous. The concept of security hadn't crept into the popular arena. It started out as enjoyable and then the audience got out of hand.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Gove, {{speaking}} on BBC Two's Newsnight Review, said: 'It {{tells the story}} of England's past in a way which someone who's familiar with the Whig tradition of history would find, as I did, completely sympathetic. It's amazing to see a film made now that is so patriotic ... One of the striking things about this film is that it's almost a historical anomaly. I can't think of a historical period film in which England and the English have been depicted heroically for the last forty or fifty years. You <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go back to Laurence Olivier's Shakespeare's Henry V in which you actually have an English king and English armies portrayed heroically'.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{intellectual}} pleasures are {{the purest}} {{and the most}} perfect. They persist throughout life undiminished and constantly trigger new feelings of happiness. One should expect that an institution such as a school, which deals only with intellectual subjects, and at the youngest age of life, would <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> generate a rapture of discovery and understanding: - And it produces just the opposite! The student works not only with occasional overexertion and difficulty, which is naturally unavoidable {{in even the most}} liberal of intellectual endeavors, but with an immense feeling of displeasure. And this is expected at an age which, on account of its tenderness and need for joy, is least of all appropriate. On these young shoulders, in fact, lies a burden which the man only thinks back on in horror and yet it is perpetually alive in his dreams. ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the album's lyrical and {{thematic}} content, Jason Lytle noted, [...] "I {{think if}} anything, {{some of the}} elements that used to drive {{a lot of my}} favourite Grandaddy songs home, was this whole storytelling aspect. Creating these little worlds and creating sounds and creating lines where you <b>almost</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> create your own little image to go with what you're hearing. ... I had this recurring image throughout the album, and I don't know where this came from. It's this recurring image, of some sort of tragedy. It's a woman, stranded, up high, in a blizzard, among the rocks and a guy who is down in the valley who can't do anything about it and its this distress of him knowing he can't do anything about it. I think there are two or three songs, where that imagery pops up." ...|$|E
