5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an <b>anti-adhesive</b> effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E

Strains were grown in M 17 broth with either lactose, saccharose or glucose added. After harvesting, cells were suspended in water or in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. 0, and suspension droplets were put {{on a piece of}} FEP-Tenon. Changes in droplet profile were analysed by ADSA-P to yield the surface tension decrease due to biosurfactant production as a function of time. Surface tension decreases larger than 8 mJ. m(- 2) were taken as indicative of biosurfactant production. Only five strains produced biosurfactants in water, solely when saccharose was added to the growth medium. In buffer, all strains produced biosurfactants and production was generally greater than in water. Also, most strains suspended in buffer produced maximally when saccharose was added to the growth medium, whereas one strain produced maximally in buffer upon the addition of glucose. Four strains suspended in buffer produced biosurfactants when glucose was added and only two strains when lactose was added. The possible role of these biosurfactants as <b>anti-adhesives</b> in the dairy industry and for the survival of these strains in natural systems is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Of all {{the various}} kinds of foods, an egg is special for its {{combination}} of all essential food nutrients in one item. However {{for much of the}} past 40 years, the public has been warned away from eggs because of concerns that they increase the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke and a claim that they raise the blood pressure by causing vasoconstriction. In Tanzania, up to date there are some cultures that forbid women in general or pregnant women in particular from eating eggs due to a belief that they will get bald babies or have problems during delivery. Several studies over the years have examined egg intake and its relationship with coronary outcome. When dietary confounders were considered, no association was seen between egg consumption and the risk of coronary heart disease in non-diabetic men and women. Recent researches have not only linked eggs with biological functions beyond basic nutrition but to a huge potential in the medical field. Eggs are now linked to fetal brain development and boosting of the immune system thus consequently lowering the risk of getting breast cancer, colon and lung cancer. For already developed cancer, eggs show potential for the development ofpromising anticancer drugs through the production of Monoclonal antibodies. They are also proven to prevent cataract and macular degeneration and protect against heart attacks and strokes by preventing rteriosclerosis and facilitating fat metabolism. Moreover researchers now not only prove eggs do not increase your blood cholesterol, but also link eggs to lowering high blood pressure by acting like an antihypertensive through an ACEI like inhibiting mechanism. Components in eggs were also found to be active as <b>anti-adhesives,</b> microbiocidals and as chelators in metal poisoning. Good news to egg lovers again...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Infectious {{diseases}} are the second {{leading cause of}} mortality worldwide, accounting for 14. 9 million deaths each year. Diarrheal diseases, usually a result of infection by enteric pathogens, cause 1. 8 million of these deaths, {{a disproportionate number of}} which are infants and children. Pathogen adhesion to host tissue is a prerequisite for a majority of infectious diseases, so these adhesion mechanisms are of primary concern to understand the pathogenesis of infectious disease and to develop strategies to combat these ailments. Of the many adhesion mechanisms that pathogens have evolved, cell surface glycoconjugates {{are one of the most}} common targets. A biosensor capable of screening pathogens against many carbohydrate structures at one time would help address the challenges of identifying binding partners, understanding bacterial adhesion, and developing <b>anti-adhesives.</b> To better understand the challenges associated with studying whole cell binding with biosensors, as well as to maximize opportunities, two very different biosensing platforms were chosen as promising technologies for studying bacterial adhesion: (1) a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) -based microelectrode array and (2) an instrument based on silicon photonic microring resonators. For each of these platforms, we developed and implemented functionalization techniques and experimental protocols to enable the study of carbohydrate-mediated bacterial interactions. In the case of the microelectrode array, a polypyrrole functionalization technique was used to evaluate bacterial adhesion to glyconconjugates immobilized on the microelectrodes, and the dose-dependent inhibition of Salmonella enterica binding demonstrated a real-world application of this platform. Achieving carbohydrate-mediated bacterial adhesion on the microring resonators proved elusive, but significant advancements were made on this emerging biosensor platform in the form of several different functionalization techniques and antibody-based capture of Campylobacter jejuni...|$|R
50|$|Most mucins adsorb to solid {{surfaces}} {{fairly easily}} without surface preparation {{due to the}} attractive interaction of the surface with the non-glycosylated region of the molecule. Surface force measurements reveal that long range steric repulsion forces exist between mucin coated surfaces and can be detected {{at a distance of}} up 100 nm or more. This indicates that mucin segments extend into the ambient solution at a long distance. Because mucin is amphiphilic, the non-glycosylated regions of the molecule interacts with the surface and the glycosylated region interacts with the ambient solution causing the steric repulsion. The repulsive forces applied by the mucin creates <b>anti-adhesive</b> properties which can suppress cell adhesion to surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|HAS {{can play}} roles {{in all of}} the stages of cancer metastasis. By {{producing}} <b>anti-adhesive</b> HA, HAS can allow tumor cells to release from the primary tumor mass and if HA associates with receptors such as CD44, the activation of Rho GTPases can promote EMT of the cancer cells. During the processes of intravasation or extravasation, the interaction of HAS produced HA with receptors such as CD44 or RHAMM promote the cell changes that allow for the cancer cells to infiltrate the vascular or lymphatic systems. While traveling in these systems, HA produced by HAS protects the cancer cell from physical damage. Finally, in the formation of a metastatic lesion, HAS produces HA to allow the cancer cell to interact with native cells at the secondary site and to produce a tumor for itself.|$|E
50|$|Catch bonds {{also play}} a {{significant}} role in bacterial adhesion, most notably in Escherichia coli. E. coli and other bacteria residing in the intestine must be able to adhere to intestinal walls or risk being eliminated from the body through urine. This is possible due to the bacterial protein FimH, which mediates high adhesion in response to high flow. The lectin domain is one that provides FimH binding the catch bond property when binding to mannose residues from other cells. Experiments have shown that when force is loaded rapidly, bonds were able to survive high forces, thus pointing to catch bond behavior. Catch bonds are responsible for the failure of E. coli in the urinary tract to be eliminated during urination, thus leading to a urinary tract infection. This knowledge is important not only in understanding bacteria, but also for learning how <b>anti-adhesive</b> technologies can be created.|$|E
50|$|In normal functioning, MUC-4 {{is known}} to play <b>anti-adhesive</b> roles in the body, such as in {{lubricating}} the reproductive lining.

In these roles, MUC-4 serves to protect and lubricate the epithelium, which facilitates transport and traps foreign particles. One example of its function in the reproductive lining relates to blastocyst implantation resulting from MUC4 downregulation. It is found to be overexpressed during the luteal phase of menstruation. MUC-4 may also have a role in fetal morphogenic development. It should be noted that MUC-4 is not found in the gallbladder, pancreas, or liver except in abnormal conditions such as cancer. MUC-4, however, may normally be found in bodily fluids like saliva, tears, and milk. In the soluble form, MUC-4 appears to lubricate the epithelial mucosa.|$|E

Keratan sulfate GAGs are found in many other tissues besides the cornea, where they are known to regulate macrophage adhesion, form barriers to neurite growth, regulate embryo implantation in the endometrial uterine lining during menstrual cycles, and affect the motility of corneal endothelial cells. [...] In summary, KS plays an <b>anti-adhesive</b> role, which suggests very important functions of KS in cell motility and attachment as well as other potential biological processes.|$|E

To control the mechanical properties, Cx-PAC film was thermally treated at 45 °C or 65 °C followed by incubation at room temperature. The Cx-PAC films exhibited varying enthalpies, ultimate tensile strength values, and contact angles before and after thermal treatment and after incubation at room temperature. Next, to examine the <b>anti-adhesive</b> properties, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured on Cx-PAC and thermal-treated Cx-PAC films.
