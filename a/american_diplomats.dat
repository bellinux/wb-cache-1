5|$|Motivated {{by seeing}} few African <b>American</b> <b>diplomats</b> on his trips abroad, {{he founded the}} Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Fellowship Program in 2002. The program is a {{collaboration}} between Howard University and the U.S. State Department that has significantly {{increased the number of}} minorities working in the U.S. Foreign Service.|$|E
5|$|The {{visit was}} largely {{ceremonial}} and mainly focused on mutual praise rather than specific policy planning and negotiations. Diệm {{stayed in the}} capital for four days, meeting with Eisenhower and high-ranking members of the State Department on the last of these days. However, the meeting with Dulles turned into a farce after the Secretary of State and his subordinates decided to visit Diệm at Blair House. Diệm, notorious for monologues that often lasted {{for up to six}} hours, talked endlessly and as a result the <b>American</b> <b>diplomats</b> were unable to raise whatever issues they had wanted to discuss.|$|E
5|$|With the US forces {{accepting}} the North Korean attack {{as an act}} of war, it became imperative to evacuate civilians and <b>American</b> <b>diplomats</b> from Korea, as the forces of the north and south were battling across the peninsula. On June 27 the South Koreans were losing the First Battle of Seoul. Most of South Korea's forces retreated {{in the face of the}} invasion. The North Koreans would capture the city the next day forcing the South Korean government and its shattered army to retreat further south.|$|E

5|$|As {{a show of}} {{communist}} rule and Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were brought to trial in Moscow in June 1945. Their removal from the political scene precluded {{the possibility of a}} democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements. The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and <b>American</b> <b>diplomats</b> without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief. The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by Tomasz Arciszewski, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Nicaragua's president, José Santos Zelaya, {{wanted to}} revoke {{commercial}} concessions granted to American companies, and <b>American</b> <b>diplomats</b> quietly favored rebel forces under Juan Estrada. Nicaragua was in debt to foreign powers, and the U.S. was unwilling that an alternate canal route {{fall into the}} hands of Europeans. Zelaya's elected successor, José Madriz, could not put down the rebellion as U.S. forces interfered, and in August 1910, the Estrada forces took Managua, the capital. The U.S. compelled Nicaragua to accept a loan, and sent officials to ensure it was repaid from government revenues. The country remained unstable, and after another coup in 1911 and more disturbances in 1912, Taft sent troops to begin the United States occupation of Nicaragua, which lasted until 1933.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{allegations}} were {{made that the}} government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden. Critics cited the proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S. chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. U.S. government files, leaked by Wikileaks, disclosed that <b>American</b> <b>diplomats</b> had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the government of Tajikistan had also told U.S. officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts.|$|E

5|$|There was broad {{agreement}} between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals; the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs, and would use force {{if necessary to}} enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was under construction throughout Taft's term (it opened in 1914), guided United States {{foreign policy in the}} Caribbean and Central America. Previous administrations had made efforts to promote American business interests overseas, but Taft went a step further and used the web of <b>American</b> <b>diplomats</b> and consuls abroad to further trade. Such ties, Taft hoped, would promote world peace. Taft pushed for arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France, but the Senate was not willing to yield its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties to arbitrators.|$|E
5|$|United States: In November 2013, the United States {{employed}} {{an industrial}} rock crusher to pulverize six tons of amassed ivory. Although the US does not ban the domestic sale of ivory, {{it is illegal}} to bring ivory into the country. Its interest in destroying its ivory was also connected to research that found links between the ivory trade and threats to national security through terrorism and organized crime. The US government and American non-governmental organizations have been involved in multiple forms of anti-poaching measures, largely in Africa, and <b>American</b> <b>diplomats</b> are actively engaging other governments to take part in eroding the ivory market by destroying stockpiles. Another ivory crush took place in New York City's Times Square in June 2015.|$|E
5|$|To prevent South Korea's {{collapse}} the United Nations Security Council {{voted to}} send military forces. The United States' Seventh Fleet dispatched Task Force 77, {{led by the}} fleet carrier USS Valley Forge; the British Far East Fleet dispatched several ships, including HMS Triumph, to provide air and naval support. By June 27, the naval and air forces moving to Korea had authorization to attack North Korean targets {{with the goal of}} helping repel the North Korean invasion of the country. With the US forces accepting the North Korean attack as an act of war, it became imperative to evacuate civilians and <b>American</b> <b>diplomats</b> from Korea, as the forces of the north and south were battling across the peninsula.

25|$|Jazz {{played a}} {{critical}} role during the Cold War in establishing political ties. Producer Willis Conover explained jazz as an embodiment of an anti-ideology or an alternative way of living by introducing a new style of music with a lose structure and improvisation. In November 1955, the New York Times declared Louis Armstrong as America's most effective ambassador. What <b>American</b> <b>diplomats</b> could not do, Armstrong and his jazz music did.
