5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts {{for more than a few}} minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat,</b> or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|Normally, the pyloric valve at {{the lower}} end of the stomach regulates the release of food into the bowel. When the gastric bypass patient eats a sugary food, the sugar passes rapidly into the intestine, where it gives rise to a {{physiological}} reaction called dumping syndrome. The body will flood the intestines with gastric content in an attempt to dilute the sugars. An affected person may feel their heart beating rapidly and forcefully, break into <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat,</b> get a feeling of butterflies in the stomach, and may have an anxiety attack. The person usually has to lie down, and could be very uncomfortable for 3045 minutes. Diarrhea may then follow.|$|E

Alex Hasyim, who did the choreography for Aku Cinta Dia and Hip Hip Hura, recalled that Chrisye was in <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> on their first day of practise and eventually created his own dancing style as he could not follow Hasyim's instructions.|$|E
5000|$|The Fifth {{started in}} 2001 out of Fayetteville, North Carolina by Roy Cathey who {{started out in}} the late 80's with a band called Gibraltar which got strong air play locally with a ballad titled Real, then in the early 90' he joined <b>a</b> band called <b>Cold</b> <b>Sweat</b> with former Keel Lead and Rhythm guitarist Marc Ferrari. Roy Cathey co-wrote on [...] "Long Way Down" [...] and [...] "Killing Floor" [...] from <b>Cold</b> <b>Sweat's</b> debut album Break Out. <b>Cold</b> <b>Sweat</b> {{released}} [...] "Lets Make Love Tonight" [...] video to MTV and on that day, <b>Cold</b> <b>Sweat</b> was dropped from MCA records. The breakup of <b>Cold</b> <b>Sweat</b> came when Grunge took over MTV and radio, just like many other bands of that genre and during that era.|$|R
60|$|Free! What {{would not}} Neverbend have given {{to be free}} also himself! He looked down the free ladder, and the very look made him sink. It seemed to him as though nothing but a spider could creep down that {{perpendicular}} abyss. And then a sound, slow, sharp, and continuous, as of drops falling through infinite space on to deep water, came upon his ear; and {{he saw that the}} sides of the abyss were covered with slime; and the damp air made him cough, and the cap had got over his spectacles and nearly blinded him; and he was perspiring with <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> clammy <b>sweat.</b>|$|R

Immediate surgical intervention and rupture of left ventricular (LV) free wall was found. He was discharged after 2 d intensive care unit (ICU) observation and 5 -day regular ward care. There is high mortality rate in traumatic heart rupture although timely repair, over all mortality is around 20 %- 36 % in recent 3 years...|$|R
500|$|The British POWs {{provided}} the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing {{sent by the}} British Red Cross. The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. When I look back at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out in <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat.</b> Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E
500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat,</b> thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, Maj. Richard Koch, {{chief of}} USAF Air Combat Command's {{advanced}} air dominance branch {{is reported to}} have said that [...] "I wake up in <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sweat</b> at the thought of the F-35 going in with only two air-dominance weapons" [...] with an Aviation Week article casting an extremely skeptical eye over the (USAF) source of claims that the F-35 would be [...] "400% more effective" [...] than projected opponents.|$|E
60|$|So {{our hero}} stood stunned and bedazed, gazing down upon his victim, {{like a man}} turned into a stone. His brain {{appeared}} to him to expand like a bubble, the blood surged and bummed in his ears with every gigantic beat of his heart, his vision swam, and his trembling hands were bedewed with <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> and repugnant <b>sweat.</b> The dead figure upon the floor at his feet gazed {{at him with a}} wide, glassy stare, and in the confusion of his mind it appeared to Jonathan that he was, indeed, a murderer.|$|R
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} {{is based on the}} Watergate scandal, as well as other real-life {{political}} events. The two Republicans who follow Bob around were based on H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, two of Richard Nixon's closest advisors during Watergate. Sideshow Bob's campaign advert was based on the famous Willie Horton and Revolving Door political advertisements used by George H. W. Bush during the 1988 United States presidential election. Birch Barlow's question to Mayor Quimby about whether his stance on crime would differ if it was his family being attacked is a reference to Bernard Shaw's similar question to Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential debates. Quimby's appearance during the debate parodies Richard Nixon's appearance during his first televised debate with John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. Nixon had recently recovered from <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> and <b>sweated</b> considerably throughout, something that was detrimental to the impression he made in the debate.|$|R

6000|$|It was hopeless, and so I {{walked in}} silence beside my guard {{down through the}} dark {{corridors}} and runways toward my awful doom. At a low level we came upon a number of lighted chambers in which we saw many Mahars engaged in various occupations. To one of these chambers my guard escorted me, and before leaving they chained me to a side wall. There were other humans similarly chained. Upon a long table lay a victim even as I was ushered into the room. Several Mahars stood about the poor creature holding him down {{so that he could}} not move. Another, grasping a sharp knife with her three-toed fore foot, was laying open the victim's chest and abdomen. No anesthetic had been administered and the shrieks and groans of the tortured man were terrible to hear. This, indeed, was vivisection with <b>a</b> vengeance. <b>Cold</b> <b>sweat</b> broke out upon me as I realized that soon my turn would come. And to think that where {{there was no such thing}} as time I might easily imagine that my suffering was enduring for months before death finally released me! ...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{safety is}} an {{important}} palt of postmarketing surveillance. In ancient times, people were already {{aware of the fact}} that drugs could have side effects. The oldest drugs were mainly of plant and animal origin, but also mercury, arsenic and antimony were used, the toxic effects of which were well known. In 1224 Frederick II, Emperor of Hohenstaufen ordered inspection of drugs and mixtures prepared by apothecaries and in 1518 the Royal college of Physicians was founded, whose Fellows were also concemed with quality control of drugs. The first drug to be banned because of its toxicity was antimony in the 17 th century. It was used again, however, after it cured Louis XIV from typhoid fever. One of the first descriptions of an intoxication to a drug which is still in use today, was made by William Withering in 1785. He described digitalis intoxication as follows: "The Foxglove, when given in very large and quickly repeated doses, occasions sickness, vomiting, purging, giddiness, confused vision, objects appearing green or yellow, increased secretion of urine with frequent motions to patt with it, and sometimes inability to retain it; slow pulse, even as low as 35 in <b>a</b> minute, <b>cold</b> <b>sweats,</b> convulsions, syncope and death"...|$|R

40|$|I, Elizabeth, {{first became}} {{affected}} by bullying when I was bullied as a child. I couldn’t understand why I was bullied, and why, {{even though some}} people were aware of this, it continued to happen. I was called racist names and physically assaulted, people used to spit in my hair, and sometimes, when I was hiding, several people would search for me to threaten and push me. As an adult looking back, I realise that as the bullying grew in severity, I became known and targeted as a ‘victim’. When I later researched bullying for my undergraduate degree, the academic literature made me feel ashamed of being a victim, particularly when I read a description from Salmivalli et al. about ‘helpless’ and ‘provocative’ victims 1. I remembered what my experience felt like as <b>a</b> child: the <b>cold</b> <b>sweats,</b> being frightened of school every day, unable to concentrate on my work. I became weak, anxious and I could hardly eat...|$|R

60|$|The {{front door}} of the car was open. Its forward end was curtained off into a small reception-room.

A picture of Abraham Lincoln hung against a wall; one of a cluster of school-girls grouped upon stone steps was in another place; a third was Easter lilies in a blood-red frame.
