For a single batch process, the equilibrium conversion determined experimentally was shown to be 0.55 and 0.21 with respect to acetic acid using two initial temperatures of 283  K and 295  K, respectively. It is shown by a simple geometrical approach that without {{the knowledge of the}} kinetics of the process, by increasing the number of reactors and considering internal cooling systems, the reaction equilibrium lines were crossed and conversion improved significantly. The paper also shows that one can attain the maximum possible conversion of 0.72, thus increasing equilibrium conversions by 31  % by adding a single adiabatic reactor to the single-stage adiabatic reactor by this geometrical technique, and hence proposes the optimal reactor configuration with interstage cooling system to achieve this optimal conversion.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} closed nuclear fuel cycle {{seems to be}} the most {{promising}} options for the efficient usage of the nuclear energy resources. However, it can be implemented only in fast breeder reactors of the IVth generation, which are characterized by the fast neutron spectrum. The lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) was defined and studied on the level of technical design in order to demonstrate its performance and reliability within the European collaboration on ELSY (European Lead-cooled System) and LEADER (Lead-cooled European Advanced Demonstration Reactor) projects. It has been demonstrated that LFR meets the requirements of the closed nuclear fuel cycle, where plutonium and minor actinides (MA) are recycled for reuse, thereby producing no MA waste. In this study, the most promising option was realized when entire Pu + MA material is fully recycled to produce a new batch of fuel without partitioning. This is the concept of a fuel cycle which asymptotically tends to the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> where the concentrations of plutonium and MA {{at the beginning of the}} cycle are restored in the subsequent cycle in the combined process of fuel transmutation and cooling, removal of fission products (FPs), and admixture of depleted uranium.

40|$|Since 1995, {{more than}} 500 extrasolar planets have been {{discovered}} orbiting very close to their parent star, where they experience strong tidal interactions. Their orbital evolution depends on the physical mechanisms that cause tidal dissipation, and these are still not well understood. We refine {{the theory of the}} equilibrium tide in fluid bodies that are partly or entirely convective, to predict the dynamical evolution of the systems. In particular, we examine the validity of modeling the tidal dissipation by the quality factor Q, as is commonly done. We consider here the simplest case where the considered star or planet rotates uniformly, all spins are aligned, and the companion is reduced to a point-mass. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the shape of the star or planet adiabatically along the line of centers. This generates the divergence-free velocity field of the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> tide which is decoupled from the dynamical tide. The tidal kinetic energy is dissipated into heat through turbulent friction, which is modeled here as an eddy-viscosity acting on the adiabatic tidal flow. This dissipation induces a second velocity field, the dissipative equilibrium tide, which is in quadrature with the exciting potential; it is responsible for the imaginary part of the disturbing function, which is implemented in the dynamical evolution equations, from which one derives characteristic evolution times. The rate at which the system evolves depends on the physical properties of tidal dissipation, and specifically on how the eddy viscosity varies with tidal frequency and on the thickness of the convective envelope for the fluid equilibrium tide. At low frequency, this tide retards by a constant time delay, whereas it lags by a constant angle when the tidal frequency exceeds the convective turnover rate.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in multiphase flows in large diameter vertical pipes (typically with diameters greater that 100 mm) {{in the context of}} hydrocarbon production systems. There are strong indications that flows in such pipes differ greatly from those in smaller diameter pipes on which most of the prediction methodologies are based. In small diameter pipes, an important mechanism for the bubble flow to slug flow transition is the formation of void waves. This research reveal this wave growth and also predict the breakdown points from bubble-to-slug flow transition using Biesheuvel and Gorissen (1990) approximate void wave model based on Harwell small tube bubble flow experiments. As the gas velocity is further increased, the slug flow itself breaks down into churn flow by a process of flooding in the Taylor bubbles. In large diameter pipes, it appears that conventional slug flow does not occur; this is probably {{due to the fact that}} there is a size limit on spherical cap bubbles. Thus, this study reviews most of literatures in terms of bubble coalescence and breakup kernels in order to evaluate dynamic bubble size changes by applying population balance model. Unfortunately, these kernels have their own problems to be solved. Therefore we establish a simplified two-group bubble interaction model by taking into account mechanisms of large bubble shearing-off breakup and small bubble coalescence in large bubble wakes, respectively, assuming small bubbles do not coalesce to each other. In large diameter pipes, the bubble/slug and slug/churn transitions appear to be by-passed in favour of a direct transition from bubble to churn flow with increasing gas mass flux. Note that the churn flow studied here is emphasized by a continuous path for the gas phase. This study also describes work aimed at developing a phenomenological understanding of the bubble/churn and churn/annular transition regions in large diameter pipes. Investigation of the liquid transport mechanisms has led to the definition of two new flow regime transition criteria, namely liquid upflow potential and minimum entrained fraction. To estimate the bubble-to-churn flow transition, the liquid upflow potential of a churn flow at the particular local set of gas and liquid flow rates is estimated by using axial view experiments and the existing <b>adiabatic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> data. In churn flow, liquid upflow is achieved by the net upward flow in the film (bearing in mind that both upflow and downflow are occurring in the film, though the net value must be positive) and by droplet transport in the gas core. Once the Kutateladse flooding is reached, suggested by Pushkina and Sorokin (1969), then it is postulated that the transition to churn flow occurs. As the gas velocity is further increased, the flow rate of entrained drops in the gas core decreases to a minimum and then rises again. This minimum is observed to occur at a dimensionless gas velocity approximately equal to one and this serves as a possible criterion for the churn-to-annular flow transition. As a framework for prediction, an existing one-dimensional steady state modelling code (GRAMP 2) has been selected. This code takes account of regime changes and predicts void fraction and pressure gradient using phenomenological models. Work on connecting the void wave growth, bubble size evaluation and GRAMP 2 code for large diameter pipes will be the main target for the nearly future. In the meantime, CFD simulation is also being undertaken using a finite volume method based the STARCD software in order to numerically predict the evaluations of dynamic bubble size and flow regime changes in large diameter pipes.

40|$|One of the {{principal}} mechanisms {{that is responsible for}} the origin of blue stragglers is mass transfer that takes place while one of the binary companions overfills its Roche lobe.

These responses, as well as the assumption on how liberal the process is, are discussed in terms of the stability of the ensuing mass transfer. The predictions of the theory of mass transfer via Roche lobe overflow are then briefly compared with the observed mass-transferring systems with both degenerate and non-degenerate donors. We conclude with the discussion which cases of mass transfer and which primordial binaries could be responsible for blue stragglers formation via Roche lobe overflow, as well as how this can be enhanced for blue stragglers formed in globular clusters.

40|$|An {{atmosphere}} in isothermal equilibrium has no natural limit, an atmosphere <b>adiabatic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> has, however, one. Beyond this “ inner” adiabatic atmosphere lies the outer atmosphere formed by molecules ” evaporated ” {{from the outer}} surface of the “ inner ” atmosphere. The fringe region lies at the farther limits of this outer atmosphere where the molecules moving without any collision describe orbits of enormous dimensions. Taking atomic oxygen and molecular nitrogen as the upper atmosphere constituents {{the height of the}} critical level or level of negligible collision is calculated by the authors and is found to be 770 km. Above 930 km. there is practically no collision between the atoms. Ionization of the atoms in the fringe region by solar ultra-violet radiation will diminish the rate of escape owing to their entanglement with the earth’s magnetic field. Critical velocities of escape of oxygen ions from different latitudes of the earth arc calculated. The increase with height of the viscous drag of the earth measured by kinematical viscosity n/p is taken into account and it is shown that the atmosphere rotates with the earth so long as there is appreciable collision between atoms. Molecular densities at different levels of the fringe region are estimated. The merging of the fringe region into interstellar space takes place between 2000 and 2500 km. above the earth’s surface. Existence of super-elastic collisions between an excited (metastable) atom and a neutral particle extends the fringe region. Of the various metastable states of the constituent particles only those of oxygen atoms are capable of producing any effect by super-elastic collisions. It is found that roughly about 10 4 atoms in the 15 state and 10 6 atoms in the 1 D state suffer collisions per second with other atoms. The atoms in the 1 S state can shoot a neutral oxygen atom to a height of about 14000 km. above earth’s centre while an atom in the 1 D state can shoot it to a height of about 9, 500 km. The density distribution in the fringe region and the merging with the interstellar space (which takes place at about 2500 km. above the earth surface) are found to be only slightly modified by the presence of these high speed particles. By considering the motion of ions in the earth’s magnetic and gravitational fields, taking into account the variations of g and H wdth altitude and also considering the rotation of the earth magnet it is found that an ion starting at the equator at 12 o’clock noon at 40, 000 km. height and describing along the magnetic line of force with a velocity of 1 km /see will enter the earth's atmosphere at 12 - 54 local hair.

No transition or anomaly was observed below 300 K in the heat-capacity curve but four anomalies were observed at super-ambient temperatures including a broad and diffuse hump extending from 300 to 375 K. A bifurcated peak was observed between 375 and 436. 5 K with peak temperatures at 411 and 425 K and with enthalpy increments ([Delta]trsHmo) of 41. 7 and 22. 8 R[middle dot]K and entropy increments ([Delta]trsSmo) of 0. 097 R and 0. 05 R, respectively. A peak believed to be of first order (solid-to-solid transformation) was observed at 474 K having [Delta]trsHmo and [Delta]trsSmo of 194 R[middle dot]K and 0. 407 R.

40|$|Both Zn 2 + and Cd 2 + dopants on the A-sites in Fe 3 O 4 {{lead to a}} loss in the {{furcation}} of the lambda anomaly at the Verwey transition but at {{markedly different}} dopant levels. <b>Equilibrium</b> <b>adiabatic</b> calorimetry from 5 to 350 K on new compositions of cadmium- and zinc-doped magneties, e. g. Cd 0. 002 Fe 2. 998 O 4 and Zn 0. 01 Fe 2. 99 O 4, permits {{an estimate of the}} mole ratios of Cd and Zn at which they have equivalent effects on the furcation of the lambda anomaly. These results are consistent with a mechanism in which the furcation of the Verwey transition in doped samples depends linearly on the deviation of the lattice constant from that of pure Fe 3 O 4. Further studies on a deliberately oxidized sample demonstrate that the furcated lambda anomaly is characteristic of stoichiometric materials; apparently B-site vacancies have a much greater effect on the transition than A-site dopants. Heat capacities and thermodynamic properties of the three samples are summarized...|$|R
2500|$|A {{definition}} of entropy based {{entirely on the}} relation of <b>adiabatic</b> accessibility between <b>equilibrium</b> states was given by [...] E.H.Lieb and J. Yngvason in 1999. This approach has several predecessors, including the pioneering work of Constantin Carathéodory from 1909 and the monograph by R. Giles. In the setting of Lieb and Yngvason one starts by picking, for a unit amount of the substance under consideration, two reference states [...] and [...] such that the latter is adiabatically accessible from the former but not vice versa. Defining the [...] entropies of the reference states to be 0 and 1 respectively the entropy of a state [...] {{is defined as the}} largest number [...] such that [...] is adiabatically accessible from a composite state consisting of an amount [...] in the state [...] and a complementary amount, , in the state [...] A simple but important result within this setting is that entropy is uniquely determined, apart from a choice of unit and an additive constant for each chemical element, by the following properties: It is monotonic with respect to the relation of adiabatic accessibility, additive on composite systems, and extensive under scaling.|$|R
40|$|Dissipation {{coefficients}} {{are calculated}} in the <b>adiabatic,</b> near thermal <b>equilibrium</b> regime {{for a large}} class of renormalizable interaction configurations involving a two-stage mechanism, where a background scalar field is coupled to heavy intermediate scalar or fermion fields which in turn are coupled to light scalar or fermion radiation fields. These interactions are typical of warm inflation microscopic model building. Two perturbative regimes are shown where well defined approximations for the spectral functions apply. One regime is at high temperature, when the masses of both intermediate and radiation fields are less than the temperature scale and where the poles of the spectral functions dominate. The other regime is at low temperature, when the intermediate field masses are {{much bigger than the}} temperature and where the low energy and low three-momentum regime dominate the spectral functions. The dissipation coefficients in these two regimes are derived. However, due to resummation issues for the high temperature case, only phenomenological approximate estimates are provided for the dissipation in this regime. In the low temperature case, higher loop contributions are suppressed and so no resummation is necessary. In addition to inflationary cosmology, the application of our results to cosmological phase transitions is also discussed. Comment: 27 pages, 6 figures. Emphasis given to the derivation of the dissipation coefficients in the different temperature regime...|$|R
40|$|The {{essence of}} the second law of {{classical}} thermodynamics is the `entropy principle' which asserts {{the existence of an}} additive and extensive entropy function, S, that is defined for all equilibrium states of thermodynamic systems and whose increase characterizes the possible state changes under adiabatic conditions. It {{is one of the few}} really fundamental physical laws (in the sense that no deviation, however tiny, is permitted) and its consequences are far reaching. This principle is independent of models, statistical mechanical or otherwise, and can be understood without recourse to Carnot cycles, ideal gases and other assumptions about such things as `heat', `temperature', `reversible processes', etc., as is usually done. Also the well known formula of statistical mechanics, S = -∑ p log p, is not needed for the derivation of the entropy principle. This contribution is partly a summary of our joint work (Physics Reports, Vol. 310, 1 [...] 96 (1999)) where the existence and uniqueness of S is proved to be a consequence of certain basic properties of the relation of <b>adiabatic</b> accessibility among <b>equilibrium</b> states. We also present some open problems and suggest directions for further study. Comment: 36 pages latex + 5 eps figs. This is a review of cond-mat/ 9708200 and math-ph/ 9805005.

40|$|We present {{time-dependent}} numerical hydrodynamic {{models of}} line-driven accretion disk winds in cataclysmic variable systems and calculate wind mass-loss rates and terminal velocities. The models are 2. 5 -dimensional, include an energy balance condition with radiative {{heating and cooling}} processes, and includes local ionization equilibrium introducing time dependence and spatial dependence on the line radiation force parameters. The radiation field is assumed to originate in an optically thick accretion disk. Wind ion populations are calculated {{under the assumption that}} local ionization equilibrium is determined by photoionization and radiative recombination, similar to a photoionized nebula. We find a steady wind flowing from the accretion disk. Radiative heating tends to maintain the temperature in the higher density wind regions near the disk surface, rather than cooling adiabatically. For a disk luminosity L (sub disk) = solar luminosity, white dwarf mass M(sub wd) = 0. 6 solar mass, and white dwarf radii R(sub wd) = 0. 01 solar radius, we obtain a wind mass-loss rate of M(sub wind) = 4 x 10 (exp - 12) solar mass yr(exp - 1) and a terminal velocity of approximately 3000 km per second. These results confirm the general velocity and density structures found in our earlier constant ionization <b>equilibrium</b> <b>adiabatic</b> CV wind models. Further we establish here 2. 5 D numerical models that can be extended to QSO/AGN winds where the local ionization equilibrium will {{play a crucial role in}} the overall dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} carbon {{monoxide}} in the reformate from the autothermal reforming of liquid hydrocarbons can be significantly reduced {{by means of the}} water-gas-shift reaction. It is possible to directly feed the reformate from the autothermal reforming to the water-gas-shift reactor without deactivation of the catalyst. The results of this paper show a clear advantage of the isothermal operation of a water-gas-shift reactor over the <b>adiabatic</b> mode. Thermodynamic <b>equilibrium</b> was reached at clearly lower temperatures in the case of isothermal operation. A two-stage water-gas-shift reactor with a high-temperature shift part running at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 42, 200 h(- 1) and an inlet temperature of 400 degrees C and a low-temperature shift stage operated at a GHSV of 26, 000 h(- 1) and an inlet temperature in the range between 280 and 310 degrees C is able to reduce the carbon monoxide outlet concentration to less than 1 vol. %. This reactor will be suitable for combination with a reactor for the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in a fuel processing system. The injection of water between the two shift stages is meaningful because carbon monoxide conversion is enhanced by higher partial pressures of water. Furthermore, the injection of water can be applied to cool down the outlet temperature of the high-temperature shift stage of approximately 420 degrees C to the inlet temperature of the low-temperature shift stage of approximately 300 degrees C. The latter function can be dispensed with in the case of water injection between autothermal reforming and the high-temperature shift stage, which therefore reduces the positive impact of this step.
