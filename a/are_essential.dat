5|$|A {{phosphatase}} is {{an enzyme}} that uses water to cleave a phosphoric acid monoester into a phosphate ion and an alcohol. Because a phosphatase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of its substrate, it is a subcategory of hydrolases. Phosphatase enzymes <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> to many biological functions, because phosphorylation (e.g. by protein kinases) and dephosphorylation (by phosphatases) serve diverse roles in cellular regulation and signaling.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme.|$|E

5|$|Essential {{genes are}} {{the set of}} genes thought to be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's genes <b>are</b> <b>essential.</b> In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes). The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential genes and quasi-essential genes (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E
5|$|Helicases are {{proteins}} {{that are a}} type of molecular motor. They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates, predominantly adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands. These enzymes <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the heated water to form a geyser, a {{plumbing}} system made of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and sometimes cavities is required. This includes a reservoir to hold the water while it is being heated. Geysers are generally aligned along faults. Constrictions in the system <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> to the building up of pressure before an eruption.|$|E
30|$|Complete {{surgical}} excision <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for DFSP of {{the abdominal}} wall which {{may result in}} large challenging defects.

5|$|In {{setting up}} {{protected}} reserves, efforts generally {{also have to}} be focused on the surrounding areas, as jaguars are unlikely to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation, especially if the population is increasing in size. Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> to make conservation areas effective.|$|E
5|$|Insurers {{claimed that}} because {{they have access to}} and collect patient data that allow {{evaluations}} of interventions, they <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> to ACO success. Large insurers formed their own ACOs. Many hospitals merged and purchased physician practices. The increased market share gave them more leverage in negotiations with insurers over costs and reduced patient care options.|$|E
5|$|Microbes are {{important}} in human culture and health in many ways, serving to ferment foods, treat sewage, produce fuel, enzymes and other bioactive compounds. They <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> tools in biology as model organisms, and have been put to use in biological warfare and bioterrorism. They are a vital component of fertile soils. In the human body microorganisms make up the human microbiota including the essential gut flora. They are the pathogens responsible for many infectious diseases, and as such are the target of hygiene measures.|$|E

40|$|Transcriptional {{induction}} of cell-cycle regulatory proteins ensures proper {{timing of}} subsequent cell-cycle events. Here {{we show that}} the Forkhead transcription factor FoxM 1 regulates expression of many G 2 -specific genes and <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for chromosome stability. Loss of FoxM 1 leads to pleiotropic cell-cycle defects, including a delay in G 2, chromosome mis-segregation and frequent failure of cytokinesis. We show that transcriptional activation of cyclin B by FoxM 1 <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for timely mitotic entry, whereas CENP-F, another direct target of FoxM 1 identified here, <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for precise functioning of the mitotic spindle checkpoint. Thus, our data uncover a transcriptional cluster regulated by FoxM 1 that <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for proper mitotic progression. ...|$|R
5|$|Microorganisms <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> {{tools in}} biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and {{molecular}} biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, genomics and proteomics, for example in protein production.|$|E

Compounds in the saliva, such as haptocorrin also help increase B12 availability by protecting the vitamin against stomach acid.|$|E
5|$|Proteins <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> to life. Cells {{produce new}} protein {{molecules}} from amino acid building blocks {{based on information}} coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|E

Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access to medical care.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the city, countryside, and {{building}} interiors <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> to Balzac's realism, often serving {{to paint a}} naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; this gave him a reputation as an early naturalist. Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages.
