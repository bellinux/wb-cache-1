40|$|Electron density {{profiles}} {{and energetic}} particle fluxes are obtained {{based on data}} collected by two rockets launched from Red Lake, Ontario, respectively, {{at the beginning and}} end of totality during the solar eclipse of February 26, 1979. Data obtained by a rocket launched on February 24, 1979 showed that the electron density was normal (at 10, 000 cu cm) above 110 km, to <b>rocket</b> <b>apogee</b> (130. 5 km). Below 110 km, the electron density was found to be enhanced compared with data from Wallops Island at the same solar zenith angle (63 deg). It is proposed that this enhancement was due to the large flux of field-aligned energetic particles observed on the same rocket. The electron density above 110 km to <b>rocket</b> <b>apogee</b> (132. 6 and 132. 3 km) was found to be reduced during totality by a factor of about three. However, below 110 km, the electron density was found to be much greater than observed during previous eclipses, probably due to the additional ionization resulting from energetic particles. The particle flux measured on February 26 was found to be an order of magnitude less than on February 24 but showed greater variability, particularly at the higher energies (100 keV) ...|$|R

The electron density profile from 24 February shows the electron density to be normal above 110 km, to <b>rocket</b> <b>apogee.</b> Below 110 km, the electron density is enhanced, by an order of magnitude in the D region, compared with data from Wallops Island at the same solar zenith angle (63 deg).

During totality (on 26 February) the electron density above 110 km to <b>rocket</b> <b>apogee</b> is reduced by a factor of about three. Below 110 km, the electron density is much greater than observed during previous eclipses. The particle flux measured on the 26 February was an order of magnitude less than that on the 24 February but showed greater variability, particularly at the higher energies (100 keV).

50|$|In model rocketry, a parachute, {{streamer}} {{or other}} recovery device or method deploys at <b>apogee,</b> but high-power <b>rockets</b> may employ more complex recovery systems since altitudes {{can be much}} higher than their counterparts. In a high-power rocket, an altimeter or electronic timer may deploy a drogue parachute (which stabilizes the rocket in descent) or a controlled freefall (where the fore and aft sections are merely separated by a tether or umbilical cord, often made of tubular nylon). These recovery events can be brought about by small explosive charges (black powder or Pyrodex) or pressurized gasses (e.g., CO2). At an altitude predetermined by the hobbyist, an altimeter deploys a main parachute that slows the rocket to a safe recovery speed. The most common varieties of altimeter use accelerometers, barometric sensors {{or a combination of}} both.|$|R

The spectrum below 1500 A is dominated by transitions from neutral and singly ionized atomic oxygen. N I, N II, and N 2 emissions, which are prominent in day airglow and nighttime auroral spectra measured by the same instrumentation, are very weak, indicating energy from the dayside auroral particles is transferred to the atmosphere above most of the N 2.

By integrating over the range of altitudes from the surface to the <b>rocket</b> <b>apogee</b> and by appropriately estimating the residual ozone amount from apogee {{to the top of}} the atmosphere, a total ozone amount can be computed from the profiles that can be directly compared with the ground based instrumentation results.

40|$|In {{preparation}} for the European Space Agency Maxus- 4 mission, a sounding rocket test flight was carried out at Esrange, near Kiruna, Sweden on February 19, 2001 to validate existing ground facilities and range safety installations. Due {{to the absence of}} a dedicated scientific payload, the flight offered the opportunity to test multiple GPS receivers and assess their performance for the tracking of sounding rockets. The receivers included an Ashtech G 12 HDMA receiver, a BAE (Canadian Marconi) Allstar receiver and a Mitel Orion receiver. All of them provide C/A code tracking on the L 1 frequency to determine the user position and make use of Doppler measurements to derive the instantaneous velocity. Among the receivers, the G 12 has been optimized for use under highly dynamic conditions and has earlier been flown successfully on NASA sounding rockets. The Allstar is representative of common single frequency receivers for terrestrial applications and received no particular modification, except for the disabling of the common altitude and velocity constraints that would otherwise inhibit its use for space application. The Orion receiver, finally, employs the same Mitel chipset as the Allstar, but has received various firmware modifications by DLR to safeguard it against signal losses and improve its tracking performance. While the two NASA receivers were driven by a common wrap-around antenna, the DLR experiment made use of a switchable antenna system comprising a helical antenna in the tip of the rocket and two blade antennas attached to the body of the vehicle. During the boost a peak acceleration of roughly l 7 g's was achieved which resulted in a velocity of about 1100 m/s {{at the end of the}} burn.

Large and small scale structures in the electron density were measured on rocket ascent and descent at the altitudes of 86. 5 and 88. 5 +/-. 5 km. Since the <b>rocket</b> <b>apogee</b> was 89 km, the rocket was in the height range 88. 5 +/-. 5 km for 30 seconds giving us an unusual measurement of horizontal structure over a distance of 5. 5 km. A power spectrum of the fluctuations for the upper layer gives further evidence that turbulent mixing is an important process in PMSE. The power spectrum of the lower layer, however, gives evidence that this layer is characterized by a form of partial or Fresnel scattering. Both spectra are in excellent agreement with similar analysis of electron fluctuation spectra measured in the same layers on the TURBO-B rocket flown 12 minutes later and the analysis of Cornell University Portable Radar Interferometer (CUPRI) data by Cho et al., 1993 A. Thus two different structuring and scattering mechanisms exist at altitudes only 1 km apart.

40|$|Major {{difficulties}} {{in a space}} missions are the launch cost and the inability of using the launch vehicle consecutive times. A maglev launch system, Maglifter, uses magnetic fields to levitate and accelerate a vehicle along a track at speeds up to 600 [mph]. It is a feasible and revolutionary first stage propulsion system that gives an initial velocity and altitude, reducing dramatically on-board fuel. Furthermore, the Maglifter is inexpensive, costing less than an estimated $ 100 per full-scale launch, and environmentally clean, using only electrical power from ground sources. It also reduces turn-around time to next launch in quick succession space missions. This paper provides feasibility studies conducted for realization of the Maglifter for a sounding rocket, which can be utilized as a small satellite launch system. It introduces a feasible system configuration of the Maglifter and also develops a computer simulation framework that derives an optimal configuration according to the required thrust, launch mass, track length, and elevation angle of track to provide a desirable initial state vector (velocity, altitude, and angle). Preliminary study {{results show that the}} Maglifter is capable to augment a sounding <b>rocketâ€™s</b> <b>apogee</b> by 30 % or to achieve the same apogee with 53 % less propellant for the same weight of the payload.
