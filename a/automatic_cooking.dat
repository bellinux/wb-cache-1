50|$|RFIQin, also {{referred}} to as RFIQ, is a patented <b>automatic</b> <b>cooking</b> device that consists of three different sized pans, a portable induction heater, and recipe cards, which is designed by Vita Craft Corporation, but is currently only sold in Japan through Vita Craft Japan. Electronics are embedded in the cookware, which monitor the food and send wireless signals to adjust the temperature of the induction heater accordingly; this prevents the loss of nutrients and saves thermal energy because the food is not overheated. Specialized recipe cards send a wireless signal to the RFIQin system when a recipe card is waved under the handle of the pan, which begins the cooking process; each recipe card can incorporate 23 separate recipe steps. The recipe cards have cooking steps to follow that are indicated by a beeping sound from the induction heater. The system can cook almost all types of food, including cakes and fried foods.|$|E

Device is actuated like flashlight. Light impinging on photo cell activates transistor which energizes buzzer to indicate presence of light...|$|E
30|$|The {{study of}} {{radiation}} effects on MHD free convection of a Casson fluid in porous medium with partial slip {{is an important}} aspect due to its practical application {{in the design of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>cooking</b> machines and the design of internal engine parts in mechanical engineering. Other examples arise in petroleum production, multiphase mixtures, pharmaceutical formulations, coal in water, paints, lubricants, jams, sewage, soup, blood. There has been a significant improvement in the study of non-Newtonian fluids in which many different situations have been considered. Studies in a Casson fluid include work by among others Mukhopadhyay et al. [3] and Nadeem et al. [4].|$|E

40|$|Automated food {{processing}} and evaluation {{is considered a}} significant research area in computer vision. The development of automated cooking and food serving by robots is envisaged as part of automated {{food processing}} and temperature {{plays a major role}} in cooking Indian foods. The delicious Indian foods are generally boiled or fried with other ingredients. The boiled grains like Bengal Gram, Black Gram, Green Gram, Red Gram and Toor Dal are part of typical Indian foods and taste differently, when boiled or cooked at different temperatures and periods of time. Therefore, identifying the effect of boiling and automatic recognition of images of boiled food grains is presented in this paper. The boiling temperatures chosen are 40 0 C, 50 0 C, 60 0 C, 80 0 C and 100 0 C. A color feature centered knowledge based classifier is proposed. The classification accuracy observed is high at lower and higher temperatures and low at medium temperatures. The work finds applications in automatic inspection of food preparations in food industries, drug preparation in pharmaceutical industries, <b>automatic</b> serving, <b>cooking</b> and monitoring of foods in restaurants and motels...|$|R
40|$|When cooking {{porridge}}, {{humans can}} easily spot how vigorously the porridge is boiled and accordingly adjust the cooking power. The {{change of the}} porridge surface appearance {{can be regarded as}} dynamic textures. This paper studies the correlation between several computational descriptors and human perception using image sequences of boiling porridges. By comparing the chosen features with the results of psychophysical experiments, we found that the texture directionality descriptor proposed by Tamura et al and the inverse difference moment descriptor proposed by Haralick et al best coincide with human's perception. Our findings can be further used to judge how vigorously the porridge is boiled and accordingly adjust the cooking power in <b>automatic</b> <b>cooking</b> systems. This record was migrated from the OpenDepot repository service in June, 2017 before shutting down...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} smart space {{scenario}} of a ubiquitous home. Considering {{the requirements of}} ubiquitous smart space, we discuss the execution of <b>automatic</b> <b>cooking</b> {{as an example of}} seamless interaction of machines with humans. The {{purpose of this study was}} to discuss the service integration in formation of various ubiquitous applications. The effective use of context information helps us divide the complex jobs into many simpler jobs on the bases of free time slots available per device. When a new device enters in the area of influence, it notifies the local server about its resources and the system allocates tasks for it in later job planning. Each device performs its role and reports back to the context aware server and waits for new instruction in the next time slot. We try to bridge the gap between man and machines using the explicit knowledge available in the form of active context. The principle objective includes the presentation of system requirements of high level of QoS required in delicate human centric ubiquitous applications. We want to present a vivid scenario for creating a smart space as a demo of our project and make a killer application in the future ubiquitous society...|$|E
