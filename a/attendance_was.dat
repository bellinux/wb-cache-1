50|$|Note: Vancouver's and Seattle's <b>attendances</b> <b>are</b> both over 100% {{capacity}} because, for select games, {{they open}} up additional sections above the regular limited capacity. Orlando's and New England's <b>attendances</b> <b>are</b> over 100% because their capacities are artificial; both teams regularly sell more tickets than the limit. San Jose's <b>attendance</b> <b>is</b> over 100% capacity because they played one game at Levi's Stadium (68,000 capacity).|$|R

5|$|Newton Heath {{initially}} {{played on}} a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League.

5|$|<b>Attendance</b> <b>was</b> {{in decline}} across the league as the Great Depression took hold. The Habs posted a losing record in 1932–33, leading to still smaller crowds. Averaging only 2,000 fans per game, the team sold Morenz to the Chicago Black Hawks in 1934 {{as part of}} an effort to cut costs. The move was not a popular one, and fans voiced their opinion of the deal by giving Morenz a {{standing}} ovation when he scored against the Canadiens on the last day of the 1934–35 season.|$|E
5|$|<b>Attendance</b> <b>was</b> low, in {{part due}} to Tech fans' {{reluctance}} to travel across the country and pay high prices for the chance to do so.
