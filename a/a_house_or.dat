They {{argue that such}} immovable property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E
5|$|Dominica's folk musical {{heritage}} includes work songs, storytelling, children's {{music and}} masquerade songs. Dominican work songs {{are accompanied by}} the tambou twavay drum, and are performed by workers while gathering fruit, building roads, fishing, moving <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>or</b> sawing wood. Many are responsorial, and are generally short and simple, with the lyrical text and rhythm tying into the work to be accompanied. On modern Dominica, work songs are rarely performed.|$|E

The distinguishing features of Rishabhanatha are his long locks of hair which fall on his shoulders, and {{an image of a}} bull in sculptures of him. Paintings of him usually depict legendary events of his life. Some of these include his marriage, and Indra performing a ritual known as abhisheka (consecration). He is sometimes shown presenting a bowl to his followers and teaching them the art of pottery, painting <b>a</b> <b>house,</b> <b>or</b> weaving textiles. The visit of his mother Marudevi is also shown extensively in painting. He is also associated with his Bull emblem, the Nyagrodha tree, Gomukha (bull-faced) Yaksha, and Chakreshvari Yakshi.|$|E

5|$|When {{published}} in bound volumes, {{the legislative history}} documents are placed in separate volumes {{apart from the rest}} of the materials published by U.S.C.C.A.N. Prior to the 99th Congress, the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. contained only <b>a</b> <b>House</b> <b>or</b> Senate report. Since the 99th Congress (1985–87), the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. have included the House or Senate report, the committee report, and any presidential signing statements. U.S.C.C.A.N. is considered a more readily accessible source for some of these materials, like committee reports, than the originals. As a result, it is recommended by the Bluebook as a citation source in addition to the original document.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} improbability of landfall {{in the days}} preceding the storm's passage, the West Palm Beach chapter of the American Red Cross began preparing for the storm. Dr. William J. Buck, likely the only doctor between Pahokee and Moore Haven and also president of the Belle Glade town council {{and the founder of}} the town's American Legion post, was skeptical of the Weather Bureau's predictions of the storm missing South Florida. He and his legionnaires warned residents in the Lake Okeechobee region of the approaching cyclone. At South Bay, Frank Schuster made several car trips to save 211 people by transporting them to higher ground. The Seminoles at the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation in Glades County evacuated to higher ground after observing retreating wildlife. Hours before the storm made landfall, many in the communities surrounding Lake Okeechobee either crowded into <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>or</b> evacuated to the building they believed was securest, such as the Belle Glade Hotel, the Glades Hotel, and Henry Martin's store in Belle Glade, with the Glades Hotel sheltering 20 people and the Belle Glade Hotel having nearly 150 refugees. About 500 people in Lake Worth were sheltered inside the Gulf Stream Hotel during the storm. In West Palm Beach, food and thousands of candles, kerosene lamps, and boards were sold on September 16. A number of residents boarded up their homes and then secured their ornamental trees and plants. At the building then being used as the Palm Beach County Courthouse, approximately 500 people sought shelter inside. In Jupiter, 20 people sought refuge in a grocery store, while 25 others stayed at a newly constructed elementary school. A number of African Americans took shelter in a school building in West Jupiter.|$|E

According to the JMP estimates, access to improved water sources in urban areas decreased from 92% in 1990 to 82% in 2015. In rural areas, however, access increased from 33% to 57% during the same period.|$|E
25|$|Creation of a small, (15–30 mL/1–2 tbsp) thumb-sized pouch {{from the}} upper stomach, {{accompanied}} by bypass of the remaining stomach (about 400 mL and variable). This restricts the volume of food which can be eaten. The stomach may simply be partitioned (like a wall between two rooms in <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>or</b> two office cubicles {{next to each other}} with a partition wall in between them - and typically by the use of surgical staples), or it may be totally divided into two separate/separated parts (also with staples). Total division (separate/separated parts) is usually advocated to reduce the possibility that the two parts of the stomach will heal back together ("fistulize") and negate the operation.|$|E
25|$|Anglicanism came to Virginia in 1607 {{with the}} {{settlers}} who founded Jamestown. The charter of the London Company instructed them {{to adhere to}} the practices of the Church of England, and between 1607 and its dissolution in 1624, the company sent 22 ministers to the colony. These ministers were not only concerned for the spiritual lives of the colonists but also attempted (largely unsuccessfully) to convert the Native Americans. When Virginia's General Assembly first met in 1619, it passed a series of laws concerning the church, including formally designating the Church of England as the established church of the colony. To keep pace with the colony's growth, the Burgesses ordered each settlement to set aside <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>or</b> room as a place to hold regular worship services.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{government}} formalized the naming system in 1868, Japanese personal names were fluid. Men changed their names {{for a variety}} of reasons: to signify that they had attained a higher social status, to demonstrate their allegiance to <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>or</b> clan, to show that they had succeeded to the headship of a family or company, to shed bad luck that was attached to an inauspicious name, or simply to avoid being mistaken for a neighbor with a similar name. Upper-class men often changed their names upon coming of age (genpuku), leaving behind their childhood name (which often ended with -maru) and taking on an adult name. When nobles and samurai received promotions in rank, they received new names, which might contain a syllable or character from their lord's name as a mark of favor.|$|E

25|$|The paschal {{sacrifice}} {{belongs to}} the shelamim, thus forming one of the sacrifices in which the meal is the principal part and indicates the community between God and man. It is really <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>or</b> family sacrifice, and each household is regarded as constituting a small community in itself, {{not only because the}} lamb is eaten at home, but also because every member of the family is obliged to partake of the meal, on pain of ritual excommunication, although each man must be circumcised and all must be ritually clean. The fact that the paschal lamb might be killed only at the central sanctuary of Jerusalem, on the other hand, implies that each household was but a member of the larger community; this is indicated also by the national character of the sacrifice, which kept alive in the memory of the nation the preservation and liberation of the entire people.|$|E
