Physiological conditions that promote lipid storage rapidly and markedly increase LD volume and surface. How the need for surface phospholipids is sensed and balanced during this process is unknown.

The need for additional PC to coat the enlarging surface during LD expansion {{is provided by the}} Kennedy pathway, which is activated by reversible targeting of the rate-limiting enzyme, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), to growing LD surfaces.

A stereoselective ex chiral pool synthesis of trisubstituted acrylesters via an amino substituted β -ketoester is described in this dissertation.

40|$|Cholesterol {{biosynthesis}} in the {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER) is tightly controlled by multiple mechanisms to regulate cellular cholesterol levels. Squalene monooxygenase (SM) {{is the second}} rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis and is regulated both transcriptionally and post-translationally. SM undergoes cholesterol-dependent proteasomal degradation when cholesterol is in excess. The first 100 amino acids of SM (designated SM N 100) are necessary for this degradative process and represent the shortest cholesterol-regulated degron identified to date. However, the fundamental intrinsic characteristics of this degron remain unknown. In this study, we performed a series of deletions, point mutations, and domain swaps to identify a 12 -residue region (residues Gln- 62 -Leu- 73), required for SM cholesterol-mediated turnover. Molecular dynamics and circular dichroism revealed an amphipathic helix within this 12 -residue region. Moreover, 70 % {{of the variation in}} cholesterol regulation was dependent on the hydrophobicity of this region. Of note, the earliest known Doa 10 yeast degron, Deg 1, also contains an amphipathic helix and exhibits 42 % amino acid similarity with SM N 100. Mutating SM residues Phe- 35 /Ser- 37 /Leu- 65 /Ile- 69 into alanine, based on the key residues in Deg 1, blunted SM cholesterol-mediated turnover. Taken together, our results support a model whereby the amphipathic helix in SM N 100 attaches reversibly to the ER membrane depending on cholesterol levels; with excess, the helix is ejected and unravels, exposing a hydrophobic patch, which then serves as a degradation signal.

Estimation of hTERT expression therefore has broad relevance in oncology and stem cell research. Several splicing variants of hTERT have been described whose regulated expression contributes to the control of telomerase activity. Knowledge of the different hTERT mRNA isoforms and the ability to distinguish between them is an important issue when evaluating telomerase expression. Results By establishing cDNA-clone panels from lung and colon tissues, we could map hTERT clones individually for differences in DNA sequence. This made possible the identification of novel alternatively spliced sites as well as analysis of their frequency and mutual correlation in mRNA isoforms. Ten different alternatively spliced sites were detected, of which six were novel sites resulting from alternative splicing of intron 2 or 14. The majority of hTERT cDNA clones from normal and tumour lung and colon tissues encoded truncated proteins ending close after exon 2 or 6.

For {{the characterization of}} their materials properties and their use in applications, the synthesis of QDs with sharp size distributions at a desired mean size is of fundamental importance. In widely used colloidal synthetic strategies based on hot injection, size control is achieved by adjusting the reaction time. Although highly successful, these procedures have an intrinsic drawback: sizes below the size reached {{at the end of}} the reaction driven growth regime (post-focused size) are only obtained at the expense of a reduced reaction yield. Here, we propose two strategies for controlling the post-focused size, either by adjusting the initial nucleation rate or the solubility of the reactive monomer.

Next, the modeling predictions are verified using a synthesis for CdSe QDs. This involves the confirmation of the basic model assumption, i. e., the formation of a monomer species, and the demonstration of size tuning at full yield from diameters of 2. 8 to 4. 1 nm. Our strategy thus makes it possible to prepare monodisperse batches of different sized QDs at high yield, which is <b>a</b> <b>key</b> result for <b>synthesis</b> reproducibility and efficient reaction upscaling...|$|R

Therefore, we developed new, biphasic reaction systems with biocompatible water-immiscible ionic liquids (ILs) as alternatives to conventional organic solvents, {{in order to improve}} the asymmetric reduction of 4 -(trimethylsilyl) - 3 -butyn- 2 -one (TMSB) to (S) - 4 -(trimethylsilyl) - 3 -butyn- 2 -ol (S) -TMSBOL, <b>a</b> <b>key</b> intermediate for <b>synthesis</b> of 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitors, using immobilized Candida parapsilosis CCTCC M 203011 cells as the biocatalyst. Results Various ILs exerted significant but different effects on the bioreduction. Of all the tested water-immiscible ILs, the best results were observed with 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (C 4 MIM·PF 6), which exhibited not only good biocompatibility with the cells but also excellent solvent properties for the toxic substrate and product, thus markedly improving the efficiency of the bioreduction and the operational stability of the cells as compared to the IL-free aqueous system. 2 -Propanol was shown to be the most suitable co-substrate for coenzyme regeneration, and {{it was found that the}} optimum volume ratio of buffer to C 4 MIM·PF 6, substrate concentration, buffer pH, 2 -propanol concentration and reaction temperature were 4 / 1 (v/v), 24 mM, 5. 5, 130 mM and 30 °C, respectively. Under these optimized conditions, the maximum yield and the product e. e. wer 97. 7...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the techniques and approaches developed at IIIT Hyderabad for building synthetic voices in Blizzard 2008 speech <b>synthesis</b> <b>challenge.</b> We have submitted three different voices: English full voice, English ARCTIC voice and Mandarin voice. Our system {{is identified as}} D. In building the three voices, our approach has been to experiment and exploit syllable-like large units for concatenative synthesis. Inspite of large database supplied in Blizzard 2008, we find that a backoff strategy is essential in using syllable-like units. In this paper, we propose a novel technique of approximate matching of the syllables as back-off technique for building voices.

His 1958 work, [...] "The Physiological Clock", {{was hailed as}} a milestone {{in the field of}} chronobiology, and his later works on plant physiology helped apply his work on photoperiodism to practical uses. [...] In 1935 he demonstrated that plants with different inherent periods would become desynchronized in constant conditions. This work provided evidence for the dismissal of the [...] "Factor X" [...] hypothesis, which held that circadian rhythms were not endogenous, and were instead reliant on an unknown external stimulus, some [...] "Factor X." ...|$|R
