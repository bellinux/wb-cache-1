500|$|Eric Goldman, {{writing for}} IGN, graded the episode a 9.0 out of 10, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} “amazing”.

The reviewer called the conclusion to the case-of-the-week a “fun and satisfying one” that highlighted the moral ambiguity of main characters, something “that the show had been lacking for a while.” He highlighted this ambiguity in both Weevil in Logan, elaborating that Logan attacking Piz showed an interesting side to his personality that had not been present all season. The reviewer also lauded the cliffhanger ending, stating, “it was <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> exciting and intense this show can be at its best.” Television Without Pity did not grant the episode a rating but lauded the characterization of Weevil, stating, “This is the most consistently written character on the show, bar none.” ...|$|E

[...] The Globe and Mail reviewer Brad Wheeler said that Drake was [...] "rewriting the rules" [...] by including no choruses, and called Shebib and Drake's work on the track [...] "bodacious". David Berry of the National Post called [...] "Tuscan Leather" [...] the best song on Nothing Was the Same, praising Drake’s smart wordplay and Shebib [...] "going Picasso" [...] on a Whitney Houston sample. Writing for Idolator, Bianca Gracie said the song showed a more confident Drake, noting that he channels Jay-Z with [...] "bold lyrics" [...] and a [...] "dizzying production" [...] reminiscent of Kanye West circa 2004. Robert Copsy of Digital Spy also noted a significant growth in confidence, and called the song: [...] "a piece of atmospheric self-reflection that sets up his current mindset: an artist with plenty of ambition but with a constant nagging fear about losing his way." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} by USA Today, [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was picked out {{as one of}} the best three songs on the Last Train to Paris. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars in his review for the song, stating that {{although}} Dirty Money promised a new sound the song sounded like [...] "Timba–pop, albeit one with a better-than-average hook." [...] He continued, [...] "in Diddy's final-minute rap, [...] <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> he jump-started his journey towards a reported $300m fortune and a butler called Fonzworth Bentley." [...] Matt from Above said it was the Danja-produced beat and the T.I. feature that make the song good. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said [...] "Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye–style automooing. He's quite good at it, too. Adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings. There's a middle bit, and it's like nothing else in the song... It sounds more like someone doing the [...] "I've lost my keys" [...] song, just before they leave the house in the morning. The odd thing is that it was left in there. I mean if minimal is your bag, surely that'd be the first bit to cut?" [...] He awarded in four out of five stars. Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song, saying, [...] "Lyrically and stylistically, it’s a pretty standard club track—over various synth beats, the song covers the usual topics: hot girls dancing, crowds waiting to have fun, and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week... But honestly, we’re just overjoyed this song isn’t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy’s various products." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that [...] "Timothy Dalton was everything {{we had come}} to expect from him in the part: scary and dangerous and then so much the funnier for the way he kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf. The episode left 's sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he really serious about making amends, or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan? - but Volkoff is such a well-drawn character, and Dalton so talented and versatile, that the comedy worked either way... Vivian, on the other hand? I'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance, and putting her on camera with , even briefly, was just <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> much less she brings to the table." [...] Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-. Though he praised Dalton's performance, McGee wrote, [...] "The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it. Let's face it: These two aren't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another. The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side. It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times, but never Chuck. At this point, he's as set in his moral code as possible. Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2.0 days, perhaps the taste of power could have gone to his head, with Vivian {{as an example of the}} road not taken. As such, Vivian's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show, not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10, writing, [...] "This Chuck got off to a shaky start. I don't know how to put my finger on it exactly, but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode... Thankfully, things picked up considerably as the episode went along – I'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates. The way Chuck's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led to a bunch of guns pulled on him was funny, as was not only Chuck asking to play Uno (for his life), but that the pirate did indeed have the game." [...] Carl Cortez of Assignment X, however, gave the episode a negative review, calling it [...] "a painfully nonsense driven episode that's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline." ...|$|E
