40|$|The {{fate and}} {{behaviour}} of total arsenic (As) and of <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in soils is {{of concern for the}} quality of drinking water. To estimate the relevance of organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> and the mobility of different <b>As</b> <b>species,</b> we evaluated the vertical distribution of organic and inorganic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in two uncontaminated and two contaminated upland soils. Dimethylarsinic acid (up to 6 ng As g− 1), trimethylarsine oxide (up to 1. 5 ng As g− 1), 4 unidentified organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> (up to 3 ng As g− 1) and arsenobetaine (up to 15 ng As g− 1), were detected in the forest soils. Arsenobetaine was the dominant organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in both unpolluted and polluted forest soils. No organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> were detected in the contaminated grassland soil. The organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> may account for up to 30 % of the mobile fraction in the unpolluted forest floor, but never exceed 9 % in the unpolluted mineral soil. Highest concentrations of organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> were found in the forest floors. The concentrations of extractable arsenite were highest in the surface horizons of all soils and may represent up to 36 % of total extractable As. The concentrations of extractable arsenate were also highest in the Oa layers in the forest soils and decreased steeply in the mineral soil. In conclusion, the investigated forest soils contain a number of organic <b>As</b> <b>species.</b> The organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in forest soils seem to result from throughfall and litterfall and are retained mostly in the forest floor. The relative high concentrations of extractable arsenite, one of the most toxic <b>As</b> <b>species,</b> and arsenate in the forest floor point to the risk of their transfer to surface water by superficial flow under heavy rain events...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the fate and {{behavior}} of diffuse inputs of arsenic (<b>As)</b> <b>species</b> in forested catchments which often are the sources of drinking water. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the mobility and transformation of different <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in forest ecosystems to assess the environmental risk related to the diffuse pollution of As. We determined concentrations and fluxes in precipitation, litterfall, soil solutions (Oa horizon and 20 - and 90 -cm depth), and runoff of organic and inorganic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> and Astotal in a forest ecosystem in NE-Bavaria, Germany. The concentrations of Astotal were mostly < 1 μg As L- 1 in aqueous samples and were highest in forest floor percolates (7. 6 μg As L- 1). In litterfall, the concentrations of <b>As</b> <b>species</b> never exceeded 0. 1 μg As g- 1. Arsenate and arsenite were the prevalent <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in all samples. Organic <b>As</b> <b>species,</b> comprising monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid, trimethylarsine oxide, arsenobetaine, and three unidentified organic <b>As</b> <b>species,</b> were mostly found in throughfall reaching up to 45 % of Astotal. The total deposition of Astotal (calculated as throughfall + litterfall) was 5. 6 g As ha- 1 yr- 1 with 16 % contribution of litterfall. The annual Astotal fluxes were 30 g As ha- 1 yr- 1 for forest floor percolates, 8. 0 g As ha- 1 yr- 1 at 20 -cm soil depth, and 1. 4 g As ha- 1 yr- 1 at 90 -cm soil depth. The annual runoff of Astotal from the catchment amounted to 3. 8 g As ha- 1 yr- 1. The annual fluxes of total organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> was highest in total deposition (1. 1 g As ha- 1 yr- 1) and decreased largely with depth in the soil profile. The annual runoff of total organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> was only 0. 08 g As ha- 1 yr- 1. Significant correlations in soil solutions and runoff were found between Astotal and dissolved organic C and Fe. Correlations between Astotal concentrations in runoff and water fluxes were seasonally dependent and with a steeper slope in the growing season than in the dormant season. The elevated concentrations of organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in throughfall indicate microbial methylation of As in the phyllosphere, but no evidence for methylation in the soil was found. The mass balance of the catchment points out the strong retention and probable degradation or oxidation of organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> and arsenite but also to mobilizable pools of Astotal and arsenate. The forest floor is presently a source, whereas the mineral soil is a sink for Astotal and arsenate. The As concentrations in runoff seem to be controlled by As mobilization from forest floor and riparian wetland soils during heavy rain events and superficial flow. The risk for excessment of the drinking water threshold concentrations of As in runoff and soil solutions is considered low at our site...|$|R
