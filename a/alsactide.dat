50|$|<b>Alsactide</b> (INN) (brand name Synchrodyn 1-17 {{or simply}} Synchrodyn, former {{development}} code name Hoechst 433), {{also known as}} alisactide, is a synthetic peptide and analogue of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) which is used in Italy as a diagnostic agent in kidney function for adrenal insufficiency. Like ACTH, <b>alsactide</b> is thought {{to act as a}} non-selective agonist of the melanocortin receptors, including the ACTH receptor (MC2R).http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?dr:D07417 However, it appears to show a different profile of receptor selectivity relative to ACTH, as it apparently demonstrated no evidence of inhibition of endogenous ACTH in Addison's disease patients.|$|E
50|$|The ACTH test (also {{called the}} cosyntropin, tetracosactide, or Synacthen test) {{is a medical}} test usually ordered and {{interpreted}} by endocrinologists to assess {{the functioning of the}} adrenal glands stress response by measuring the adrenal response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; corticotropin) or another corticotropic agent such as tetracosactide (cosyntropin, tetracosactrin; Synacthen) or <b>alsactide</b> (Synchrodyn). ACTH is a hormone produced in the anterior pituitary gland that stimulates the adrenal glands to release cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and aldosterone.|$|E
40|$|Hypovolemic shock was {{produced}} in rats by withdrawing about 50 % of the estimated total blood volume. Following mean arterial pressure stabilization {{in the range of}} 15 - 25 mm Hg, with a pulse pressure of 7 - 12 mm Hg, the rats were given intravenous bolus injections either of ACTH fragments or of saline. The following ACTH fragments or analogs were used: ACTH-(4 - 10), alpha-MSH, ACTH-(1 - 16), ACTH-(1 - 17), ACTH-(1 - 18), [Nle 4,D-Phe 7]alpha-MSH, [beta-Ala 1,Lys 17]ACTH-(1 - 17) - 4 -amino-n-butilamide (<b>alsactide).</b> ACTH-(1 - 24) and human synthetic ACTH-(1 - 39) were used for comparison. All animals treated with saline died in 22. 51 +/- 3. 62 min. Treatment with ACTH fragments (160 micrograms/kg i. v.) increased blood pressure and pulse amplitude, the effect starting within a few minutes, gradually increasing, and reaching a maximum in 15 - 30 min. The blood and pulse pressure increases were sustained, remaining almost stable {{until the end of the}} 2 h recording. Two out of nine rats treated with <b>alsactide,</b> which was the least active, died within 2 h after treatment, while all rats treated with the other ACTH fragments or analogs were still surviving at that time. Both on a weight and on a molar basis, the most active was ACTH-(1 - 24), followed by ACTH-(1 - 16), by the alpha-MSH analog [Nle 4,D-Phe 7]ACTH-(1 - 13), by ACTH-(1 - 18) and by ACTH-(1 - 17). The present results show that melanocortins reverse otherwise fatal hypovolemic shock, and suggest a new therapeutic approach for shock treatment...|$|E
