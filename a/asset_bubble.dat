25|$|An {{economic}} bubble or <b>asset</b> <b>bubble</b> (sometimes {{also referred to}} as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. though theories of financial crises such as debt-deflation and the Financial Instability Hypothesis suggest instead that bubbles burst progressively, with the most vulnerable (most highly-leveraged) assets failing first, and then the collapse spreading throughout the economy.|$|E

This article explains what the ECB can learn from historical <b>asset</b> <b>bubbles</b> in EU eurozone member countries.

They cite factors such as bubbles forming during periods of innovation, easy credit, loose regulations, and internationalized investment as reasons why narratives play such an influential role in the growth of asset bubbles.|$|E

2500|$|Chapter 1 {{includes}} a thumbnail {{sketch of the}} unfolding events that comprise the 2007-2009 crises, [...] a brief discussion of the government response and an outline of the various causes, along with a summary of how they have been covered in the media. The crises is described as the deflation of the <b>asset</b> <b>bubble</b> once confidence was undermined in key underlying factors: American house prices and the credit worthiness of sub-prime mortgages. [...] Following on from this was the liquidity crunch {{in the world of}} finance, with the knock-on effect on the real economy. [...] Lord Skidelsky divides his discussion of the response into two sections, covering the bail-outs and the stimulus packages. He identifies the follow possible causes: financial innovation; lack of regulation; the behaviour of the bankers & hedge funds and the failings of both credit-rating agencies and governments. He finishes by asserting that all these actors are influenced by economic theories, and that it is recent trends in economics that are the real cause of the crises.|$|E

When a lender such as a government, central bank, or banking sector is willing to lend {{infinitely}} against collateral, explosive <b>asset</b> <b>bubbles</b> can form which exactly offset a bubble in household liabilities. Surprisingly, evidence from a VAR using long-run restrictions supports the idea that <b>asset</b> <b>bubbles</b> are approximately neutral in their real effects before 2007.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how economic policy should respond to possible <b>asset</b> price <b>bubbles.</b> Three questions are considered: • Are some <b>asset</b> price <b>bubbles</b> more problematic than others? • How should monetary policy respond to <b>asset</b> price <b>bubbles?</b> • What {{other types of}} policy responses are appropriate? I conclude that <b>asset</b> price <b>bubbles</b> associated with credit booms present particular challenges because their bursting can lead to episodes of financial instability that have damaging effects on the economy. Monetary policy should not react to <b>asset</b> price <b>bubbles</b> per se, but rather {{to changes in the}} outlook for inflation and aggregate demand resulting from asset price movements. However, regulatory policies and supervisory practices should respond to possible <b>asset</b> price <b>bubbles</b> and help prevent feedback loops between <b>asset</b> price <b>bubbles</b> and credit provision, thereby minimising the damaging effects of bubbles on the economy. ...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{geography}} of financial bubbles and financial crises. While bubbles and crises have erupted across the globe {{in the past several}} years, their spatial aspect has largely been ignored. While interest in bubbles has grown, stimulated by recent financial crises, economic and econometric analyses designed to interrogate them have de-spatialized any understanding of their characteristics by looking or commonalities across bubbles, in essence developing models in (abstract) space but not of (real, contextualized) space. Geographers, for their part, often assume that bubbles or crises are manifestations of the deeper forces generating capitalist crisis. We argue, to the contrary, that <b>asset</b> <b>bubbles</b> and crises cannot be reduced to epiphenomena; ‘placing’ them {{is the only way to}} fully grasp their causes and consequences. In integrated economies with developed divisions of labor and well-organized institutions for investment, lending, and saving, <b>asset</b> <b>bubbles</b> arise systematically: they are commonplace, not rare. We establish this argument on the basis of cross-border accounting balances. This way of understanding <b>asset</b> <b>bubbles</b> suggests that whether they are readily deflated or instead grow to problematic and unsustainable peaks depends on local market and income structures and on cross-border flows of all kinds. So understanding <b>asset</b> <b>bubbles</b> – and their role in the uneven growth of income, wealth, and debt – requires an examination of the geographic political economy which has generated (or moderated) them, thereby creating new layers of losers and winners in residents’, enterprises’, and financiers’ struggles for sustenance, security, and gain...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{financial}} booms and extreme asset valuations on the relative demand for skills and the wage structure. The substantial rise in wage inequality in the U. S. since the late 1970 s {{has been accompanied by}} a major expansion of financial services, a series of <b>asset</b> <b>bubbles,</b> and rising relative wages and relative education in the financial industry. I motivate and develop a theoretical framework where financial institutions benefit from financial booms and <b>asset</b> <b>bubbles.</b> Yet the complexity and novelty of financial products and fundamentals surrounding bubbles favor the supremacy of skilled individuals in exploiting these opportunities. Hence financial booms increase opportunities for skilled labor, contributing to the rise in overall wage inequality in the economy. Simple extensions of the basic framework allow us to study the implications of financial regulation and globalization of financial services, as well as further topics. Finally, the paper documents and compares relative wage and employment patterns in the U. S., U. K., Germany, and France, providing suggestive evidence for the theoretical framework.

50|$|The Bank of Japan {{has also}} been criticized for its role in fueling the <b>asset</b> <b>bubble.</b> The {{movement}} of the BOJ to appreciate the Japanese yen rather than stabilizing the asset price inflation and overheating meant little could be done during {{the peak of the}} crisis.

50|$|Consequently, {{this had}} an adverse impact on whole Japanese <b>asset</b> <b>bubble.</b> Firstly, cheap and easily {{available}} loans reduced the funding {{costs for the}} purpose of speculation. Second, stock rises, coupled by low interests rates, reduced the capital costs and aided financing the capital market (e.g. convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, etc.). Third, the combination of a rise in land and stock prices pushed up the value of assets held by corporations, which effectively increased their sources of funding since such these increased the collateral value of the assets.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study the e¤ects of {{globalization}} on the workings of asset markets and welfare. To do this, we adopt a technologicalview of the globalization process. That is, we model this process as consisting of a gradual (and exogenous) reduction in the costs of shipping goods across di¤erent regions of the world. In the absence of market frictions, globalization creates foreign trade opportunities without a¤ecting domestic ones and, as a result, unambiguously raises welfare. In the presence of sovereign risk, however, globalization can either create or destroy both domestic and foreign trade opportunities. The net e¤ect on welfare of this process of creation and destruction of trade opportunities might be either positive or negative. We also 8 ̆ 5 nd that <b>asset</b> <b>bubbles</b> moderate this welfare e¤ect.
