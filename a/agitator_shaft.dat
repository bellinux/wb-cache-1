5000|$|As with {{front-loading}} washers, clothing {{should not}} be packed tightly into a top-loading washer. Although wet fabric usually fits into a smaller space than dry fabric, a dense wad of fabric can restrict water circulation, resulting in poor soap distribution and incomplete rinsing. Extremely overloaded top-loading washers can either jam {{the motion of the}} agitator, overloading or damaging the motor or gearbox, burning drive belts, or tearing fabrics - many Whirlpool/Kenmore machines even have a mechanical [...] "fuse" [...] designed to break before the expensive motor is damaged. Extreme overloading can also push fabrics into the small gap between the underside of the agitator and the bottom of the wash basket, resulting in fabrics wrapped around the <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft,</b> possibly requiring agitator removal to unjam.|$|E
50|$|In most {{industrial}} fermentations, {{the organisms}} or eukaroyotic cells are submerged in a liquid medium; in others, {{such as the}} fermentation of cocoa beans, coffee cherries, and miso, fermentation takes place on the moist surface of the medium.There are also industrial considerations related to the fermentation process. For instance, to avoid biological process contamination, the fermentation medium, air, and equipment are sterilized. Foam control {{can be achieved by}} either mechanical foam destruction or chemical anti-foaming agents. Several other factors must be measured and controlled such as pressure, temperature, <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> power, and viscosity. An important element for industrial fermentations is scale up. This is the conversion of a laboratory procedure to an industrial process. It is well established in the field of industrial microbiology that what works well at the laboratory scale may work poorly or not at all when first attempted at large scale. It is generally not possible to take fermentation conditions that have worked in the laboratory and blindly apply them to industrial-scale equipment. Although many parameters have been tested for use as scale up criteria, there is no general formula because of the variation in fermentation processes. The most important methods are the maintenance of constant power consumption per unit of broth and the maintenance of constant volumetric transfer rate.|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{ball mill}} consisting of vertical cylinder, {{equipped with a}} rotating shaft with arms, and filled with steel balls as a grinding medium {{has been used in}} the experiments. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the effect of <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> speed and amount of grinding media (steel balls) on power requirements and energy consumption of a ball mill. With constant mass of the steel balls (20 kg, 30 kg and 40 kg), the <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> speed was increased from 10 % to 100 % of the maximum speed which corresponds to a speed of 50 rpm. The power consumption (W) was recorded upon which milling energy consumption (J/kg) has been calculated. The results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA. The increase of the <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> speed, in steps of 10 % to the maximum speed of 50 rpm, led to a statistically significant increase in milling energy consumption. At low <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> speed (10 %), increase in the mass of the steel balls had no influence on the power requirements. Power requirements for the grinding runs using 30 kg and 40 kg are similar and higher compared to power requirement in trial with 20 kg, as <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> speed increases from 20 % to 70 %. At high <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> speeds (≥ 80 %), increase in steel balls mass led to the significant increase in power requirements of the ball mill...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of the main milling variables, i. e., <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> speed (50, 75 and 100 %, which is 25, 37. 5 and 50 rpm) and milling time (30, 45 and 60 min) on physical and sensory properties of fat filling, as well as on energy consumption during the production in a laboratory ball mill. Within the response surface method, the face centered central composite design is used. A response surface regression analysis for responses was performed and a full quadratic model was fitted to the experimental data. It is shown that <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> speed had the most significant influence on physical properties (particle size distribution, rheological and textural propertes) and sensory characteristics of fat filling, while the milling energy consumption is highly influenced by milling time with contribution 55. 4 %, followed by <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> speed (40. 04 %). The model obtained by regression analyses was used to perform the optimization of processing parameters in order to provide the combination of <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> speed and milling time that cost less energy while at the same time do not compromise the quality of the fat filling. Optimization of production of fat filling in a laboratory ball mill would imply the maximum <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> speed and 30 -min milling time...|$|E
40|$|The {{overview}} {{presents the}} most important and recent issues regarding the modelling and the control of the aerobic bioprocess. First part is dedicated to the discussion about instruments and techniques for bioprocess variables determination and monitoring: (a) the standard direct physical determinations: temperature, pressure (over pressure), <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> power and rate of stirring, foam, gas and liquid flow, weight; (b) the regular chemical determinations: pH, redox potential, dissolved oxygen concentration, exit-gas analysis, on-line analysis of other chemical factors (ion-specific sensors, enzyme electrodes, microbial electrodes, mass spectrometers, fluorimeters). In the second part the mathematical modelling of the aerobic bioprocess is presented with several types of models: unstructured global models; structured models; segregated models; metabolic modelling. The bioprocess control has different goals and objectives, function of bioprocess characteristics and imposed performances. A case study based on authors ’ original research presents the bioprocess modelling and the intelligent structure design to control the fed batch cultivation of Hansenula polymorpha CBS- 4732 yeast for alcoholoxidase-containing cellular mass...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{processing}} of NaNbO 3 nanopowder by combining the solid-state synthesis and subsequent milling in the agitator bead mill. The effect of different rotation speeds of the <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> on the comminution process was followed by laser granulometry. The morphology and specific surface area of the powders were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and the N 2 adsorption method, respectively. With the optimized milling parameters, we obtained NaNbO 3 nanoparticles with an average size of 25 [*]nm and a narrow particle size distribution. The result is comparable to other processing techniques, such as solution-based chemical routes or mechanochemical synthesis; however, the presented method does not require any complicated processing {{and it can be}} easily upscaled to yield large quantities of the NaNbO 3 nanopowder. Furthermore, the compaction behaviour of the obtained nanopowder was investigated, and a compaction-response diagram was constructed revealing good compactability of the powder. The green compacts, isostatically pressed at 740 [*]MPa, had a relative density of 70 % and a narrow pore size distribution with an average pore radius of 4 [*]nm...|$|E
40|$|Powder mixing {{is common}} in many {{industrial}} processes, yet traditional methods of investigation provide only very limited information {{of the influence of}} agitator geometry and important operational parameters on flow patterns. Here powder mixing is investigated in horizontal mixers using Positron Emission Particle Tracking, a recently developed non- invasive method of investigating solid or liquid systems. It is thus possible to investigate powder mixing far more thoroughly than hitherto. In particular it allows single particle motion to be followed at speeds up to 2 m/s in traditionally opaque equipment of diameter up to 400 mm. Powder flow patterns were characterised here using velocity fields as well as axial and radial mixing coefficients. The experiments were conducted in mixers of diameter 270 mm and of length 650 mm, the level of fill being varied between 20 and 70 % and the agitator speed between 20 and 45 rpm. Studies on a single long flat blade located on radial arms fixed to a rotor shaft revealed, at low fills, the presence in the cross-sectional plane of a circulation zone directly beneath the rotating shaft where little agitation occurred. This zone decreased in size and moved towards the <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> with increase of fill. Distributions of velocity showed that powder movement was controlled by the number of blade passes. In a mixer having six long flat blades located on radial arms fixed to a rotor shaft, a circulation zone similar to that observed with the single blade agitator appeared beneath the <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft.</b> Axial flow patterns showed two loops of circulation inside each compartment defined by the supports of the rotating blades. Another type of agitator had series of short paddles. The material was more evenly distributed in the cross-sectional plane. The short blades also promoted axial displacement. Continuous experiments with the agitator having six long flat blades showed that behaviour in the cross-sectional plane was similar to that in batch experiments. Although two loops of circulation in each compartment remained, axial motion was dominated by the convective flow. The work opens the prospect of obtaining a detailed understanding of powder mixing and also of establishing links between powder flow patterns and a wide range of operations such as heat transfer, chemical reaction or agglomeration processes.

40|$|Biological {{methods were}} {{developed}} to detoxify corn stover and corn starch pyrolysis liquors produced at 400 [...] 500 °C. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic suspended cells and biofilms were employed for the detoxification process. The continuous of detoxification process was monitored by measuring the change in dissolved oxygen and pH. Total phenolic assay, change in UV absorbance spectra, GC-MS analysis and bioassay were performed to determine the detoxification. Pseudomonas putida and Streptomyces setonii biofilms, developed on Plastic Composite Supports (PCS) fixed to <b>agitator</b> <b>shaft</b> of benchtop computer controlled bioreactor, detoxified 10 and 25 % (v/v) diluted corn stover and corn starch pyrolysis liquor (Des and Dst), while mixed culture biofilms detoxified 50 % (v/v) Dcs and Dst.;Ligninolytic enzymes of Phanerochaete chrysosporium were also employed to detoxify the Dcs and Dst in shake flask cultures. The detoxification was determined by measuring the activity of lignin peroxidase (LiP), mangenase peroxidase (MnP), total phenolic compounds reduction, GC-MS analysis, and bioassay. Ph. chrysosporium culture detoxified 10 and 25 % (v/v) Dcs and Dst, but not 50 % (v/v) Des and Dst. The involvement of ligninolytic enzymes in the detoxification process were confirmed by adding ligninolytic enzymes inhibitors, sodium azide and cycloheximide to culture medium and by employing concentrated crude enzyme to detoxify 10 % (v/v) Dcs.;In a subsequent study, the ligninolytic enzymes were produced by Ph. chrysosporium PCS biofilm in stirred tank bioreactor. Fourteen repeated batch fermentations were performed with different culture conditions. The differences in enzymes production between the batches were determined statistically by comparing the activity of LiP and MnP. All batch conditions evaluated enhanced the production {{of at least one}} of the enzymes. In batch C 3 V 0 11 and C 3 V 3 8 (continuous aeration, 300 agitation, and addition of veratryl alcohol on day zero or three) LiP and MnP were produced on day three and reached a peak on day six. However, in batch C 3 VM 0 14 (continuous aeration, 300 agitation, and addition of veratryl alcohol and MnSO 4 on day zero) LiP and MnP were produced earlier, on day three, and decreased by day six...|$|E
