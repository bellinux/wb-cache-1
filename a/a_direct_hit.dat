5|$|Bénouville was the {{farthest}} forward {{point of the}} British advance on 6 June 1944. On 9 June, the German Air Force attacked the bridges with 13 aircraft. The British had positioned light and medium-sized anti-aircraft guns around the bridges and {{in the face of}} intense anti-aircraft fire the attack failed, although they did claim one of the bridges was destroyed by <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Central Pacific hurricanes {{are rare}} and on average 4 to 5 storms form or move {{in this area}} annually. As there are no large {{contiguous}} landmasses in the basin, direct hits and landfalls are rare; however, they occur occasionally, as with Hurricane Iniki in 1992, which made landfall on Hawaii, and Hurricane Ioke in 2006, which made <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> on Johnston Atoll.|$|E
5|$|Corporal Elspeth Henderson and Sergeant Helen Turner (1941) – {{both women}} were awarded the Military Medal for staying at their post when the {{building}} {{they were in}} received <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> from a bomb during an air raid on RAF Biggin Hill. Although painted in Knight's studio in Malvern, the painting shows the two women on duty at their airfield.|$|E

25|$|During {{the course}} of the battle, the Venetian Captain General Marcello was killed by <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> cannon <b>hit,</b> but his death kept a secret from all but his second, the provedditore of the fleet Barbaro Badoer.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} threat of strong {{thunderstorms}} and gusts, Florida was spared <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> from Nicole. The storm skirted {{the state with}} only showers; 12.71inches (323mm) of rain were recorded at North Key Largo, though the mainland received much smaller quantities. The storm flooded streets in Miami Beach and the northern Florida Keys, {{as well as one}} home. Similarly, inclement weather spread over the northwestern Bahamas without significant consequences.|$|E
5|$|Fern made <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> at Yap on Christmas Day. A {{cargo ship}} was {{abandoned}} {{after it was}} damaged by high winds offshore. On the island, Fern caused $3 million (1996USD) of damage. Roads and bridges were significantly damaged, and other public facilities were destroyed. Crops and private properties also received damage. A state of emergency was declared in Yap State two weeks later, and became a disaster area two months later.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{destroyed}} by the explosion of her own torpedoes. According to Goodall's theory, the ship's torpedoes could have been detonated either by the fire raging on the boat deck or, more probably, by <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> from Bismarck. This would have blown out {{the side of the}} ship, destroying the girder strength of the hull; the force of water entering the hole, at a speed of nearly , would then shear the stern section {{from the rest of the}} hull.|$|E
50|$|On 15 October 1940, {{during the}} Blitz, the Courtyard gates were {{destroyed}} by <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> bomb <b>hit.</b> The wall above the Gate Clock collapsed, and the clock's dial was damaged. The damage was repaired after the war.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 November 1943, Suzunami was sunk in a U.S. carrier {{air raid}} on Rabaul, New Britain. Reportedly she took <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> bomb <b>hit</b> while loading torpedoes near mouth of Rabaul Harbor (...) [...] She blew up and sank; 148 were killed {{including}} Commander Kamiyama.|$|R
25|$|The novel {{describes}} {{that since}} the end of the war, a stalemate has developed between Germany and the United States, which seems to overshadow international relations. New German buildings are constructed with mandatory bomb shelters; the Reichsarchiv (German National Archive) claims to have been built to withstand <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> missile <b>hit.</b>|$|R
5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{originating in the}} Atlantic Ocean that affects the state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.|$|E
5|$|During {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} war, most of the company's branch offices were destroyed, and {{employees}} in the East fled the Soviet advance. The head office in Essen suffered <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> from a bomb in March 1945, and regional offices and construction centres in Danzig, Halle, Katowice, Königsberg, Kraków, Leipzig and Magdeburg were lost as the territory they were in was allotted to Poland or the Soviet Zone of occupation. As Eugen Vögler was {{on the run from}} the new authorities, he was replaced as CEO by Artur Konrad.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters and {{computer}} models at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center predicted that Hurricane Dean would impact the Yucatán Peninsula a full 6days {{before the storm}} actually arrived. The hurricane's stable and well predicted path gave all {{of the countries in}} the region ample time to prepare for its arrival. On August 17, {{at the request of the}} Quintana Roo state government, which was expecting their state to suffer <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit,</b> the Civil Protection Office of Mexico's federal Interior Ministry declared a state of emergency for the entire state. This included the towns and cities of Cancún, Playa del Carmen, and Chetumal as well as the islands of Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and Holbox.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, al-Tamimi's sister, Bassama Tamimi {{died while}} visiting him in {{custody of the}} Israeli Army; it is alleged that she was struck and pushed {{down a flight of}} stairs by an Israeli army interpreter. Bassem's cousin Rushdi Muhammed Sa'id Tamimi was convicted of the October 1993 murder of Haim Mizrahi, a settler from Beit El, he was {{released}} in 2013. Bassem was arrested and reportedly tortured. In December 2011, al-Tamimi's cousin Mustafa Tamimi was killed by <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> from a gas grenade fired at close range.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Puerto Cabezas, {{population}} 60,000, meteorologists expected <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit.</b> Local authorities announced a curfew to prevent looting. The government also cut off electricity throughout the small coastal city to prevent injuries. Evacuations were limited, and the most vulnerable of the population weathered the storm in poorly constructed shelters. To {{be able to respond}} to an emergency following Beta, the government of Nicaragua requested relief supplies for 41,866 families which would last 15 days. These supplies consisted of 98,000lb (44,452kg) of cereals, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of beans, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of corn, 125,7200lb (57,025kg) of rice, 44,500lb (20,184kg) of sugar, 171,600lb (77,836kg) of salt, 4,929gal (18,658L) of cooking oil, 324,900lb (147,372kg) of milk and 21,264 blankets.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at {{the start}} of the second innings, {{bringing}} his tormentor Edrich to the crease. Lindwall did not bounce Edrich, but Miller did, earning the ire of the crowd. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes. This was aided three dropped catches from Washbrook. Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six, but was immediately run out by Morris with <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit.</b> Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball, as England reached 174/3 at the close, with Washbrook unbeaten on 85.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 November 1944, Akebono, while {{alongside}} destroyer [...] at Cavite pier near Manila {{was attacked}} in a USAAF air raid. <b>A</b> <b>direct</b> bomb <b>hit</b> set both ships ablaze, {{and the following}} day a large explosion on Akishimo blew a hole in Akebono, which sank upright in shallow water at position , with 48 crewmen killed and 43 wounded.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, in {{the area}} to the east of the Jordan River garrisoned by the Ottoman Fourth Army, two Bristol Fighters {{reporting}} early in the day all Ottoman camps {{in the area}}, were quiet. After attacking a mass of cavalry at Ain es Sir they returned to base by flying over the Wadi Fara road. Here they dropped their remaining bombs on a column of 50 motor lorries, moving eastwards along the road towards the Jisr ed Damieh bridge over the Jordan River. <b>A</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> on one of the lorries blocked the road and in the late afternoon another two Bristol Fighters continued this attack.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days prior}} to Fabian {{striking}} Bermuda, computer models forecast a ridge of high pressure forcing the hurricane {{to the west of}} the island by 200miles (320km). Not expected to be a direct threat, a meteorologist at the Bermuda Weather Service expected gusty winds and potentially heavy rainfall. Each successive advisory brought the hurricane steadily closer to Bermuda, and 35hours before Fabian made its closest approach, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the island. When a track near Bermuda became more certain, a hurricane warning was issued for the island, approximately 29hours before Fabian made <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> on the island.|$|E
5|$|Temes was {{commissioned}} into the Danube Flotilla in 1915, {{and was in}} action against the Serbian Army at Belgrade in early October, when the Serbs evacuated {{the city in the}} face of an Austro-Hungarian assault. During the final river crossing and reinforcement of the resulting bridgehead, Temes provided close support. During this task, she attempted to draw fire away from the battle-damaged monitor Enns but after receiving <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> in the crew quarters aft, she had to move out of range. She was run ashore to put out fires and stop leaks, before being towed out of the battle area by an armed steamer, and taken to Budapest for repairs.|$|E

5|$|With the Nazi {{invasion}} of Belgium on 10 May 1940, Zita {{and her family}} became war refugees. They narrowly missed being killed by <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> on the castle by German bombers and fled to Prince Xavier's French Castle in Bostz. The Habsburgs then fled to the Spanish border, reaching it on 18 May. They moved on to Portugal where the U.S. Government granted the family exit visas on 9 July. After a perilous journey they arrived in New York City on 27 July, having family in Long Island and Newark, New Jersey.; at one point, Zita and several of her children lived, as long-term house-guests, in Tuxedo Park, New York.|$|E
5|$|Although {{more common}} since 1995, few above-normal {{hurricane}} seasons occurred during 1970–94. Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960, including many major New England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933, a record only recently exceeded in 2005, which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900–25; however, many intense storms formed during 1870–99. During the 1887 season, 19 tropical storms formed, {{of which a}} record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 19th century, including an 1821 storm that made <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> on New York City. Some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as Category 4 in strength.|$|E
5|$|Broadcasting House {{was first}} used by the BBC on 2 May 1932, and total {{construction}} costs were £350,000. It was too small for all services, and St George's Hall, next to All Souls, was used for variety broadcasts until it was demolished during the Blitz. On 15 October 1940, the building took <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>hit,</b> killing seven people, and later that year a landmine exploded on Portland Place, causing widespread fires in Broadcasting House. Despite the damage, it survived the war {{and became one of}} the best known buildings associated with radio broadcasting. Subsequently, the BBC expanded with additional studios at Maida Vale, followed by the former headquarters of BBC Television, BBC Television Centre at Wood Lane. In the 2000s, Broadcasting House was expanded to include a new wing and modernise the site, replacing earlier extensions. It was designed by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard. Originally named the Egton Wing, it was renamed to the John Peel Wing in 2012, in memory of the radio broadcaster.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the most}} notable {{cyclones}} of the season were Steve and Rosita. Cyclone Steve transversed the entire Australian continent, and although a fairly weak cyclone, caused widespread flooding in Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia, while Cyclone Rosita made <b>an</b> almost <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> on Broome as a severe Category4 cyclone, devastating several remote stations and the town itself. Rosita surprised many residents of its arrival, as it made landfall very late in the season.|$|R
50|$|The {{stick of}} twenty-one 1000 lb bombs crossed the airfield, damaged the airport tower, scored <b>a</b> single <b>direct</b> <b>hit</b> in {{the centre of}} the runway and killed two Air Force personnel.
