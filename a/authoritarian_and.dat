5|$|Before {{his service}} in North America, {{he served as}} Bailiff of Guernsey. His tenure in New England was <b>authoritarian</b> <b>and</b> turbulent, as his views were decidedly pro-Anglican, a {{negative}} quality in a region home to many Puritans. His actions in New England resulted in his overthrow during the 1689 Boston revolt.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{has been}} praised for {{significantly}} reducing poverty and illiteracy in Bolivia {{and has been}} internationally decorated with various awards. His supporters have lauded him {{as a champion of}} indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and environmentalism. Alternately, a number of leftist, indigenous, and environmentalist critics have accused him of failing to live up to many of his espoused values, while right-wing opponents have accused him of being excessively radical and <b>authoritarian</b> <b>and</b> claimed that his defence of coca contributes to illegal cocaine production.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 1962 the Chapter General of the Holy Ghost Fathers elected Lefebvre as the Superior General. Lefebvre {{was widely}} {{respected}} for {{his experience in}} the mission field. On the other hand, certain progressive members of his congregation, particularly in France, considered his administrative style <b>authoritarian</b> <b>and</b> desired radical reforms. On 7 August 1962 Lefebvre was given the titular archiepiscopal see of Synnada in Phrygia.|$|E

5|$|The 1930s {{also saw}} the growth of several <b>authoritarian</b> <b>and</b> fascist {{political}} parties in both Wallonia and Flanders. In the 1936 elections, one of these, the French-speaking Rexist party, gained 11.6 {{percent of the national}} vote. By 1939 however, extremist parties lost many of the seats that they had previously gained in new elections and political stability seemed to be returning.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s Yeats {{was fascinated}} with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, {{nationalist}} movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the far right Blueshirts, although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism, and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order {{and the needs of}} the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for <b>authoritarian</b> <b>and</b> nationalist leadership.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the death}} of Kirchner caused a power vacuum, as Cristina Kirchner had ruled so far as a figurehead, while Néstor Kirchner still managed the {{government}}. She changed {{the style of the}} government making it more <b>authoritarian,</b> <b>and</b> more critical of the U.S.. She broke with allies of her husband, such as the union leader Hugo Moyano, and increased the political clout of the youth wing La Cámpora instead. She also relied on her public image more than her husband had. The popularity of the Kirchners had been in a decline at the time of Néstor's death, but after being widowed, Cristina Kirchner's popularity increased greatly. As a result, she won the reelection in the 2011 general elections by a landslide.|$|E

5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who read the books were significantly different {{than those who had}} not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less <b>authoritarian,</b> <b>and</b> less cynical. Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 coup was a {{major event}} in interwar Lithuania; the {{dictatorship}} would go on for 14years. In 1935, the Smetona government outlawed the activities of all other political parties. The coup {{continues to be a}} difficult issue for Lithuanians, since the Soviet Union would go on to describe its subsequent occupation of Lithuania as a liberation from fascism. Encyclopædia Britannica, however, describes the regime as <b>authoritarian</b> <b>and</b> nationalistic rather than fascist. The coup's apologists have described it as a corrective to an extreme form of parliamentarianism, justifiable in light of Lithuania's political immaturity.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Bruce Perens {{assumed the}} project leadership. Perens was a {{controversial}} leader, regarded as <b>authoritarian</b> <b>and</b> strongly attached to Debian. He drafted a social contract and edited suggestions from a month-long discussion into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. After the FSF withdrew their sponsorship {{in the midst}} of the free software vs. open source debate, Perens initiated the creation of the legal umbrella organization Software in the Public Interest instead of seeking renewed involvement with the FSF. He led the conversion of the project from a.out to ELF. He created the BusyBox program to make it possible to run a Debian installer on a single floppy, and wrote a new installer. By the time Debian 1.2 was released, the project had grown to nearly two hundred volunteers. Perens left the project in 1998.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} explores the {{potential}} relationships among perceived parenting style, perfectionism, and creativity in a high-ability and high-achieving young adult population. Using data from 323 honors college {{students at a}} Midwestern university, bivariate correlations suggested positive relationships between (a) permissive parenting style and creativity <b>and</b> (b) <b>authoritarian</b> parenting style <b>and</b> socially prescribed perfectionism. Furthermore, negative relationships were also found between <b>authoritarian</b> parenting style <b>and</b> creativity. These relationships were further investigated using a path model that included control variables for gender and parent education level. Findings suggest statistically significant relationships between creativity <b>and</b> gender, <b>authoritarian</b> parenting <b>and</b> socially prescribed perfectionism, <b>authoritarian</b> parenting <b>and</b> creativity, and permissive parenting and creativity...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Decomposing authoritarian {{leadership}} {{into two}} essential elements - <b>authoritarian</b> decision making <b>and</b> <b>authoritarian</b> decision implementation, this dissertation focuses on disentangling {{the relationship between}} <b>authoritarian</b> leadership <b>and</b> work unit effectiveness, the relationship that has confused leadership researchers for decades. Surveys from 376 employees of 114 work units in a Chinese Fast Moving Consumer Goods company show four important findings. First, <b>authoritarian</b> decision making <b>and</b> <b>authoritarian</b> decision implementation are theoretically and empirically two distinct constructs. Second, leader authoritarian decision making interacts with both leader <b>authoritarian</b> decision implementation <b>and</b> leader competence to affect work unit decision quality. Moreover, leader authoritarian decision implementation partially moderates the relationship between work unit decision quality and work unit effectiveness. Finally, leader authoritarian decision making has an indirect effect on work unit effectiveness through its impact on work unit decision quality only when leader authoritarian decision implementation is low. The theoretical and empirical implications of these findings {{are discussed in the}} organizational context...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between <b>authoritarian</b> leadership <b>and</b> employees’ deviant workplace behaviors (DWB), {{as well as the}} mediating effects of psychological contract violation and organizational cynicism. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 391 manufacturing workers in a northern city of China. Structural equation modeling was performed to test the theory-driven models. The results showed that the relationship between <b>authoritarian</b> leadership <b>and</b> employees’ DWB was mediated by organizational cynicism. Moreover, this relationship was also sequentially mediated by psychological contract violation and organizational cynicism. This research unveiled psychological contract violation and organizational cynicism as underlying mechanism that explained the link between <b>authoritarian</b> leadership <b>and</b> employees’ DWB...|$|R
