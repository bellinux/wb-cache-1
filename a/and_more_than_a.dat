5|$|A brawl scene between Johnson's and Diesel's {{characters}} {{was considered}} difficult to choreograph. The characters were written {{to be equally}} formidable, so the fight was punctuated with moments of character development, as Moritz felt this made the fight more exciting. The scene required several weeks of rehearsal <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> week of filming by the actors and their stunt doubles, who incurred several minor injuries.|$|E

The houses were sold at a discount of 33–55 per cent, leading to large profits for some new owners. Personal wealth rose by 80 per cent in real terms during the 1980s, mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings. Shares in the privatised utilities were sold below their market value to ensure quick and wide sales, rather than maximise national income.|$|E

5|$|A {{month and}} a half after Joaquim Inácio's marriage, Emperor PedroI abdicated and sailed to Europe. Since the former emperor's son and heir Dom PedroII was a minor, a regency was formed, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> decade of {{instability}} and turmoil ensued. On 6 October 1831, navy artillerymen, held under suspicion of plotting a mutiny, escaped the presiganga (prison ship) in which they had been confined. Joaquim Inácio commanded the schooner Jaguaripe which, along with other vessels, had been guarding the prison ship. Seeing that the artillerymen had set sail for Rio de Janeiro, Joaquim Inácio and a few men took a boat to warn the city. They encountered musket fire from the artillerymen, who then changed course for the nearby Ilha das Cobras (Island of the Snakes) in the face of strong opposition from the mainland. They were defeated the next day when three columns of men from the Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion and Permanent Municipal Guard Corps invaded the island.|$|E
5|$|American {{merchant}} shipping had been {{protected by the}} British Navy, {{and as a consequence}} of the Treaty of Paris and the disarmament of the Continental Navy, the United States no longer had any protection for its ships from pirates. The fledgling nation did not have the funds to pay annual tribute to the Barbary states, so their ships were vulnerable for capture after 1785. By 1789, the new Constitution of the United States authorized Congress to create a navy, but during George Washington's first term (1787–1793) little was done to rearm the navy. In 1793, the French Revolutionary Wars between Great Britain and France began, and a truce negotiated between Portugal and Algiers ended Portugal's blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar which had kept the Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean. Soon after, the pirates sailed into the Atlantic, and captured 11 American merchant ships <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> hundred seamen.|$|E

5|$|Australia had {{previously}} won {{medals in the}} event, but was not {{regarded as one of}} the favourites for the gold, as the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden all fielded more decorated swimmers over the component legs of the relay. After the backstroke leg, Australia was in fourth place <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> second in arrears of the Soviet leaders. However, Evans was the fastest among the breaststrokers and moved the team into second position at the halfway point in the race; and Tonelli, a makeshift butterflyer, completed his leg in a time much faster than his previous best, allowing Australia to keep the Soviet lead reasonable. Australia's anchor swimmer Brooks overtook his more credentialled Soviet counterpart Sergey Koplyakov in the latter half of the final leg to secure a narrow victory. The quartet disbanded after the Olympics due to Tonelli's retirement, although some of the members continued to be present in the relay team at various times alongside new swimmers. By 1986, all four members of the 1980 team had retired from international competition.|$|E
5|$|Between March 23 and March 27, 1913, Indiana <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> {{dozen other}} states {{experienced}} major flooding during the Great Flood of 1913; it was Indiana's worst flood disaster {{up to that}} time. The weather system that created the unprecedented flooding arrived in Indiana on Sunday, March 23, with a major tornado at Terre Haute. In four days, rainfall topped nine inches in southern Indiana, {{more than half of}} it falling within a twenty-four-hour period on March 25. Heavy rains, runoff, and rising rivers resulted in extensive flooding in northeast, central, and southern Indiana. Indiana's flood-related deaths were estimated at 100 to 200, with flood damage estimated at $25 million (in 1913 dollars). State and local communities handled their own disaster response and relief. The American Red Cross, still a small organization at that time, established a temporary headquarters in Indianapolis and served the six hardest-hit Indiana counties. Indiana governor Samuel M. Ralston appealed to Indiana cities and other states for relief assistance and appointed a trustee to receive relief funds and arrange for distribution of supplies. Independent organizations, such as the Rotary Club of Indianapolis and others, helped with local relief efforts.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{fluctuating}} critical {{assessment of}} the various works over the years, Elgar's major works {{taken as a whole}} have in the twenty-first century recovered strongly from their neglect in the 1950s. The Record Guide in 1955 could list only one currently available recording of the First Symphony, none of the Second, one of the Violin Concerto, two of the Cello Concerto, two of the Enigma Variations, one of Falstaff, and none of The Dream of Gerontius. Since then there have been multiple recordings of all the major works. More than thirty recordings have been made of the First Symphony since 1955, for example, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> dozen of The Dream of Gerontius. Similarly, in the concert hall, Elgar's works, after a period of neglect, are once again frequently programmed. The Elgar Society's website, in its diary of forthcoming performances, lists performances of Elgar's works by orchestras, soloists and conductors across Europe, North America and Australia.|$|E

As a result of congestion on the nation's railroads and ports when the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, the Federal government established the wartime U.S. Railroad Administration (USRA) to take charge of railroads and steamship companies, including the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. The USRA directed the operations of the Old Bay Line and the rival Chesapeake line {{for the duration of the}} war <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year thereafter, until March 1, 1920.|$|E
5|$|Mounted on a {{large scale}} under American command and {{involving}} nearly 15,000 troops, Paddington failed to result in significant contact, in spite of the employment of well co-ordinated search techniques and blocking forces. A large number of Viet Cong camps, bunkers and storage areas were however uncovered and destroyed, resulting in significant disruption to the communist logistic system. Under the overall command of Major General George G. O'Connor, commander US 9th Infantry Division, allied forces for Operation Paddington included the US 1st Brigade, 9th Infantry Division, the 2nd Battalion, US 47th Infantry Regiment (Mechanised), the US 11th Armoured Cavalry Regiment, Task Force B Marine Corps (RVN) and the 1st Australian Task Force, as well as various supporting arms including two artillery batteries <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thousand armoured vehicles and helicopters. Viet Cong casualties included 92 killed, including 31 by 1 ATF for the loss of one Australian killed and another wounded. Nonetheless, the results were disappointing for the Australians, and the Viet Cong continued to elude them.|$|E
5|$|On August 22, the British {{landed on}} the shores of Gravesend Bay in {{southwest}} Kings County, across the Narrows from Staten Island <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> dozen miles south from the established East River crossings to Manhattan. After five days of waiting, the British attacked American defenses on the Guan Heights. Unknown to the Americans, however, Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after. The Americans panicked, resulting in twenty percent losses through casualties and captures, although a stand by 400 Maryland troops prevented a larger portion of the army from being lost. The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights. The British dug in for a siege but, on the night of August 29–30, Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of supplies or a single life. Washington and the Continental Army were driven out of New York entirely after several more defeats and forced to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|The great {{demand for}} Harry Potter books {{motivated}} the New York Times {{to create a}} separate best-seller list for children's literature in 2000, just before the release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

On 12 April 2007, Barnes & Noble declared that Deathly Hallows had broken its pre-order record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site. For the release of Goblet of Fire, 9,000 FedEx trucks were used with no other purpose than to deliver the book. Together, Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble pre-sold more than 700,000 copies of the book. In the United States, the book's initial printing run was 3.8million copies. This record statistic was broken by Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, with 8.5million, which was then shattered by Half-Blood Prince with 10.8million copies. 6.9million copies of Prince were sold in the U.S. within the first 24 hours of its release; in the United Kingdom more than two million copies were sold on the first day.
