5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation was}} carried out by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, precursor to the NTSB). It emerged that pilot Roger Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flying training, although had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under visual flight rules, which essentially require that the pilot must be able to see where he is going. However, {{on the night of the}} accident, visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a visible horizon, and the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> lights over the sparsely populated area.|$|E
2500|$|The young United States also faced {{criticism}} {{on political}} and ideological grounds. Ceaser argues that the Romantic strain of European thought and literature, hostile to the Enlightenment view of reason and obsessed with history and national character, disdained the rationalistic American project. The German poet Nikolaus Lenau commented: [...] "With the expression Bodenlosigkeit (<b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground),</b> I think I am able to indicate the general character of all American institutions; what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme". Ceaser argues in his essay that such comments often repurposed the language of degeneracy, and the prejudice came to focus solely on the United States and not Canada and Mexico. Lenau had emigrated to the United States in 1833 {{and found that the}} country did not live up to his ideals, leading him to return to Germany the following year. His experiences in the USA were the subject of a novel entitled Tired of America (Der Amerika-Müde) (1855) by fellow German Ferdinand Kürnberger.|$|E

50|$|The Mascarene Islands of Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues once harboured five {{species of}} giant tortoise, {{comprising}} two species occurring on Mauritius, another two on Rodrigues, {{and one on}} Réunion. The tortoises were unique to these islands and had gained a number of special adaptations in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> predators. They differed from any other giant tortoise species because of their modified jaws, reduced scales on the legs and shells averaging just 1mm thick. The shells of the giant tortoises were open-ended; the name Cylindraspis actually means cylinder-shaped. This was a specific adaptation {{in response to the}} lack of predators, where thick, heavily armored shells were no longer necessary.|$|E

In time it became practical for some people to have warfare as their sole occupation, either {{as a member of a}} military force or mercenary. The original cause of war is not always known. Wars may be prosecuted simultaneously in one or more different theatres. Within each theatre, there may be one or more consecutive military campaigns.

50|$|The main {{benefits}} of fiber are its exceptionally low loss (allowing long distances between amplifiers/repeaters), its <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> currents and other parasite signal and power issues common to long parallel electric conductor runs (due to {{its reliance on}} light rather than electricity for transmission, and the dielectric nature of fiber optic), and its inherently high data-carrying capacity. Thousands of electrical links {{would be required to}} replace a single high bandwidth fiber cable. Another benefit of fibers is that even when run alongside each other for long distances, fiber cables experience effectively no crosstalk, in contrast to some types of electrical transmission lines. Fiber can be installed in areas with high electromagnetic interference (EMI), such as alongside utility lines, power lines, and railroad tracks. Nonmetallic all-dielectric cables are also ideal for areas of high lightning-strike incidence.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly after, the Antonovs {{caused a}} lot of commotion in Suriname after Blue Wing was put on the European Union black list of unsafe airliners. The French {{aviation}} authority established that “specific safety rules, as recorded in the Chicago Treaty, were not fulfilled” and that “there was no adequate reaction on a query regarding safety issues”. It appeared that the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ground</b> Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) on board of the Blue Wing aircraft caused the problems. Since 2006, GPWS was already obliged in France, but from 2010 on worldwide. Because Blue Wing received permission to operate on French Guyana, the French insisted on putting Blue Wing on the list. Late 2007 Blue Wing was removed from the list as the GPWS system is only obligatory for aircraft that weigh more than 5700 Kilograms of which is not the case with neither of the aircraft of Blue Wing.|$|E

50|$|The second {{instalment}} {{looks at}} how plants, {{animals and humans}} colonised even the most remote islands. Most pioneers came from the west, with New Guinea acting as the launch pad. The saltwater crocodile is one species which managed to swim the 60-mile crossing to the next island group, the Solomons. The mass spawning of groupers on a Solomon Island reef releases millions of eggs, which drift on ocean currents to establish new populations. The activity allows grey reef sharks to snatch a few distracted groupers. Few animals made it to Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, 1000 miles further east. Fruit bats were the only mammals to cross the ocean divide, but smaller animals were carried here by cyclones and jet stream winds. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> predators, invertebrates have reached monstrous proportions. Fijian crested iguanas {{are thought to have}} floated here on rafts of vegetation. Seabirds have made the crossing to French Polynesia, where their rich guano helped fertilise barbed seeds stuck to their feathers and turn barren coral atolls into fertile groves. One plant needs no such help. Coconuts can survive drifting for two months at sea and lay roots into bare sand. Before the arrival of humans, fewer than 500 species colonised Hawaii in 30 million years. Once established, they evolved into countless new varieties. The story of human colonisation is no less remarkable. The ancestors of modern Polynesians, most probably Lapitas of Southeast Asia, arrived in Fiji 3,500 years ago and Hawaii 2,000 years ago.|$|E
