25|$|On 11 August 2015, the Mexican Supreme Court ruled, in a 9-1 decision, that Campeche's ban on {{same-sex}} couples adopting children is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court struck down Article 19 of Campeche's civil union law which outlawed adoption by couples in civil unions. Children's rights were {{cited as the}} main reason for the Court's decision. The ruling set a constitutional precedent, meaning all bans in Mexico forbidding {{same-sex couples}} from adopting are unconstitutional and discriminatory. On 23 September 2016, the Mexican Supreme Court finalized the ruling in the <b>adoption</b> <b>case</b> against Campeche and issued a nationwide jurisprudence which binds all lower court judges to rule in favor of same-sex couples seeking adoption and parental rights.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} courts in <b>adoption</b> <b>cases</b> have {{resolved}} interstate jurisdictional disputes using the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA). This Article contends that the UCCJA was never intended to be applied in <b>adoption</b> <b>cases,</b> but rather was crafted specifically to meet the very different requirements of child custody disputes following the dissolution of a marriage. Specifically, the UCCJA is designed for situations in which custody determinations are not final judgments and so can be modified to meet changed circumstances. Adoption orders, by contrast, are final judgments, and as such are entitled to full faith and credit in the courts ofother states. This Article argues that the proper model for dealing with interstate jurisdictional issues in <b>adoption</b> <b>cases</b> is the Uniform Adoption Act (UAA), which is carefully designed for this purpose. The Article urges state legislatures to enact the UAA, with suggested modifications. Further, the Article urges state courts to begin using the Full Faith and Credit Clause to resolve interstate adoption problems, rather than waiting for legislative action. By continuing to apply the UCCJA in <b>adoption</b> <b>cases,</b> the Article argues, courts risk damage both to the parties in those cases and to the underlying substantive law...|$|R

(This came after Tăriceanu refused several telephone calls from Băsescu, and the entire affair formed {{part of a larger}} power struggle between the two.) The first referred to a 1987 case where she drew up an indictment and an innocent person was held under arrest for eighteen days as a result - this individual had the same name as the one being sought by the authorities (wanted for wheat theft), but upon realising this, Clinci altered his arrest warrant to match the other man's information rather than reveal the mistake. In a 1991 case (following the 1989 fall of the Communist regime), she represented a foreign citizen in an <b>adoption</b> <b>case,</b> despite her status as prosecutor, and then claimed not to know that the law forbade this; she left her position a month later. Nicolai in turn produced a document indicating the individual in the 1987 case did not spend any time in prison (and calling Băsescu's version of events an [...] "insolent lie"), and said she appeared in the <b>adoption</b> <b>case</b> as a private individual, not a prosecutor, and did not violate the law. Nicolai further opined that the document release was reminiscent of the methods of the Securitate secret police; the PNL's UDMR government partners also weighed in on the prime minister's side, as did the opposition PSD.
