5|$|After {{transitioning}} {{away from}} being a cover band, the group quickly gained popularity in the Puerto Rican reggae scene. Cultura Profética began performing in major reggae festivals and opening for Jamaican reggae musician Don Carlos. The band's first album, Canción de Alerta (1998), was recorded in the Tuff Gong studios at Jamaica with Errol Brown, frontman of Hot Chocolate and Bob Marley's sound engineer. The group was the first Spanish-language act to record in Marley's studios. The record discusses a number of social issues in Puerto Rico, including the importance of <b>acknowledging</b> <b>the</b> island's African influence.|$|E
5|$|Although the State Arms {{were granted}} in 1969, {{municipal}} heraldry {{had already been}} using the black swan symbolism since 1926, when the coat of arms of Perth were granted with a black swan as a charge {{in the first quarter}} and black swan supporters. This was followed by Northam (1953, black swan crest) and Bunbury (1959, black swan crest). Following the grant of the State Arms, municipal arms continued this tradition: Fremantle (1971, charge), Gosnells (1978, charge), Melville (1981, supporters) and Subiaco (1984, crest). All of the municipal arms granted by the Crown have included a representation of a black swan, presumably <b>acknowledging</b> <b>the</b> allegiance of each municipality to the state.|$|E

He was eventually discharged from the NZEF in late May 1919. His services in the war were subsequently recognised with his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath.

Her husband, Baldwin, had been recently crowned emperor in Constantinople. He did homage to her, <b>acknowledging</b> <b>the</b> suzerainty of the Latin Emperors over Antioch. Marie tried to mediate a reconciliation between Bohemond and Leo of Cilicia, but she died in August.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} {{claimed that}} it had not anticipated that such a massive number would leave; it believed that perhaps 300,000 might choose to depart temporarily and that a large portion would return to Algeria. The administration had set aside funds for absorption of those it called repatriates to partly reimburse them for property losses. The administration avoided <b>acknowledging</b> <b>the</b> true numbers of refugees in order to avoid upsetting its Algeria policies. Consequently, few plans were made for their return, and, psychologically at least, many of the Pieds-Noirs were alienated from both Algeria and France.|$|E

It would be rewritten again following the September 11 attacks, with the purpose of <b>acknowledging</b> <b>the</b> series premise as battling terrorism.

The idea of using split screen, regularly used by the series, came from Nalluri after filming wrapped up for the episode, and was not inspired by the American television series 24.|$|E
5|$|Altman {{was then}} {{instructed}} to contact Newark Liberty International Airport, a directive he agreed to. However, {{he did not}} contact the tower at Newark. It later transpired that, in <b>acknowledging</b> <b>the</b> instruction to contact Newark, Altman had read back the wrong frequency (127.8MHz instead of 127.85), an error that the controller did not correct. Soon after, a controller at Newark who was concerned about aircraft in the Piper's path contacted the Teterboro controller and asked the him to attempt to re-establish contact. All attempts to contact Altman and change his aircraft's heading were unsuccessful. After the failure to contact Altman, a radar alert about a possible collision occurred in both the Newark and Teterboro towers. However, the two controllers did not remember seeing or hearing this alert.|$|E
5|$|As king, Matthias waged wars {{against the}} Czech mercenaries who {{dominated}} Upper Hungary (today parts of Slovakia and Northern Hungary) and against Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who claimed Hungary for himself. In this period, the Ottoman Empire conquered Serbia and Bosnia, terminating {{the zone of}} buffer states along the southern frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary. Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, <b>acknowledging</b> <b>the</b> Emperor's right to style himself King of Hungary. The Emperor returned the Holy Crown of Hungary with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon realized he could expect no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy.|$|E

This two-disc edition was also included in a box set titled World War II Collection, along with two documentaries produced by Spielberg, Price For Peace (about the Pacific War) and Shooting War (about war photographers, narrated by Tom Hanks). The film was released on Blu-ray Disc on April 26, 2010 in the UK and on May 4, 2010 in the US, as part of Paramount Home Video's premium Sapphire Series. However, only weeks after its release, Paramount issued a recall due to audio synchronization problems.

In March 2008, the head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Nicola Cabibbo, announced a plan to honour Galileo by erecting a statue of him inside the Vatican walls. In December of the same year, during events to mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo's earliest telescopic observations, Pope Benedict XVI praised his contributions to astronomy. A month later, however, the head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, Gianfranco Ravasi, revealed that the plan to erect a statue of Galileo in the grounds of the Vatican had been suspended.|$|E

Rudy and Fran move on, barely <b>acknowledging</b> <b>the</b> suicide. They check into an El Paso hotel used by criminals as a safe house because Rudy knows that the McCoys will be heading to the same place. When Doc and Carol check in at the hotel, they ask for food to be delivered, but the manager, Laughlin, says he is working alone and cannot leave the desk. Doc soon realizes that Laughlin sent his family away because something is about to happen. He urges Carol to dress quickly so they can escape. An armed Rudy comes to their door while Fran poses as a delivery girl who needs to be paid for the food. Peering from an adjacent doorway, Doc is surprised to see Rudy alive.
