40|$|Soiling {{characters}} of some fibers are studies through measuring the surface reflective indices of white plain-weaves made of such fibers {{as shown in}} Table I, before and after those fabrics are dipped in the artificial soiling baths which are prepared with carbon-black suspended in carbon-tetrachloride or in the water. The findings are summarized as follows : 1) Generally speaking, spun yarn fabrics are more easily soiled than filament yarn fabrics, especially between those made of chemically homogeneous fibers. Fibers with no curl and those with smooth surface are difficult to be soiled, whereas those with high absorption of water are easily soiled. Some kinds of fibers are found with various soiling characters according to the dispersing agents of the soiling baths; e. g. Amilan (Sample 12, Japanese Nylon- 6) is soiled rather easily when CCl_ 4 is used but is most difficult with H_ 2 O, whereas Vinylon (Sample 11, PVA formal fiber) shows exactly opposite tendency. While in both cases wool (sample 4) is most easy and <b>acetate</b> <b>filament</b> fabric (sample 9) is most difficult to be soiled. 2) Soiling bath with CCl_ 4 as disper sing agent for carbon-black shows stronger soiling quality against fibers than that with H_ 2 O, though this quality is not yet definite {{because of the lack}} of oily materials in the latter case. Extension of dipping time and increase in carbon-black concentration in the soiling bath cause increase in soiling but not proportionally towards certain equilibrium, and this tendency is clear when fabrics are shortly washed in the same dispersing agent after each dipping. The more times samples are tested in the same soiling bath, the higher becomes the concentration of soiling baths, though this tendency shows minimum value at certain range of initial concentration...|$|E

The presence of transversely oriented bundles of intermediate filaments at the level of Z band was reported in a number of ultrastructural studies of cardiac muscle (1, 4). In our immunoelectron microscopic study of chicken cardiac muscle (14), however, the major subunit of the filament, desmin, was localized not only at the level of Z band, but additionally along the length of sarcomere in the interfibrillar spaces wher...|$|R
50|$|On 12 December 1912 Henri and Camille Dreyfus, {{funded by}} the {{entrepreneur}} Alexander Clavel-Respinger, set up a factory in Basel, Cellonit Gesellschaft Dreyfus & Co., to produce fireproof celluloid from cellulose acetate. The Cellonit company, founded in 1913, was innovative in developing new materials.The Dreyfus brothers produced the first <b>acetate</b> continuous <b>filament</b> yarn in 1913.However, most of the production went in film for motion pictures or toiletry items.The Paris-based Path√© cinema equipment manufacturer became a major customer.The company also made lacquers that were used for German Zeppelins and airplanes.Demand for acetate lacquers grew steadily as the aircraft industry expanded.|$|R
40|$|An anaerobic, H 2 -utilizing bacterium, strain RD- 1, was {{isolated}} from the highest growth-positive dilution series of a root homogenate prepared from the sea grass Halodule wrightii. Cells of RD- 1 were gram-positive, spore-forming, motile rods that were linked by connecting <b>filaments.</b> <b>Acetate</b> was produced in stoichiometries indicative of an acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) pathway-dependent metabolism when RD- 1 utilized H 2 -CO 2, formate, lactate, or pyruvate. Growth on sugars or ethylene glycol yielded acetate and ethanol as end products. RD- 1 grew {{at the expense of}} glucose in the presence of low initial concentrations (up to 6 % [vol/vol]) of O 2 in the headspace of static, horizontally incubated culture tubes; the concentration of O 2 decreased during growth in such cultures. Peroxidase, NADH oxidase, and superoxide dismutase activities were detected in the cytoplasmic fraction of cells grown in the presence of O 2. In comparison to cultures incubated under strictly anoxic conditions, acetate production decreased, higher amounts of ethanol were produced, and lactate and H 2 became significant end products when RD- 1 was grown on glucose in the presence of O 2. Similarly, when RD- 1 was grown on fructose in the presence of elevated salt concentrations, lower amounts of acetate and higher amounts of ethanol and H 2 were produced. When the concentration of O 2 in the headspace exceeded 1 % (vol/vol), supplemental H 2 was not utilized. The 16 S rRNA gene of RD- 1 had a 99. 7 % sequence similarity to that of Clostridium glycolicum DSM 1288 T, an organism characterized as a fermentative anaerobe. Comparative experiments with C. glycolicum DSM 1288 T demonstrated that it had negligible H 2 - and formate-utilizing capacities. However, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase was detected in both RD- 1 and C. glycolicum DSM 1288 T. A 91. 4 % DNA-DNA hybridization between the genomic DNA of RD- 1 and that of C. glycolicum DSM 1288 T confirmed that RD- 1 was a strain of C. glycolicum. These results indicate that (i) RD- 1 metabolizes certain substrates via the acetyl-CoA pathway, (ii) RD- 1 can tolerate and consume limited amounts of O 2, (iii) oxic conditions favor the production of ethanol, lactate, and H 2 by RD- 1, and (iv) the ability of RD- 1 to cope with limited amounts of O 2 might contribute to its survival in a habitat subject to daily gradients of photosynthesis-derived O 2...|$|R
