500|$|In November 1943, Kesselring {{met with}} Hitler. Kesselring gave an optimistic {{assessment}} {{of the situation in}} Italy and gave reassurances that he could hold the Allies south of Rome on the Winter Line. Kesselring further promised that he could prevent the Allies reaching the Northern Apennines for at least six months. As a result, on 6 November 1943, Hitler ordered Rommel and his Army Group B headquarters to move to France to take charge of the Atlantic Wall and prepare for the Allied attack that was expected there in the spring of 1944. On 21 November 1943, Kesselring resumed command of all German forces in Italy, combining Commander-in-Chief South, a joint command, with that of Army Group C, a ground command. [...] "I had always blamed Kesselring", Hitler later explained, [...] "for looking at things too optimistically ... events have proved Rommel wrong, and I have been justified in my decision to leave Field Marshal Kesselring there, whom I have seen as an incredible political idealist, but also as a military optimist, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> opinion that military leadership without optimism is not possible." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1813 the United States was at {{war with}} Great Britain, and Baltimore was {{preparing}} for an eventual attack as the fleet of the British Royal Navy had complete maritime control of the Chesapeake Bay. [...] Major George Armistead, the U.S. Army commander of the Infantry and Artillery units that defended Fort McHenry in Baltimore, felt that the fort was prepared for an attack, except it lacked a flag. [...] In {{a letter to the}} head of the Maryland Militia and military commander for Baltimore, Major General Samuel Smith, he wrote, [...] "We, sir, are ready at Fort McHenry to defend Baltimore against invading by the enemy. [...] That is to say, we are ready except that we have no suitable ensign to display over the Star Fort <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> desire to have a flag so large that the British will have no difficulty seeing it from a distance." [...] A delegation consisting of Armistead, Smith, Brig. General John Stricker, and Commodore Joshua Barney, Pickersgill's brother-in-law, visited with Pickersgill, and discussed the particulars of the desired flag. [...] They commissioned Pickersgill to make two flags, [...] "one American ensign, 30 X 42 feet, first quality bunting" [...] and another flag 17 by 25 feet." [...] A task as large as the making of these flags was beyond the capability of one person to complete, and Pickersgill not only drew on members of her own household for help, but also contracted labor from the immediate neighborhood. In early summer 1813, she began the job with the assistance of her daughter, Caroline, her two nieces, Eliza Young and Margaret Young, a free African American apprentice, Grace Wisher, and likely her elderly mother, Rebecca Young. [...] An additional unnamed African American who boarded in the house is also listed as helping in some sources, as were additional local seamstresses who were hired during the summer. Often working late into the evening, until midnight at times, Pickersgill's team was able to complete the job in six weeks. [...] Pickersgill's daughter, in an 1876 letter to Georgiana Armistead Appleton, the daughter of Major Armistead (later breveted a lieutenant colonel), wrote these particulars about the flag: ...|$|E

In 1891 Derby County tried to recruit two of Royal Arsenal's players after an FA Cup match between the clubs; Humble and Danskin realised that the club {{would be unable to}} survive if its players were being continually tempted away. Therefore, at the club's 1891 AGM, Humble proposed the club turn professional; however with his socialist views, he baulked at turning the club into a limited liability company at the same time, declaring: [...] "The club [...] carried on by working men <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> ambition to see it carried on by them." ...|$|E
