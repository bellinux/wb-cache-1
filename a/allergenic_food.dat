ObjectiveWe {{sought to determine}} the feasibility of the early introduction of multiple <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods</b> to exclusively breast-fed infants from 3  months of age and the effect on breastfeeding performance. MethodsWe performed a randomized controlled trial. The early introduction group (EIG) continued breastfeeding with sequential introduction of 6 allergenic foods: cow's milk, peanut, hard-boiled hen's egg, sesame, whitefish (cod), and wheat; the standard introduction group followed the UK infant feeding recommendations of exclusive breastfeeding for around 6  months with no introduction of <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods</b> before 6  months of age. ResultsOne thousand three hundred three infants were enrolled. By 5  months of age, the median frequency of consumption of all 6 foods was 2 to 3 times per week for every food in the EIG and no consumption for every food in the standard introduction group (P < . 001 for every comparison). By 6  months of age, nonintroduction of the <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods</b> in the EIG was less than 5 % {{for each of the}} 6 foods.

40|$|Background: For most <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods,</b> {{insufficient}} {{threshold dose}} information within the population restricts the advice on levels of unintended <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods</b> which should trigger precautionary labeling on prepackaged foods. Objective: We wanted to derive threshold dose distributions for major <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods</b> and to elaborate the protein doses {{at which a}} proportion of the allergic population is likely to respond. Methods: For 7 <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods</b> double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs) with a positive outcome for allergic reactions were selected from the clinical database of children routinely tested to diagnose food allergy at the University Medical Center Groningen. For each allergen 2 population threshold distributions were determined with the individual minimal eliciting dose and the preceding dose of each DBPCFC for objective symptoms and any symptom (either subjective or objective). Results: Individual positive DBPCFCs were available for peanut (n = 135), cow's milk (n = 93), hen's egg (n = 53), hazelnut (n = 28), and cashew nut (n = 31). Fewer children were challenged with soy (n = 10) or walnut (n = 13). Threshold dose distributions showed a good statistical and visual fit. The protein dose at which 5 % of the allergic population is likely to respond with objective reactions was 1. 6 mg for peanut, 1. 1 mg for cow's milk, 1. 5 mg for hen's egg, 7. 4 mg for cashew nut, and 0. 29 mg for hazelnut. Thresholds for any symptom were on average 2 to 6 times lower than for objective symptoms. The 95 % upper and lower confidence intervals of the threshold distributions were overlapping.

40|$|A {{workshop}} was organised {{to investigate}} whether risk assessment strategies and methodologies used in classical/conventional toxicology {{may be used for}} risk assessment of <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods,</b> to discuss the advantages and limitations of different approaches and to determine the research needed to move the area forward. Three possible approaches to safety assessment and risk assessment for <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods</b> were presented and discussed: safety assessment using NOAEL/LOAEL and uncertainty factors, safety assessment using Benchmark Dose and Margin of Exposure (MoE), and risk assessment using probabilistic models. The workshop concluded that all the three approaches to safety and risk assessment of <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods</b> should continue to be considered. A particular strength of the MoE and probabilistic approaches is that they do not rely on low-dose extrapolations with its inherent issues. Probabilistic modelling is considered to be the most promising approach for use in population risk assessment (which is a particular focus for risk managers).

A simulation study was performed to evaluate the effects of sample size and dosing schemes on the accuracy of the threshold distribution curve. The relationships between sample size, dosing scheme and the employed statistical distribution on the one hand and accuracy of estimation on the other hand were obtained. It showed that the largest relative gains in accuracy are obtained when sample size increases from N= 20 to N= 60. Moreover, it showed that the EuroPrevall dosing scheme is a useful start, but that it may need revision for a specific allergen as more data become available, because a proper allocation of the dosing steps is important.

Objective: To systematically review and meta-analyze evidence that timing of <b>allergenic</b> <b>food</b> introduction during infancy influences risk of allergic or autoimmune disease. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL and LILACS, searched between January 1946 and March 2016. Study Selection: Intervention trials and observational studies that evaluated timing of <b>allergenic</b> <b>food</b> introduction {{during the first year of}} life and reported allergic or autoimmune disease, or allergic sensitization were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted in duplicate and synthesized for meta-analysis using generic inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel methods with a random effects model. GRADE was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) : Wheeze, eczema, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, allergic sensitization, type 1 diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune thyroid disease and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Results: Of 16, 289 original titles screened, data were extracted from 204 titles reporting 146 studies. There was moderate certainty evidence from 5 trials (1915 participants) that early egg introduction was associated with reduced egg allergy (RR 0. 56 95 %CI 0. 36, 0. 87 I 2 = 36 %; P= 0. 009). Absolute risk reduction for a population with 5. 4 % incidence of egg allergy was 24 cases per 1000 population (95 % CI 7, 35). There was moderate certainty evidence from 2 trials (1550 participants) that early peanut introduction was associated with reduced peanut allergy (RR 0. 29 95 %CI 0. 11, 0. 74 I 2 56 = 66 %; P= 0. 009). Absolute risk reduction for a population with 2. 5 % incidence of peanut allergy was 18 cases per 1000 population (95 % CI 6, 22). Certainty of evidence was downgraded due to imprecision of effect estimates and indirectness of the populations and interventions studied. Timing of egg or peanut introduction was not associated with risk of allergy to other foods. There was low to very low certainty evidence that early fish introduction was associated with reduced allergic sensitization and rhinitis. There was high certainty evidence that timing of gluten introduction was not associated with celiac disease risk, and timing of <b>allergenic</b> <b>food</b> introduction was not associated with other outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review, early egg or peanut {{introduction to}} the infant diet was associated with lower risk of developing egg or peanut allergy.

40|$|Importance Timing of {{introduction}} of allergenic foods to the infant diet {{may influence the}} risk of allergic or autoimmune disease, but the evidence for {{this has not been}} comprehensively synthesized. Objective To systematically review and meta-analyze evidence that timing of <b>allergenic</b> <b>food</b> introduction during infancy influences risk of allergic or autoimmune disease. Data Sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and LILACS databases were searched between January 1946 and March 2016. Study Selection Intervention trials and observational studies that evaluated timing of <b>allergenic</b> <b>food</b> introduction {{during the first year of}} life and reported allergic or autoimmune disease or allergic sensitization were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis Data were extracted in duplicate and synthesized for meta-analysis using generic inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel methods with a random-effects model. GRADE was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Main Outcomes and Measures Wheeze, eczema, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, allergic sensitization, type 1 diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Results Of 16   289 original titles screened, data were extracted from 204 titles reporting 146 studies. There was moderate-certainty evidence from 5 trials (1915 participants) that early egg introduction at 4 to 6 months was associated with reduced egg allergy (risk ratio [RR], 0. 56; 95...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although corn {{is often}} cited as an <b>allergenic</b> <b>food,</b> very {{few studies have been}} devoted to the {{identification}} of corn allergens and corn allergy has been rarely confirmed by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Recently, Pastorello et al. (1) identified some salt-soluble IgEbinding proteins of corn flour as potential allergens. One of these, corresponding to corn Lipid Transfer Protein (LTP), appeared to be the major one. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the clinical significance of the skin prick test (SPT) and CAP-FEIA CAP-System IgE fluozoenzyme immunosorbent assay (Pharmacia Diagnostic, Uppsala, Sweden) positivities to corn and to identify the presence of IgE-binding proteins in the corn flour salt-insoluble protein fractions (comprising up to 96...|$|E
40|$|Allergic {{diseases}} {{are a major}} public health problem. It is essential to develop prevention strategies applied to it. A number of risk factors have been identified, but some are still under contradictory. Changing the dietary pattern of the at-risk infant may prevent food allergy. Evidence suggests that exclusive breast-feeding for the first 4 -months seems to protect against atopic dermatitis in infants and early childhood wheezing. Breast-feeding should be encouraged for all infants because of all its well known benefits. Hydrolyzed formulas cannot substitute breast milk on the prevention of allergic diseases. Extensively hydrolysed formulas should be encouraged {{as a supplement to}} breast milk in high-risk infants whenever necessary. Partially hydrolysed formulas may be a reasonable substitute, but more studies are necessary. There is no evidence that avoiding <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods</b> during pregnancy will reduce the incidence of allergenic diseases in child. Avoidance food and aeroallergen seems effective in reducing early childhood wheeze, atopic dermatitis and asthma. Maternal avoidance of <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods</b> during lactation should only be undertaken under medical supervision by highly motivated mothers with a high risk of allergy in the offspring.

40|$|Background Soybean and peanut, {{members of}} the Legume family, are {{recognized}} as common <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods</b> by the FAO Codex Alimentarius. EU directive 2003 / 89 /EC and US Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act prescribe labelling of food products for these two major <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods.</b> EU directive 2007 / 68 /EC requires labelling for lupin, {{another member of the}} Legume family. The reported prevalence and severity of allergic reactions to soybeans is lower than peanut and most other major <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods.</b> For lupin only limited clinical data are available. Our previous work with peanut has used clinical results from double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) to estimate a population threshold. Further exploration of soy and lupin thresholds would benefit all stakeholders. Methods Publications were screened for DBPCFCs providing lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) and/or no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for soy- or lupin-allergic individuals. Unpublished data were retrieved from diagnostic DBPCFCs from the UMCU outpatient population. LOAELs were based upon elicitation of objective symptoms. All doses were converted to mg protein to standardize challenge materials across studies. Individual thresholds were analyzed using Interval-Censoring Survival Analysis and fitted to parametric models (Log-Normal, Log-Logistic, and Weibul) using LIFEREG procedure (SAS v 9. 2). The eliciting dose predicted to provoke reactions in a proportion of the allergic population(EDp) was estimated and compared to the known peanut-allergic population. Results Public literature revealed clinical thresholds of 43 soy-allergic individuals in 4 studies and 9 lupin-allergic individuals in 3 studies. An additional 15 unpublished lupin DBPCFC were retrieved. Comparison of the ED doses indicate that soy and lupin are less potent <b>allergenic</b> <b>foods</b> than peanut. Using the Log-Normal distributions, the ED 05 for peanut is 1. 3 mg peanut protein while the ED 05 for lupin is 19. 1 mg lupin protein and soybean is 24. 5 mg soy protein. However, the lowest eliciting dose observed for each group of allergic individuals is 36 mg lupin protein and 88 mg soy protein, considerably higher than the predicted ED 05. Conclusion The eliciting dose for allergic reactions of three {{members of the}} Legume family showed a different potency for peanut, lupin, and soybean. Additional clinical data from soy and/or lupin challenges would be valuable to increase the statistical confidence in the population threshold estimates...|$|R
