5|$|Pritchard {{learned from}} local {{residents}} that about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half {{to the north}} there was a military camp. Not knowing whether this was Davis and his group or the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, he approached cautiously. He soon identified the camp as Davis's. At first dawn, Pritchard charged the camp, which was so surprised and overwhelmed that it offered no resistance and yielded immediately.|$|E

5|$|As sweet {{a little}} nook as ever Ulysses mooned away a day in, during his memorable voyage homeward. Though merely a small bay, {{about a mile}} in breadth, and curving inland for <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, it is quite {{sheltered}} from all winds save the east, being flanked {{to the south and}} west by Haskeval and Hondeval, and guarded on the northern side by a low range of heathery slopes. In this sunny time, the sheep are bleating from the shores, the yacht lies double, yacht and shadow, and the bay is painted richly with the clear reflection of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Both {{stations}} {{closed in}} the 1960s {{as part of the}} Beeching Axe. Shepton Mallet (High Street) closed with the withdrawal of passenger services on the Yatton to Witham line in 1963, though part of the former East Somerset line remains open for freight and as a heritage railway. Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road) closed in 1966 with the closure of the Somerset and Dorset line. Nowadays, the nearest Network Rail station is Castle Cary, some eight miles south of Shepton Mallet.

5|$|Stanton and Pike {{stopped to}} rest, and Reed {{returned}} alone to the group, arriving {{four days after}} the party's departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of Weber Canyon, or forge their own trail in the direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route. Their progress slowed to about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half (2.4km) a day, and all the able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave rocks {{to make room for the}} wagons.|$|E

5|$|The western {{terminus}} is at exit24 on I-96, {{one mile}} (1.6km) east of Marne. In Ottawa County, {{the road is}} called Ironwood Drive. Beginning at the Kent County border, the street is called Remembrance Road (in honor {{of those who died}} in battle). From its western terminus, the road angles southeast–northwest for about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half (2.4km). Then M-11 turns south on Wilson Avenue to run north–south through Walker. Wilson Avenue intersects M-45 (Lake Michigan Drive) in the Standale Business District. South of Lake Michigan Drive, the trunkline continues on Wilson Avenue through the edge of a rural area. The highway runs through forest land near Millennium Park until it crosses the Grand River at I-196.|$|E
5|$|From the Rutgers Street intersection, Route 7 {{continues}} along Washington Avenue {{for about}} <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half before reaching Nutley, still continuing on Washington Avenue into Nutley. At the intersection with County Route 646 (Park Avenue), Route 7 {{turns into a}} municipally maintained road and enters a more residential area. Upon intersecting County Route 606 (Kingsland Road), Route 7 crosses into Clifton, Passaic County and heads to the west on county-maintained Kingsland Street signed eastwest. Kingsland, carrying Route 7, crosses back into Nutley, regaining state maintenance. When Kingsand becomes County Route 644 at the intersection with Cathedral Avenue, Route 7 turns north from Kingsland onto Cathedral Avenue and comes to its terminus at Orange St in Nutley. However, signage continues to indicate Route 7 up to the terminus of Cathedral Avenue at interchange with Route 3 {{at the intersection of}} Cathedral Avenue, Passaic Avenue, and Ward Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 go unnamed as they proceed eastward. Roughly one mile from the county line in the hamlet of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 meet the {{southern}} terminus of NY65. Exiting the hamlet, US20 and NY5 head through another area dominated by open land, intersecting Elton Road before passing seamlessly into East Bloomfield. <b>A</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half from the town line, US20 and NY5 intersect NY64, a road running northwest–southeast from the Monroe County line south to US20 and NY5. NY64, whose right-of-way ends at US20 and NY5 {{at the foot of}} a small hill, joins the two routes eastward on a triple overlap, entering the village of Bloomfield and intersecting the southern terminus of NY444 south of the portion of Bloomfield once known as Holcomb. Near the junction with NY444, US20, NY5 and NY64 take on a due east alignment, absorbing the routing used by Gauss Road west of this point.|$|E

5|$|North of Romeo, the {{trunkline}} {{passes through}} agricultural areas of The Thumb {{region of the}} state. M-53 crosses into Lapeer County south of Almont. Further north, Van Dyke Road meets I-69 in Imlay City, running through the downtown area north of the Interstate; Imlay City is also {{the location of a}} crossing of the Canadian National Railway line that carries Amtrak's Blue Water service between Flint and Port Huron. In the unincorporated community of Burnside, M-53 intersects M-90. The two highways run concurrently for about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half (2.4km) before separating. M-53 continues northward and crosses into Sanilac County near Marlette. In that city, the highway crosses a branch line of the Huron and Eastern Railway (HESR) before continuing through downtown. From Marlette northward, M-53 runs parallel to, and about a mile east of, the Sanilac–Tuscola county line. The highway follows Van Dyke Road through rural farming country past intersections with M-46 and M-81 and across the Cass River before crossing into Huron County.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} {{plan was}} for the 29th Division to land at Cape Helles {{on the tip of}} the peninsula and then advance upon the forts at Kilitbahir. The Anzacs were to land north of Gaba Tepe on the Aegean coast from where they could advance across the peninsula and prevent retreat from or reinforcement of Kilitbahir. The Anzac assault force, the 3rd Brigade of the Australian 1st Division, began to go ashore shortly before dawn at 4:30 am on 25 April 1915. The intended landing zone was a broad front centred about a mile north of Gaba Tepe, however, possibly due to navigational error or an unexpected current, the landing went awry and the boats concentrated about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half further north than intended in a shallow, nameless cove between Ari Burnu to the north and Hell Spit to the south. Since 1985, the cove has been officially known as Anzac Koyu (Anzac Cove).|$|E
5|$|US10 {{enters the}} state after it crosses Lake Michigan from Manitowoc, Wisconsin, to Ludington. Traffic is carried {{across the lake}} {{during the summer months}} on the SS Badger, a privately owned carferry. Heading eastward from the ferry, the highway runs along Pere Marquette Lake and then northward through a light {{industrial}} area along James Street in Ludington. At the intersection with Ludington Avenue in the downtown business area, the trunkline turns to the east. US10 runs through commercial and residential areas on its course out of town. Near the Mason County Airport, the highway intersects the northern end of Business US31 (Bus. US31, Pere Marquette Highway). About <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half (2.4km) east of that intersection, US10 meets the interchange that marks the northern end of the US31 freeway in the state. From here to Scottville, the two highways run concurrently together through a mix of rural fields and forests. On the west side of town, US31 turns northward along the Scottville Bypass, and US10 continues through the middle of town on State Street. The road heads eastward roughly parallel to the Pere Marquette River. Near Custer, US10 crosses into the Manistee National Forest.|$|E

5|$|Major {{changes to}} the routing of M-47 started in December 1960 when the I-75/US10/US23 freeway opened between Saginaw and Bay City. US10 was rerouted east of Midland to Bay City along the M-20 freeway. M-47 was rerouted along the former US10 from Saginaw to east of Midland using a {{connector}} expressway from Freeland north to the US10 freeway. M-81 was extended over State Street in Saginaw, and the former routing of M-47 between Saginaw and Bay City was redesignated as M-84. M-13 also replaced the former US23/M-47 when US23 was moved to freeways as well. The southern end of M-47 was changed in 1962 with the completion of I-96 in the Lansing area. US16 was replaced by M-43, and the southern terminus of M-47 was moved to exit122 along I-96. This segment of M-47 south of M-46 became an extension of M-52 in 1969, truncating M-47 to Hemlock. The interchange at Salzburg Road north of Freeland opened in 1970, and the expressway segment was upgraded to a full freeway. At the same time, M-47 was truncated to its current routing, resulting in {{the elimination of the}} M-46/M-47 concurrency near Shields. In the end, only about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half (2.4km) of roadway still bears the M-47 from before the changes made starting in 1960, along a section of road that was not originally part of the highway in 1919.|$|E
