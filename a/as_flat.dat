5|$|The race began for {{the second}} year in {{succession}} with a team time trial on one of Italy's islands, in this case Sicily (in 2007 it had been Sardinia). The route contained only four stages that were officially deemed mountain stages, but several of the seven intermediate stages contained selective climbs. The Giro had four time trials, three of which were individual and one a team event. Six stages were classified <b>as</b> <b>flat.</b>|$|E
5|$|The section between London and Woodstock {{generally}} {{parallels the}} former Highway2 but {{lies on the}} south side of the Thames River. This area is not <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> but the highway is generally straight. This part of Highway401 often experiences heavy snowsqualls in early winter, sometimes extending as far east as Toronto. To the south of Woodstock, Highway401 curves northeast and encounters the western terminus of Highway403. The highway heads towards Kitchener and Cambridge, where it encounters Highway8 and returns to its eastward orientation.|$|E
50|$|In 1797 {{the manor}} house was {{destroyed}} by fire, leaving only the stable block, which survives today <b>as</b> <b>flats,</b> and the coach house, which was converted into homes.

5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders received points for finishing {{among the highest}} placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points system was also changed. A stage win was worth 50 points instead of 45, second place awarded 30 instead of 35 and third 20 instead of 30. The sprint points rule change aimed to make a stage win more valuable. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The new system was in effect only on the Tour's six stages classified <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> (stages 2, 5, 6, 7, 15 and 21). On seven stages (the cobble stage and six hillier stages, namely stages 3, 4, 8, 10, 13, 14 and 16) the rider who won received 30 points, 25 for the second rider, and so on. For the mountain stages (stages 11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20) and the individual time trial (stage 1), the winner received 20 points. No points were awarded for the team time trial on stage nine. The leader was identified by a green jersey.|$|E

25|$|The {{materials}} used determine the substrate's dielectric constant. This constant is also dependent on frequency, usually decreasing with frequency. As this constant determines the signal propagation speed, frequency dependence introduces phase distortion in wideband applications; <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> dielectric constant vs frequency characteristics as achievable is important here. The impedance of transmission lines decreases with frequency, therefore faster edges of signals reflect more than slower ones.|$|E
25|$|The medieval Indian texts {{called the}} Puranas {{describe}} {{the earth as}} a flat-bottomed, circular disk with concentric oceans and continents. This general scheme is present {{not only in the}} Hindu cosmologies but also in Buddhist and Jain cosmologies of South Asia. However, some Puranas include other models. For example, the fifth canto of the Bhagavata Purana, includes sections that describe the earth both <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> and spherical.|$|E
25|$|Exact {{solutions}} for the EFE can only be found under simplifying assumptions such as symmetry. Special classes of exact solutions are most often studied as they model many gravitational phenomena, such as rotating black holes and the expanding universe. Further simplification is achieved in approximating the actual spacetime <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> spacetime with a small deviation, leading to the linearized EFE. These equations are used to study phenomena such as gravitational waves.|$|E

25|$|The bird skin {{collection}} contains approximately 20,500 specimens representing at least 2,300 species. These are mostly study skins, {{but in recent}} years the division has prepared a large proportion of new specimens <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> skins or spread wings with associated skeletons. In 1992, the division also received a collection of approximately 3,000 skins. The skin collection has grown by 23% in the last five years. Also wide-ranging taxonomically, it represents 27 orders, 129 families, and 850 genera. Rarities include skins of ivory-billed woodpeckers and extinct dusky seaside sparrows, passenger pigeons, and Carolina parakeets.|$|E
25|$|Unlike its predecessors, {{which used}} an engine based on 2D {{isometric}} graphics and sprites, SimCity 4 primarily uses a 3D engine to render its graphics. The landscape and moving props such as vehicles are modeled as fully polygonal and rotatable 3D objects. Small buildings and props are drawn <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> images, which are pasted onto billboards; polygons with their surface normal facing into the camera. Larger buildings are modeled using a hybrid approach; a simple polygonal model defines {{the shape of}} the building, then textures are added to create detail such as doors, windows and rooftop clutter.|$|E
25|$|Brunswick {{itself is}} {{relatively}} flat and {{is ideal for}} cycling. Brunswick East is bounded by the Merri Creek Trail, and Brunswick West by the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail, though neither of these can be described <b>as</b> <b>flat.</b> The Upfield Bike Path follows the Upfield railway line from Fawkner, through Coburg and Brunswick, joining the Capital City Trail at Park Street. Streets in Brunswick vary, from too narrow for two cars to pass, to reasonably wide. Not all of the wider streets have cycle lanes, though even riding in lanes in the narrower street often means riding close to parked cars, presenting a significant hazard to cyclists from opening car doors.|$|E

25|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} {{is formed}} in flat sheets {{in a variety}} of thicknesses and colors. <b>As</b> <b>flat</b> sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and minimal extra cost (see Closed-cell PVC foamboard). Sheets are cut using saws and rotary cutting equipment. Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, adhesive-backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a computer-controlled plotter (see Vinyl cutter) or printed in a wide-format printer. These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of commercial signage products, including car body stripes and stickers.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays, in {{all forms}} of digital X-ray imaging (radiography, fluoroscopy, and CT) the {{conversion}} of X-ray energy into visible light {{can be achieved by}} the same types of electronic sensors, such <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> panel detectors, which convert the X-ray energy into electrical signals, small bursts of current that convey information that a computer can analyze, store, and output as images. As fluorescence is a special case of luminescence, digital X-ray imaging is conceptually similar to digital gamma ray imaging (scintigraphy, SPECT, and PET) in that in both of these imaging mode families, the information conveyed by the variable attenuation of invisible electromagnetic radiation as it passes through tissues with various radiodensities is converted by an electronic sensor into an electric signal that is processed by a computer and made output as a visible-light image.|$|E
25|$|Steinbach {{is located}} on {{the eastern edge of the}} Canadian Prairies, and is also located {{directly}} east of the Red River Valley. Because of this the topography around Steinbach is extremely flat and the soil very fertile. Due to higher levels of precipitation received than in the areas of western Manitoba, the natural prairie of Steinbach is defined as tallgrass prairie. Some of this original prairie can still be viewed at the Manitoba Tall Grass Prairie Preserve south of the city near Vita. The areas to the west and north of Steinbach are defined <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> tallgrass prairie, and part of the Lake Manitoba Plain. The areas south and west of the city progress steadily into treed Aspen segments, and eventually growing into Sandilands Provincial Forest and the large boreal forest region extending east and north of the city.|$|E
