25|$|The 1973 Toronado {{went on sale}} in September 1972 and has a {{combined}} fuel economy of between 8.5 and 10.9 miles per gallon. The 1975 through 1978 Toronados had a fuel tank that could hold 26 gallons of gasoline, whereas the 1973 Toronado had a 25.9 gallon capacity fuel tank with 250 horsepower and an <b>axle</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2.73:1.|$|E
25|$|Engine options {{remained}} the unchanged for 1976, however fuel economy was improved on all engines with {{revisions to the}} engine spark advance and the EGR valve operation. The 351-2V engines and the 400-2V had a power and torque increase, and the 460-4V had a power decrease. In an attempt to help improve fuel economy, the standard rear <b>axle</b> <b>ratio</b> for all models was now 2.75:1.|$|E
25|$|A Competition Group (Comp-G) {{package was}} {{available}} for the GTP that included red painted brake calipers (same brakes as the 'standard' GTP), sport tuned suspension, heads-up display (also in GT2 model), 4-speed automatic transmission with paddle-style TAPShift, StabiliTrak dynamic control system, 3.29 <b>axle</b> <b>ratio,</b> performance tires and Magnasteer II. Also, a 10-spoke light weight wheel was standard with the Comp-G package but could be 'upgraded' to the GTP optional wheel.|$|E
50|$|The Ram 3500 {{has three}} <b>axle</b> <b>ratios</b> (3.42, 3.73 and 4.10) and 17-inch wheels. Ram 4500/5500 has three <b>axle</b> <b>ratios</b> (4.10, 4.44 and 4.88) and 19.5-inch wheels. The 4500/5500 Rams rear axle is a Dana S 110. The front axle on 4x4 models is {{manufactured}} by Magna, while 2-wheel-drive models {{just have a}} solid, non-drive axle.|$|R
50|$|Rear-wheel {{drive or}} all-wheel drive have {{conventional}} open-type differentials {{with a choice}} of <b>axle</b> <b>ratios.</b> Traction control systems, both mechanical and electronic, are optional.|$|R
2500|$|All Rambler Rebels {{benefitted from}} bigger brakes, {{improved}} automatic transmission controls, and numerically lower <b>axle</b> <b>ratios</b> for improved fuel economy. A new option was adjustable headrests. The 1959 Rebel {{came with a}} 4-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts rated at [...] with [...] of torque.|$|R
25|$|External {{improvements}} {{include an}} optional SVT Performance Package, which includes Goodyear EagleF1 SuperCar G: 2 tires, all-new lightweight 19-inch forged-aluminum wheels {{in front and}} 20-inch forged-aluminum wheels at the rear, a 3.73 rear <b>axle</b> <b>ratio,</b> and performance tuned front and rear shocks along with stiffer springs.

Optional is a glass top roof, previously available, starting in 2009, with the Mustang GT.|$|E
25|$|The {{big-block}} 455 {{was gone}} forever. The base engine {{was now the}} Buick 350 with a 4-barrel carburetor until 1979. The Oldsmobile 403 was optional from 1977 to 1979. Oldsmobile's 350 diesel {{was added to the}} option list beginning in 1980, along with an Oldsmobile-sourced 307. The Buick 350 was now optional, with the base engine being the Buick 4.1 L V6 for improved fuel economy. In 1981, the then-optional Buick 350 was dropped. That same year, the Electra gained the new THM200-4R automatic transmission, which featured a lock-up torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With the new transmission, the Electra could be equipped with a numerically higher rear <b>axle</b> <b>ratio</b> for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range.|$|E
25|$|At the 2015 North American International Auto Show a more refined, {{hardcore}} {{and limited}} production {{version of the}} GT350 was unveiled called the GT350R, it still has the GT350's 5.2-liter flat-plane crank V8, making a rated 526hp and 429lb.-ft. of torque, but items like the air conditioning, the stereo, the trunk floorboard, all the carpeting, the rear seats, and the backup camera have been removed. The GT350R is also equipped with carbon-fiber wheels that each weigh approximately 15 pounds less than the aluminum wheels on the GT350. Overall, the GT350R is 130lbs. lighter than the GT350. A larger splitter and rear wing help improve downforce, with the wing drawing the car's weight balance more rearwards. A Torsen limited-slip differential with a 3:73 <b>axle</b> <b>ratio</b> helps handling further. Serial #001 was sold at the 2015 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale Auction for $1,000,000 with the proceeds to benefit the JDRF.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{discontinuation}} of the SLC in September 1981, the 107 series continued initially as the 280, 380 and 500 SL. At this time, the V8 engines were re-tuned {{for greater}} efficiency, lost a few hp and consumed less fuel- this {{largely due to}} substantially higher (numerically lower) <b>axle</b> <b>ratios</b> that went from 3.27:1 to 2.47:1 for the 380 SL and from 2.72:1 to 2.27:1 for the 500 SL.|$|R
50|$|The FE line is {{available}} in two frame heights for general transport distribution duty or one light construction transport duty. The suspension {{is available}} either on full air or combination of front parabolic leaf spring and rear air bags or rear S parabolic springs.Wide selection of rear <b>axle</b> <b>ratios</b> in both single and hub reduction are on offer with differential locks as standard in 4x2,6x2 and 6x4 configuration.|$|R
25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 <b>axle</b> <b>ratio</b> became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|E

2500|$|Many buyers {{selected}} the [...] "Go Package", available with the 360 and 390 four-barrel V8 engines. [...] This package as in prior years included front disc brakes, a dual exhaust system, heavy-duty suspension with anti-sway bar, improved cooling, 3.54 rear <b>axle</b> <b>ratio,</b> and wide Goodyear white-lettered performance tires on styled road wheels.|$|E
50|$|The 1921 G.P. chassis proved {{versatile}} and their appearance were modified by S.T.D. Works {{to suit the}} many events they were entered in with different colour and different radiator badges (Sunbeam, Talbot or Talbot Darracq) in an early attempt at badge engineering. Engine types (3-litre and 4.9-litre), break system, body configurations, fuel tanks and <b>axle</b> <b>ratios</b> were also changed from one event to another making the essentially identical cars appear potentially different.|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of the Ant used Reliant's 700cc engine with 29 hp but in 1972 engine capacity was increased to 748 cc with claimed output of 32 bhp (23.5 kW). Performance benefitted. By this time Greek partner MEBEA was building the vehicles under license. After 1975 reliant fitted their all new 850cc engine with 45 hp, this was made to attain 50 mph and get a claimed 60mpg. Ants had very low gear <b>axle</b> <b>ratios</b> for pulling weight and attaining low speeds (40 to 50 mph).|$|R
50|$|The 350 {{cubic inch}} 5.7-litre 255 {{horsepower}} (L31) V8 {{was the only}} engine offered. RPO ZM9 was standard which included Bilstein 46mm shock absorbers and 3.73 front and rear <b>axle</b> <b>ratios</b> {{as well as a}} locking rear differential. Separate coolers for the transmission and engine oil were also standard. The Denali upgrade also included GM's automatic transfer case which allowed for push button transitions from 2-wheel high to 4-wheel high to 4 wheel low or fully automatic switching from 2 wheel drive to 4 wheel drive.|$|R
2500|$|The Stage 1 engine option used {{cylinder}} heads that, while using raw castings {{of the same}} pattern as {{all of the other}} Buick 455s sharing the same model year, were machined differently in order to accept larger valves (2.13" [...] intake and 1.755" [...] exhaust), and to produce smaller compression chambers for increased static compression ratio. The option also included a more aggressive camshaft, a specially tuned 4-barrel Quadrajet carburetor, more aggressive ignition timing,5/8inch oil pickup tube and a higher numerical final drive, and was available with either Turbo-Hydramatic 400 3-speed automatic transmission, or a Muncie M-22 4-speed manual transmission (although it was later discovered, and confirmed, that one 1970 GS Stage 1 convertible was produced with a 3-speed manual and a standard 3.64:1 Positraction <b>axle</b> <b>ratio).</b> Stage 1 cars equipped with air conditioning received a 3.42 <b>axle</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
2500|$|With the new lighter {{weight and}} smaller engines, Chevrolet promised {{increase}} fuel economy without great loss of performance compared to 1976 models. The EPA estimates for 1977 Chevrolet was [...] city and [...] highway for six-cylinder models. Ford's 1977 LTD was rated at [...] city and [...] highway with its smallest engine, the [...] V8. By the same EPA estimates, Plymouth's Gran Fury returned 13 MPG city and 18 MPG highway with the 318 V8. Performance was good when comparing the smaller 1977 Caprice to the 1976 Caprice. A 1976 350 two-bbl powered Chevrolet ran 0–60 in 12.9seconds, while a 400 powered model ran 10.7 seconds. 1977 models ran 11.4seconds to [...] with the 305 engine and 10.8 seconds with the 350 engine. Car and Driver tested a 1977 Chevrolet Impala with the 350 engine and 3.08:1 axle running a 9.6second 0–60 time and obtaining a [...] top speed. The 350 was available with a 2.56:1 <b>axle</b> <b>ratio</b> and a 3.08 <b>axle</b> <b>ratio</b> {{which may explain}} the difference in performance times.|$|E
2500|$|... 2012 Limited Edition Super Snake {{comes with}} a {{standard}} power of over 750 HP and 590ft./lbs. of torque out of its 5.4-liter supercharged V8 engine. [...] The power can be taken up to a venom-spitting 800 horsepower with the optional upgrade. Helping the engine along is a six-speed manual transmission with 3.73:1 rear <b>axle</b> <b>ratio</b> and short-throw shifter.

25|$|Technical {{changes for}} 1975 {{included}} {{the addition of}} a catalytic converter and electronic ignition to not only meet the stringent 1975 and later emission requirements, but also extended routine maintenance intervals, and improved fuel economy and driveability which was a must in the era immediately following the 1973–74 energy crisis, but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems and mandated the use of unleaded gasoline as the converter could be rendered useless if contaminated with lead. <b>Axle</b> <b>ratios</b> were also numerically lowered to aid in improving gas mileage. The 455 four-barrel V8, now rated at , was retained as the standard and only available engine.|$|R
2500|$|... 1978 models had minor {{front and}} rear styling revisions. The engine line-up {{remained}} unchanged, but numerically lower <b>axle</b> <b>ratios</b> were used {{in an attempt to}} boost fuel economy. The 305 and 350 engines went from a standard 2.56:1 axle in 1977 (2.73:1 for wagons), to a 2.41:1 axle in 1978 (2.56:1 for wagons). An optional 3.08 axle was also available for 350 powered Caprices. The 305 V8 engine received an aluminum intake manifold which reduced engine weight by 35pounds. A larger brake booster was also added to help reduce braking effort. New options included a steel sliding moonroof and 40-channel CB radio built into the AM/FM radio.|$|R
2500|$|For 1989, the 9C1 Caprice {{received}} some major {{changes to the}} drivetrain. All engines were now equipped with throttle-body fuel-injection (shared with the truck/van lineup {{and based on the}} LB4 4.3L TBI injection system first used with the 1985 model year passenger cars), and the [...] engine was now added to the option list. The available engines were now the [...] V6, the [...] and [...] V8s. The V6 and 350 engines were equipped with TH700-R4 transmissions while the 305 engine used the TH200-4R transmission. The V6 and the 305 used a 3.08:1 <b>axle</b> <b>ratio,</b> while the 350-powered cars now used a 3.42:1 <b>axle</b> <b>ratio.</b> The 4.3L remained at , while the 305 TBI engine was rated at , and the 350 TBI engine was rated at [...] The 350 powered Caprice did well again at Michigan State Police tests for pursuit rated cars. It had the fastest 0–100mph, the fastest road course time, the highest top speed and the best fuel economy. The Dodge Diplomat and Ford LTD Crown Victoria outbraked the Caprice, and the Plymouth Fury and Dodge Diplomat had better ergonomics than the Caprice.|$|E
2500|$|... 1982 models {{saw only}} minor styling revisions. The model line-up was reduced by one, with the Caprice Landau coupe dropped. Remaining were the sedan, sport coupe, six-passenger wagon and the eight-passenger wagon. [...] A new four-speed {{automatic}} overdrive transmission with lock-up torque converter joined the powertrain line-up. This transmission helped boost highway fuel economy, while improving city performance with a 3.08:1 rear <b>axle</b> <b>ratio.</b> The overdrive transmission was only available with the 305cuin V8, {{and was a}} mandatory option for this engine.|$|E

50|$|The Mark II was {{available}} in 6 body styles: Van, Kombi, Chassis Cab, Parcel Van, Bus and Crewbus all available in short-wheelbase (2690 mm) and long-wheelbase (3000 mm) versions. A selection of 5 engines {{was available}}: 1.6-litre OHC Petrol, 1.6-litre OHV Petrol (Kent), 2.0-litre OHC Petrol, 2.0-litre OHC Petrol (Economy) and 2.5-litre Diesel. On top of this were 32 door combinations, 6 <b>axle</b> <b>ratios</b> and options for 12 - 17 interior seats. All of these were available in any combination when purchased with Ford's highly customizable custom plan. At the time this gave the business sector an unprecedented amount of flexibility, which was {{a major factor in}} the vehicles' ultimate success.|$|R
50|$|The TG was the {{standard}} 'touring' model, while the SD - {{powered by the}} 1496cc engine, now fitted with a large-port cylinder head - satisfied {{the needs of the}} sporting motorist. Also available in this year was the TH, which had the gearbox and rear <b>axle</b> <b>ratios</b> of the 'touring' TG, but the sub-1500cc engine of the SD. The TG and SD models were available until 1929. The TG and (very rare) TH models can be recognised by their taller radiators, with a noticeably deeper top section. Cars from the 1928 and 1929 model years also sported higher-set lamps, in accordance with the fashion of the time.|$|R
2500|$|The 389 engines {{received}} revised {{cylinder heads}} with re-cored intake passages and high rise intake manifolds, improving breathing. Rated power increased to [...] at 5,000rpm for the base four-barrel engine; the Tri-Power engine was now rated [...] at 5,200rpm. The 'S'-cammed Tri-Power engine had slightly less peak torque rating than the base engine [...] at 3,600rpm versus [...] at 3,200rpm. Transmission and <b>axle</b> <b>ratio</b> choices remained the same. The three-speed manual was standard, while two four-speed manual transmissions (wide or close ratio) or two-speed automatic were optional.|$|E
2500|$|Chrysler {{increased}} {{the displacement of}} its highest-performance small block V-8 engine from [...] to [...] for 1974. The 360 was rated at [...] {{and placed in the}} Duster 360. However, the 1974 Duster was nearly [...] heavier than the 1971 model on account of the heavier bumpers, side-impact door beams, emission control equipment, and added soundproofing. Even with performance options such as the four-speed manual transmission, Hurst shifter and Sure-Grip differential with 3.55:1 <b>axle</b> <b>ratio,</b> 0–60mph and quarter-mile times increased roughly two seconds compared to those for the 1970 Duster. Unfortunately, higher fuel prices and performance-car insurance surcharges deterred many buyers as the interest in high performance waned.|$|E
2500|$|The {{drivetrain}} {{consisted of}} one engine, the [...] straight-6-cylinder, {{in conjunction with}} a three-speed automatic transmission (a version of Chrysler's A998), with Dana 30 and Dana 35 differentials. All 1980 Eagles came standard with a permanent four-wheel-drive system that employed a New Process 119 transfer case that had a viscous fluid coupling that allowed the four-wheel-drive system to operate on wet or dry pavement without causing undue suspension and drivetrain wear. Optional trailer towing packages were available for handling trailers weighing up to [...] that included a weight distributing (equalizing) tow hitch, seven-connector wiring harness, wiring, auxiliary transmission oil cooler, 3.54 <b>axle</b> <b>ratio,</b> and required the optional heavy-duty battery and automatic load-leveling air shocks.|$|E
