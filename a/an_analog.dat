5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. <b>An</b> <b>analog</b> communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E
5|$|Fermi, {{learning}} of Ulam's breakthrough, devised <b>an</b> <b>analog</b> computer {{known as the}} Monte Carlo trolley, later dubbed the FERMIAC. The device performed a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons. As computers improved in speed and programmability, these methods became more useful. In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern massively parallel supercomputers are embarrassingly parallel applications, whose results can be very accurate.|$|E
5|$|Other more rare {{types of}} {{radioactive}} decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus, {{or more than}} one beta particle. <b>An</b> <b>analog</b> of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is internal conversion— a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission.|$|E

5|$|The Gaussian {{integers}} {{are complex}} {{numbers of the}} form α=u+vi, where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one. By defining <b>an</b> <b>analog</b> of the Euclidean algorithm, Gaussian integers can {{be shown to be}} uniquely factorizable, by the argument above. This unique factorization is helpful in many applications, such as deriving all Pythagorean triples or proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. In general, the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications, but not essential; for example, the theorems can often be proven by other arguments.|$|E
5|$|The T series, {{produced}} from 1968 to 1975, {{was the last}} of the tonewheel spinet organs. Unlike all the earlier Hammond organs, which used vacuum tubes for preamplification, amplification, percussion and chorus-vibrato control, the T series used all-solid-state, transistor circuitry, though, unlike the L-100, it did include the scanner-vibrato as seen on the B-3. Other than the T-100 series models, all other T-Series models included a built-in rotating Leslie speaker and some included <b>an</b> <b>analog</b> drum machine, while the T-500 also included a built-in cassette recorder. It {{was one of the last}} tonewheel Hammonds produced.|$|E

5|$|The {{configuration}} of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal ring current (not <b>an</b> <b>analog</b> of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through the equatorial plasma sheet. The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a centripetal force, which keeps the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90–160million amperes.|$|E
5|$|Videoball is {{a minimalist}} sports video game by Action Button Entertainment. Up to six human and {{computer-controlled}} players form two teams. Each uses <b>an</b> <b>analog</b> stick {{and a single}} button to control triangles that shoot charged projectiles at a ball and other players. The objective is to knock {{the ball into the}} opposing team's goal.

Videoball has a simple visual style with bright colors, basic shapes, and many customization options.|$|E
5|$|William Stokoe {{proposed}} that these components are {{analogous to the}} phonemes of spoken languages. There {{has also been a}} proposal that these are analogous to classes like place and manner of articulation. As in spoken languages, these phonological units can be split into distinctive features. For instance, the handshapes /2/ and /3/ are distinguished by {{the presence or absence of}} the feature , as illustrated to the right. ASL has processes of allophony and phonotactic restrictions. There is ongoing research into whether ASL has <b>an</b> <b>analog</b> of syllables in spoken language.|$|E

5|$|By 2005, {{several other}} EyeTV {{products}} had been introduced, {{such as the}} EyeTV for DTT, the EyeTV EZ and the EyeTV Wonder. The EyeTV for DTT (digital terrestrial TV) is a small USB-powered device with an antenna for receiving free over-the-air television broadcasts. It received a 4 out of 5 rating in TechRadar. A review in The Register gave it an 85 percent rating. The Eye TV Wonder was only available from July 2005 to January 2006, before being discontinued and replaced with the Eye TV EZ. The EZ was a basic, entry-level product with <b>an</b> <b>analog</b> tuner for watching TV on a Mac computer.|$|E
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For <b>an</b> <b>analog</b> signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E
5|$|Forrest Mims was {{interested}} in science and electronics as a youth and even built <b>an</b> <b>analog</b> computer while in high school. Mims graduated from Texas A University in 1966 (major in government with minors in English and history) then became a commissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force. While serving in Vietnam as an intelligence officer, Mims continued his model rocket hobby. At Texas A, Mims developed an infrared obstacle-sensing device and he experimented with it at the Saigon School for Blind Boys and Girls. Launching model rockets in an area accustomed to rocket attacks and working with blind children resulted in {{a story in the}} military newspaper, Stars and Stripes. This caught the attention of an Air Force Colonel, who arranged for Mims to be assigned to the Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB even though Mims lacked an engineering degree.|$|E

5|$|In July 1914, World War I {{broke out}} in Europe; the United States {{remained}} neutral {{for the first three}} years of the war. Tensions with Germany came to a head in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Connecticut-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. In June 1918, New Hampshire and Louisiana were involved in a serious gunnery accident, where gunners aboard the former accidentally hit the latter, killing one and injuring several other men. The following month, Louisiana was used to test Arthur Pollen's Argo Clock, the first fire control system to use <b>an</b> <b>analog</b> computer to calculate firing solutions.|$|E
5|$|In June 1933 Massey {{became an}} {{independent}} lecturer in Mathematical Physics at the Queen's University of Belfast. He {{was the only}} member of the department until R. A. Buckingham arrived in 1934. Despite having to give nine lectures a week, he found time to write his second book, Negative Ions (1938), and began working on upper atmospheric physics. Frustrated with the tiresome and time-consuming process of calculation, he had his physics workshop superintendent, John Wylie, build him a small-scale differential analyzer, <b>an</b> <b>analog</b> computer that could solve differential equations, for just £50. This was used to solve problems related to low temperature helium, and the photo-ionisation of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
