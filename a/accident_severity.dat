In Florida, transit bus <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> was modeled with a multinomial logit model with regard to traffic flow and road characteristics [12]. In Canada, injury in bus accidents was estimated {{with a series of}} binary logistic regressions in connection to traffic control and infrastructural factors [27]. In the U.S., bus <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> was modeled with a generalized ordered logit in regard to risk factors such as drivers’ demographics and behavior, collision partners’ characteristics and behavior, infrastructural characteristics and environmental conditions [18].

The availability or large data sets makes the study of factors that affect the frequency and <b>severity</b> <b>accidents</b> are viable. However, the data are often highly unbalanced and overlapped.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this PhD thesis is the investigation of <b>accident</b> probability and <b>severity</b> exploiting high resolution traffic and weather data from urban roads and motorways, collected on a real-time basis, with specific focus on Powered-Two-Wheelers. For that purpose, an advanced mesoscopic multi-faceted statistical analysis was conducted in order to expand previous road safety work {{and contribute to the}} further understanding the complex issues of <b>accident</b> probability and <b>severity.</b> Linear models as well as non-linear models were developed on the basis of 6 -year accident data from urban roads as well as an urban motorway in Greater Athens area (Attica Tollway). Empirical findings indicate that high resolution traffic and weather data are capable of opening new dimensions in accident analysis in urban roads and urban motorways. The multi-faceted statistical analysis conducted in the thesis has revealed a consistent and strong influence of traffic parameters on <b>accident</b> probability and <b>severity.</b> It is interesting that weather parameters were not found to influence <b>accident</b> probability and <b>severity</b> when linear relationships are considered. Lastly, the application of cusp catastrophe models demonstrated that it is likely that even small traffic and weather changes may have a critical impact on road safety in urban roads as sudden transitions from safe to unsafe conditions (and vice versa) may occur...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Traffic {{accident}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of mortality in Iran. The damage and injury caused by these accidents threatens human societies severely. Rural accidents are often more severe and show harsher consequences because the operational speed is higher on rural roads and highways. World statistics presented by World Health Organization (WHO) reveal that about 25 percent of all injuries in the world are caused by traffic accidents. Appropriate diagnoses and treatments of traffic black spots, prioritization, defining proper safety countermeasures and geometric design improvements are the main objectives of this study. Materials and Methods: In this study, geometric design parameters are verified in black spots to determine which deficiency is the main cause of safety problem. Sari – Kiasar corridor, which is a rural road, is selected as the case study. Results: Because of the fact that the general topography of Sari – Kiasar corridor is mountainous, the geometric design parameters are very diverse. Thus, after evaluation of geometric parameters, black spots are determined according to the types of <b>accidents,</b> <b>severity</b> of <b>accidents,</b> rate of accidents and the collision scenario. These items are then verified and studied in detail. Conclusion: Results of the assessment show that geometric parameters such as horizontal and vertical curves, poor pavement, poor shoulder quality and poor drainage are contributing factors in increasing accident risk.

Because of the binary nature of this dependent variable, a logistic regression approach was found suitable. Of nine independent variables obtained from police accident reports, two were found most significantly associated with <b>accident</b> <b>severity,</b> namely, location and cause of accident. A statistical interpretation is given of the model-developed estimates in terms of the odds ratio concept.

30|$|The {{analysis}} {{of the number of}} accidents and <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> between urban and rural areas may lead to some interesting observations. Using data from the Hellenic Statistical Authority (statistics.gr), processed by the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) Road Safety Observatory [40] one can deduce that in 2010 in Greece more than three quarters of road accidents and 49  % of fatalities occurred inside built-up areas. However, <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> is more than 4 times higher outside built-up areas [40]. This is not a new finding, as it has been described several times {{over the past two decades}} (e.g. [11, 13]). Theofilatos et al. [51] analyze the factors affecting <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> inside and outside urban areas in Greece. Theofilatos et al. [51] conclude that factors affecting road <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> only inside urban areas include young driver age, intersections and collision with fixed objects, while factors affecting only severity outside of urban areas include weather conditions and head-on and side collisions. Clark and Cushing [17] present an analysis and discussion of rural and urban traffic fatalities, correlating them with exposure and population density. The majority of the variation (91  %) in rural mortality rate was explained by rural vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) per capita, population density and southern location. Urban mortality rate, on the other hand, was not affected by population density, but was higher in the south.|$|E
40|$|Accident {{prediction}} models (APMs) {{have been}} extensively used in site ranking {{with the objective}} of identifying accident hotspots. Previously this has been achieved by using a univariate count data or a multivariate count data model (e. g. multivariate Poissonlognormal) for modelling the number of <b>accidents</b> at different <b>severity</b> levels simultaneously. This paper proposes an alternative method to estimate accident frequency at different severity levels, namely the two-stage mixed multivariate model which combines both <b>accident</b> frequency and <b>severity</b> models. The <b>accident,</b> traffic and road characteristics data from the M 25 motorway and surrounding major roads in England have been collected to demonstrate the use of the two-stage model. A Bayesian spatial model and a mixed logit model have been employed at each stage for <b>accident</b> frequency and <b>severity</b> analysis respectively, and the results combined to produce estimation of the number of <b>accidents</b> at different <b>severity</b> levels. Based on the results from the two-stage model, the accident hotspots on the M 25 and surround have been identified. The ranking result using the twostage model has also been compared with other ranking methods, such as the naïve ranking method, multivariate Poisson-lognormal and fixed proportion method. Compared to the traditional frequency based analysis, the two-stage model has the advantage in that it utilises more detailed individual accident level data and is able to predict low frequency accidents (such as fatal accidents). Therefore, the two-stage mixed multivariate model is a promising tool in predicting accident frequency according to their severity levels and site ranking...|$|R
