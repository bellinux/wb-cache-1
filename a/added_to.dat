5|$|First {{designated}} by 1919, M-76 initially terminated at Roscommon. It was later extended north through Grayling and west to Kalkaska in the 1920s. A second, disconnected, segment was <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the highway in the 1930s. By the early 1940s, both the disconnected section and the Kalkaska–Grayling were <b>added</b> <b>to</b> M-72. M-76 was converted in stages into a freeway {{in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s.

50|$|In the plane, angles about a point <b>add</b> up <b>to</b> 360°, while {{interior}} angles in a triangle <b>add</b> up <b>to</b> 180° (equivalently, exterior angles <b>add</b> up <b>to</b> 360°). However, on a convex polyhedron the angles at a vertex on average <b>add</b> up <b>to</b> less than 360°, on a spherical triangle the {{interior angles}} always <b>add</b> up <b>to</b> more than 180° (the exterior angles <b>add</b> up <b>to</b> less than 360°), and the angles in a hyperbolic triangle always <b>add</b> up <b>to</b> less than 180° (the exterior angles <b>add</b> up <b>to</b> more than 360°).|$|R
5000|$|For finite ordinals, the nim-sum {{is easily}} {{evaluated}} {{on a computer}} by taking the bitwise exclusive or (XOR, denoted by [...] ) of the corresponding numbers. For example, the nim-sum of 7 and 14 can be found by writing 7 as 111 and 14 as 1110; the ones place <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> 1; the twos place <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> 2, which we replace with 0; the fours place <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> 2, which we replace with 0; the eights place <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> 1. So the nim-sum is written in binary as 1001, or in decimal as 9.|$|R
