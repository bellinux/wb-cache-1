5|$|An <b>assault</b> is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim is aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an <b>assault</b> if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since <b>assault</b> is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted <b>assault.</b> However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of <b>assault.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Assaults</b> on rugby referees {{are being}} {{reported}} {{more and more}} in the media. One study found that around six percent of United Kingdom referees surveyed had been physically <b>assaulted.</b> A further examination of the study found that rugby union referees' fear of being <b>assaulted</b> was a significant factor for increased stress. The same study found that rugby referees were most concerned about being <b>assaulted</b> by a spectator or coach. A study by Rainey and Hardy found that it was in fact players who committed <b>assaults</b> on referees the most, contributing to seventy-nine percent of all <b>assaults</b> on referees.|$|R

5|$|During the {{artillery}} barrage {{that preceded the}} infantry <b>assault,</b> Longstreet began to agonize over an <b>assault</b> {{that was going to}} cost dearly. He attempted to pass the responsibility for launching Pickett's division to his artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander. When the time came to actually order Pickett forward, Longstreet could only nod in assent, unable to verbalize the order. The <b>assault,</b> known as Pickett's Charge, suffered the heavy casualties that Longstreet anticipated. It was the decisive point in the Confederate loss at Gettysburg and Lee ordered a retreat back to Virginia the following day.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{to support}} the platoon in contact, Scott ordered D Company to conduct an <b>assault</b> against the flank and rear of the bunker complex, mounted in APCs with tanks in support. Two troops of Centurions spearheaded the <b>assault</b> through the jungle from the north, and they soon began {{receiving}} heavy small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades, one of which subsequently suffered external damage. Realising that the bunker system was larger than previously estimated, the tanks were forced to halt while the infantry were brought up to begin the <b>assault.</b>|$|E

5|$|Regardless of the {{controversy}} regarding the preparations, however, once the <b>assault</b> began around 4 p.m., Longstreet pressed the <b>assault</b> by McLaws and Hood (Pickett's division had not yet arrived) competently against fierce Union resistance, but it was largely unsuccessful, with significant casualties.|$|E
5|$|A British <b>assault</b> force {{landed on}} the island on 7 February, after which Nelson moved to intensify the {{blockade}} off Bastia. For {{the rest of the}} month he carried out raids along the coast and intercepted enemy shipping. By late February St Fiorenzo had fallen and British troops under Lieutenant-General David Dundas entered the outskirts of Bastia. However, Dundas merely assessed the enemy positions and then withdrew, arguing that the French were too well entrenched to risk an <b>assault.</b> Nelson convinced Hood otherwise, but a protracted debate between the army and naval commanders meant that Nelson did not receive permission to proceed until late March. Nelson began to land guns from his ships and emplace them in the hills surrounding the town. On 11 April the British squadron entered the harbour and opened fire, whilst Nelson took command of the land forces and commenced bombardment. After 45 days, the town surrendered. Nelson subsequently prepared for an <b>assault</b> on Calvi, working in company with Lieutenant-General Charles Stuart.|$|E
40|$|Marriage {{may reduce}} the risk of {{accidents}} and <b>assaults</b> by promoting social control of health behavior. This study examines the impact of marital status on non-fatal accidents and <b>assaults</b> in young British women. Data is drawn from a large cohort study of the people born in 1958. Rate ratios of overall and specific incidence of non-fatal accidents and <b>assaults</b> are determined by negative binomial regression, with adjustment for socio-economic and behavioral confounders. The null hypothesis of no association between marital status and incidence of non-fatal accidents and <b>assaults</b> is rejected. It is suggested that, independent of parental status, more exposure to marriage and less exposure to marital dissolution may reduce accidents and <b>assaults.</b> accidents <b>assaults</b> social control marital status Britain...|$|R

5|$|A second regimental-sized {{attack against}} 3 RAR at Balmoral was {{launched}} by the North Vietnamese at 02:30 on 28 May, with a two-battalion <b>assault</b> preceded by 60mm and 80mm mortar fire from the south. Meanwhile, FSB Coral was also attacked by indirect fire from 02:45. Similar to the attack two nights before, it began with another feint from the south as the North Vietnamese sappers blew up the wire in front of A Company, but was successfully broken up before it reached the wire by the Australian defenders with claymore mines and small-arms fire from their M60 machine-guns, L1A1 Self Loading Rifles and M16 <b>assault</b> rifles. The main <b>assault</b> began at 03:10 from the north-east, with the brunt again being borne by Phillips' D Company. The Australian infantrymen were once again supported by tanks firing canister shot and machine-guns, while artillery and mortars provided continuous close indirect fires, with the combined effect of this firepower stopping the North Vietnamese on the wire before they could penetrate the position. Although the <b>assault</b> was well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese had lost the element of surprise, with the preparatory fire once more alerting the defenders. The <b>assault</b> was subsequently called off after 30 minutes, while at 03:40 a small probe developed from the east but quickly dissipated. Sporadic mortar and rocket fire continued to fall as helicopter light-fire teams and C-47 Spooky gunships engaged the North Vietnamese, directed by forward air control aircraft. From 05:00 until first light artillery from FSB Coral provided continuous battlefield illumination to stymie North Vietnamese attempts to clear their dead and wounded, and they finally withdrew by 05:30.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>assault,</b> the 33rd Division {{pursued the}} {{retreating}} German forces, while the 38th stayed close behind {{ready to take}} over the advance or <b>assault</b> strongly-held German positions as needed. On 9 October, Clary was liberated and the next day the divisional artillery was firing in support of the 33rd which had made contact with German forces. Over the next few days, the 33rd Division pursued the Germans to the River Selle and launched a bloody <b>assault</b> on the defended eastern bank during the opening stages of the Battle of the Selle. While a bridgehead was secured, it was abandoned due to losses and the 38th Division was moved forward. On the night of 13/14 October, the division took over the line near Troisvilles and Bertry. Over the next six days, the division prepared itself: conducting reconnaissance, constructing bridges and moving up heavy artillery. During these preparations, the Germans bombarded elements of the division's artillery with gas shells.|$|E

5|$|Although the French and British had {{intended}} to launch a spring offensive in 1917, the strategy was threatened in February, when the Russians admitted {{that they could not}} meet the commitment to a joint offensive, which reduced the two-front offensive to a French <b>assault</b> along the Aisne River. In March, the German army in the west , withdrew to the Hindenburg line in Operation Alberich, which negated the tactical assumptions underlying the plans for the French offensive. Until French troops advanced to compensate during the Battles of Arras, they encountered no German troops in the <b>assault</b> sector and it became uncertain whether the offensive would go forward. The French government desperately needed a victory to avoid civil unrest but the British were wary of proceeding, in view of the rapidly changing tactical situation. In a meeting with Lloyd George, French commander-in-chief General Robert Nivelle persuaded the British Prime Minister, that if the British launched a diversionary <b>assault</b> to draw German troops away from the Aisne sector, the French offensive could succeed. It was agreed in the London Convention of 16 January, that the French <b>assault</b> on the Aisne would begin in mid-April and that the British would make a diversionary attack in the Arras sector approximately one week prior.|$|E

5|$|Although the <b>assault</b> {{is known}} to popular history as Pickett's Charge, overall command was given to James Longstreet, and Pickett {{was one of his}} {{division}}al commanders. Lee did tell Longstreet that Pickett's fresh division should lead the <b>assault,</b> so the name is appropriate, although some recent historians have used the name Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble <b>Assault</b> (or, less frequently, Longstreet's <b>Assault)</b> to more fairly distribute the credit (or blame). With Hill sidelined, Pettigrew's and Trimble's divisions were delegated to Longstreet's authority as well. Thus, Pickett's name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded 3 out of the 11 brigades while under the supervision of his corps commander throughout. Pickett's men were almost exclusively from Virginia, with the other divisions consisting of troops from North Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from Alabama and Florida.|$|E
5|$|Archival {{data of the}} II SS-Panzer Corps {{shows that}} the corps had 294 {{operable}} tanks and <b>assault</b> guns {{on the evening of}} 11 July, and 251 on the evening of 13 July.

An estimated total of 60–80 tanks and <b>assault</b> guns of the II SS-Panzer Corps were damaged or destroyed in combat on 12 July. By the end of 16 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps had 292 serviceable tanks and <b>assault</b> guns, almost the same number it had {{at the beginning of the}} battle on 12 July.

Realising that the man carrying the ladder had been killed crossing the beach and the ladder left behind, they looked for another way to cross. They discovered wooden planks bridging the gap that the defenders used to access the town. DTroop crossed and captured the machine gun posts around the battery. With the machine guns taken, EandFTroops began their <b>assault.</b> The attack was successful but they discovered the guns were only wooden dummies made from telegraph poles.
