It {{is a combination of}} the Net Emotional State (balance of emotions felt) and the Net Intensity Balance (intensity with which they are felt) and, therefore, can measure values from -100% to +100%.|$|E
5000|$|COLA is not CPI, {{which is}} an <b>aggregate</b> <b>indicator.</b> Using CPI as a COLA salary {{adjustment}} for taxable income fails to recognize that increases are generally taxed at the highest marginal tax rate whereas an individual's rising costs are paid with after-tax dollars - dollars commensurate with an individual's average after-tax level. Indexing tax brackets does not address this fundamental issue but it does effectively eliminate [...] "bracket-creep". Indexation has been very important in high-inflation environments, and was known as monetary correction [...] "correção monetária" [...] in Brazil from 1964 to 1994. Some countries have cut back significantly {{in the use of}} indexation and cost-of-living escalation clauses, first by applying only partial protection for price increases and eventually eliminating such protection altogether when inflation is brought down to single digits.|$|E
50|$|Total {{dissolved}} solids (TDS) {{is a measure}} of the combined content of all inorganic and organic substances contained in a liquid in molecular, ionized or micro-granular (colloidal sol) suspended form. Generally the operational definition is that the solids must be small enough to survive filtration through a filter with two-micrometer (nominal size, or smaller) pores. Total {{dissolved solids}} are normally discussed only for freshwater systems, as salinity includes some of the ions constituting the definition of TDS. The principal application of TDS is in the study of water quality for streams, rivers and lakes, although TDS is not generally considered a primary pollutant (e.g. it is not deemed to be associated with health effects) it is used as an indication of aesthetic characteristics of drinking water and as an <b>aggregate</b> <b>indicator</b> of the presence of a broad array of chemical contaminants.|$|E

This article presents a systematic approach to constructing indicators {{of the environment and}} economy on a macro level. It includes a distinction into the following categories: the volume of economic activities as an indicator of potential environmental pressure; actual environmental pressure; environmental quality; and environmental policy. In each category <b>aggregate</b> <b>indicators</b> are calculated for 12 OECD countries, mostly based on data from 1993; and the correlation between these indicators is examined. Significant correlation is found between the economic activity indicators (or “potential” environmental pressure) and the actual environmental pressure and environmental quality, whereas a weak correlation exists with these indicators and two types of <b>aggregate</b> <b>indicators</b> of environmental policy. Because of some arbitrary choices, which are inevitable, the results must be judged with caution.

One {{of the most}} critical issues about DGS concerns the criteria to be used to assess the risk‐based contribution that each member bank should pay to the Scheme. We propose an alternative model for risk-based contributions based on CDS spreads. We construct the same balance sheet ratios used in the Italian DGSs for a sample of EU banks issuing CDSs. Subsequently we perform panel regressions to explore the relationship between CDS spreads and balance sheet indicators.

The <b>aggregate</b> <b>indicator</b> for strategic planning comprises seven indicators that represent each a component of the strategic planning process: mission, objectives, internal and external analysis, strategic alternative selection, implementation, control and evaluation. For overall performance <b>aggregate</b> <b>indicator</b> we considered the objectives achievement level, the perceived performance in 2008 compared to 2007, number of employees’ dynamics and turnover dynamics. For a in depth analysis of the influences of strategic planning activities on performance we tested forty hypotheses using Pearson Chi Square test.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to analyze three <b>aggregated</b> <b>indicators</b> {{and put them into}} the context of Ecological Economics. The second chapter points out that {{different}} sustainability perspectives imply distinct sustainability policies. Ecological Economics is outlined in contrast to Environmental Economics. Following three chapters analyze selected <b>aggregated</b> <b>indicators.</b> <b>Aggregated</b> <b>indicators</b> can provide quick insight into complex problems; however, their virtue depends to a large extent on the method of aggregation. Therefore, the interpretation of <b>aggregated</b> <b>indicators</b> should always be conditioned by their specific methodology. The Ecological Footprint is called technologically skeptical indicator of sustainability, applicable rather on a global than a national scale. Even on a lower scale the Ecological Footprint can illustrate demands of a given population for renewable natural resources. A major shortcoming of the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare is the integration of welfare and sustainability into one indicator since it does not allow for a simple interpretation of its results. High correlation between the Human Development Index and the indicators of economic activity limits the usefulness of the former. Yet, it can serve as a basis for further evolution of the concept and measurement of human [...] ...|$|R

The paper examines the impact of development {{of agricultural}} sector on performance of the cooperative banks in Poland in years 1997 - 2004.

Workers (n= 942) were divided into 22 subgroups, according {{to the type of}} their workstations. They answered ques-tions on perceived musculoskeletal pain of upper limbs. Basic and aggregate indices from a ques-tionnaire on the prevalence, intensity and frequency of pain were compared with an upper limb load indicator (repetitive task index, RTI) calculated with the recently developed Upper Limb Risk Assessment (ULRA). There was relatively strong correlation of RTI and general intensity and fre-quency of pain in the arm, and general intensity and frequency of pain in the arm and forearm or prevalence of pain in the arm. Frequency and intensity of pain in the arm were weakly correlated. An <b>aggregate</b> <b>indicator</b> of evaluation of MSDs, which was calculated {{on the basis of the}} prevalence, intensity and frequency of pain, was to a higher degree associated with the musculoskeletal load of a task than basic evaluative parameters.
