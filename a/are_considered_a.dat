5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and <b>are</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E

Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made to produce it in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E

5|$|Silkies <b>are</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> bantam {{breed in}} some countries, but this varies {{according}} to region and many breed standards class them officially as large fowl; the bantam Silkie is actually a separate variety most of the time. Almost all North American strains of the breed are bantam-sized, but in Europe the standard-sized is the original version. However, even standard Silkies are relatively small chickens, with the males weighing only four pounds (1.8kg), and females weighing three pounds (1.36kg). The American Standard of Perfection calls for males that are 36 ounces (1kg), and females that are 32 ounces (910grams).|$|E
