5|$|Mamie largely raised Emmett {{with her}} mother; she and Louis Till {{separated}} in 1942 after {{she discovered that}} he had been unfaithful. Louis later abused her, choking her to unconsciousness, to which she responded by throwing scalding water <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>For</b> violating court orders to stay away from Mamie, Louis Till was forced by a judge in 1943 to choose between jail or enlisting in the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{marked the}} end of Linois's three-year {{campaign}} against British trade and was the second British victory of the Atlantic campaign, following the Battle of San Domingo the previous month. Willaumez eventually returned to France, although without many of his squadron who were destroyed by British operations or Atlantic gales. Linois, despite the criticism levelled <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> his failures in the Indian Ocean, was considered to have fought hard and been unlucky to have encountered such an overwhelming force. Made a prisoner of war, Linois was not exchanged by Napoleon, who criticised his behaviour during the campaign and refused to employ him at sea again.|$|E

5|$|The date of Michael Bourtzes's {{birth is}} unknown, {{but must be}} placed {{sometime}} between 930 and 935. He is first mentioned in late 968, when he was appointed by Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (reigned 963–969) as patrikios and strategos of the small theme of Mauron Oros ("Black Mountain"), on the southern outliers of the Amanus Mountains. With his base on the newly built fortress of Pagras, Bourtzes and his thousand men were tasked with controlling the northern approaches to the Arab-held city of Antioch. Acting against Nikephoros's orders not to assault the city in his absence, in the late autumn of 969, Bourtzes persuaded a traitor inside the city to surrender one of the wall's main towers, which he then promptly occupied on 28 October. He then defended this post against repeated attacks of the city's defenders for three days, until the reinforcements led by the stratopedarches Peter arrived and secured {{the city for the}} Byzantines. Despite his major role in this success, Bourtzes's reward was distinctly lacking: angry <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> disobeying his orders, or, according to another account, for laying fire and destroying much of the city, Emperor Nikephoros dismissed him from his post and appointed a kinsman of his, Eustathios Maleinos, as the first governor of Antioch.|$|E
5|$|To impress Marge, Homer {{joins the}} debate team, of which Marge is a member. At a debate, Homer {{finds out that}} Marge is more {{interested}} in the more articulate Artie Ziff. Therefore, Homer pretends to be a French student so that he can be tutored by Marge and when Homer asks Marge to the senior prom she accepts. However, when Homer confesses that he is not really a French student, Marge is furious <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> making her lose sleep for a debate tournament the next morning. She ultimately loses to Artie, who asks her to be his partner to the prom; she agrees. Homer does not realize that Marge has changed her plans, and so he shows up at her house for prom night to pick her up. Moments later Artie shows up, causing confusion to Marge's family, and a despondent Homer leaves. Undaunted, he decides to go to the prom alone.|$|E

He was buried in Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.

25|$|The {{publication}} of the book brought some literary fame to Goyen, both in New York and in Texas. He would later recall that he felt that “everyone he met in the literary world wanted a piece of him, wanted to admire him as the moment’s fashion, {{and yet at the}} same time he felt that others were angry <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> his moment of public recognition.” He would also recall later that he was “just about disinherited” by his family after the book’s publication, and “fell out of favor with many people” in his home town.|$|E
25|$|Later, in Chapter 47, Cao Cao sends Jiang Gan {{to spy on}} Zhou Yu again.

Jiang Gan wanders around and meets Pang Tong in a nearby temple by chance, without knowing that Pang has been expecting him. He escapes and brings Pang Tong back with him to meet Cao Cao. Pang Tong gives fake advice to Cao Cao by suggesting that he uses metal chains to link his warships together to reduce the chances of his troops falling seasick. The chained-linked ships later become vulnerable to the fire attack during the Battle of Red Cliffs.|$|E

On the April 15, 2004 episode of SmackDown!, Big Show promised to quit if he failed to defeat Eddie Guerrero that night. He lost to Guerrero after Guerrero performed a Frog Splash, and, believing that Torrie Wilson had laughed <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> losing, upended her car and threatened to throw her off a ledge. Then General Manager of SmackDown! Kurt Angle ascended the ledge to try to talk some reason into Big Show, but he chokeslammed Angle off the ledge, kayfabe concussing him and breaking his leg, as well as causing the back of Angle's head to bleed.

He closes the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it [...] "wasn't actually that hard". She moves around the room browsing through his possessions, brushes her teeth with his toothbrush and declines to take the bath he had run for her.|$|E
500|$|... "Back from Vacation" [...] {{was written}} by Justin Spitzer, a staff writer who joined The Office in its third season. The episode was his first script for the series. Spitzer found Jan's final scene with Michael– in which he expects she will yell <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> their {{circulated}} picture but instead informs him they are staying together– especially tricky to write. Spitzer was unsure how to craft the scene, and eventually requested advice from the other series' writers. They decided that Jan would give a [...] "psychobabble" [...] response to Michael. Sitting on a panel of television writers at Northwestern University, Spitzer briefly described her reasoning, [...] "Jan’s nuts. She has some bad psychiatrist giving her bad advice." [...] He praised {{the benefits of a}} [...] "good writers room," [...] in which [...] "scenes go to this place you never could have gone to alone." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1849, Tubman {{became ill}} again, which diminished her {{value as a}} slave. Edward Brodess tried to sell her, but {{could not find a}} buyer. Angry <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> trying to sell her and for {{continuing}} to enslave her relatives, Tubman began to pray for her owner, asking God to make him change his ways. She said later: [...] "I prayed all night long for my master till the first of March; and all the time he was bringing people to look at me, and trying to sell me." [...] When it appeared as though a sale was being concluded, [...] "I changed my prayer," [...] she said. [...] "First of March I began to pray, 'Oh Lord, if you ain't never going to change that man's heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of the way.'" [...] A week later, Brodess died, and Tubman expressed regret for her earlier sentiments.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the song, {{the narrator}} {{addresses}} an unidentified girl, asking [...] "When {{will you come}} with me", and lamenting {{the fact that she}} laughs <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> having nothing to his name.

He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me". As he sees her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really mean to tell me, you love me as I am?" ...|$|E
500|$|Roughly {{twenty-four hours}} {{after the death of}} Francisco Rafael, the Mexican federal police arrested Manuel Aguirre Galindo (alias [...] "El Caballo" [...] – [...] "The Horse"), a founder of the Tijuana Cartel and a {{high-ranking}} leader and money launderer who had been a fugitive for more than 20 years, in Mexico City. It is unknown who notified the authorities of his whereabouts but they allege that they were either notified by a rival gang or by members of the Arellano Félix clan. Among the hypotheses presented by Zeta, a Tijuana-based magazine known for its investigative reports on the Tijuana Cartel, are as followed: (1) shortly after the murder of Francisco Rafael, the police interrogated his family and several of the party invitees, who may have proportionated information that led to Aguirre Galindo's arrest, given that the drug lord was allegedly responsible for providing security to Francisco Rafael; (2) the other hypothesis is that Aguirre Galindo's location was tipped by members of the Tijuana Cartel who were mad <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> failing to protect Francisco Rafael.|$|E
500|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century there were no {{permanent}} salaried orchestras in London. The main orchestras were those of Covent Garden, the Philharmonic Society and the Queen's Hall; their proprietors engaged players individually for each concert or for a season. As there were competing demands for the services of the finest players it was an accepted practice that, even though under contract to play for a concert, a player was at liberty to accept a better-paid engagement if it were offered. He would then engage another player to deputise <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> the original concert and the rehearsals for it. The treasurer of the Philharmonic Society described the system thus: [...] "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away." [...] There was much competition for good orchestral players, with well-paid engagements offered by more than fifty music halls, by pit bands in West End musical comedies, and by grand hotels and restaurants which maintained orchestras.|$|E
