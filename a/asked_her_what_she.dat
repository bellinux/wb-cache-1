5|$|Born in Chicago, Illinois, Piccard {{was one of}} nine {{children}} born to Emily Ridlon and John Ridlon, who {{was president of the}} American Orthopaedic Association. She had a lifelong interest in science and religion. When she was 11, her mother <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted to be when she grew up. Piccard's reply"a priest"sent her mother running out of the room in tears.|$|E
500|$|Later that day, Solanas {{arrived at}} the Factory and waited outside. Morrissey arrived and <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing there, and she replied [...] "I'm waiting for Andy to get money". Morrissey tried {{to get rid of}} her by telling her that Warhol was not coming in that day, but she told him she would wait. At 2:00pm she went up into the studio. Morrissey told her again that Warhol was not coming in and that she had to leave. She left but rode the {{elevator}} up and down until Warhol finally boarded it.|$|E
500|$|In the first, an 80-second clip, Leslie gives {{everyone}} in the department tickets to the banquet. She tries to invite Andy, and when Ann says he cannot put on pants due to his cast, Leslie asks, [...] "Does he have a formal kilt or something?" [...] The second clip features 100 seconds of extended banquet sequences, including Ann's reaction to Leslie's haircut, Ann's awkward attempts to make small talk with April and more of Tom's speech to Marlene. In the third, a 30-second clip, set at the bar, Tom describes to Mark his strategy in picking up a girl: he <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did for a living, then, [...] "I just yawned, gave her the middle finger and left. Pretty risky but I feel good about it." [...] In the final clip, which was 15 seconds long, an amused Tom shows a newspaper photo caption of Leslie and Ann from the banquet, with the caption, [...] "Mr. Leslie Knope and wife Ann." ...|$|E

500|$|Casting {{of the new}} {{characters}} for series 1 {{was announced}} on 25 November 2009. Open auditions were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East, followed by recalls until the possible actors were reduced to eight and then four. Yorke {{described it as a}} [...] "painful process" [...] and they had difficulty finding someone to play Zsa Zsa Carter. Emer Kenny was cast in the role whilst writing the second episode. Yorke said [...] "She was so good that we suddenly went, 'It's her! Kenny said, [...] "I'm really thrilled to have been given the opportunity to both write for and act in a show connected with such an iconic drama as EastEnders. Kids these days use their laptops more than their televisions, so it's really exciting {{to be a part of}} a project that's taking drama online and connecting with these viewers." [...] To prepare for the role, Kenny had to disguise her [...] "posh" [...] accent, saying that when the director <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would do about her voice, she travelled around the East End to listen to the way people spoke.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after her}} arrival in Edmonton, she said, Brownlee had telephoned her—commenting that [...] "a little birdie" [...] {{had told him}} that she was in town—and invited her to his home to meet his family; she soon became a regular visitor there. [...] She alleged that in October 1930, while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit, the premier took her hand and <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> knew [...] "about life". [...] On her {{response}} that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen, he invited her out the next evening for what she presumed would be some advice. [...] Instead, he drove her [...] west of town on Highway 16 and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him. [...] He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start, that he was lonely, {{that he and his wife}} had not lived together as man and wife in a long time, that his wife (an invalid) would be endangered by a pregnancy, and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him. [...] He told her that if she refused him, he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife, and that this would likely kill her. [...] MacMillan reacted fearfully, and asked if there was anything else she could do to help Brownlee and his wife; he replied that there was not.|$|E
2500|$|Elisabeth was {{an emotionally}} complex woman, and {{perhaps due to}} the melancholy and {{eccentricity}} that was considered a given characteristic of her Wittelsbach lineage (the best-known {{member of the family}} being her favorite cousin, the eccentric Ludwig II of Bavaria), she was interested in the treatment of the mentally ill. In 1871, when the Emperor <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would like as a gift for her Saint's Day, she listed a young tiger and a medallion, but: [...] "...a fully equipped lunatic asylum would please me most".|$|E

2500|$|In October 2003, {{while in}} the UK to promote her film In the Cut, Meg Ryan made a {{controversial}} appearance on Parkinson, which resulted in negative publicity. The press accused both Ryan and Parkinson of being rude to one another. Ryan gave a few one-word answers, and after she acknowledged that she wasn't comfortable with the interview, Parkinson <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would do {{if she were in}} his position now. She replied that she would [...] "just wrap it up". Parkinson later revealed to the press that he felt her behaviour to his earlier guests, Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, whom she turned her back on, was [...] "unforgivable". Ryan also commented that Parkinson was a [...] "nut" [...] and said that she was [...] "offended" [...] by him as he was like a [...] "disapproving father" [...] in his tone. A 2006 survey of British TV viewers, her behaviour on the show was voted the third [...] "most shocking" [...] TV chat show moment ever.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; I am <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thinks {{will become}} of the work if she is to go and take her {{pleasure}} whenever she likes. She talks of working extra; but supposing she had a headache, she'd be sorry she had thrown away her time." ...|$|R
