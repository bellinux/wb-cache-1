40|$|Although {{multiplying}} delay-locked loops allow {{clock frequency}} multiplication with very low phase noise and jitter, their application {{has been so}} far limited to integer-N multiplication, and the achieved reference-spur performance has been typically limited by time offsets. This paper presents the first published multiplying delay-locked loop achieving fine fractional-N frequency resolution, and introduces an automatic cancellation of the phase detector offset. Both capabilities are enabled by insertion of a digital-to-time converter in the reference path.

50|$|Quadrature sine/cosine signals can be {{monitored}} easily {{by using an}} oscilloscope in XY mode to display a circular Lissajous Figure. Highest accuracy signals are obtained if the Lissajous Figure is circular (no gain or phase error) and perfectly centred. Modern encoder systems employ circuitry to trim these error mechanisms automatically. The overall accuracy of the linear encoder {{is a combination of}} the scale accuracy and errors introduced by the readhead. Scale contributions to the error budget include linearity and slope (scaling factor error). Readhead error mechanisms are usually described as cyclic error or sub-divisional error (SDE) as they repeat every scale period. The largest contributor to readhead inaccuracy is signal offset, followed by signal imbalance (ellipticity) and phase error (the quadrature signals not being exactly 90° apart). Overall signal size does not affect encoder accuracy, however, signal-to-noise and jitter performance may degrade with smaller signals. Automatic signal compensation mechanisms can include <b>automatic</b> <b>offset</b> compensation (AOC), <b>automatic</b> balance compensation (ABC) and automatic gain control (AGC). Phase is more difficult to compensate dynamically and is usually applied as one time compensation during installation or calibration.

30|$|When the {{computer}} is working, it will transmit the electromagnetic leakage signal containing the video information and receive and process the electromagnetic leakage signal within a certain distance, which can reproduce the screen information and form the electromagnetic leakage restoration sequence image.

At the current level of power consumption, we have proven that this design is thermal-noise limited to a 6 -bit precision, and higher precision is possible only if we expend more power. As such, it is already useful for cochlear implants, as deaf patients can only discriminate 1 dB out of a 30 dB dynamic range in the auditory nerve bundles.

The optimization of <b>automatic</b> <b>offset</b> printing system for the environmentally friendly dampening components via free alcohol and filtration procedures is a further milestone of the classical offset technology environmental approach. Offset printing, also named “wet” offset, uses dampening solution in order to keep non-printing elements as a hydrophilic on the surface of offset printing plate. So fountain solution is a part of its process. Generally it is composed by water and around of 8 - 10 % isopropyl alcohol as a surface active agent improved wetting. However, there are inherent issues with this process, such as negative environmental impact, health hazardous, complex press operations and waste water and chemical regulations. Isopropyl alcohol used in water solution in offset printing has negative influence as: part of it vaporizes to form volatile organic compounds that pollute the working environment, also toxic and flammable. Measured by volume IPA is the most significant air pollutant in the offset printing companies. In the common ecology savings conditions there are alternative ways to reduce or even fully IPA-free printing, lowering costs and risks for health and safety the environment.

Thiscomputation model is substantially different from conventional random access registermachines and stack machines. Traditional code generation methods cannot be applied toqueue machines, therefore, this doctoral dissertation presents the design and developmentof a parallelizing queue compiler framework. The queue compiler translates any programwritten in C language into queue processor’s machine code. The most importantcharacteristic of the queue compiler is the integration of the queue computing principle inall stages of code generation, making it the first available true queue compiler. Novel andefficient algorithms and data structures have been developed to facilitate and solve all theproblems related to compilation for the queue model. This work is the result of two years ofresearch and development, and it provides efficient solutions to a broad range of problemson queue computing including the principles of compiler development, <b>automatic</b> codegeneration, <b>offset</b> calculation, scheduling, parallelization, optimization, data allocation,and constrained compilation. Internally, the queue compiler is completely different toany other existing compiler, this due to the special characteristics of queue computing. First, control flow and data flow graphs of the input program are generated. Then a setof custom analyses and transformations are performed to compute the offset referencevalues. Finally, the data flow graph is scheduled in a level-order manner to generate thefinal instruction sequence for the target queue machine.

To allow for precise cell deposition into microwells the SCP was equipped with an <b>automatic</b> dispenser <b>offset</b> compensation, and the 384 -microwell plates were electrostatically neutralized. The ejection efficiency was 99. 7 % for fluorescent beads (n = 2304) and 98. 7 % for human cells (U- 2 OS or Kasumi- 1 cancer cell line, acute myeloid leukemia [AML] patient; n = 150). Per fluorescence microscopy, 98. 8 % of beads were correctly delivered into the wells. A subset of single cells (n = 81) was subjected to whole genome amplification (WGA), which was successful in all cells. On empty droplets, a PCR on LINE 1 retrotransposons yielded no product after WGA, verifying the absence of free-floating DNA in SCP-generated droplets. Representative gene variants identified in bulk specimens were sequenced in single-cell WGA DNA. In U- 2 OS, 22 of 25 cells yielded results for both an SLC 34 A 2 and TET 2 mutation site, including cells harboring the SLC 34 A 2 but not the TET 2 mutation. In one cell, the TET 2 mutation analysis was inconclusive due to allelic dropout, as assessed via polymorphisms located close to the mutation. Of Kasumi- 1, 23 of 33 cells with data on both the KIT and TP 53 mutation site harbored both mutations. In the AML patient, 21 of 23 cells were informative for a TP 53 polymorphism; the identified alleles matched the loss of chromosome arm 17 p. The advanced SCP allows efficient, precise and gentle isolation of individual cells for subsequent WGA and routine PCR/sequencing-based analyses of gene variants.

30|$|The {{changes of}} current {{during the process}} of a working {{computer}} will generate electromagnetic leakage emission. If the electromagnetic leakage emission is analyzed, it may be restored to relevant information, resulting in information leakage [1 – 4]. A large number of scholars have conducted a series of reduction studies on electromagnetic leakage and recovered useful video information successfully. As the radiation efficiency of video information of computer becomes relatively higher, electromagnetic radiation signals are easier to receive, and video information becomes the most easily intercepted and reproduced red information in a computer system. Video reduction is also evolving towards portability in the current days [5 – 7]. Due to the influence of the electromagnetic environment, equipment noise and other factors {{during the process of}} video information receiving and reduction, the introduction noise and fluctuation of video signal line and field signal will inevitably lead to the blur and drift of video information received. Electromagnetic leakage reduction sequence images are accompanied by a lot of noise. Only after the image is processed can the SNR of the image be improved to the maximum extent and the recognition of the image be enhanced. Once the image details are lost, it is impossible to recover them accurately, but it is possible to eliminate or mitigate the visual effects caused by a false contour. Specifically, for electromagnetic leakage reduction sequence images, multi-frame accumulation can effectively improve the image signal-to-noise ratio, but the premise is that the influence of position migration of each frame image should be eliminated by image feature retrieval and matching, and the migration amount can be found respectively. Xiao et al. proposed an improved brain CT image point matching algorithm based on the original SIFT algorithm, which combined SIFT and gray scale features. Using Euclidean distance and cosine similarity of gray feature vectors as a similarity measure, the final matching point pairs are obtained [8]. Qu et al. proposed a new image registration algorithm based on SURF feature point extraction and bidirectional matching {{to solve the problem of}} low matching accuracy caused by different imaging mechanisms of different source images [9]. Takasu et al. offered an edge detection algorithm that can be applied to image matching [10]. Ding et al. brought up an image matching method based on a gray relational degree and feature point analysis, which has high matching precision and robustness and can eliminate the impact of stretching, rotation, and illumination changes [11]. Konar aims at designing a fuzzy matching algorithm that would automatically recognize an unknown ballet posture [12]. Ma proposes a simple yet surprisingly effective approach, termed as guided locality preserving matching, for robust feature matching of remote sensing images. The key idea is merely to preserve the neighborhood structures of potential true matches between two images [13]. The FAST feature point detection algorithm and the FREAK feature point description algorithm were combined and applied in image matching, to improve the image recognition performance of the image recognition algorithm in the mobile phone [14]. Sun propose a Feature Guided Biased Gaussian Mixture Model (FGBG) for image matching [15]. Aiming at the problems of slow image processing speed and poor real-time capability and accuracy of feature point matching in mobile robot vision-based SLAM, Zhu proposes a novel image matching method based on color feature and improved SURF algorithm [16]. Olson improve upon these using a probabilistic formulation for image matching in terms of maximum-likelihood estimation that can be used for both edge template matching and gray-level image matching [17]. In order to further improve and broaden the accuracy of the image matching algorithm based on spectral features, Bao proposes an image matching algorithm based on the elliptic metric spectral feature [18]. Marc-Michel proposes an innovative approach for registration based on the deterministic prediction of the parameters from both images instead of the optimization of an energy criteria [19]. Kim deals with the problem of boundary image matching which finds similar boundary images regardless of partial noise exploiting time-series matching techniques [20]. Some of these image matching algorithms have complex operations, while some can only process binary images, and some have poor adaptability. Firstly, this paper analyzes the noise of electromagnetic leakage emission and restoration sequence images and the method of multi-frame cumulative averaging, as well as the cumulative averaging effect of multi-frame sequence images under the influence of image offset. Secondly, on the basis of theoretical analysis, an algorithm of image migration feature retrieval for electromagnetic leakage restoration sequence is proposed and validated, which achieves more accurate inter-frame matching, <b>automatic</b> <b>offset</b> calculation, and multi-frame sequence image accumulation and enhances the recognition of electromagnetic leakage restoration image. Lastly, different algorithms are compared, and their effects are evaluated as well.|$|R

Furthermore, plume height during explosive volcanism is the primary parameter for estimating mass eruption rate. Knowing the plume altitude is also important to get the correct amount of SO 2 concentration from dedicated spaceborne spectrometers. Moreover, the distribution of ash deposits on ground greatly depends on the ash cloud altitude, which has an impact on risk assessment and crisis management. Furthermore, a spatially detailed plume height measure {{could be used as a}} hint for gas emission rate estimation and for ash plume volume researches, which both have an impact on climate research, air quality assessment for aviation and finally for the understanding of the volcanic system itself as ash/gas emission rates are related to the state of pressurization of the magmatic chamber. Today, the community mainly relies on ground based measurements but often they can be difficult to collect as by definition volcanic areas are dangerous areas (presence of toxic gases) and can be remotely situated and difficult to access. Satellite remote sensing offers a comprehensive and safe way to estimate plume height. Conventional photogrammetric restitution based on satellite imagery fails in precisely retrieving a plume elevation model as the plume own velocity induces an apparent parallax that adds up to the standard parallax given by the stereoscopic view. Therefore, measurements based on standard satellite photogrammeric restitution do not apply as there is an ambiguity in the measurement of the plume position. Standard spaceborne along-track stereo imagers (e. g. SPOT 5, ASTER or Quickbird among the others) present a long temporal lag between the two stereo image acquisitions. It can reach tens of seconds for baseline-to-height ratios (B/H) between 0. 2 and 0. 5, during which time the surface texture of the plume may have changed due to the plume fast displacement (i. e. velocities larger than 10 m/s) biasing <b>automatic</b> cross correlation <b>offset</b> measurements. For the purpose of the plume surface elevation model extraction, the ideal is as small as possible time lag, with still a B/H ratio large enough to provide a stereoscopic view for restituting the height. In this study we present a method to restitute a detailed map of the surface height of a volcanic eruptive column from optical satellite imagery. We call it the volcanic Plume Elevation Model (PEM). As the volcanic plume is moving rapidly, conventional satellite based photogrammetric height restitution methods do not apply as the epipolar offset due to plume motion adds up to the one generated by the stereoscopic view. This is because there are time-lags of tens of seconds between conventional satellite stereoscopic acquisitions, depending on the stereo acquisition mode. Our method is based on a single satellite pass. We exploit the short time lag and resulting baseline that exist between the multispectral (MS) and the panchromatic (PAN) bands to jointly measure the epipolar offsets and the perpendicular to the epipolar (P 2 E) offsets. The former are proportional to plume height plus the offsets due to plume velocity in the epipolar direction. The latter, are proportional to plume velocity in the P 2 E direction only. The latter is used to compensate the effect of plume velocity in the stereoscopic offsets by projecting it on the epipolar direction assuming a known plume direction, thus improving the height measurement precision. We apply the method to Landsat 8 data taking into account the specificities of the focal plane modules. We focus on the Holuhraun 2014 fissure eruption (Iceland) and on Mount Etna (Italy) 2013 episode. We validate our measurements against ground based measurements. The method has potential for detailed high resolution routine measurements of volcanic plume height/velocity. The method can be applied both to other multi focal plane modules push broom sensors (such as the ESA Sentinel 2) and potentially to other push-broom systems such as the CNES SPOT family and Pléiades...|$|R
