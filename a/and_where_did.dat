500|$|That summer, Prokofiev {{completed}} the Divertimento, Op. 43 (which {{he had started}} in 1925) and revised his Sinfonietta, Op. 5/48, a work started in his days at the Conservatory. In October that year, he had a car crash while driving his family back to Paris from their holiday: as the car turned over, Prokofiev pulled some muscles on his left hand. Prokofiev was therefore unable to perform in Moscow during his tour shortly after the accident, but {{he was able to}} enjoy watching performances of his music from the audience. Prokofiev also attended the Bolshoi Theatre's [...] "audition" [...] of his ballet Le pas d'acier, and was interrogated by members of the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM) about the work: he was asked whether the factory portrayed [...] "a capitalist factory, where the worker is a slave, or a Soviet factory, where the worker is the master? If it is a Soviet factory, when <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> Prokofiev examine it, since from 1918 to the present he has been living abroad and came {{here for the first time}} in 1927 for two weeks ?" [...] Prokofiev replied, [...] "That concerns politics, not music, and therefore I won't answer." [...] The RAPM condemned the ballet as a [...] "flat and vulgar anti-Soviet anecdote, a counter-revolutionary composition bordering on Fascism". The Bolshoi had no option but to reject the ballet.|$|E

2500|$|In 1480 the Vespucci family {{commissioned}} a fresco figure of Saint Augustine for the Ognissanti, their parish church, and Botticelli's. [...] Someone else, probably the order running the church, commissioned Domenico Ghirlandaio to do a facing Saint Jerome; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects. [...] As in other cases, such direct competition [...] "was always an inducement to Botticelli {{to put out}} all his powers", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Hebert Lighbown. [...] The open book above the saint contains one of the practical jokes for which Vasari says he was known. [...] Most of the [...] "text" [...] is scribbles, but one line reads: [...] "Where is Brother Martino? He went out. <b>And</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> he go? He is outside Porta al Prato", probably dialogue overheard from [...] the Uumiliati, the order who ran the church. [...] Lightbown suggests that this shows Botticelli thought [...] "the example of Jerome and Augustine likely to be thrown away on the Umiliati as he knew them".|$|E
