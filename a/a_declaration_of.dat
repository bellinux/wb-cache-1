5|$|In 1905, Du Bois {{and several}} other African-American civil rights activists– {{including}} Fredrick L. McGhee, Jesse Max Barber and William Monroe Trotter– met in Canada, near Niagara Falls. There they wrote <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> principles opposing the Atlanta Compromise, and incorporated as the Niagara Movement in 1906.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia, Adams {{promoted}} colonial unity {{while using}} his political skills to lobby other delegates. On September 16, messenger Paul Revere brought Congress the Suffolk Resolves, {{one of many}} resolutions passed in Massachusetts that promised strident resistance to the Coercive Acts. Congress endorsed the Suffolk Resolves, issued <b>a</b> <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Rights that denied Parliament's right to legislate for the colonies, and organized a colonial boycott known as the Continental Association.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent. It also removed the need for <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> {{neutrality}} (which would have granted the Nationalists and Republicans control over neutrals in the areas they controlled), and had little legal standing. In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E

5|$|On 19 May 1991, the Croatian {{government}} held {{a nationwide}} referendum on <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> sovereignty. In Vukovar, as elsewhere in Croatia, hardline Serb nationalists urged Serbs {{to boycott the}} referendum, while moderates advocated using the poll to register opposition to independence. Many local Serbs did vote, but the referendum passed with 94 percent nationally voting in favour.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 10 May 1940 the Dutch awoke {{to the sound of}} {{aircraft}} engines roaring in the sky. Germany had commenced operation Fall Gelb and attacked the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Luxembourg, {{in the case of the}} Low Countries without <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war given before hostilities; France was already at war.|$|E
5|$|The {{peace with}} Britain {{proved to be}} uneasy and controversial. Britain did not {{evacuate}} Malta as promised and protested against Bonaparte's annexation of Piedmont and his Act of Mediation, which established a new Swiss Confederation. Neither of these territories were covered by Amiens, but they inflamed tensions significantly. The dispute culminated in <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war by Britain in May 1803; Napoleon responded by reassembling the invasion camp at Boulogne.|$|E

5|$|With {{fall of the}} Austrian regime, the revolutionaries {{were forced}} to decide what form a new revolutionary state would take. Figures within revolutionary France, such as Jacques Pierre Brissot, praised their work and {{encouraged}} them to declare their own national independence {{in the spirit of}} the American Revolution. On 30 November, <b>a</b> <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Unity was signed between Flanders and the Brabant states. On 20 December, an actual declaration of independence was signed proclaiming the end of Austrian rule and the independence of the states.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the war had}} officially ended, a {{state of}} anarchy and {{lawlessness}} pervaded {{in the first days}} following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70, who headed an interim government with Domitian as the representative of the Flavian family in the Senate. Upon receiving the tidings of his rival's defeat and death at Alexandria, the new Emperor at once forwarded supplies of urgently needed grain to Rome, along with an edict or <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> policy, in which he gave assurance of an entire reversal of the laws of Nero, especially those relating to treason. In early 70, Vespasian was still in Egypt however, continuing to consolidate support from the Egyptians before departing. By the end 70, he finally returned to Rome, and was properly installed as Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons {{working in the}} justice system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required to disclose their membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found {{that there has been}} no evidence of wrongdoing, it was felt that any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E

5|$|If the Spanish monarch ever refused in {{conscience}} {{to grant}} royal assent, a procedure {{similar to the}} Belgian handling of King Baudouin's objection {{would not be possible}} under the current constitution. If the sovereign were ever declared incapable of discharging royal authority, his or her powers would not be transferred to the Cabinet, pending the parliamentary appointment of a regency. Instead, the constitution mandates the next person of age in the line of succession would immediately become regent. Therefore, had Juan Carlos followed the Belgian example in 2005 or 2010, <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> incapacity would have transferred power to Felipe, then the heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|In 1517, Martin Luther, an Augustinian friar in Germany, {{sent his}} Ninety-Five Theses to several bishops. His theses protested key points of Catholic {{doctrine}} {{as well as}} the sale of indulgences. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticised Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the European movement called the Protestant Reformation, which gave birth to a variety of Christian denominations known today collectively as Protestantism. The English Reformation during the reign of Henry VIII began as a political dispute. When the pope denied Henry's petition for <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> nullity of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed, making him head of Church of England, forming Protestant Anglicanism.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{acting on}} these {{feelings}} and perceptions, Stanton joined Mott, Mott's sister Martha Coffin Wright, Jane Hunt {{and a handful}} of other women in Seneca Falls. Together they organized the Seneca Falls Convention held in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20. Over 300 people attended. Stanton drafted <b>a</b> <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Sentiments, which she read at the convention. Modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence, Stanton's declaration proclaimed that men and women are created equal. She proposed, among other things, a then-controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women. The final resolutions, including female suffrage, were passed, in no small measure, because of the support of Frederick Douglass, who attended and informally spoke at the convention.|$|E

5|$|Later, the Finnish statesman J.K. Paasikivi {{commented that}} the Soviet attack, without <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war, {{violated}} three different non-aggression pacts: the Treaty of Tartu of 1920, the Non-aggression Pact between Finland and the Soviet Union signed 1932 and again in 1934, and further the Charter of the League of Nations. The invasion was judged as illegal by the League of Nations, which expelled the Soviet Union on December 14. Following the Soviet attack, C.G.E. Mannerheim was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defense Forces. Furthermore, the Finnish government changed as Risto Ryti was appointed {{the new prime minister}} and Väinö Tanner as foreign minister.|$|E
5|$|On 29 May, Deutschland was {{attacked}} by two Republican planes. It was claimed that their Soviet pilots had mistaken it for the Nationalist ship Canarias, or else had been fired upon by it. 32 sailors were killed, the Kriegsmarine's greatest loss {{of life in the}} war. After a retaliatory attack on Almeria (Valencia had been the original target, but minefields posed too great a problem), Germany came close to withdrawing from the agreement, but British diplomatic efforts to keep Germany patrolling prevailed. After the Germans claimed that Leipzig had been attacked by an unidentified submarine off Oran, it formally withdrew from international patrols to enforce the agreement. Republican minister of defense Indalecio Prieto considered <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war on Germany, but Soviet fear of a world war prevented this.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November British {{warships}} bombarded outer forts in the Dardanelles. Two {{days later}} the United Kingdom extended <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war to the Ottoman Empire, as did France. Due to these attacks, there was a common impression in Britain that Churchill had brought the Ottomans into the war. Prime Minister Lloyd George held this belief for several years to come. In the meantime, Churchill tried to promote {{the advantages of the}} conflict, such as the possibility of territorial gains in the Middle East (the reason that would ultimately bring Italy and Balkans nations like Greece into the war). The Ottoman government finally declared war on the Triple Entente on 11 November. Three days later Ottoman Sultan Mehmed V called for a Jihad campaign by Sunni and Shia Muslims against the Western powers.|$|E

5|$|Reaction in the U.S. Congress to the {{incursion}} {{was also}} swift. Senators Frank F. Church (Democratic Party, Idaho) and John S. Cooper (Republican Party, Kentucky), proposed {{an amendment to}} the Foreign Military Sales Act that would have cut off funding not only for U.S. ground operations and advisors in Cambodia, but would also have ended U.S. air support for Cambodian forces. On 30 June the United States Senate passed the act with the amendment included. The bill was defeated in the House of Representatives after U.S. forces were withdrawn from Cambodia as scheduled. The newly amended act did, however, rescind the Southeast Asia Resolution (better known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution) under which Presidents Johnson and Nixon had conducted military operations for seven years without <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund III's {{crowning}} in Sweden {{took place}} in 1594 amid tensions and instability caused by religious controversies. As Sigismund returned to Poland, his uncle Charles, the regent, took {{the lead of the}} anti-Sigismund Swedish opposition. In 1598 Sigismund attempted to resolve the matter militarily, but the expedition to the country of his origin was defeated at the Battle of Linköping; Sigismund was taken prisoner and had to agree to the harsh conditions imposed. After his return to Poland, in 1599 the Riksdag of the Estates deposed him in Sweden, and Charles led the Swedish forces into Estonia. Sigismund in 1600 proclaimed the incorporation of Estonia into the Commonwealth, which was tantamount to <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war on Sweden, at the height of Rzeczpospolita's involvement in Moldavia region.|$|E
5|$|The President must {{declare the}} office of Prime Minister vacant if the Prime Minister resigns his office, or if the President, acting in his discretion, is {{satisfied}} that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence {{of a majority of}} the MPs. In the latter situation, the President is required first to inform the Prime Minister of his evaluation in this regard, and if the Prime Minister requests him to, the President may dissolve Parliament instead of making <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> vacancy. A general election must be held within three months after the dissolution of Parliament. This gives the former Prime Minister the opportunity to consolidate support by receiving a fresh mandate at the polls.|$|E
