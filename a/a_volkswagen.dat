5|$|Another {{variation}} on the theme was produced later in the season. Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the radiators from the front wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again. The standard radiators were replaced by units from <b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> Golf mounted behind the front wheels out of the airstream in a region of positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|Players {{start off}} with 5 {{vehicles}}, and 5 more are unlockable; the vehicles available range from <b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> New Beetle and a Ford F-350 to a city bus and a Freightliner Century truck. Unlocking vehicles requires completing goals such as placing within the top three of any two races. If the player has previously won a certain race mission, they can change the race's duration and the weather when replaying it. The Checkpoint mode allows players to also set the frequency of traffic, police cars, and pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|Two limited {{editions of}} the globe were made in Berlin in the mid 1930s, one for the Nazi Party and another for German {{dictator}} Adolf Hitler himself. The one made for the Führer was nearly the size of <b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> car and manufactured at a great expense. It changed Abyssinia (today's Ethiopia) to Italian East Africa. The other was made of standard wood with no special features. The actual number of globes produced cannot be verified as the factory that produced the globe, along with its archives, was destroyed in air raids in 1943.|$|E

5|$|As {{the column}} {{approached}} Villers-Bocage, an Sd.Kfz. 231 armoured car crew observed the British advance and escaped. At 08:30, having covered , the 22nd Armoured Brigade group entered {{the town to}} be greeted by celebrating residents; two German soldiers were spotted leaving at high speed in <b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> Kübelwagen. The two Hussar regiments made contact with German forces {{on either side of}} the 22nd Brigade group route and the 8th Hussars engaged German eight-wheeler armoured cars. The Hussars reported German tanks heading towards Villers-Bocage, but Lieutenant Charles Pearce, of 4th CLY, thought that these were probably self-propelled guns.|$|E
5|$|Lois {{hears about}} Brian on TV, and then discovers {{that her parents}} do not love each other, and even raised her {{to believe that a}} {{heterosexual}} couple who hate each other have every right to marry while a homosexual couple who love each other don't. Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding that gay couples who love each other {{have the right to be}} together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for <b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was filmed in various {{locations}} in Albuquerque and Portland. Among the areas filmed included the Rio Grande, junkyards, and near Mercer's home. The clip {{was directed by}} Lance Bangs, an associate of Spike Jonze. It features the band re-enacting the cover art of other bands' albums, including Zen Arcade and New Day Rising by Hüsker Dü, Let It Be by The Replacements, Moon Pix by Cat Power, Double Nickels on the Dime by The Minutemen, Squirrel Bait's first EP, Sonic Youth's Sister and Slint's Spiderland. Shooting in just two cities created logistical problems for album covers originally photographed {{in cities such as}} Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Louisville. For the homage to Double Nickels on the Dime, the band had to track down the exact model of the car featured on the album cover (<b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> Beetle), and Albuquerque happened to have a San Pedro Street, which is featured on a freeway sign on the original cover.|$|E

25|$|In 1984 was the marque's 30th {{anniversary in}} Mexico, for this reason, three {{commemorative}} limited editions were launched.

25|$|GM {{offerings in}} the late 1950s spilled over to European Opel, when the Rekord was made for 1959 (and beyond in {{commercial}} styrene form).

25|$|One of {{the most}} recent {{commissioned}} works is the “Vochol,” <b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> Beetle which was covered in Huichol designs using 2,277,000 beads fastened to the body of the car using a special heat-resistant resin.

25|$|Several {{units of}} the Last Edition Beetle were {{exported}} from Mexico to, mainly, North America and Europe, where {{it had become a}} cult car. Today, <b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> Sedan Última Edición, being the last representative of a lineage of more than 21 million units produced, had increased its value as a collector car at the international level, reaching figures of up to US$15,000.00 in resale.|$|E
25|$|The two {{companies}} continued their collaboration in 1969 {{to make the}} VW-Porsche 914 and Porsche 914-6. (The 914-6 had a 6-cylinder Porsche engine, and the standard 914 had <b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> engine.) Volkswagen and Porsche would collaborate again in 1976 on the Porsche 912-E (USA only) and the Porsche 924, which used many Audi components and was built at Audi's Neckarsulm facilities. The 924 was originally designated for AUDI. Most Porsche 944 models were built there, although they used far fewer VW components.|$|E
25|$|Financing {{their own}} tour, the band drove around {{in an old}} RV {{borrowed}} from Sexton's father, and towed <b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> bus which held their equipment.

All of their equipment and possessions were lost, though no one was seriously injured. The band continued their tour, using borrowed equipment.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving the}} sport, Hulme led the GPDA (Grand Prix Drivers' Association) {{for a brief}} period, but the cut and thrust nature of the post was ill-suited to his gentlemanly nature {{and he did not}} fill the post for very long. He then retired to New Zealand, {{returning}} to touring cars to race occasionally in the Benson & Hedges 500 race at Pukekohe Park Raceway in the late 1970s first in Chrysler Chargers then later <b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> Golf, partnering Stirling Moss on occasion for the 500 kilometre endurance format.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the railway linking the village of Zermatt {{from the town of}} Visp started in 1888. The first train reached Zermatt on July 18, 1891 and the entire line was electrified in 1930. Since 1930 the village is directly connected to St. Moritz by the Glacier Express panoramic train. However there is no connection with the village of Breuil-Cervinia on the Italian side. Travellers have to hire mountain guides to cross the 3,300 metres high glaciated Theodul Pass, separating the two resorts. The town of Zermatt remains almost completely free of internal combustion vehicles and can be reached by train only. (Apart from the local police service which uses <b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> car, only electric vehicles are used locally).|$|E
25|$|The {{purchase}} {{price of the}} 2CV was low relative to its competition. In West Germany during the 1960s, for example, it cost about {{half as much as}} <b>a</b> <b>Volkswagen</b> Beetle. From the mid-1950s economy car competition had increased— internationally {{in the form of the}} 1957 Fiat 500 and 1955 Fiat 600, and 1959 Austin Mini. By 1952, Germany produced a price competitive car - the Messerschmitt KR175, followed in 1955 by the Isetta - these were microcars, not complete four-door cars like the 2CV. On the French home market, from 1961, the small Simca 1000 using licensed Fiat technology, and the larger Renault 4 hatchback had become available. The R4 was the biggest threat to the 2CV, eventually outselling it.|$|E
