5|$|Sai Baba's {{real name}} remains unknown. The name 'Sai' {{was given to}} him by Mhalsapati when he arrived at Shirdi, a town now in the west Indian state of Maharashtra. The word 'Sai' refers to a {{religious}} mendicant but can <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> 'God'. In several Indian and Middle Eastern languages the term 'Baba' is an honorific signifying grandfather, father, old man or sir. Thus Sai Baba denotes holy father, saintly father or (venerable) poor old man.|$|E
5|$|The name Birbhum comes {{probably}} from the term 'land' ('bhumi') of the 'brave' ('bir'). Another theory {{says that the}} district bears the name of Bagdi king Bir Malla, who ruled in the area from 1501 to 1554 CE. Bir in the Santali language means forests; therefore, Birbhum could <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> a land of forests.|$|E
5|$|Henry Ward Beecher became {{involved}} in many social issues of his day, most notably abolition. Though Beecher hated slavery as early as his seminary days, his views were generally more moderate than those of abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison, who advocated {{the breakup of the}} Union if it would <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> the end of slavery. A personal turning point for Beecher came in October 1848 when he learned of two escaped young female slaves who had been recaptured; their father had been offered the chance to ransom them from captivity, and appealed to Beecher to help raise funds. Beecher raised over two thousand dollars to secure the girls' freedom. On June 1, 1856, he held another mock slave auction to purchase the freedom of a young woman named Sarah.|$|E

5|$|Peat {{is found}} in thick, {{plentiful}} layers across the Pennines and Scottish Borders, {{and there are many}} large coalfields, including the Great Northern, Lancashire and South Yorkshire Coalfields. Millstone grit, a distinctive coarse-grained rock used to make millstones, is widespread in the Pennines, and the variety of other rock types is reflected in the architecture of the region, such as the bright red sandstone seen in buildings in Chester, the cream-buff Yorkstone and the distinctive purple Doddington sandstone. These sandstones <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> that apart from the east coast, most of Northern England has very soft water, and this has influenced not just industry, but even the blends of tea enjoyed in the region.|$|E
5|$|The local {{gravitational}} acceleration at the poles {{is greater than}} at the equator, so, by the Von Zeipel theorem, the local luminosity is also higher at the poles. This {{is seen as a}} variation in effective temperature over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000K, while the equatorial temperature is 7,600K. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator, then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole. This large temperature difference between the poles and the equator produces a strong 'gravity darkening' effect. As viewed from the poles, this results in a darker (lower intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star. The temperature gradient may <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> Vega has a convection zone around the equator, while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|In 627, Honorius was consecrated as {{archbishop}} by Paulinus of York at Lincoln. Honorius {{wrote to}} Pope Honorius I asking the pope {{to raise the}} see of York to an archbishopric, so that when one archbishop in England died, the other {{would be able to}} consecrate the deceased bishop's successor. The pope agreed, and sent a pallium for Paulinus, but by this time, Paulinus had already been forced to flee from Northumbria. When Paulinus, after the death of King Edwin of Northumbria in October 633, fled Northumbria, he was received by Honorius and appointed to the bishopric of Rochester. The papal letter is dated to June 634, and implies that news of Edwin's death had not reached the pope. This evidence may mean that the traditional date of Edwin's death may need to be moved to October 634. The papal letter may <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> that the traditional date of consecration for Honorius may need re-dating, as the long gap between 627, when he {{is said to have been}} consecrated, and 634, when he finally received a pallium, is much longer than usually found. It may be that Honorius was consecrated closer to 634. The papal letter to Honorius is given in the Ecclesiastical History of the medieval writer Bede.|$|E

5|$|According to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon's Temple {{was built}} atop {{what is known}} as the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and {{destroyed}} by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, and the Second Temple completed and dedicated in 516 BCE. Around 19 BCE Herod the Great began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, doubling it in size. Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall. The excavators came upon the coins inside a ritual bath that predates Herod's building project, which was filled in to create an even base for the wall and was located under its southern section. This seems to indicate that Herod did not finish building the entire wall by the time of his death in 4 BCE. The find confirms the description by historian Josephus Flavius, which states that construction was finished only during the reign of King Agrippa II, Herodâ€™s great-grandson. Given Josephus' information, the surprise mainly regarded the fact that an unfinished retaining wall in this area could <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> that at least parts of the splendid Royal Stoa and the monumental staircase leading up to it could not have been completed during Herod's lifetime. Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock. Some scholars are doubtful of the interpretation and have offered alternative explanations, such as, for example, later repair work.|$|E
