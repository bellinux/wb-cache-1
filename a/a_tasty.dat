5|$|In the {{traditional}} cottage garden, hedges served as fences {{on the perimeter}} to keep out marauding livestock and for privacy, along with other practical uses. Hawthorn leaves made <b>a</b> <b>tasty</b> snack or tea, while the flowers were used for making wine. The fast-growing Elderberry, in addition to creating a hedge, provided berries for food and wine, with the flowers being fried in batter or made into lotions and ointments. The wood had many uses, including toys, pegs, skewers, and fishing poles. Holly was another hedge plant, useful because it quickly spread and self-seeded. Privet was also a convenient and fast-growing hedge. Over time, more ornamental and less utilitarian plants became popular cottage garden hedges, including laurel, lilac, snowberry, japonica, and others.|$|E

25|$|An {{unintended}} {{benefit of}} the round goby's introduction is that the Lake Erie watersnake, once listed as a threatened species, has found the goby to be <b>a</b> <b>tasty</b> addition to its diet. A recent study found the introduced fish now accounts for up to 90% of the snake's diet. The new food supply means that the water snake is now staging a comeback.

25|$|The Top 3, Sophie, Bill and Fenton {{had just}} two final {{challenges}} to complete. The {{first was the}} last chance {{to work on their}} presenting skills with Mark and Julia. Mark held a Cue card which they were required to read while looking down the camera and deliver it with as much personality as possible. Mark was looking for someone with the ability to engage the audience. Bill and Sophie struggled with their delivery while big Fenton nailed it in one take, getting a round of applause from both judges. Then it was off to one of Sydney's best fine dining experiences, Mint bar and dining. Once there they had one last attempt to impress 5 VIP's with a signature dish under the keen eye of Ben O'Donoghue. This showed another side of Ben that the contestants had yet to see, a no nonsense head chef barking orders at them in the kitchen and putting the pressure on to get the meals out as efficiently as possible. Sophie served up a very fresh and light Mexican chicken with <b>a</b> <b>tasty</b> salad including heart of palm and pistachio. The food critiques were very impressed. Next up Bill aimed to impress with his dish, crayfish cooked in herb butter and served with a salad. The reaction was the same all round from the judges, not good. The presentation was lacking and the salad didn't suit the dish. Owner of Mint remarked 'It's like two different dishes on one plate.' Finally Fenton from Queensland served up an eye fillet with hollandaise and potato rösti (a favourite at his restaurant.) While one judge thought the beef was the best stating 'he (Fenton) put his whole life on the BBQ and served it up for us.' it was Sophie's chicken that got the majority of the VIP judges vote and won her ticket through to the grand finale. That left Fenton and Bill. Ben then announced that Bill would be going home and Fenton was going through. But then in a final twist, Chef Ben O'Donoghue decided to bring Bill back because he felt that he had let him down with his direction in the kitchen. So the Top 2 was again the Top 3 with all contestants going into the final with the winner announced on Australia Day.|$|E

500|$|... "Liquor Store Blues" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews by most music critics. Tyrone S.

[...] The addition of Damien Marley made the track [...] "more alluring". DJ Gravy praised the fact that the song [...] "has a more authentic yard vibe, thanks to Black Chiney's Supa Dups", when comparing it to Mars and Travis McCoy's [...] "Billionaire". Slant Magazines Eric Henderson panned the song as [...] "sway gently with a hint of reggae swagger". Kevin Barber from the Consequence of Sound, who positively reviewed the album, wrote [...] "In return for all of his generous favors he has given other artists, they give back as well. Damien Marley joins him on the reggae jam". Idolator's writer Robbie Daw had a mixed opinion towards the song by writing that the recording [...] "isn’t nearly as infectious as [...] "Just The Way You Are", [...] it should still make for a fairly decent album track in what we’re hoping is <b>a</b> <b>tasty</b> plateful of catchy future singles". He found the tune to be [...] "reggae-tinged jam". Scott Mervis of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] "Liquor Store Blues" [...] was in a [...] "heavier dub zone with toaster Damian Marley" [...] furthering a personal matter [...] "the young singer should have stuck to the liquor store 'cause he was busted for cocaine in Vegas last month". Andrew Winistorfer of Prefix Magazine criticized the artist, saying [...] "After conquering the ladies who love weak pop music that is sung by a competent if boring singer, Bruno Mars has decided to try to carve off a chunk of Sublime's fans". He concluded by deeming the recording a [...] "faux reggae track". A writer for Rap-Up magazine commented that the recording's lyrics regard [...] "a quick escape from his bad fortune in an odd foreshadowing of events". Similarly, while reviewing the music video, Entertainment Weeklys, Brad Wete stated that the content of the lyrics saying [...] "Mars aims to [...] "get messed up today" [...] in hopes that he’ll [...] "be okay tomorrow"".|$|E
2500|$|Navitaire {{urged that}} easyJet's {{studying}} the OpenRes system's functionality resulted in taking {{a substantial part}} of the source code, was similar to reading a novel, taking the plot, and using that same plot in a new novel. [...] However, the court disagreed with this reasoning and found that computer programs and code were not like a novel. Instead, the court found that the case was more like a chef who invents pudding using a different recipe than original, but derives a similar result. [...] That is, one chef after several tries comes up with <b>a</b> <b>tasty</b> pudding dish and writes down the recipe. Another chef then tries it and decides to recreate it, but comes up with his own recipe. This would not be considered infringement as although the results were the same, the means to derive them were different.|$|E
2500|$|Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times {{praises the}} show's ability to [...] "anchor fantasy with vivid and {{recognizable}} human psychology" [...] and declares that {{the series is}} [...] "not just a cult hit but a significant piece of television." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune describes it as a [...] "sprawling, enthralling tale of human survival" [...] that is [...] "full of political allegories and fascinating, multifaceted characters." [...] She finds, [...] "Like Deadwood, Battlestar Galactica is interested in exploring how a society on the edge decides to govern itself. What rights and actions are sacrosanct, which are outlawed, {{when most of the}} human race is eliminated? ... Thanks to a stellar cast and brave writing, Battlestar soars." [...] Throughout its run, the series has often surprised reviewers with its many twists and turns. Ryan comments: [...] "There’s nothing like a good Battlestar plot twist to make your head spin, but the 'holy cow' moments aren’t the main point (though they’re one heck of <b>a</b> <b>tasty</b> side dish). The show and its twists and turns are grounded in deep curiosity about human nature, and how contradictory and confounding it can be." ...|$|E

METHODS: Data on the ingredients of the Polymeal were taken from the literature. The evidence based recipe included wine, fish, dark chocolate, fruits, vegetables, garlic, and almonds.

60|$|When we {{emerged from}} these hushed places of danger Cyrano took {{us all to}} his dug-out, which was <b>a</b> <b>tasty</b> little cottage carved {{from the side of}} a hill and faced with logs.

It was a fine, mediaeval bit of work, with Venus, in her traditional costume, in the centre of it. It seemed the last touch in the picture of the gallant, virile Cyrano. I only met him this once, nor shall I ever see him again, yet he stands a thing complete within my memory. Even now as I write these lines he walks the leafy paths of the Argonne, his fierce eyes ever searching for the Boche workers, his red moustache bristling over their annihilation.

Also, the doctor and his wife, who admired the massive frame of [...] "Columbus," [...] but said not {{a word about the}} picture itself. Also, Mr. Bullivant, the sculptor, and Mr. Hemlock, the journalist, exchanging solemnly that critical small talk, in which such words as [...] "sensuous," [...] "aesthetic," [...] "objective," [...] and [...] "subjective," [...] occupy prominent places, and out of which no man ever has succeeded, or ever will succeed, in extricating an idea. Also, Mr. Gimble, fluently laudatory, with the whole alphabet of Art-Jargon at his fingers' ends, and without the slightest comprehension of the subject to embarrass him in his flow of language. Also, certain respectable families who tried vainly to understand the pictures, opposed by other respectable families who never tried at all, but confined themselves exclusively to the Dowager Countess. Also, the obscure general visitors, who more than made up in enthusiasm what they wanted in distinction. And, finally, the absolute democracy, or downright low-life party among the spectators--represented for the time being by Mr. Blyth's gardener, and Mr. Blyth's cook's father--who, standing together modestly outside the door, agreed, in awe-struck whispers, that the [...] "Golden Age" [...] was <b>a</b> <b>Tasty</b> Thing, and [...] "Columbus in sight of the New World," [...] a Beautiful Piece.|$|E

5000|$|The {{approach}} {{relies on}} a combination of companion crops to be planted around and among maize or sorghum. Both domestic and wild grasses can help to protect the crops by attracting and trapping the stemborers. The grasses are planted in the border around the maize and sorghum fields where invading adult moths become attracted to chemicals emitted by the grasses themselves. Instead of landing on the maize or sorghum plants, the insects head for what appears to be <b>a</b> <b>tastier</b> meal. These grasses provide the [...] "pull" [...] in the [...] "push-pull" [...] strategy. They also serve as a haven for the borers' natural enemies. Good trap crops include well-known grasses such as Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and Sudan grass (Sorghum vulgare sudanense). Napier grass has a particularly effective way of defending itself against the pests: once attacked by a borer larva, it secretes a sticky substance which physically traps the pest and limits its damage.|$|R
