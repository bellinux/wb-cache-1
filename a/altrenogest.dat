40|$|Synchronization of the {{oestrous cycle}} of gilts using <b>altrenogest</b> {{treatment}} {{has been found}} to increase ovulation rate. The current experiment investigated if the increase in ovulation rate after <b>altrenogest</b> treatment is related to increased follicle size at the end of <b>altrenogest</b> treatment compared with late luteal phase follicles. Crossbred gilts (n = 15) received <b>altrenogest</b> during 18 days [20 mg Regumate (Janssen Animal Health, Beerse, Belgium) ], starting 5 ¿ 7 days after onset of first oestrus. Control gilts (n = 15) did not receive <b>altrenogest.</b> At days 10 ¿ 12 of the oestrous cycle [i. e. in the presence of corpora lutea (CL) ], average follicle development was 2. 51 ± 0. 20 mm (assessed with ultrasound) in altrenogest-treated gilts and 2. 58 ± 0. 16 mm in control gilts (p > 0. 10). During the last days of <b>altrenogest</b> treatment (i. e. when CL had gone into regression), average follicle size had increased to 3. 01 ± 0. 31 mm (p < 0. 05). Subsequent ovulation rate was 16. 6 ± 1. 7 in <b>altrenogest</b> treated gilts and 15. 1 ± 1. 2 in control gilts (p < 0. 05). <b>Altrenogest</b> treatment resulted in increased follicle size after regression of the CL, showing that suppression of follicle growth by <b>altrenogest</b> alone is less severe than suppression by endogenous progesterone (either with or without <b>altrenogest).</b> <b>Altrenogest</b> treatment also resulted in a higher ovulation rate.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine the effects of a synthetic progestogen (<b>altrenogest)</b> on growth and carcass characteristics of boars. <b>Altrenogest</b> inhibited both the growth of the testes and the pubertal rise in testosterone that is associated with maleness.

These changes appeared to be related to marked mounting activity of boars beginning 5 days after withdrawal of <b>altrenogest</b> from the feed. Feeding <b>altrenogest</b> to growing boars had no negative effects on carcass qualitative traits, but intensity of boar odor in fat was not diminished in treated boars.

40|$|A severe {{negative}} {{energy balance}} during first lactation {{may result in}} poor reproductive performance in the second litter. Allowing the sow recovery time after weaning by inseminating the sow the second estrus after weaning (skip a heat) improves reproductive performance. Postponing estrus for a shorter period after weaning using daily <b>altrenogest</b> administration has also been found to influence reproductive performance. The aim of this thesis {{was to develop a}} better understanding of consequences of <b>altrenogest</b> after weaning for follicle development and subsequent reproductive performance. Therefore, a first experiment investigated follicle development during and after post weaning <b>altrenogest</b> treatments and related this to subsequent fertility. It showed that follicle size increased during <b>altrenogest</b> treatment (independent of dose and duration), but no effects were found on fertility parameters on day 5 of gestation. Therefore, a second experiment studiedthe effect of duration of treatment on follicle development and subsequent farrowing rate and litter size. This experiment showed again an increase in follicle size and also showed that long <b>altrenogest</b> treatments (15 d) improve fertility, but that shorter treatments (8 d) reduce farrowing rates in sows with large follicles at weaning.   So, to prevent outgrowth of follicles before weaning a third experiment started <b>altrenogest</b> treatment 3 d before weaning. This did not suppress follicle growth, but fertility was improved after <b>altrenogest</b> treatment in primiparous sows with compromised body condition at weaning. A fourth experiment attempted to stimulate follicle growth before weaning using split-weaning (reducing litter size to the 6 smallest piglets 3 d before complete weaning) and found that  split-weaning resulted in lower embryonic survival, especially in sows with large follicles at weaning or high follicle growth during treatment. Because in all experiments sows showed follicle growth during <b>altrenogest</b> treatment, it was suspected that LH release was not completely suppressed during <b>altrenogest</b> treatment. Therefore, a fifth experiment investigated LH pulsatility during the last day of <b>altrenogest</b> treatment and indeed showed that LH release was suppressed during only a part of the 24 h between <b>altrenogest</b> administrations. Finally a last experiment showed a release pattern of both FSH and estradiol that varied over the day related with the moment of daily <b>altrenogest</b> administration. Further, a decrease of estrogenic activity was found during the second week of post weaning <b>altrenogest</b> treatment, probably as a result of reduced LH responsiveness. The level of estrogenic activity was related to weight loss during lactation. Therefore, it is assumed that LH and FSH release during <b>altrenogest</b> treatment stimulate follicle growth, but that levels are not high enough to sustain outgrowth of the follicles to pre-ovulatory sizes and, as a result, follicles go into atresia after on average 5 - 8 d of treatment. This may explain why long <b>altrenogest</b> treatments (12 - 15 d) result in improved fertility, short <b>altrenogest</b> treatments (3 - 4 d) have little effect on fertility and intermediate <b>altrenogest</b> treatments (5 - 8 d) may reduce fertility.  As there is large variation between sows (parity, lactational burden, follicle size), this may also affect their response to <b>altrenogest</b> treatment. In general, to improve reproductive performance, it is recommended to start <b>altrenogest</b> treatment 3 - 6 h before weaning and to apply intermediate treatments (5 - 8 d) only in primiparous sows that suffered a severe lactational burden and are in low body condition at weaning.  ...|$|E

40|$|In our experience, <b>altrenogest</b> has {{not always}} been able to exert {{predictable}} control over the estrous cycle of the mare. Therefore, we examined 12 mares that were treated with <b>altrenogest</b> to identify reasons for its failure to control the estrous cycle. The mares were fed <b>altrenogest</b> for 15 to 20 days and were examined for follicle development, ovulation, and corpus luteum formation during treatment. Through the use of real-time ultrasonography and radioimmunoassay for progesterone, we concluded that <b>altrenogest</b> was unable to suppress the growth of follicles to preovulatory size in some mares, leading to ovulation during treatment or earlier than expected after the end of treatment. In addition, <b>altrenogest</b> did not appear to shorten the life-spans of the corpora lutea that were formed during treatment; in 4 mares, this resulted in the persistence of corpora lutea {{after the end of the}} suggested 15 -day periods of treatment.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{we showed that}} follicle size at weaning affects a sow’s response to a short <b>altrenogest</b> treatment after weaning. In this study, {{an attempt was made}} to prevent growth of follicles into larger size categories before weaning using different <b>altrenogest</b> treatments before weaning to improve reproductive performance after postweaning <b>altrenogest</b> treatments. Sows (87 primiparous and 130 multiparous) were assigned to: control (no <b>altrenogest</b> treatment; n = 59), RU 0 - 20 (20 mg <b>altrenogest,</b> d - 1 to d 6; weaning = d 0; n = 53), RU 40 - 20 (40 mg <b>altrenogest,</b> d - 3 to d 0 and 20 mg <b>altrenogest</b> d 1 to d 6; n = 53), and RU 20 - 20 (20 mg <b>altrenogest,</b> d - 3 to d 6; n = 52). Follicle size was assessed daily with trans-abdominal ultrasound. Follicle size on d - 3 (3. 6 ± 0. 7 mm) and at weaning (4. 0 ± 0. 7 mm) was similar for all treatments. Altrenogest-treated sows had larger follicles {{at the start of the}} follicular phase than control sows (5. 4 ± 0. 1 and 3. 8 ± 0. 2 mm, LS Means, respectively; P < 0. 0001) and on d 4 of the follicular phase (8. 0 ± 0. 1 and 6. 7 ± 0. 2 mm, LS Means, respectively; P < 0. 0001). Multiparous sows had larger follicles than primiparous sows at the start of the follicular phase (5. 3 ± 0. 1 and 4. 7 ± 0. 1 mm, LS Means, respectively; P < 0. 01) and on d 4 of the follicular phase (8. 0 ± 0. 1 and 7. 0 ± 0. 1 mm, LS Means, respectively; P < 0. 0001). Farrowing rate and litter size (born alive + dead) were not affected by treatment or parity. However, in primiparous sows, when mummies were included in litter size, <b>altrenogest</b> sows had larger litters than control sows (13. 4 ± 0. 5 and 11. 9 ± 0. 7 piglets, respectively; P = 0. 02).

40|$|Use of oral <b>altrenogest</b> as {{exogenous}} progesterone (P 4) in mares in {{an effort}} to maintain high-risk pregnancies is a widespread practice. Treatment is sometimes initiated as early as 2 days after ovulation. Timing when it can safely be stopped is frequently uncertain and therefore, supplementation is often continued until 100 - 120 days, when the placental secretion of progestagens has taken over. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if <b>altrenogest</b> interfered with progesterone assay and if timing of <b>altrenogest</b> administration discontinuation could be based on the blood concentration of P 4. Data were obtained from 7 healthy standard breed mares in seasonal anoestrus and in dioestrus. Mares were considered anoestrus when no follicles larger than 15 mm in diameter or corpus luteum (CL) were found at 2 consequent ultrasound examinations 7 days apart. They were confirmed dioestrus based on an observed ovulation and the presence of a CL 2 days after. Mares were treated with 0. 044 mg/kg of <b>altrenogest</b> (Regumate®, Intervet, Boxmeer, Netherlands) orally once per day during 12 days beginning at any time for the anestrus group and at day 2 after ovulation for the dioestrus group. Blood was collected at day 0, 6, 12, 18 right before <b>altrenogest</b> administration and the serum was stored at - 20 °C until analysis. P 4 concentration was obtained by radioimmunoassay and <b>altrenogest</b> by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Differences in P 4 and in <b>altrenogest</b> concentrations between different sampling days were determined by Friedman non parametric test. Concentrations of <b>altrenogest</b> before treatment were almost not detectable (negative control). At day 6, they were significantly higher (p< 0. 05), and were back to basal, almost not detectable values at day 18, in both groups. P 4 concentration was basal with values < 0. 4 ng/ml all through the experiment in the anoestrus group. In the dioestrus group, P 4 concentration was variable from one mare to another, but it was significantly higher in mid-dioestrus (day 6) as compared to the time of the impending next oestrus (day 12). No cross-reaction between P 4 and <b>altrenogest</b> assays was observed as illustrated by the fact that concentration of P 4 during anoestrus remained basal with or without supplementation. Despite the treatment, the variation of P 4 over time was as expected in both groups. <b>Altrenogest</b> was no longer detectable 6 days after the last administration. Further studies with larger numbers and sampling in dioestrus to compare P 4 levels in treated and untreated mares to investigate the potential effect of <b>altrenogest</b> on endogenous P 4 production by the CL are needed.

Plasma concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, estrogen conjugates, and inhibin were determined. Within each experiment, an analysis of variance procedure was used to compare the change from pretreatment values to values at the end of treatment, 30 days post treatment, and 60 days post-treatment between the treated and control stallions. Both dosages of <b>altrenogest</b> decreased the total number of strikes toward another stallion (p 0. 05). Testicular volume and DSO were also unaffected by both dosages (p> 0. 05). The label dosage decreased concentrations of testosterone, estrogen conjugates, and inhibin (p< 0. 05) at the end of treatment. The double dosage decreased concentrations of LH and inhibin (p< 0. 05) at the end of treatment. The concentration of LH returned to pretreatment values by 30 days post-treatment. These data suggest that <b>altrenogest</b> may act at the level of the hypothalamus and/or pituitary gland. Suppression of LH response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GNRH) administration for up to 60 days after the double dosage of <b>altrenogest</b> treatment suggests <b>altrenogest</b> has a prolonged effect on pituitary responsiveness to GNRH. The effectiveness of <b>altrenogest</b> therapy, as a means to alter objectionable behavior in stallions, remains questionable...|$|E

In experiment I, nine pony mares were bred, and started on <b>altrenogest</b> treatment on Day 4 after ovulation. On Day 10 after ovulation, these mares were given an intramuscular injection of prostaglandin F₂∞ (PGF, 3 mg) in order to regress their corpora lutea (endogenous progesterone source). Frequent rectal palpation of reproductive tracts indicated that seven of the nine mares were pregnant at Day 35. Four of these mares maintained pregnancy through Day 85 of gestation, at which time the pregnancies were terminated. Plasma progesterone levels were monitored indicating that the primary corpora lutea regressed following the Day 10 PGF and that secondary corpora lutea formed in the pregnant mares between Days 32 and 85.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} study, {{based on}} 60 990 farrowing records from 35 commercial herds, {{was performed to}} determine the incidence of early parturition (< 114 d) and to investigate the relationship between early parturition and total number of piglets born, number of piglets born alive and percentage of stillborn piglets per litter. The mean gestation length was 115. 4 +/- 1. 62 d, and early parturition occurred in 10 % of all farrowing records. Sows with early parturition had significantly more stillborn piglets and a larger litter size compared to sows with a normal gestation length (114 - 117 d). Sows with a gestation length < 114 d were 1. 2 times (95 % CI: 1. 19 - 1. 21; p < 0. 001) {{more likely to have}} an early parturition at the subsequent parity. A second study was performed in four herds (n = 329) to investigate the efficacy of <b>altrenogest</b> administration on 110 - 112 d (T 112) or 111 - 113 d (T 113) of gestation for preventing early parturition and to investigate the effect of this treatment on the reproductive performance of sows. The interval between the last <b>altrenogest</b> treatment and the onset of parturition was 3. 3 +/- 1. 32 (T 112) or 2. 0 +/- 0. 89 (T 113) days. The gestation length of sows of the <b>altrenogest</b> group (T 112 + T 113) (115. 3 +/- 1. 23 d) was significantly longer compared to gestation length of the non-treated sows (114. 7 +/- 1. 69 d) (p < 0. 01). <b>Altrenogest</b> treatment had no negative effect on the reproductive performances of the sows.

40|$|Progesterone supplementation {{during early}} {{pregnancy}} may increase embryo survival in pigs. The current study evaluated whether oral supplementation with an analogue of progesterone, <b>altrenogest</b> (ALT), affects embryo survival. A first experiment evaluated {{the effect of}} a daily 20 -mg dosage of ALT during days 1 – 4 or 2 – 4 after onset of oestrus on embryo survival at day 42 of pregnancy. A control group (CTR 1) was not treated. The time of ovulation was estimated by transrectal ultrasound at 12 -h intervals. <b>Altrenogest</b> treatment significantly reduced pregnancy rate when start of treatment was before or at ovulation: 25 % (5 / 20) compared to later start of treatment [85 % (28 / 33) ] and non-treated CTR 1 [100 % (23 / 23) ]. <b>Altrenogest</b> treatment also reduced (p < 0. 05) number of foetuses, from 14. 6 ± 2. 6 in CTR 1 to 12. 5 ± 2. 5 when ALT started 1 – 1. 5 days from ovulation and 10. 7 ± 2. 9 when ALT started 0 – 0. 5 days from ovulation. In a second experiment, sows with a weaning-to-oestrous interval (WOI) of 6, 7 or 8 – 14 days were given ALT [either 20 mg (ALT 20; n = 49) or 10 mg (ALT 10; n = 48) ] at day 4 and day 6 after onset of oestrus or were not treated (CTR 2; n = 49), and farrowing rate and litter size were evaluated. Weaning-to-oestrous interval did not affect farrowing rate or litter size. ALT did not affect farrowing rate (86 % vs 90 % in CTR 2), but ALT 20 tended to have a lower litter size compared with CTR 2 (11. 7 ± 4. 1 vs 13. 3 ± 3. 1; p = 0. 07) and ALT 10 was intermediate (12. 3 ± 2. 9). In conclusion, <b>altrenogest</b> supplementation too soon after ovulation reduces fertilization rate and embryo survival rate and <b>altrenogest</b> supplementation at 4 – 6 days of pregnancy reduces litter size. As a consequence, <b>altrenogest</b> supplementation during early pregnancy may reduce both farrowing rate and litter size and cannot be applied at this stage in practice as a remedy against low litter size...|$|E
40|$|This {{study used}} split-weaning (SW) to induce {{differences}} in follicle size at weaning and study its consequences for follicle development {{during and after}} post-weaning <b>altrenogest</b> feeding and for reproductive performance. Multiparous sows (n = 47) were assigned to SW (n = 23; litter size reduced to the six smallest piglets 3 days before weaning) or control (C; n = 24; normal weaning). <b>Altrenogest</b> (20 mg/day) was fed to all 47 sows from Day - 1 till Day 5 (complete weaning = Day 0). Follicle size on Day 1, 2 and 8 was smaller in C than in SW (p = 0. 05). Ovulation rate was similar, but C sows had higher embryo survival rate (ESR) than SW sows (83 ± 19 and 58 ± 31 %, respectively; p = 0. 001). SW sows with low ESR (63 %; n = 10; p = 0. 04). A decrease in follicle size between Day 5 and 6 of <b>altrenogest</b> feeding was associated with increased ESR in both treatments (p = 0. 002). Follicle pool analyses (assessment of all follicles > 2 mm) revealed that on Day 3, sows with low ESR had a higher % of follicles > 5 mm compared with sows with high ESR (30 % vs 10 %; p = 0. 04). Thus, sows in which follicle growth was less suppressed during <b>altrenogest</b> feeding had a lower ESR.

Estrogen from a growing follicle stimulates the preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) unlike the suppressive effects of progesterone. The possibility exists that administration of progesterone, in the presence of an ovulatory follicle, would sufficiently suppress LH thereby delaying ovulation. The objective of this experiment was to elucidate the potential for oral administration of <b>altrenogest</b> (17 -Allyl- 17 phydroxyestra- 4, 9, 1 1 -trien- 3 -one) to postpone ovulation of a preovulatory follicle (35 mm) for greater than 48 h. Fourteen light horse mares, ranging in age from 2 - 19 y were randomly assigned to three treatments (A-. 044 mg/kg BW; B-. 088 mg/kg BW; and no <b>altrenogest)</b> over three consecutive estrous cycles. Mares received the treatment dose when a > 35 mm follicle was observed via transrectal ultrasonography. Control mares were bred on the first day a 35 mm follicle was first detected and every other day until ovulation. Treated mares were given <b>altrenogest</b> for the first two days. Beginning on the fifth day after initiation of treatment, the mares were bred every other day until ovulation. LH was determined during estrus on daily blood samples collected via jugular venipuncture using a double-antibody RIA. The intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 1. 39 % and 5. 39 %, respectively. When number of days to ovulation, follicular activity, and mean LH concentration were analyzed, no difference was found due to a period by treatment interaction.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the endocrine background of follicle size changes during post-weaning <b>altrenogest</b> treatment. altrenogest-treated sows received a 20 -mg dosage daily at 8. 00 a. m. from Day – 1 to Day 14 after weaning. On Day – 1, only 3 / 13 altrenogest-treated sows showed LH pulses compared with 8 / 8 control sows (P = 0. 001). On Day 0, control sows showed a typical high frequency–low amplitude LH pattern, indicative for recruitment of oestrogenic follicles. In altrenogest-treated animals on Day 0, half of the sows showed high frequency–high amplitude pulses from 4 – 5 h after weaning. In altrenogest-treated sows, average follicle size increased from 3. 1 ± 0. 5 mm on Day 0 to 4. 4 ± 0. 6 mm on Day 5, then decreased to 3. 7 ± 0. 5 mm on Day 7 and stabilised thereafter. FSH and oestradiol (E 2) concentrations showed a distinct diurnal pattern; high at 7. 00 a. m. and low at 3. 00 p. m. E 2 concentrations (7. 00 a. m.) showed a 2. 5 -fold increase from Day – 1 to Day 2, and subsequently a 2 -fold decline to reach a plateau at Day 8. FSH concentrations reached maximum levels by Day 5 and slowly declined afterwards. In conclusion, once-daily administration of <b>altrenogest</b> starting one day before weaning delays the weaning-induced increase in LH pulses. Although FSH and follicle size increase until Day 5 after weaning, follicle E 2 production already decreased from Day 2 after weaning. Post-weaning <b>altrenogest</b> treatment thus results in a follicular wave of follicles that lose oestrogenic competence at Day 2 after weaning, presumably related to the changed LH dynamics during <b>altrenogest</b> treatment...|$|E
