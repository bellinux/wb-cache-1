40|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> {{the recent}} <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>Annex</b> VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (a. k. a. “MARPOL 73 / 78 ”), the international shipping industry is currently meeting sulfur emission caps by blending and burning higher priced distillate fuels. In the short-term, while emission caps are relatively high (e. g., easy to attain compliance), {{it is easier}} and arguably cheaper to opt for distillates. However, as those sulfur caps fall in the coming years, {{in accordance with the}} schedule put forth by the International Maritime Organization, more marine distillate will be needed to meet regulations. Despite its inherent environmental and health benefits, said demand will have adverse effects on global supply and in turn price of transportation fuels. Nonetheless, technologies currently exist in the marketplace that remove the sulfur from the vessel’s exhaust gas stream post-combustion and allow for the use of lower grade and lower priced residual fuels (instead of high priced distillates). This masters’ project highlights the current sulfur abatement technologies in the market, specifically exhaust gas cleaning systems or “scrubbers”, and how ship owners and operators can meet sulfur regulations economically. It makes a case for said scrubbers and looks deeper into the levers of financial feasibility of these devices, both presently and in the future. Additionally, it addresses some of the possible effects of a wholesale transition to distillates by the marine shipping industry and its adverse effects on the global marketplace...|$|R
40|$|International {{shipping}} carries 80 {{per cent}} of global trade by volume and over 70 per cent by value. This significant global activity {{comes with the}} concern that the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping lead to adverse effects on climate, human health and marine ecosystems. There have been international efforts {{to address this problem}} by improving regulation, principally by the United Nations (UN), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the shipping industry, flag States and port States. The international climate change regime under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process and the IMO through its Marine Environment Protection Committee have been grappling with this issue, and GHG emissions from international shipping have been partially regulated by <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>Annex</b> VI <b>to</b> the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73 / 78) in 2011 and 2014. This thesis examines the evolution and adequacy of the current regulatory framework for the reduction of GHG emissions from international shipping. It discusses the applicability of international environmental law principles to the reduction of GHG emissions from ships and assesses the responses of the key stakeholders to the challenge of reducing GHG emissions. These responses and legal principles are then analysed to identify gaps in the regulatory framework. It concludes that there are deficiencies in the current legal, policy and institutional frameworks regulating GHG emissions from international shipping. The thesis proposes options for legal and institutional reforms to improve the regulatory framework for the reduction of GHG emissions from international shipping...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{maritime}} accidents {{have been}} caused by corrosion, and this has led to stringent regulations concerning protective coatings for ballast tanks. The Coating Performance Standard for Ballast Tank Coatings (PSPC), became effective in 2008. It specifies how protective coatings should be applied during vessel construction with the intention of giving a coating a 15-year service life. Additional regulations, such as those established by The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water & Sediments (SBWS) sought to avoid introducing invasive species throughout the world through ship's ballast tanks. [...] The methods used to avoid having these invasive species surviving in ballast tanks however greatly increased the rate of corrosion. Therefore ongoing research attempts to find water treatment systems that kill invasive species, while not having a destructive effect on the ballast tank coatings. As double-hulled tankers were introduced it meant that there was more ballast tank area had to be coated and therefore a greater capital investment for ship owners. With the onset of the OPA 90 and later the <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> MARPOL <b>annex</b> 1, single hull tankers (without alternative method) have basically phased out.|$|R
