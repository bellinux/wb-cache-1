5|$|In the {{two centuries}} since the hurricane, the oceans rose about , the {{wetlands}} around New Orleans have diminished, and the elevation has dropped due to subsidence. These {{have increased the}} threat to the city of a significant hurricane strike. The 1812 hurricane was not <b>a</b> <b>worst-case</b> scenario for New Orleans, as a stronger and larger hurricane would have caused more damage. If the storm struck in 2012, one researcher estimated the hurricane would have been among the costliest Louisiana hurricanes, comparable to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico, prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London. Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2. Anticipation {{of a threat to}} supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in the price move. In New Orleans, officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as <b>a</b> <b>worst-case</b> scenario, intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior. Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation. Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall. Both Louisiana and Texas emergency operation centers monitored the progress of the storm, though did not execute any preparation action.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{eventually}} migrated {{the development}} of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay, intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk. At its release, the 32-megabyte game would be the largest game Nintendo had ever created. Early in the game's development, concerns about the data storage constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto to imagine <b>a</b> <b>worst-case</b> scenario in which Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, and using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm. An idea that arose from this stage of development, a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings, ultimately made {{its way into the}} finished game as the boss of the Forest Temple dungeon.|$|E

5|$|When the {{projects}} begin, {{the work is}} done without machines, with supplies being shipped on small boats and then carried by hand from the beach. Project costs range between $5,000 and $150,000, although the average is between $20,000 and $25,000. The protected areas that result from these deals typically involve a 20- to 30-year commitment. Seacology hopes that during that time the local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress {{to a point where}} they are less dependent on natural resources. According to marine biologist Mark Erdmann, in <b>a</b> <b>worst-case</b> scenario, if the people violate the contract and destroy the habitat, Seacology will have still made a difference in their lives through its low-cost investment, whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing the immediate needs of the people, if the project fails, both lose that investment and not have helped the community.|$|E

A total of NOK 451 million was invested, but was 'geared' by borrowing an additional amount corresponding to ten times the investment, so that - in reality - the municipalities were actually investing between NOK 4 and 5 billion.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of <b>an</b> algorithm’s <b>worst-case</b> time complexity is useful because it succinctly captures how its runtime will grow as the input size becomes arbitrarily large. However, for certain algorithms—such as those per-forming search-based test data generation—a theoretical analysis to determine worst-case time complexity is diffi-cult to generalize and thus not often {{reported in the}} liter-ature. This paper introduces a framework that empirically determines <b>an</b> algorithm’s <b>worst-case</b> time complexity by doubling {{the size of the}} input and observing the change in runtime. Since the relational database is a centerpiece of modern software and the database’s schema is frequently untested, we apply the doubling technique to the domain of data generation for relational database schemas, <b>a</b> field where <b>worst-case</b> time complexities are often unknown. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of suggesting the worst-case runtimes of the chosen algorithms and configu-rations, the results of our study reveal performance trade-offs in testing strategies for relational database schemas. ...|$|R

A vast majority of researchers in the field make strong average-case assumptions about these networks, for example that the devices are distributed uniformly at random. To system builders {{on the other hand}} many of these assumptions appear suspicious. In this paper we advocate <b>an</b> algorithmic (<b>worst-case)</b> approach to adhoc and sensor networking.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and motivate}} {{the problem of}} mixed H^ 2 /H∞ estimation by studying the stochastic and deterministic approaches of H^ 2 and H^∞ estimation. Mixed H^ 2 /H^∞ estimators have the property {{that they have the}} best average performance over all estimators that achieve <b>a</b> certain <b>worst-case</b> performance bound. They thus allow a tradeoff between average and worst-case performances. In the finite horizon case, we obtain a numerical solution (based on convex optimization methods) for the optimal mixed H^ 2 /H^∞ estimator. We also give some analytic characterizations, both on this optimal solution, and on the set of all estimators achieving <b>a</b> guaranteed <b>worst-case</b> bound. <b>A</b> numerical example is also provided...|$|R
