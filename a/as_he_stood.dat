5|$|In February 1991, Icke {{visited a}} pre-Inca Sillustani burial ground near Puno, Peru, where he felt {{drawn to a}} {{particular}} circle of waist-high stones. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> in the circle, he had two thoughts: that people would {{be talking about this}} in 100 years, {{and that it would be}} over when it rained. His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the kundalini (a term from Indian yoga) activating his chakras, or energy centres, triggering a higher level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|New York Police linked rapper Fabolous to {{a crew of}} robbers who {{targeted}} Judah twice. According {{to police}} reports, the Street Fam Crew, the gang that attempted to rob Judah, {{is made up of}} 20members, all former drug dealers from Fabolous' Brooklyn neighborhood. In 2006, three men tried to rob Judah <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> next to his Lamborghini on West 27th Street at 10th Avenue in New York City. The three men drove up to Judah in a minivan at about 5am, and came out. One man pulled a handgun on Judah, and told him to put his jewelry on the hood of his car, but Judah ran instead. The muggers followed in their minivan, but crashed into a tree a block away. All three robbers fled the scene, but one was captured by a Homeland Security agent on his way to work, and another was grabbed by a nearby cab driver.|$|E

5|$|To the south, HMS Bellerophon was {{in serious}} trouble as the huge {{broadside}} of Orient pounded the ship. At 19:50 the mizzenmast and main mast both collapsed and fires broke out simultaneously at several points. Although the blazes were extinguished, the ship had suffered more than 200 casualties. Captain Darby recognised that his position was untenable and ordered the anchor cables cut at 20:20. The battered ship drifted away from the battle under continued fire from Tonnant as the foremast collapsed as well. Orient had also suffered significant damage and Admiral Brueys had been struck in the midriff by a cannonball that almost cut him in half. He died fifteen minutes later, remaining on deck and refusing to be carried below. Orients captain, Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca, was also wounded, struck in the face by flying debris and knocked unconscious, while his twelve-year-old son had a leg torn off by a cannonball <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> beside his father. The most southerly British ship, Majestic, had become briefly entangled with the 80-gun Tonnant, and in the resulting battle, suffered heavy casualties. Captain George Blagdon Westcott was among the dead, killed by French musket fire. Lieutenant Robert Cuthbert assumed command and successfully disentangled his ship, allowing the badly damaged Majestic to drift further southwards so that by 20:30 it was stationed between Tonnant and the next in line, Heureux, engaging both. To support the centre, Captain Thompson of Leander abandoned the futile efforts to drag the stranded Culloden off the shoal and sailed down the embattled French line, entering the gap created by the drifting Peuple Souverain and opening a fierce raking fire on Franklin and Orient.|$|E

25|$|For {{his first}} {{directing}} assignment, Huston chose Dashiell Hammett's detective thriller, The Maltese Falcon, a film {{which had already}} failed {{at the box office}} in two earlier versions by Warners.

25|$|In February 1917, Brown was {{promoted}} to brigadier general and given command of the 1st Infantry Brigade. He led the brigade during the Battle of Messines, {{for which he was}} mentioned in despatches for a third time.

25|$|In August 1986, Dahmer {{was arrested}} for masturbating in front of two 12-year-old boys <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> close to the Kinnickinnic River. Dahmer {{initially}} admitted the offense and was again charged with indecent exposure, but quickly changed his story and claimed he had merely been urinating, unaware that there were witnesses. The charge was changed to disorderly conduct and, on March 10, 1987, Dahmer was sentenced to one year's probation, with additional instructions he was to undergo counseling.|$|E

25|$|Television {{presenter}} Noel Edmonds {{often used}} hidden cameras to record celebrities in Candid Camera-like situations for his television programme, Noel's House Party. In 1996, Edmonds planned a stunt in which shelves would {{fall from the}} walls of a room while Geller was in it. The cameras recorded footage of Geller from angles he was not expecting, and they showed Geller grasping a spoon firmly with both hands <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> up to display a bend in it.|$|E
25|$|The wicket {{proved to}} be helpful to the touring side too after a similar opening (the first and second wicket – a duck – falling cheaply on 28) and another duck leaving them at 68/4 however a well-paced strike rate from Mohammad Yousuf, making a double century {{in the nick of}} time <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> until the last wicket, and a half century from skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq, keeping his record against England alive, proved the team would stand as strong as the home team. Stephen Harmison's bowling, which had been under {{scrutiny}} over the Winter months, improved greatly at his least favourite pitch as he took 4–94 but the next best, Matthew Hoggard at 3–117 proved the tourists had victory in their sights. A special note must go to Pietersen who made a rare attempt at bowling for two overs, taking wicket keeper Kamran Akmal for 58 at figures of 1–11.|$|E
25|$|Temeraires one {{brush with}} the French {{during this period}} came on 13 August 1811. Having {{received}} orders to sail to Menorca, Spear attempted to tack out of Hyères Bay. As {{he tried to do}} so, the wind fell away, leaving Temeraire becalmed and caught in a current which caused her to drift towards land. She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew. The most serious casualty was her master, Robert Duncan, who had one of his legs shot off <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> talking to Spear. Temeraires boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, she was towed out of range of the French guns. She then sailed to Menorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of yellow fever broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen. Spear was one of those badly affected, and the {{commander in chief of the}} Mediterranean Fleet, Sir Edward Pellew, ordered him back to Britain with his ship. Health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic. Spear was to have commanded Temeraires replacement in the Mediterranean, the 100-gun , but his ill health prevented this.|$|E

500|$|Underwater for hours, {{sometimes}} {{near the}} seabottom, McCain surfaced; Japanese escorts fired shells at him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> on the bridge, while he fired torpedoes back, striking and sinking one (originally {{thought to be}} a destroyer, it was the coastal minesweeper Tsubame). [...] McCain dove again and the Japanese ships continued in sonar-based pursuit. [...] After a total of 36 hours, nearly all spent underwater, Gunnels batteries were about to fail and the air was very hot and virtually unbreathable. [...] McCain surfaced in battle stations position, ready to engage in a disadvantageous gun battle with the Japanese pursuers, but they were heading in the opposite direction {{and he was able to}} escape.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{presents}} matadors as heroic characters {{dancing in}} a bullring. He considered the bullring as war with precise rules, {{in contrast to}} the messiness of the real war that he, and by extension Jake, experienced. Critic Keneth Kinnamon notes that young Romero is the novel's only honorable character. [...] Hemingway named Romero after Pedro Romero, an 18th-century bullfighter who killed thousands of bulls in the most difficult manner: having the bull impale itself on his sword <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> perfectly still. [...] Reynolds says Romero, who symbolizes the classically pure matador, is the [...] "one idealized figure in the novel." [...] Josephs says that when Hemingway changed Romero's name from Guerrita and imbued him with the characteristics of the historical Romero, he also changed the scene in which Romero kills a bull to one of recibiendo (receiving the bull) in homage to the historical namesake.|$|E
500|$|Cannon {{remains a}} {{respected}} and iconic figure in Louisiana sports despite his legal troubles.

Fans gave a long standing ovation and players raised their helmets in salute, leading athletic director Skip Bertman to proclaim to a friend, [...] "He's still the icon, isn't he?" [...] His punt return on Halloween night in 1959 is still played on the big screen in Tiger Stadium before every home game. As of 2017, Cannon is LSU's only Heisman winner, and his number 20 jersey remains one of only two jerseys retired by LSU football. He was selected as a halfback on the Associated Press' [...] "Southeast Area All-Time football team: 1920–1969 era", edging out Beattie Feathers of Tennessee by one vote.|$|E

500|$|Condé's Corps formed down {{river at}} Neuburg and Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg's column formed at Müllheim. Their role was specific: keep the French left from {{flanking}} the main Austrian force. [...] Yet, despite specific {{orders to the}} contrary, the Duke of Enghien, Condé's grandson, led a spirited attack on Steinstadt with the Army of Condé; they took the village with a bayonet charge and remained there under severe artillery and musket fire {{for the rest of}} the daylight hours. Republican fire continued, incessant and terrible. [...] An officer was killed <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> between the Royal Highnesses (Condé, his son, and grandson) and the Duke of Berry. Taking advantage of the royalist acquisition, the second column took the hill opposite Schliengen, which was heavily defended by General of Division Gouvion Saint-Cyr. Saint-Cyr tried several times to retake the position, but Fürstenberg's column clung to its prize throughout the day, despite a heavy cannonade from the French divisions opposite it.|$|E
