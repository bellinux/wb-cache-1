40|$|Introduction: The {{association}} of <b>acute</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> and <b>acute</b> pancreatitis is well described. This {{study was conducted}} to find out the frequency of pancreatic involvement in <b>acute</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> in the Nepalese population. Methods: Consecutive patients of <b>acute</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> presenting with severe abdominal pain between January 2005 and April 2010 were studied. Patients with history of significant alcohol consumption and gall stones were excluded. <b>Acute</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> was diagnosed by clinical examination, liver function test, ultrasound examination and confirmed by viral serology. Pancreatitis was diagnosed by clinical presentation, biochemistry, ultrasound examination and CT scan. Results: Severe abdominal pain was present in 38 of 382 serologically-confirmed <b>acute</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> patients. Twenty five patients were diagnosed to have acute pancreatitis. The pancreatitis was mild in 14 and severe in 11 patients. The etiology of pancreatitis was hepatitis E virus in 18 and hepatitis A virus in 7 patients. Two patients died of complications secondary to shock. The remaining patients recovered from both pancreatitis and hepatitis on conservative treatment.

25|$|Bacterial {{infection}} of the liver commonly results in pyogenic liver abscesses, <b>acute</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> or granulomatous (or chronic) liver disease. Pyogenic abscesses commonly involve enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and are composed of multiple bacteria up to 50% of the time. <b>Acute</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is caused by Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bartonella henselae, Borrelia burgdorferi, salmonella species, brucella species and campylobacter species. Chronic or granulomatous hepatitis is seen with infection from mycobacteria species, Tropheryma whipplei, Treponema pallidum, Coxiella burnetii, and rickettsia species.|$|E

In addition to the signs of <b>acute</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> people can also demonstrate signs of coagulopathy (abnormal coagulation studies with easy bruising and bleeding) and encephalopathy (confusion, disorientation, and sleepiness). Mortality due to fulminant hepatitis is typically the result of various complications including cerebral edema, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, respiratory failure, or kidney failure.|$|E

25|$|Hepatitis is {{inflammation}} of the liver tissue. Some people have no symptoms whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes, poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Hepatitis may be temporary (acute) or long term (chronic) depending on whether it lasts for less than or more than six months. <b>Acute</b> <b>hepatitis</b> can sometimes resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or rarely result in acute liver failure. Over time the chronic form may progress to scarring of the liver, liver failure, or liver cancer.|$|E
25|$|Globally, around 1.4 million {{symptomatic}} cases occur {{each year}} and about 114 million infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic). It {{is more common in}} regions of the world with poor sanitation and not enough safe water. In the developing world, about 90% of children have been infected by age 10, thus are immune by adulthood. It often occurs in outbreaks in moderately developed countries where children are not exposed when young and vaccination is not widespread. <b>Acute</b> <b>hepatitis</b> A resulted in 11,200 deaths in 2015. World Hepatitis Day occurs each year on July 28 to bring awareness to viral hepatitis.|$|E
25|$|Many {{chemical}} agents, including medications, industrial toxins, and herbal {{and dietary}} supplements, can cause hepatitis. The spectrum of drug-induced liver injury varies from <b>acute</b> <b>hepatitis</b> to chronic hepatitis to acute liver failure. Toxins and medications can cause liver injury {{through a variety}} of mechanisms, including direct cell damage, disruption of cell metabolism, and causing structural changes. Some drugs such as paracetamol exhibit predictable dose-dependent liver damage while others such as isoniazid cause idiosyncratic and unpredictable reactions that vary among individuals. There are wide variations in the mechanisms of liver injury and latency period from exposure to development of clinical illness.|$|E

25|$|Although HAV is {{excreted}} in the feces {{towards the}} end of the incubation period, specific diagnosis is made by the detection of HAV-specific IgM antibodies in the blood. IgM antibody is only present in the blood following an <b>acute</b> <b>hepatitis</b> A infection. It is detectable from 1-2 weeks after the initial infection and persists for up to 14 weeks. The presence of IgG antibodies in the blood means the acute stage of the illness has passed and the person is immune to further infection. IgG antibodies to HAV are also found in the blood following vaccination, and tests for immunity to the virus are based on the detection of this antibody.|$|E
25|$|Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} {{can present}} anywhere within the spectrum from asymptomatic to acute or chronic hepatitis to fulminant liver failure. Patients are asymptomatic 25–34% of the time, and {{the diagnosis is}} suspected {{on the basis of}} abnormal liver function tests. Up to 40% of cases present with signs and symptoms of <b>acute</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> As with other autoimmune diseases, autoimmune hepatitis usually affects young women (though it can affect patients of either sex of any age), and patients can exhibit classic signs and symptoms of autoimmunity such as fatigue, anemia, anorexia, amenorrhea, acne, arthritis, pleurisy, thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis, nephritis, and maculopapular rash. Autoimmune hepatitis increases the risk for cirrhosis, and the risk for liver cancer is increased by about 1% for each year of the disease.|$|E

25|$|Similar to Hepatitis A, {{hepatitis}} E manifests {{as large}} outbreaks and epidemics associated with fecal contamination of water sources. It {{accounts for more}} than 55,000 deaths annually with approximately 20 million people worldwide thought to be infected with the virus. It affects predominantly young adults, causing <b>acute</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> In infected pregnant women, Hepatitis E infection can lead to fulminant hepatitis with third trimester mortality rates as high as 30%. Individuals with weakened immune systems, such as organ transplant recipients, are also susceptible. Infection is rare in the United States but rates are high in the developing world (Africa, Asia, Central America, Middle East). Many genotypes exist and are differentially distributed around the world. There is some evidence of hepatitis E infection of animals, serving as a reservoir for human infection.|$|E
