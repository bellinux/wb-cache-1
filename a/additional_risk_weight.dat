40|$|The thesis {{starts with}} a simple {{description}} of the system and some brief theory needed for the following analysis. Further a factory acceptance test is performed, this implies measurement of the dynamic response due to load generated by the system itself under normal operation and making sure the dynamic behaviour are within the acceptance criteria. The data from the test is used to point out some weaknesses in the design from a dynamical point of view and some potential ideas of improvement are presented. To introduce additional damping of some of the rotational equipment is the idea which is proceeded with. A great simplification in this thesis is that only transversal vibrations (the y-component of the vibrations) are considered after the factory acceptance test is performed. This results in less reliable quantities although the trends and the final conclusion remains correct. A comprehensive finite element analysis is carried out to study the effect of a passive damper solution. It turns out that passive dampers can limit the vibrations remarkably, but if the foundation gets too soft the vibrations will increase. The low frequency vibration however, is not affected much by the additional damping. Some important eigenfrequencies are also studied and put into consideration. A sensitivity analysis of the constant damping ratio in the finite element solver is also performed. In addition a more trivial analysis is performed to study the effect of an active damper solution. This solution seems to be less effective and does not influence the low frequencies considerably neither. It also introduces <b>additional</b> <b>risk</b> and <b>weight</b> to the system, which is highly undesirable. The thesis concludes that passive damping of the hydraulic power unit has favourable effects on the system. If the main goal is to reduce low frequency vibration it might not be an entirely satisfying solution. </p...|$|R

40|$|Banks use {{internal}} models to optimize <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> and better {{account for the}} specific risk of each asset class. As {{the choice of a}} set of <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> affects the regulatory capital ratio, economic theory suggests that banks should optimize their <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> accounting for the cost and benefit of holding equity capital. Banks with a higher cost of equity, and banks with better growth opportunities, should be more aggressive in reducing <b>risk</b> <b>weights.</b> We consider a large panel of international banks and find that, after controlling for a number of bank and country characteristics, a higher cost of equity and better growth opportunities have a negative relation with the ratio between risk-weighted assets and total assets and with the share of credit risk evaluated though {{internal models}}. The results are obtained in the context of endogeneity-robust econometric procedures and across several specifications. We also find that banks that are more aggressive in terms of such optimization have a subsequent lower return on equity {{and are more likely to}} have raised capital during the credit crisis...|$|R

As a result, the internal model approach does not necessarily provide capital savings relative to the standardized method that encourages the financial institutions to develop internal models. Whether the internal model approaches can provide capital savings depends on the characteristics of the portfolios of the financial institutions. The capital savings will occur only in the case of low-risk financial institutions. The high-risk financial institutions will choose the standardized method as their calculation tool of capital requirements. To solve the moral hazard problem of “supervisory discrimination”, we propose the “VaR-based <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> ” which can ensure capital savings of adoption of the internal model and thereby encourage the financial institutions to develop internal models...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the VaRs for marketable assets {{in order to}} examine the propriety of the <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> set by the Basel Accord and compare the capital charges between the standardized and the internal model approaches using the actual positions of institutions. We find that the <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> exhibit a risk-encouraging concave function of economic risk, and tend to favor the riskier assets more than the riskless assets. Such “supervisory discrimination ” in terms of <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> gives rise to the moral hazard problem in that the regulator fails to reduce the risk-taking incentives of institutions. The internal model approach does not necessarily provide the capital savings to encourage the institutions to develop internal models. Since the capital savings will occur only in the case of low-risk institutions, the high-risk institutions, which need to introduce an internal model to improve their risk management, will choose the standardized method as their tool for calculating capital requirements.

5000|$|The Tier 1 {{capital ratio}} is {{the ratio of}} a bank's core equity capital to its total risk-{{weighted}} assets (RWA).

Most central banks follow the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) guidelines in setting formulae for asset <b>risk</b> <b>weights.</b> Assets like cash and currency usually have zero <b>risk</b> <b>weight,</b> while certain loans have a <b>risk</b> <b>weight</b> at 100% of their face value.
