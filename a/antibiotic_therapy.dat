5|$|An {{increasing}} number of infected individuals are found to harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This results in initial treatment failure and requires additional rounds of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> or alternative strategies, such as a quadruple therapy, which adds a bismuth colloid, such as bismuth subsalicylate. For the treatment of clarithromycin-resistant strains of H. pylori, the use of levofloxacin {{as part of the}} therapy has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Many {{treatment}} options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy.</b> Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{antimicrobial}} peptides against P. acnes {{is under}} investigation {{as a treatment for}} acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance. In 2007, the first genome sequencing of a P. acnes bacteriophage (PA6) was reported. The authors proposed applying this research toward development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment in order to overcome the problems associated with long-term <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> such as bacterial resistance. Oral and topical probiotics are also being evaluated as treatments for acne. Probiotics have been hypothesized to have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skin's ceramide content. As of 2014, studies examining the effects of probiotics on acne in humans were limited.|$|E

40|$|Paper-based {{interventions}} {{have been}} shown to stimulate switching from intravenous (i. v.) to oral (p. o.) <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapies.</b> Shorter i. v. durations are associated with a lower risk of iatrogenic infections as well as reduced workload and costs.

In this controlled before-and-after study, an algorithm identified patients who were eligible for i. v. -to-p. o. switch 60 h after starting i. v. antimicrobials. Reminders offering guidance on the re-assessment of initial i. v. therapy were displayed within the electronic health records in 12 units during the intervention period (year 2012). In contrast, no reminders were visible during the baseline period (2011) and in the control group (17 units).

40|$|Background: The {{scheduled}} {{changing of}} antibiotics type (<b>antibiotic</b> cycling <b>therapy)</b> {{has been reported}} as an effective prophylaxis to {{reduce the incidence of}} antibiotic resistant bacteria. In this study, we aimed to clarify the preventive effects of <b>antibiotic</b> cycling <b>therapy</b> on surgical site infections after cardiac surgery. Methods: 618 patients underwent elective cardiac surgery in our department. We examined the frequency of occurrence of SSI between different groups, Cycling group, using single antibiotics with changing the type every 3 months, and Combined group, using two types of antibiotics together at once. Result: 284 patients was participated in Cycling group, 334 was in Combined group. 3 patients (1. 1 %) developed SSI after cardiac surgery in Cycling group, and 13 (3. 9 %) in Combined group (p= 0. 027). <b>Antibiotic</b> cycling <b>therapy</b> was an independent factor of the risk of SSI with an odds ratio of 0. 2 (confidence interval [CI]: 0. 07 − 0. 9, p= 0. 030), and the risk of SSI caused by antibiotic−resistant bacteria with an odds ratio of 0. 2 (CI: 0. 05 − 1. 0, p= 0. 054). Conclusion: <b>Antibiotic</b> cycling <b>therapy</b> reduced the incidence of antibiotic−resistant bacteria and SSI after cardiac surgery. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed, <b>antibiotic</b> cycling <b>therapy</b> was an independent factor to lower the occurrence of postoperative SSI and SSI related antibiotic−resistant bacteria...|$|R
25|$|ABPA {{should be}} {{suspected}} {{in patients with}} a predisposing lung disease—most commonly asthma or cystic fibrosis— and {{is often associated with}} chronic airway limitation (CAL). Patients generally present with symptoms of recurrent infection such as fever, but do not respond to conventional <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy.</b> Poorly-controlled asthma is a common finding, with a case series only finding 19% of ABPA patients with well-controlled asthma. Wheezing and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are common features, and mucus plugging is seen in 3169% of patients.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of corneal ulcers {{includes}} topical <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> {{to prevent}} infection, and pain medications, including topical atropine to stop spasms of the ciliary muscle. Atropine may decrease tear production and interfere with corneal healing. Superficial ulcers usually heal {{in less than}} a week. Deep ulcers and descemetoceles may require corneal suturing, conjunctival grafts or conjunctival flaps, soft contact lenses, or corneal transplant. Topical corticosteroids and anesthetics should not be used on any type of corneal ulcer because they prevent healing and will often make them worse.|$|E
25|$|These {{peptides}} {{are excellent}} candidates for development as novel therapeutic agents and complements to conventional <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> because they generally {{have a broad}} range of activity, are bactericidal as opposed to bacteriostatic and require a short contact time to induce killing. A number of naturally occurring peptides and their derivatives have been developed as novel anti-infective therapies for conditions as diverse as oral mucositis, lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), cancer, and skin and wound infections.

Although A. viscosus is difficult to distinguish from other closely related actinomycetes, the general determination of being an actinomycete is sufficient for treatment of infections.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{effectiveness}} of active intervention with antenatal maternal corticosteroid and <b>antibiotics</b> <b>therapy</b> in infants delivered between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation after premature rupture of membrane.
