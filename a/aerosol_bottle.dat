40|$|A 78 -year-old female {{with total}} urinary {{incontinence}} was referred to Tygerberg Hospital. On physical exam a firm mass consistent with a stone was palpated along the anterior vagina and confirmed with KUB X-ray and ultrasonography. Under general anesthesia cystolithalopaxy was performed and the vaginal component was removed manually. A foreign body (aerosol cap) was identified in the vagina as the underlying cause. The aerosol cap had eroded through the anterior vaginal wall resulting in a vesicovaginal fistula. A biopsy of the fistulous tract demonstrated granulation tissue with no evidence of malignancy. A discussion of retained foreign bodies causing vesicovaginal fistula, specifically <b>aerosol</b> <b>bottle</b> caps, follows...|$|E
40|$|Aerosol-And propane bottles for consumers, {{including}} hairspray, lubricants, etc. {{were tested}} for exposure from fire. The tested bottles had a volume between 15 - 400 ml of product mixed with propane and bottles with propane only containing 0. 35, 0. 45, 5 and 6 kg of propane. The aerosol-And propane bottles {{were exposed to}} a heptane pool fire, corresponding to properties of common available flammable liquids for sale in stores. The experiments showed that the <b>aerosol</b> <b>bottles</b> exposed to fire exploded {{within a few minutes}} only and that this resulted in clouds of burning vapor as well as shrapnel affecting the vicinity. An experiment with several such <b>aerosol</b> <b>bottles</b> exposed to fire on a shelf in an enclosure, showed that unexploded <b>aerosol</b> <b>bottles</b> acted as projectiles when adjacent bottles exploded. Also, the explosion resulted in a high pressure, affecting building components. Experiments with propane bottles exposed to fire showed that such bottles release pressure in different ways, depending on their type and construction. During the experiments, the bottles released their pressure through a pressure valve or melting fuse within a few minutes only. During comparative experiments with propane bottles without safety devices, the bottles exploded within a few minutes only, resulting in large burning vapor clouds and shrapnel being thrown as far as approximately 80 m. Recommendations based on the experiments included suggestions on the maximum amount of combustible liquids which should be stored together with <b>aerosol</b> <b>bottles.</b> Recommendations were also given regarding the relevance of safety devices and securing propane bottles so that they can't move if safety devices activates when bottles are exposed to fire...|$|R

50|$|Once-a-month topical {{products}} {{are the most}} commonly used products to kill parasite infestations. They are normally applied {{on the back of the}} pet, and their advantage is they also provide protection from further infestations. Sprays are available as <b>aerosols</b> and pump <b>bottles,</b> and they are meant to be applied on all parts of the pet. Dips and rinses are also available, but they are not as common as the other such products because they are the most dangerous for the health of the pet.|$|R
40|$|In {{case of a}} {{hypothetical}} severe accident {{it is very likely}} that iodine at least partly deposits on painted walls of a reactor containment building. Iodine may react with painted surfaces to form organic iodine species. These organic species are a possible source of volatile iodine, which may increase the fraction of releasable iodine. Therefore, it is important to study the transport of organic iodine in containment conditions. Another question is, in which form are the organic iodides transported as gaseous molecules or as aerosol particles resulting from organic iodides reacting with radiolysis products. To answer this last question methyl iodide was fed into the EXSI facility in an air mixture. In some experiments the flow contained also humidity. The reactions took place in a quartz tube heated either to 50 °C, 90 °C or 120 °C. UV-light was used as a source of radiation to produce ozone from oxygen. A separate generator was also applied to reach higher ozone concentrations. Nucleated aerosol particles were collected on plane filters and gaseous iodine species were trapped in trapping <b>bottles.</b> <b>Aerosol</b> mass flow rate and size distribution as well as speciation of gaseous reaction products were measured with several on-line instruments. Collected aerosol particles were analysed with SEM. It was found that the formation of aerosol particles was very fast when ozone and methyl iodide were present in the facility. Even a very low concentration of ozone produced high number concentration of particles. The measured aerosol mass concentration increased with increasing temperature and ozone concentration. Because the particle diameter was quite small (< 180 nm), their settling velocity is low. Therefore, iodine containing aerosols may exist in containment atmosphere {{for a long period of}} time. Part of methyl iodide was always transported through the facility regardless of experimental conditions. All ozone was consumed in the reactions when only UV-light was used as its source. With a separate generator, ozone concentration was sufficiently high to be detected at the outlet of the facility and thus enabling the study of the reaction kinetics. The transported fractions for both methyl iodide and ozone decreased with increasing reaction temperature. The main gaseous reaction products were methanol and formaldehyde. Especially at elevated temperature other reaction products, such as formic acid and methyl formate, became important as well...|$|R
