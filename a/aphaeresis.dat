These Phœnicians [106] were the Tyrians, who at that time built Carthage in Afric, and Carteia in Spain, and Gades in the Island of that name without the Straights; and gave the name of Hercules to their chief Leader, because of his labours and success, and that of Heraclea to the city Carteia which he built. So Strabo: [107] Εκπλεουσιν ουν εκ της ‛ημετερας θαλαττης εις την εξω, δεξιον εστι τουτο· και προς αυτο Καλπη [Καρτηια] [108] πολις εν τετταρακοντα σταδιοις αξιολογος και παλαια, ναυσταθμον ποτε γενομενη των Ιβηρων· ενιοι δε και Ηρακλεους κτισμα λεγουσιν αυτην, ‛ων εστι και Τιμοσθενης· ‛ος Φησι και Ηρακλειαν ονομαζεσθαι το παλαιον· δεικνυσθαι τε μεγαν περιβολον, και νεωσοικους. Mons Calpe ad dextram est e nostro mari foras navigantibus, & ad quadraginta inde stadia urbs Carteia vetusta ac memorabilis, olim statio navibus Hispanorum. Hanc ab Hercule quidam conditam aiunt, inter quos est Timosthenes, qui eam antiquitus Heracleam fuisse appellatam refert, ostendique adhuc magnum murorum circuitum & navalia. This Hercules, in memory of his building and Reigning over the City Carteia, they called also Melcartus, the King of Carteia. Bochart [109] writes, that Carteia was at first called Melcarteia, from its founder Melcartus, and by an <b>Aphæresis,</b> Carteia; and that Melcartus signifies Melec Kartha, the King of the city, that is, saith he, of the city Tyre: but considering that no ancient Author tells us, that Carteia was ever called Melcarteia, or that Melcartus was King of Tyre; I had rather say that Melcartus, or Melecartus, had his name from being the Founder and Governor or Prince of the city Carteia. Under Melcartus the Tyrians sailed as far as Tartessus or Tarshish, a place in the Western part of Spain, between the two mouths of the river Bœtis, and there they [110] met with much silver, which they purchased for trifles: they sailed also as far as Britain before the death of Melcartus; for [111] Pliny tells us, Plumbum ex Cassiteride insula primus apportavit Midacritus: And Bochart [112] observes that Midacritus is a Greek name corruptly written for Melcartus; Britain being unknown to the Greeks long after it was discovered by the Phœnicians. After the death of Melcartus, they [113] built a Temple to him in the Island Gades, and adorned it with the sculptures of the labours of Hercules, and of his Hydra, and the Horses to whom he threw Diomedes, King of the Bistones in Thrace, to be devoured. In this Temple was the golden Belt of Teucer, and the golden Olive of Pygmalion bearing Smaragdine fruit: and by these consecrated gifts of Teucer and Pygmalion, you may know that it was built in their days. Pomponius derives it from the times of the Trojan war; for Teucer, seven years after that war, according to the Marbles, arrived at Cyprus, being banished from home by his father Telamon, and there built Salamis: and he and his Posterity Reigned there 'till Evagoras, the last of them, was conquered by the Persians, in the twelfth year of Artaxerxes Mnemon. Certainly this Tyrian Hercules could be no older than the Trojan war, because the Tyrians did not begin to navigate the Mediterranean 'till after that war: for Homer and Hesiod knew nothing of this navigation, and the Tyrian Hercules went to the coasts of Spain, and was buried in Gades: so Arnobius [114]; Tyrius Hercules sepultus in finibus Hispaniæ: and Mela, speaking of the Temple of Hercules in Gades, saith, Cur sanctum sit ossa ejus ibi sepulta efficiunt. Carthage [115] paid tenths to this Hercules, and sent their payments yearly to Tyre: and thence it's probable that this Hercules went to the coast of Afric, as well as to that of Spain, and by his discoveries prepared the way to Dido: Orosius [116] and others tell us that he built Capsa there. Josephus tells of an earlier Hercules, to whom Hiram built a Temple at Tyre: and perhaps there might be also an earlier Hercules of Tyre, who set on foot their trade on the Red Sea in the days of David or Solomon.|$|E

40|$|Lipoprotein glomerulopathy is a {{pathological}} condition characterized by lipid accumulation in the glomerular capillaries {{that has been}} associated with the presence of rare mutants of apolipoprotein E (ApoE). We describe a 51 -year-old Italian patient presenting Type III hyperlipidemia and proteinuria in whom renal biopsy showed capillary ectasia and intraluminal lipid deposits, suggesting the diagnosis of lipoprotein glomerulopathy. The patient, who had elevated plasma ApoE level, was found to be heterozygous for a mutation in ApoE (Arg 150 Cys), designated apoEMODENA. This mutation induces the formation of ApoE dimers that are detectable under non-reducing conditions. Treatment with hypolipidemic drugs did not result in a complete remission of the proteinuria and was accompanied by a slow but progressive worsening of renal function with the persistence of intracapillary lipid thrombi. The introduction of low-density lipoprotein <b>aphaeresis</b> combined with a more aggressive lipid lowering and antihypertensive therapy resulted in the remission of proteinuria and a substantial improvement of renal function.

40|$|Introduction: A {{system for}} {{monitoring}} {{the use of}} <b>aphaeresis</b> {{in the treatment of}} Ulcerative Colitis (UC), named SiMAC, was designed in 2006 in the Basque Country. In the present study, the opinion of the clinicians who participated in SiMAC was evaluated, in order to identify the barriers and gather suggestions that could improve implementation of this kind of system. Methods: A mixed questionnaire was designed, in order to gather clinicians’ assessments of the SiMAC monitoring system. Results: The response rate was 73. 9 % (17 / 23). The data from 40. 96 % (159 / 388) of patients with UC treated with <b>aphaeresis</b> was recorded. The main reasons for not including the data from all treated patients were a lack of required data or not meeting the study inclusion criteria. Positive aspects of the SiMAC were identified, as the simplicity of data collection and its systematic, multi-centre approach. The negative aspects mentioned were the use of a local computer application and the lack of time for health professionals to enter data. Discussion: The use of monitoring systems helps to formalise the introduction of technologies of little-known effectiveness; involve clinicians and medical societies in coming to agreement and obtaining information about the safety, effectiveness or efficiency of new technologies; and provide relevant information to healthcare administrations for making decisions about the introduction of new technologies into healthcare practice.

40|$|Abstract G-CSF is {{routinely}} used to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from bone marrow (BM) into peripheral blood before <b>aphaeresis,</b> but HSC harvesting can be suboptimal. On the other hand, transplanted HSCs sometimes fail to engraft a recipient BM microenvironment when G-CSF is used after transplantation, as pushing-CSF will push HSCs away from marrow. So, G-CSF action {{needs to be}} potentiated by other drugs. Marrow stromal cells establish a local CXCL 12 concentration gradient that is the primary homing signal for HSCs. Pharmacological interventions that modify this gradient, therefore, have potential to help HSC mobilization (by decreasing CXCL 12) and engraftment (by increasing CXCL 12).

The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the rate of discard of blood and blood component and identify its reasons at the National Blood Centre (NBC), Kuala Lumpur, during the year of 2007 in order to introduce appropriate intervention. Study Designs and Methods: Data on the number of discarded whole blood units and its components, reasons for discard, and the number of blood components processed as well as the number of collected blood units were obtained from the Blood Bank Information System - NBC database. These were analyzed. Results: The total number of blood units collected in 2007 was 171169 from which 390636 units of components were prepared. The total number of discarded whole blood units and its components was 8968 (2. 3 %). Platelet concentrate recorded the highest of discard at 6 % (3909) followed by whole blood at 3. 7 % (647), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) at 2. 5 % (2839), and cryoprecipitate at 2 % (620). The rate of discarded packed red blood cells RBCs, plasma <b>aphaeresis,</b> and PLT <b>aphaeresis</b> was less than 1 % at 0. 6 % (902), 0. 6 % (37), and 0. 29 % (14), respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{and studies}} different {{problems in the}} blood supply chain. The problems are focused on aspects less frequently studied in the literature such as the exploitation of the different collection and production alternatives, consideration of multiple products and uncertainty in demand and supply. These important features {{can be found in}} different decision levels, including daily collections, annual planning and at the strategic level when the blood supply chain is designed. For each problem presented, a suitable solution strategy is proposed. Different methods such as discrete event simulation, Monte Carlo simulation, optimisation, stochastic optimisation and multi-objective optimisation have been used to provide solutions to the problems studied. A simulation-optimisation model to support collection and production decisions in the blood supply chain is first presented. A model which integrated discrete event simulation and integer linear programming was designed to solve this problem. The model is tested using data from a blood centre in Colombia. Results show that key performance indicators such as total cost, number of donors, shortage and outdated units are improved by using the approach proposed. In addition, a stochastic multi-objective optimisation model to study the trade-off between cost and number of donors required is also included in this thesis. This model supports the decision of number of donors required by using whole blood and <b>aphaeresis</b> collection processes as well as considering the different blood groups and two main objectives: minimisation of cost and donors. The problem is solved using a combination of the augmented epsilon-constraint algorithm and the sample average approximation technique. A Pareto front considering stochastic demand is obtained by applying the proposed method. The final model included studies the optimal design of a blood supply chain as well as a discussion about the main motivations for centralised and decentralized systems. A stochastic mixed integer linear programming model is proposed and a solution method based on the sample average approximation technique is designed to address the problem. The complete approach is applied to a case study and several scenarios are generated to evaluate different travel time policies as well as the impact of using <b>aphaeresis</b> processes...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Familial {{hypercholesterolemia}} (FH) {{is caused}} by nonfunctioning low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, resulting in high serum cholesterol. Two types of FH are described: the heterozygous form is diagnosed in adults and responds well to medical therapy; the homozygous form is rare, diagnosed in children, and often requires multiple treatments to prevent complications. Cholesterol accumulation in tissues produces common clinical manifestations including cutaneous xanthomas, coronary artery disease, and aortic stenosis. Treatment options consist of lifestyle modifications, lipid-lowering medications, LDL <b>aphaeresis,</b> and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Case Presentation. Two patients with FH presented at young ages due to characteristic cutaneous xanthomas. The patients underwent cardiac testing that revealed atherosclerotic changes. The patients received maximal medical therapy, but only experienced a small decrease in serum cholesterol and LDL levels. After several years of medical treatment without improvement of symptoms, the patients were listed for OLT. The transplantations were successful, and only one patient had a postoperative complication of acute rejection, treated successfully. Currently, both patients are doing well with regression of the cutaneous xanthomas and atherosclerotic changes. Conclusion. OLT is a safe and effective option for patients with homozygous FH refractory to maximal medical therapy and may represent the optimal treatment for these patients...|$|E

Here we present a patient with CCHF who was treated for a misdiagnosis of refractory thrombocytopenia, whereas she had an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) -dependent pseudothrombocytopenia. A 53 -year-old female was transferred to our department on suspicion of CCHF. Laboratory findings included a platelet count of 1. 7 x 103 /mm 3, a hemoglobin level of 11. 3 gr/dL, and a {{white blood cell count}} of 3. 3 x 103 /mm 3. Liver function tests and other biochemical findings were within normal limits. CCHF virus IgM antibody was positive. Since low platelet counts persisted despite transfusions consisting of four units of random donor platelets and four units of <b>aphaeresis</b> platelets for five days, refractory thrombocytopenia was suspected. Steroid therapy was started. Although blood smear examination was not initially performed because of the biologic hazard, persistent low counts of platelets were further evaluated by blood smear examination which revealed many platelet clumps. EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia was suspected for this normal appearance, and a repeated complete blood count using a citrated sample tube showed a platelet count within normal limits (i. e., 417 x 103 /mm 3).

40|$|The {{interfacial}} behaviour of biomolecules {{in general}} and proteins in particular is interesting from a biochemical point of view since proteins are involved in processes such as complement activation, blood coagulation and atherosclerotic plaque formation, {{but also in the}} context of biomedical applications such as solid-phase diagnostics, therapeutic <b>aphaeresis</b> and biosensors. The objective of this thesis is to study biomolecular interactions using surface sensitive biosensor techniques such as surface plasmon resonance, SPR, in combination with bulk techniques. Lipopolysaccharide, LPS, is as a key mediator of sepsis mediated syndromes. Removal of circulating LPS by therapeutic <b>aphaeresis,</b> achieved by LPS-binding molecules that are anchored to a solid support, has been suggested as an adjuvant sepsis therapy. Anti-LPS peptides, designed from LPS-binding molecules, were covalently immobilized on model surfaces. The effect of immobilization on the LPS-binding ability of the peptides and the stability of the interaction was studied. Covalently attached peptides retained their activity although to varying extent. The LPS binding capacity of the peptides was in some cases dependent on the immobilization method. Furthermore, the solution behaviour of LPS in terms of aggregation onset and aggregate size was studied. It was found that LPS aggregated into spherical aggregates in a continuous manner at close to physiological conditions, possibly reflecting the polydispersity of the molecule. Suppression of non-specific protein adsorption is essential for biosensors applications in order to achieve sufficient selectivity and sensitivity and for blood contacting devices in order to avoid immune responses or blood coagulation. This can be accomplished with PEG-functionalized coatings. The effect of interfacial charge on the protein rejecting ability of two PEGylated copolymers was monitored. The results indicate that an adsorbed layer of PEGylated copolymers can be very efficient in preventing proteins from adsorbing at a surface provided there is charge matching between the polyelectrolyte and the underlying surface. Inadequate diagnosis contributes to the high mortality records of severe sepsis. Direct detection of elevated plasma levels of protein-bound isopeptides, from the disseminated intravascular coagulation that occurs in severe sepsis, could constitute a useful diagnostic marker. The interaction between an immobilized anti-isopeptide antibody and a protein-bound isopeptide was studied by SPR with the intention to develop a SPR based immunoassay for the diagnosis of sepsis. This first study shows that this direct assay has a high immunocapturing efficiency and detects protein-bound isopeptides in buffer and diluted plasma. Finally, the combined use of two surface sensitive biosensor techniques, SPR and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, QCM-D, was explored {{for the study of the}} interaction between low density lipoprotein, LDL and the proteoglycan decorin. LDL affinity to proteoglycans is a potential marker for atherogenic LDL that may be used in a clinical solid-phase or biosensor assay for atherosclerosis risk prediction...|$|E

Blood donors (n = 864) from our population were genotyped for HLA-A, HLA-B and HPA systems by polymerase chain reaction amplification with sequence-specific primer(PCR-SSP) techniques. Using this cohort, we compared the results of platelet transfusions (matched vs. random) in 23 patients with PTR. Matched platelets were selected either by HLA antigen matching or by HLA antibody matching, as predicted by antibody specificity prediction (ASP) analysis. Significantly higher platelet recovery (PPR) values were obtained with HLA-matched platelets in comparison with random platelets. No significant difference in PPR was observed between HLA matching and ASP methods. In two patients, platelet-specific alloantibodies (alloabs) (anti-HPA- 3 b and anti-HPA- 5 b) were detected besides HLA class I alloabs. Transfusion with HLA- and HPA-compatible platelets in both the patients resulted in significantly higher PPR when compared with HLA-compatible platelet transfusion alone. In this study, we demonstrated that {{the establishment of an}} HLA- and HPA-typed platelet <b>aphaeresis</b> donor registry is useful to improve the treatment outcome of PTR patients and to maintain a long-term platelet transfusion strategy. © 2010 British Blood Transfusion Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Unmanipulated haploidentical/mismatched related {{transplantation}} with combined granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-mobilised {{peripheral blood}} stem cells (G-PBSCs) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-mobilised bone marrow (G-BM) has been developed as an alternative transplantation strategy for patients with haematologic malignancies. However, little information is available about the factors predicting the outcome of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection and bone marrow (BM) harvest in this transplantation. The effects of donor characteristics and procedure factors on CD 34 + cell yield were investigated. A total of 104 related healthy donors received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) followed by PBSC collection and BM harvest. Male donors had significantly higher yields compared with female donors. In multiple regression analysis for peripheral blood collection, age and flow rate were negatively correlated with cell yield, whereas body mass index, pre-aphaeresis white blood cell (WBC) and circulating immature cell (CIC) counts were positively correlated with cell yields. For BM harvest, age was negatively correlated with cell yields, whereas pre-BM collection CIC counts were positively correlated with cell yield. All donors achieved the final product of ≥ 6 × 106 kg− 1 recipient body weight. This transplantation strategy {{has been shown to}} be a feasible approach with acceptable outcomes in stem cell collection for patients who received HLA-haploidentical/mismatched transplantation with combined G-PBSCs and G-BM. In donors with multiple high-risk characteristics for poor <b>aphaeresis</b> CD 34 + cell yield, BM was an alternative source...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to set up and {{evaluate}} a novel method for studies of platelet adhesion and activation in blood and platelet suspensions such as platelet concentrate (PC) samples using protein-coated polystyrene beads and flow cytometry. To demonstrate its usefulness, we studied PCs during storage. PCs were prepared by <b>aphaeresis</b> technique (n[*]=[*] 7). Metabolic variables and platelet function was measured on day 1, 5, 7 and 12 of storage. Spontaneous and TRAP- 6 -induced adhesion to fibrinogen- and collagen-coated beads was analyzed by flow cytometry. P-selectin and phosphatidyl serine (PS) expression was assessed on platelets bound to beads as well as on non-adherent platelets. Platelet adhesion to fibrinogen beads had increased by day 12 and adhesion to collagen beads at day 7 of storage (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). TRAP- 6 stimulation significantly increased the platelet adhesion to fibrinogen beads (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) as well as the P-selectin and PS exposure on platelets bound to beads (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) during the first 7 days of storage, but by day 12, significant changes were no longer induced by TRAP- 6 stimulation. We demonstrate that our adhesion assay using protein-coated polystyrene beads can be used to assess the adhesion properties of platelets during storage without the addition of red blood cells. Therefore it may offer a useful tool for future studies of platelet adhesive capacity in transfusion medicine and other settings...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundAutologus {{platelet}} gel is easy {{to prepare}} and is relatively low cost. The {{aim of this study}} was to prepare and evaluate in vitro efficacy of autologus platelet gel. Materials and MethodsIn this experimental study, platelet concentrate and platelet poor plasma were prepared with <b>aphaeresis</b> method. Thrombin was prepared by mixing the plasma with calcium. Thrombin activity level was determined by spectrophotometric method. The platelet gel was obtained by adding thrombin and calcium to the platelet rich plasma. The concentration of growth factors was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. ResultsPlatelet rich plasma contained a total average of 1 × 1011 platelet in the 100 ml product. The highest activity of prepared thrombin was achieved at a ratio of 5 vol (5 ml) platelet poor plasma to 1 volium (1 ml) calcium gluconate (p= 0. 02). Produced thrombin was stable for two hours at 24 ºC, six hours at 4 ºC, and more than three months at - 20 ºC (p= 0. 04). Concentration of platelet derived growth factor and transforming growth factors-β in platelet gel supernatants were generally high (23. 2 ± 6 ng/ml, 18. 2 ± 5 ng/ml respectively), whereas epithelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor were present at low concentration (870 ± 110 pg/ml, 24. 7 ± 3 pg/ml respectively). ConclusionWith proper production, large numbers of platelets in the platelet rich plasma will be activated, hence high concentration of growth factors will be produced...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{recruitment}} and retention of male donors are vital for the ongoing provision of blood products. Compared with females, male donors {{are less likely to}} be medically deferred or experience vasovagal reactions and are typically preferred for plasmapheresis donation in voluntary non-remunerated settings. However, females outnumber males among donors aged under 40  years. This systematic review aimed to synthesize evidence and identify key motivators for blood donation among males to inform targeted recruitment/retention campaigns. Databases (e. g. EBSCOhost, Web of Science) were searched using terms (dona* OR dono*) AND (blood OR <b>aphaeresis</b> OR apheresis OR plasma* OR platelet* OR platlet*) in title AND (male OR gender OR sex OR female) AND (motivat* OR intention OR attitude OR behavi* OR predictor OR barrier OR deter*) NOT (organ OR sperm OR tissue OR autologous OR oocyte) in text. Two researchers independently systematically scanned quantitative, full-text, English language, peer-reviewed publications from 1990 to 2015 that examined males/females separately with outcomes of blood donation or self-reported intention. Two additional researchers resolved discrepancies. Among 28 identified articles, the most frequently cited motivators for male blood product donation were as follows: altruism; positive attitude towards incentives; health check(s); subjective norms. Altruism was less pronounced among males compared with females and was combined with 2 ̆ 7 warm glow 2 ̆ 7 in novice males (impure altruism). Perceived health benefits and incentives (e. g. coffee mugs) were stronger motivators of males than females. Marketing campaigns for recruitment/retention of male donors should focus on identified motivators rather than take a 2 ̆ 7 one-size-fits-all 2 ̆ 7 approach...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{treatment}} of patellar tendinopathies could be difficult. Recent systematic review concluded that PRP could be recommend {{as a treatment}} in such indication. Recently, the viscoelastic properties of hyaluronic acid (HA) on liquid connective tissue have been proposed for the {{treatment of}} tendinopathies. Some observations also support its use in a clinical setting to improve pain and function. We aimed to compare the effect of PRP injection versus two injections of HA after three months on patients who have a proximal patellar tendinopathy. Methods: Thirty-three sportsmen with proximal patellar tendinopathies being not relieved after minimum three months of normal physiotherapy treatments where included. Eighteen of them (group 1) have received a leukocyte poor PRP injection (obtained using an <b>aphaeresis</b> machine (3)) and the other fifteen (group 2) two HA injections, all of them have benefited of standardized rehabilitation. Concerning the evaluation of the pathology, algo-functional tests (visual analogic scale (VAS), pressure algometer, IKDC score, VISA-P score), isokinetic (associated to VAS) along with the patellar tendon ultrasonography (US) have been realized over three times (pre-injection, after 6 weeks, after 3 months post-injections). Results: The results of VAS (p 0, 05) for the healthy limb and during the analysis of the bilateral difference (p= 0, 0002). For the group 2, the improvement of quadriceps maximum peak torque in C 240 °/s is significant (p> 0, 01) for the pathological knee after 6 weeks post-injections only. The VAS associated with isokinetic tests decreases significantly for all contraction modes after three months of study. Conclusion: Both PRP and HA can improve the symptoms of proximal patellar tendinopathy, even if the results are slightly better in the PRP group. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOssetic is an archaic Iranian language, {{which is}} {{primarily}} spoken by roughly {{a half million}} people in the Caucasus. Nowadays fully surrounded by non-Iranian peoples, the speakers of Ossetic are the last descendants of those North Iranian tribes, such as Cimmerians, Scythians, Saka, Sarmatians and Alans, who used to roam the vast Eurasian steppes. It {{is for this reason that}} Ossetic contains a wealth of information which attests to their historical contacts with many and ethnically very diverse groups, like Caucasians, Finno-Ugrians, Slavs, Goths, Greeks, Turks and Mongols. Despite its isolation and recent attestation, the language has essentially kept its Iranian character, moreover, being in appearance at least as conservative as a Middle Iranian language, such as Sogdian, Chorasmian or Khotanese. In the present work a comprehensive account of some important developments which took place in the phonology of that language is given. The developments comprise apocope (loss of final vowel), syncope (loss of medial vowel), <b>aphaeresis</b> (loss of initial vowel), i-epenthesis (insertion of *i) and accompanying palatalization, and finally, the fate of *u. Also the role of the accent in these cases is addressed. None of these developments has been subjected to a systematic treatment before. The book also contains a valuable contribution to etymology, as for this research Ossetic words are gleaned and assessed from the monumental work of the eminent scholar Vasilij Abaev, Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Ossetic language. Finally, morphology is also touched upon in an extensive appendix, in which several nominal suffixes and the verbal endings are treated. The book is a contribution not only to our understanding of Ossetic itself but also to the advancement of Iranian and Caucasian studies...|$|E
