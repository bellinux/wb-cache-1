25|$|It's {{definitely}} the hardest game of cricket I've ever played. The World Cup was difficult, {{if not more}} difficult, but {{you knew it was}} <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be over in a day. This just took turn after turn after turn over the four days' duration, plus your rained out day — it was a real tough game of cricket to play for every body.|$|E

When the car reached the ascent at the Canal Bridge, the horse had to stop {{and some of the}} passengers got out. The conductor pleaded guilty but in mitigation said that the passengers were <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the Nottinghamshire v. Gloucestershire cricket match at Trent Bridge. He was fined 20s.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lord's Taverners and the involvement of early members can be broadly summarised by the following:"We've all got professional and sporting interests in common. So why not start a club, based at the beloved old tavern here. We can talk about our work and watch the cricket. And {{we can try to}} put a few bob back into the game at the same time."Since its inception, the Lord's Taverners has developed into a membership charity. For the first fifteen years, the NPFA was the sole beneficiary of the Lord's Taverners, with the money <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cricket projects, mostly for the installation of artificial pitches.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the Air Force {{had started a}} {{research}} project into future interceptor aircraft that eventually settled on an advanced specification known as the 1954 interceptor. Contracts for this specification eventually resulted {{in the selection of}} the F-102 Delta Dagger, but by 1952 it was becoming clear that none of the parts of the specification other than the airframe would be ready by 1954; the engines, weapons and fire control systems were <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take too long to get into service. An effort was then started to quickly produce an interim supersonic design to replace the various subsonic interceptors then in service, and the F-101 airframe was selected as a starting point.|$|E
25|$|As {{everything}} {{had been done to}} help the passengers, and when nothing else could be done to save them, Mr Russell and people from all over Kilkee took in survivors from the disaster for the night. The next morning the extent of the disaster became apparent with bodies and wreckage strewn across the whole beach. As the day wore on it became known that of the 216 aboard, 98 lost their lives and 118 were saved. All day, bodies washed up on the beach and in the end 54 bodies were recovered. Most of the deceased were buried in the nearby Kilfiera graveyard. To help the survivors, a subscription was held with businessmen from all over Ireland and England contributing to it. In the end over £300 was raised, <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the survivors and to the next of kin of the dead. As Ireland {{was in the middle of}} a famine, many poor people looted the ship, with some going as far as stripping the clothes from the dead.|$|E
25|$|Noticing {{that all}} sinkholes are connected, {{they come to}} the {{conclusion}} that the biggest hydra must be in the center, laying the eggs that hatch into the smaller hydras who wander through the tunnels. They notice that the giants are <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> meet that alpha hydra, and Jack Junior leaves to go kill it, followed by the children. There, they meet the giant multi-headed dragon, who had already started to kill the giants that had gathered to fight it. After hurting Jack Junior and the Grace kids, Nick has an idea and realizes it's up to him to save the day. Using the cap given to him by the merfolk so he could safely breathe, he goes into one of the tunnels with Jack's machete so to meet the hydra from below. When he gets there, instead of trying to kill the beast, he cuts the substance that keeps all the dragons together, thus making them separate from each other and easier for the giants to kill.|$|E
