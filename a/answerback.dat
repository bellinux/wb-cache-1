The way the {{transmitted}} bits were packed into larger codes varied by manufacturer; {{the most common}} solution allocates the bits from the least significant bit towards the most significant bit (leaving the three most significant bits of a byte unused).In ITA2, characters are expressed using five bits. ITA2 uses two code sub-sets, the [...] "letter shift" [...] (LTRS), and the [...] "figure shift" [...] (FIGS). The FIGS character (11011) signals that the following characters are to be interpreted as being in the FIGS set, until this is reset by the LTRS (11111) character. In use, the LTRS or FIGS shift key is pressed and released, transmitting the corresponding shift character to the other machine. The desired letters or figures characters are then typed. Unlike a typewriter or modern computer keyboard the shift key isn't kept depressed whilst the corresponding characters are typed. [...] "ENQuiry" [...] will trigger the other machine's <b>answerback.</b> It means [...] "Who are you?" ...|$|E
40|$|The Bachleor work {{deals with}} {{comparison}} of services of early care in Zlín and South Bohemian regions. The sphere of early intervention has been neglected {{for a relatively}} {{long time in the}} Czech Republic. The investigative section deal with availability early intervention in Zlin and South Bohemian regions. Secondary data anylysis was also employed as an additional method for mapping early intervention providers in this two regions. The data collection technique selected for the purpose of the bachleor research was the technique of questionnaire. Necessary information was gained from information materials of providers and on-line sources. The main objective of the bachleor work was comparison facilities providing all-inclusive early intervention in this both regions. The results was collected of clients and providers <b>answerback.</b> The results, which resulting of investigation from parents, who have a child with handicap are same in both regions. Services of early care in Zlín and South Bohemian regions aren´t same. This Bachleor work can be used for a further planning these service. It can help for the providers of this regions improve the services of early intervention...|$|E
