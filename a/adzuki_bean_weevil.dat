Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants.

50|$|The <b>Adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> females {{lay their}} eggs {{directly}} {{on the surface of}} the legume singly and move on to either a different part of the legume or else to a different one depending on the bean density and competition among other females to lay more eggs. They can lay as many as 90 eggs after a single fertilization. Fecundity is relative to which legume is being used as a host and female fitness. The eggs usually hatch after 3-5 days and the new larvae will burrow into the been for the rest of development.|$|E

40|$|The <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> Callosobruchus chinensis is {{the main}} pest of mungbean {{especially}} during seed storage. Mungbean generally has low yield and is susceptible to main pests. Ricebean (Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi & Ohashi) has superior characters such as the high pod number per plant and resistance to many pests. The interspecific hybridization was conducted to combine the superior characters of mungbean and ricebean.   The objectives of this research were to evaluate resistance of hybrids of interspecific hybridization between mungbean and ricebean to C. chinensis and to determine pattern of resistant inheritance. Evaluation of resistance to this pest was conducted in bottles by placing 200 hybrid seeds and then 20 C. chinensis adults were introduced into the bottle covered by dense cheese cloth. The bottles were arranged in a completely ramdomized design with three replications. The treatment consisted of eight hybrids and six parents.   The {{results showed that the}} resistance of the test hybrids to C. chinensis was different among cross combinations. Hybrids of crossing between mungbean Merak variety and yellow ricebean as well as Vima variety and red ricebean were moderately resistant, while the others were resistant. There was resistance improvement of hybrids to C. chinensis. The resistance of the hybrids to C. chinensis was controlled by single gene with partially dominance gene action...|$|E
40|$|Background: The <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil,</b> Callosobruchus chinensis L., {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} pests of stored legume seeds such as mungbean, cowpea, and adzuki bean, which usually cause considerable loss in the quantity and quality of stored seeds during transportation and storage. However, a lack of genetic information of this pest results in a series of genetic questions remain largely unknown, including population genetic structure, kinship, biotype abundance, and so on. Co-dominant microsatellite markers offer a great resolving power to determine these events. Here, we report rapid microsatellite isolation from C. chinensis via high-throughput sequencing. Principal Findings: In this study, 94, 560, 852 quality-filtered and trimmed reads were obtained for the assembly of genome using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. In total, the genome with total length of 497, 124, 785 bp, comprising 403, 113 high quality contigs was generated with de novo assembly. More than 6800 SSR loci were detected and a suit of 6303 primer pair sequences were designed and 500 of them were randomly selected for validation. Of these, 196 pair of primers, i. e. 39. 2 %, produced reproducible amplicons that were polymorphic among 8 C. chinensis genotypes collected from different geographical regions. Twenty out of 196 polymorphic SSR markers were used to analyze the genetic diversity of 18 C. chinensis populations. The results showed the twenty SSR loci were highly polymorphic among these populations.

40|$|Background and purpose: As an herbal medicine, <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> {{has been}} practiced since the Tang Dynasty of China to {{maintain}} health and control weight; {{this practice is}} still very popular in China nowadays. However, it is still lack of sufficient scientific basis to explain scientific principle of this popular civil practice in weight control using <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to verify and explain the anti-obesity effects of <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> through in vitro enzymatic assays, in vitro lipolysis and in vivo study of obese mice model. Methods: Inhibitory effects of flavonoids and saponins from <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> (Vigna angularis) on pancreatic lipase, α-glucosidase activities, and noradrenaline-induced lipolysis were assessed. High-fat diet-induced obesity model was created to study anti-obesity effects of <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean.</b> Both serum and liver lipid parameters were determined after 8 weeks intervention. Results: <b>Adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> extracts enhanced lipolysis. Compared to the final body weight of high-fat diet group, oral administration of <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced the final body weight of mice and adipose tissue accumulation. The <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> intervention also significantly reduced the levels of serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and liver lipid. Conclusion: <b>Adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> demonstrated the anti-obesity effects on mice, such effects may mediated through the inhibitory effects of flavonoids and saponins from <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> on α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase activities, and lipolysis enhancement effect of active components from <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} to render pulses inedible to weevils {{has the potential}} to greatly reduce post-harvest losses. The breakthrough has come about because a team of US and Australian researchers have been able to transfer the natural resistance that is found in the common kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) into the common pea (Pisum sativum). Using the same technique, the researchers are confident that the resistance can be transferred into cowpeas, chickpeas, mung beans and other pulses. The resistant gene was transferred from the common kidney bean by Professor Thomas Higgins of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in Canberra. He used a well-established technique involving the bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens. When that bacterium infects a plant it inserts its own genes. So by placing the weevil resistant gene in Agrobacterium, the bacterium then acts like a syringe and injects the gene into the cells of the common pea. Professor Maarten Crispeels of the University of California, San Diego, then attached an extra piece of DNA which switches the genes on in the seeds and nowhere else. The genetically altered pea seeds were tested against two common pests, the cowpea weevil (Callosobruchus maculatus) and the <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> (C. chinensis). The larvae of both insects ate the unaltered peas without effect, but died soon after touching the altered seeds. The resistant genes produce an inhibitor to the alpha-amylase enzyme produced by the larvae. This enzyme is crucial for the digestion of starch. By preventing this enzyme from working, the; larva gets no nutrition' from what it has eaten and ' therefore starves to death. The research team sees no health or other risks to humans, because people have been eating kidney beans for thousands of years with no ill effects. The enzyme is also destroyed during cooking. The research team are not patenting their technology but it has been published openly and the team plan to make their work available to governments and research organizations who are interested.

Experiments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with either five PRE or nine POST herbicides. Volunteer <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> interference in soybean resulted in yield loss of up to 25 %. Cloransulam-methyl, linuron, metribuzin, flumetsulam, and imazethapyr applied PRE provided up to 6, 24, 14, 8, and 0 % control, respectively at 8 weeks after emergence (WAE), while acifluorfen, fomesafen, bentazon, thifensulfuron-methyl, cloransulam-methyl, imazethapyr, and imazethapyr plus bentazon applied POST provided 2, 2, 5, 34, 6, 4, and 12 % control, respectively at 8 weeks after application (WAA).

Soaking, cooking, grinding, filtering, rinsing and centrifuging are processes for producing <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> paste, then followed by adding cooking and concentrating with agar and sugar to form <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> jelly. In this study, effects of soaking and cooking processes on <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> were investigated. A three - variable and three-level design method analyzed by response surface methodology was used to determine optimum operating conditions for preparation of <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> paste and <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> jelly. Based on analyses of microstructure and gel properties. The factors that affected the processes and quality of <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> jelly were determined. On the other hand, the <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> powder was also used to evaluate the feasibility of production of <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> jelly. The results were as follows. Water absorption, volume swelling and percentage of solid loss of <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> steadily increased with the increase of soaking temperature(r 2 > 0. 87). The high correlation value(r 2 > 0. 92) observed confirmed that the water absorption rate of <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> during soaking is temperature dependent. The soaking temperature and soaking time could be varied and were related. Their relationship can be expressed by the equation: t = 79583 T - 1. 426 when moisture content was 80 %(Equilibrium moisture content at 70 ℃). On the microstructure of cotyledons, pectic substances of the middle lamella were loss during cooking. Protein denatured and compassed starch granules, then <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> paste granules are produced after grinding and separating. When soaking accompanied with cooking, paste production could increased, rupture of cell wall decreased and improve qualities of <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> paste in the end. In this study, the response surface methodology (RSM) was determined to obtain the optimum process conditions of <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> paste and jelly. By the way of our results, soaking 5 ~ 6 hrs and cooking at temperature 110. 5 ℃ combined with cooking for 45 min would yield an optimum process with best <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> paste products. And the optimum process conditions of <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> jelly was agar concentration 1. 2 ~ 1. 5 %, sugar content 34 ~ 40 % and concentrating time 30 ~ 45 min.
