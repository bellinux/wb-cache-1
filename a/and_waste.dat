40|$|Despite major {{advances}} in the treatment and survival of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), weight loss <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> remain common problems. In the HIV-infected population, weight loss is associated with lower CD 4 + cell counts and is an independent predictor of mortality. The etiology of weight loss <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> is complex <b>and</b> multifactorial. We discuss, {{on the basis of}} a large longitudinal cohort that examined nutritional status in HIV infection, data on weight loss <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> from the present clinical era. The definition, prevalence, and significance of HIV-associated weight loss <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> are summarized. The etiology of weight loss is discussed for 2 main categories: inadequate nutrient intake and altered metabolism. Finally, studies of interventions to treat HIV-associated weight loss <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> are discussed. This information is intended to raise awareness among health care providers of HIV-infected patients that weight loss <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> remain important acquired immunodeficiency syndrome–defining conditions, despite the advent of HAART. During the HAART era, HIV infection has become a chronic, manageable disease. Nutrition-related complications remain a challenging issue for HIV-infected patients and for those in-volved in their care. Involuntary weight loss is associated with disease progression and death, even where access to HAART is not limited [1, 2]. HIV-associated weight loss <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> wer...|$|R

Moreover, some demand-pulled invisible multipliers, in terms of the scraps <b>and</b> <b>wastes,</b> have been explored by performing a numerical simulation. From the invisible multipliers, we find the paradoxical phenomenon that the reduction in the amount of final disposal and the promotion of material recycling decreases the intermediate demand of the scraps <b>and</b> <b>wastes</b> for material recycling if there is a time-lag in the introduction of the appropriate recycling technology.

40|$|Introduction: Malnutrition in {{preschool}} {{children is a}} significant problem and has been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the most lethal form of malnutrition, indirectly or directly causes an annual death of at least 5 million children worldwide. The object {{of this study was}} to estimated the rate of underweight, stunting <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> among preschool children in northeast of Iran. Methods: A cross sectional population based study was conducted and 70339 children; 35792 males and 34547 females were recruited. The primary outcome variables were; weight, height, age and gender of the children. The sex and age specific rate and overall rate of underweight, stunting, <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> were calculated. Results: The rate of underweight, stunting, <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> were 7. 5 %, 12. 5 % and 4. 4 % respectively. There were significant differences in stunting <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> rate between boys and girls. The overall rate of stunting was significantly higher than the overall rates of underweight <b>and</b> <b>wasting.</b> The rate of malnutrition increased with child’s age. Conclusion: In compare to WHO criteria, the rate of malnutrition among this study population was low. According to the higher rate of stunting, the main goal of future research and interventions must be finding the causes of deficiency in height growth and improving it. </span...|$|R
