2500|$|In August, France passed what a New York Times {{editorial}} {{described as}} the most comprehensive law on gender equality in that country to date, Loi pour l'égalité réelle entre les femmes et les hommes.

Provisions were changed to encourage more men to take paternal leave and requiring workplaces to improve gender equality or face fines. There are also several provisions to strengthen the fight against domestic abuse. Beauty pageants were forbidden for girls under 13 years of age, and the media was forbidden from portraying women in a sexist or demeaning way.

The law was quickly challenged in court by a number of individuals — including Chancellor Helmut Kohl — and by the State of Bavaria. The Constitutional Court decided a year later to maintain its earlier decision that the constitution protected the fetus from the moment of conception, but stated that it is within the discretion of parliament not to punish abortion in the first trimester, provided that the woman had submitted to state-regulated counseling intended to discourage termination and protect unborn life. Parliament passed such a law in 1995. [...] Abortions are covered by public health insurance.|$|R

With regard to the obligations of the diocesan bishop, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops declared in 2004: [...] "The question has been raised {{as to whether the}} denial of Holy Communion to some Catholics in political life is necessary because of their public support for <b>abortion</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b> Given the wide range of circumstances involved in arriving at a prudential judgment on a matter of this seriousness, we recognize that such decisions rest with the individual bishop in accord with the established canonical and pastoral principles.

The polarizing tendencies of election-year politics can lead to circumstances in which Catholic teaching and sacramental practice can be misused for political ends.

5000|$|Abortion in Serbia was legalized in {{its current}} form (in Serbia and the other former Yugoslav republics) on October 7, 1977. Abortion is {{available}} on-demand for women whose pregnancies have not exceeded the tenth week, {{and in the case of}} risk to life or health of woman (no limit specified), or when the pregnancy has resulted from a sex offence (including rape or incest), or in case of fetal impairment up to twenty weeks. Minors under 16 require parental consent before undergoing an abortion. Some estimates suggest that Serbia has the highest abortion rate in Europe. Official data from the Belgrade Institute of Public Health claims that 23,000 abortions are performed in Serbia annually, but unofficial data suggests a number as high as 150,000. [...] Although abortions performed after 10 weeks must be done only if there is a specific approved reason, in practice, <b>abortions</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> are performed later than the legal limit - women often obtain fake medical documentation, for example, a note from a psychiatrist stating that they are mentally unstable. Furthermore, doctors who want to perform abortions have to obtain a license; because the process of obtaining this license can be strict and complicated many doctors work illegally without a license, and do not report the abortions that they perform. Until recently, abortion was a leading method of birth control in what is now the country of Serbia. Lack of sex education, coupled with little to no knowledge of contraception methods caused a large number of unwanted pregnancies, and with them, a high number of terminations. In the 1970s and 1980s, approximately 12 percent of sexually active women in Serbia used modern contraception such as condoms.|$|R

[...] This produced cries of disappointment in the audience.

Indeed, this ethic now stood as the chief enemy.

Member denominations soon complied. In a 1970 Report, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) rejected the old “taboos and prohibitions” and gave its blessing to “mass contraceptive techniques,” homosexuality, and low-cost <b>abortion</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b> The same year, the Lutheran Church in America fully embraced contraception and abortion as responsible choices. And in 1977, the United Church of Christ celebrated the terms “freedom,” “sensuousness,” and “androgyny,” and declared free access to contraception and abortion as matters of justice.|$|E

40|$|Introduction/Aim. Induced {{termination}} of unwanted pregnancy after 12 th gestational week (late-term abortion) is legally restricted in Serbia {{as well as}} in many other countries. On the other hand, unwanted pregnancy very often brings women into the state of personal crisis. Psychiatric indications for legally approved late-term <b>abortion</b> <b>on</b> women’s <b>demand</b> include only severe psychiatric disorders. The aim of this paper was to compare sociodemographic, psychological characteristics and claimed reasons for abortion in the two groups of women with late-term demand for abortion - the group of women satisfying legally prescribed mental health indications, and the group of women not satisfying these indications. The aim of the study was also to determine predictive validity of the abovementioned parameters for late-term abortion as the outcome of unwanted pregnancy. Methods. A total of 62 pregnant women with demand for late-term abortion were divided into two groups according to the criteria of satisfying or not satisfying legally proposed psychiatric indications for late-term abortion after psychiatric evaluation. For the assessment of sociodemographic and psychological parameters sociodemographic questionnaire and symptom checklist - 90 revised (SCL- 90 ®) scale were used, respectively. The outcome of unwanted pregnancy was followed 6 months after the initial assessment. Results. The obtained results showed a statistically significant difference between the groups in educational level, satisfaction with financial situation, elevated anxiety and distress reactions. Unfavorable social circumstances were the main reason for an abortion in both groups and were predictive for an abortion. A 6 -month follow-up showed that women had abortion despite legal restrictions. Conclusion. Pregnant women with psychiatric indication for late-term abortion belong to lower socioeconomic and educational level group compared to women without this indication who have more frequently elevated anxiety and distress reactions to unwanted pregnancy. It is necessary to have more accurate guidelines for mental health indications for legally approved late-term abortion, respecting social circumstances. Preventive measures are of great importance in order to lower the risk of illegally performed late-term abortions...|$|R
