5|$|<b>Astatine</b> has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– {{lower than that}} of iodine (2.66) and the same as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as <b>astatine</b> hydride. That would be consistent with the electronegativity of <b>astatine</b> on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2). The electron affinity of <b>astatine</b> is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{physical}} properties of <b>astatine</b> have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using theoretically or empirically derived methods. For example, halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight– fluorine is nearly colorless, chlorine is yellow-green, bromine is red-brown, and iodine is dark gray/violet. <b>Astatine</b> is sometimes described as probably being a black solid (assuming it follows this trend), or as having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or a metal). The melting and boiling points of <b>astatine</b> are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series, increasing with atomic number. On this basis they {{are estimated to be}} , respectively. Some experimental evidence suggests <b>astatine</b> may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the halogen trend. <b>Astatine</b> sublimes less readily than does iodine, having a lower vapor pressure. Even so, half of a given quantity of <b>astatine</b> will vaporize in approximately an hour if put on a clean glass surface at room temperature. The absorption spectrum of <b>astatine</b> in the middle ultraviolet region has lines at 224.401 and 216.225nm, suggestive of 6p to 7s transitions.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of <b>astatine</b> {{are not known}} with any certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. A visible piece of <b>astatine</b> would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. It {{remains to be seen}} if, with sufficient cooling, a macroscopic quantity of <b>astatine</b> could be deposited as a thin film. <b>Astatine</b> is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid; metal formation has also been predicted.|$|E

500|$|Differences {{for other}} {{electron}} levels also exist. For example, the 6d electron levels (also split in two, with four being 6d3/2 and six being 6d5/2) are both raised, {{so they are}} close in energy to the 7s ones, although no 6d electron chemistry has been predicted for tennessine. The difference between the 7p1/2 and 7p3/2 levels is abnormally high; 9.8eV. <b>Astatine's</b> 6p subshell split is only 3.8eV, and its 6p1/2 chemistry has already been called [...] "limited".

They also said that metalloids are typically semiconductors, though antimony and arsenic (semimetals from a physics perspective) have electrical conductivities approaching those of metals. Selenium and polonium are suspected as not in this scheme, while <b>astatine's</b> status is uncertain.|$|R
5|$|The {{formation}} of an <b>astatine</b> compound with hydrogen– usually referred to as hydrogen astatide– was noted by the pioneers of <b>astatine</b> chemistry. As mentioned, there are grounds for instead referring to this compound as <b>astatine</b> hydride. It is easily oxidized; acidification by dilute nitric acid gives the At0 or At+ forms, and the subsequent addition of silver(I) may only partially, at best, precipitate <b>astatine</b> as silver(I) astatide (AgAt). Iodine, in contrast, is not oxidized, and precipitates readily as silver(I) iodide.|$|E
5|$|As a halogen, <b>astatine</b> {{tends to}} be {{classified}} as a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified as either a metalloid or (less often) as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a metal. In 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal. In 1950 <b>astatine</b> was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, <b>astatine</b> was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Astatine</b> is an {{extremely}} radioactive element; all its isotopes have short half-lives of 8.1 hours or less, decaying into other <b>astatine</b> isotopes, bismuth, polonium or radon. Most of its isotopes are very unstable with half-lives of one second or less. Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only francium is less stable, and all the <b>astatine</b> isotopes more stable than francium are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature.|$|E
5000|$|Differences {{for other}} {{electron}} levels also exist.

5|$|<b>Astatine</b> is {{the rarest}} {{naturally}} occurring element. The {{total amount of}} <b>astatine</b> in the Earth's crust (quoted mass 2.36 × 1025 grams) {{is estimated to be}} less than one gram at any given time.|$|E
5|$|Less {{reactive}} than iodine, <b>astatine</b> is {{the least}} reactive of the halogens, although its compounds have been synthesized in microscopic amounts and studied as intensively as possible before their radioactive disintegration. The reactions involved have been typically tested with dilute solutions of <b>astatine</b> mixed with larger amounts of iodine. Acting as a carrier, the iodine ensures there is sufficient material for laboratory techniques (such as filtration and precipitation) to work. Like iodine, <b>astatine</b> {{has been shown to}} adopt odd-numbered oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.|$|E
5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{commented on the}} {{metallic}} nature {{of some of the}} properties of <b>astatine.</b> Since iodine is a semiconductor in the direction of its planes, and since the halogens become more metallic with increasing atomic number, it has been presumed that <b>astatine</b> would be a metal if it could form a condensed phase. <b>Astatine</b> may be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with an enthalpy of vaporization (∆Hvap) greater than ~42 kJ/mol are metallic when liquid. Such elements include boron, silicon, germanium, antimony, selenium and tellurium. Estimated values for ∆Hvap of diatomic <b>astatine</b> are 50 kJ/mol or higher; diatomic iodine, with a ∆Hvap of 41.71, falls just short of the threshold figure.|$|E
5|$|The melting and boiling {{points of}} {{tennessine}} are not known; earlier papers predicted about 350–500°C and 550°C, respectively, or 350–550°C and 610°C, respectively. These values exceed those of <b>astatine</b> and the lighter halogens, following periodic trends. A later paper predicts {{the boiling point}} of tennessine to be 345°C (that of <b>astatine</b> is estimated as 309°C, 337°C, or 370°C, although experimental values of 230°C and 411°C have been reported). The density of tennessine {{is expected to be}} between 7.1 and 7.3g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density among the halogens; that of <b>astatine</b> is estimated to be between 6.2 and 6.5g·cm−3.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of solid <b>astatine</b> is unknown. As an analogue of iodine {{it may have}} an orthorhombic crystalline structure composed of diatomic <b>astatine</b> molecules, and be a semiconductor (with a band gap of 0.7 eV). Alternatively, if condensed <b>astatine</b> forms a metallic phase, as has been predicted, it may have a monatomic face-centered cubic structure. Evidence for (or against) the existence of diatomic <b>astatine</b> (At2) is sparse and inconclusive. Some sources state {{that it does not}} exist, or at least has never been observed, while other sources assert or imply its existence. Despite this controversy, many properties of diatomic <b>astatine</b> have been predicted; for example, its bond length would be 300 ±10 pm, dissociation energy 83.7 ±12.5 kJ·mol−1,, Cl2, Br2, I2, and At2| url=http://theochem.chem.rug.nl/publications/PDF/ft279.pdf| journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics |volume=104 |issue=22|pages=9040–9046| doi=10.1063/1.471636|bibcode= 1996JChPh.104.9040V}} and heat of vaporization (∆Hvap) 54.39 kJ·mol−1. The latter figure means that <b>astatine</b> may (at least) be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with a heat of vaporization greater than ~42 kJ·mol−1 are metallic when liquid; diatomic iodine, with a value of 41.71 kJ·mol−1, falls just short of the threshold figure.|$|E
5|$|There are 39 known {{isotopes}} of <b>astatine,</b> with atomic masses (mass numbers) of 191–229. Theoretical modeling {{suggests that}} 37 more isotopes could exist. No stable or long-lived <b>astatine</b> isotope has been observed, nor is one expected to exist.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{studies show}} that <b>astatine,</b> {{similarly}} to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, <b>astatine</b> also shows {{a tendency to be}} taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If administered {{in the form of a}} radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of <b>astatine</b> into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of <b>astatine</b> can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Astatine's {{alpha decay}} {{energies}} {{follow the same}} trend as for other heavy elements. Lighter <b>astatine</b> isotopes have quite high energies of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, {{because it has a}} nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a magic number corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1hours for astatine-210 and 7.2hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%. The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived <b>astatine</b> isotope. Even though heavier <b>astatine</b> isotopes release less energy, no long-lived <b>astatine</b> isotope exists, because of the increasing role of beta decay (electron emission). This decay mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay. Beta decay modes have been found for all <b>astatine</b> isotopes except astatine-213, -214, -215, and -216m. Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay (positron emission), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes electron capture.|$|E
5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or <b>astatine</b> are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and <b>astatine</b> as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Francium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolFr and atomic number87. It {{used to be}} known as eka-caesium and actinium K. It is the second-least electronegative element, behind only caesium, and is the second rarest naturally occurring element (after <b>astatine).</b> Francium is a highly radioactive metal that decays into <b>astatine,</b> radium, and radon. As an alkali metal, it has one valence electron.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of <b>astatine</b> {{are not known}} with any certainty. Many {{of them have been}} estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine, {{and a member of the}} halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). <b>Astatine</b> is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several anionic species of <b>astatine</b> are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).|$|E
5|$|The six {{commonly}} recognised metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. Five {{elements are}} less frequently so classified: carbon, aluminium, selenium, polonium, and <b>astatine.</b> On a standard periodic table, all eleven {{are in a}} diagonal area in the p-block extending from boron at the upper left to <b>astatine</b> at lower right, along the dividing line between metals and nonmetals shown on some periodic tables.|$|E
5|$|Francium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{unstable}} of the naturally occurring elements: its longest-lived isotope, francium-223, has a half-life of only 22minutes. The only comparable element is <b>astatine,</b> whose most stable natural isotope, astatine-219 (the alpha daughter of francium-223), has a half-life of 56seconds, although synthetic astatine-210 is much longer-lived with a half-life of 8.1hours. All isotopes of francium decay into <b>astatine,</b> radium, or radon. Francium-223 also has a shorter half-life than the longest-lived isotope of each synthetic element up to and including element 105, dubnium.|$|E
5|$|Restrepo et al. {{reported}} that <b>astatine</b> {{appeared to be}} more polonium-like than halogen-like. They did so {{on the basis of}} detailed comparative studies of the known and interpolated properties of 72 elements.|$|E
5|$|Some of astatine's {{reported}} {{properties are}} nonmetallic. It has the narrow liquid range ordinarily associated with nonmetals (mp 302°C; bp 337°C). Batsanov gives a calculated band gap energy for <b>astatine</b> of 0.7eV; {{this is consistent}} with nonmetals (in physics) having separated valence and conduction bands and thereby being either semiconductors or insulators. The chemistry of <b>astatine</b> in aqueous solution is mainly characterised by the formation of various anionic species. Most of its known compounds resemble those of iodine, which is a halogen and a nonmetal. Such compounds include astatides (XAt), astatates (XAtO3), and monovalent interhalogen compounds.|$|E
5|$|Emilio Gino Segrè (1 February 1905 – 22 April 1989) was an Italian-American {{physicist}} and Nobel laureate, {{who discovered the}} elements technetium and <b>astatine,</b> and the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle, {{for which he was}} awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{and their}} closer neighbours mostly {{cost less than}} silver; only polonium and <b>astatine</b> are more expensive than gold, on account of their significant radioactivity. As of 5 April 2014, prices for small samples (up to 100 g) of silicon, antimony and tellurium, and graphite, aluminium and selenium, average around one third the cost of silver (US$1.5 per gram or about $45 an ounce). Boron, germanium and arsenic samples average about three-and-a-half times the cost of silver. Polonium is available for about $100 per microgram. Zalutsky and Pruszynski estimate a similar cost for producing <b>astatine.</b> Prices for the applicable elements traded as commodities tend to range from {{two to three times}} cheaper than the sample price (Ge), to nearly three thousand times cheaper (As).|$|E
5|$|Any <b>astatine</b> {{present at}} the {{formation}} of the Earth has long since disappeared; the four naturally occurring isotopes (astatine-215, -217, -218 and -219) are instead continuously produced {{as a result of the}} decay of radioactive thorium and uranium ores, and trace quantities of neptunium-237. The landmass of North and South America combined, to a depth of 16 kilometers (10 miles), contains only about one trillion astatine-215 atoms at any given time (around 3.5 × 10−10 grams). Astatine-217 is produced via the radioactive decay of neptunium-237. Primordial remnants of the latter isotope—due to its relatively short half-life of 2.14 million years—are no longer present on Earth. However, trace amounts occur naturally as a product of transmutation reactions in uranium ores. Astatine-218 was the first <b>astatine</b> isotope discovered in nature. Astatine-219, with a half-life of 56 seconds, is the longest lived of the naturally occurring isotopes.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Benito Mussolini's fascist {{government}} passed anti-Semitic laws barring Jews from university positions. As a Jew, Segrè was now rendered {{an indefinite}} émigré. At the Berkeley Radiation Lab, Lawrence {{offered him a}} job as a research assistant. While at Berkeley, Segrè helped discover the element <b>astatine</b> and the isotope plutonium-239, which was later used to make the Fat Man nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} isotope is astatine-210, {{which has a}} {{half-life}} of 8.1hours. The primary decay mode is beta plus, to the relatively long-lived (in comparison to <b>astatine</b> isotopes) alpha emitter polonium-210. In total, only five isotopes have half-lives exceeding one hour (astatine-207 to -211). The least stable ground state isotope is astatine-213, with a half-life of 125 nanoseconds. It undergoes alpha decay to the extremely long-lived bismuth-209.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{unstable}} −1 state, three more oxidation states are predicted; +5, +3, and +1. The +1 state should be especially stable {{because of the}} destabilization of the three outermost 7p3/2 electrons, forming a stable, half-filled subshell configuration; <b>astatine</b> shows similar effects. The +3 state should be important, again due to the destabilized 7p3/2 electrons. The +5 state is predicted to be uncommon because the 7p1/2 electrons are oppositely stabilized. The +7 state has not been shown—even computationally—to be achievable. Because the 7s electrons are greatly stabilized, it has been hypothesized that tennessine effectively has only five valence electrons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Astatine</b> is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol At and atomic number 85. It is the rarest naturally occurring {{element in the}} Earth's crust, occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements. All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{are among the}} most {{electropositive}} elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table, the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and <b>astatine),</b> forming salts known as the alkali metal halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions. All twenty stable alkali metal halides are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of <b>astatine</b> and francium. The most well-known of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride, otherwise known as common salt. All of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points. All the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li+ and F− ions, causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong: a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride, consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between nonmetals and metals {{is by no}} means clear. The result is that a few borderline elements lacking a preponderance of either nonmetallic or metallic properties are classified as metalloids; and some elements classified as nonmetals are instead sometimes classified as metalloids, or vice versa. For example, selenium (Se), a nonmetal, is sometimes classified instead as a metalloid, particularly in environmental chemistry; and <b>astatine</b> (At), which is a metalloid and a halogen, is sometimes classified instead as a nonmetal.|$|E
5|$|The first 94 {{elements}} occur naturally; {{the remaining}} 24, americium to oganesson (95–118) occur only when synthesized in laboratories. Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are primordial and 11 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements. No element heavier than einsteinium (element 99) {{has ever been}} observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, nor has <b>astatine</b> (element 85); francium (element 87) has been only photographed {{in the form of}} light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms).|$|E
