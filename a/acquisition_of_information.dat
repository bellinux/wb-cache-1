5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century {{spectral}} analysis was developed by Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen. It enabled the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on the physical parameters and chemical abundances of stars, by the spectral analysis of their light. Foerster recognized these possibilities and initiated the building of a solar observatory in 1871 as a memorial to the crown prince, in which he emphasized the importance and profit of solar research. This idea was soon extended to the whole of astrophysics.|$|E
40|$|In {{a beauty}} contest framework, {{we show that}} more precise public {{information}} contributes to higher welfare when the precision <b>of</b> private <b>information</b> is endogenous. We consider a Stackelberg game in which public authorities decide the accuracy <b>of</b> public <b>information</b> taking into account how this affects the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> private <b>information</b> and the choice of individual actions in equilibrium. Because the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> private <b>information</b> is costly, {{an increase in the}} precision <b>of</b> public <b>information</b> increases welfare by reducing the incentives for <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> private <b>information,</b> thereby inducing socially valuable savings of private resources.

2500|$|In 1890, William James defined {{psychology}} as [...] "the {{science of}} mental life, both of its phenomena and their conditions". This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as John B.

Also since James defined it, the term more strongly connotes techniques of scientific experimentation.
