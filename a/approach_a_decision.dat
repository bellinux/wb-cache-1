30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{three-phase}} decision making approach for self-adaptive vehicle systems to improve the precision of decisions with competitive efficiency. The approach makes use of B-kNN (Kafaf et al. 2017), a variation of k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) (Cover and Hart 1967) for improved efficiency in object identification. In the <b>approach,</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> is made in three phases supported by web services. In the first phase, a self-adaptive unit (SAU) makes the initial decision for an encountered object using its local knowledge base. If the object cannot be identified, the SAU sends a request to a context-specific knowledge base, which is specific to an environment (e.g., indoor, outdoor), {{in the second phase}} via a web service. The context-specific knowledge base is shared and evolves by multiple SAUs within the same environment. If the object still cannot be identified, the system further requests to the global knowledge base in the third phase. The global knowledge base is shared and contributed by all vehicles across different environments.|$|E

Methods Conceptual review of {{the strengths and}} weaknesses of intuitive and analytical decision making and applying these findings to the practice of DA design. Results DAs combine several important goals: providing information, helping to clarify treatment related values, supporting preference construction processes, and facilitating more active engagement in decision making. Many DAs encourage patients to <b>approach</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> analytically, without solid theoretical or empirical grounding for this approach.

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the short term}} and long term cost effectiveness, from a healthcare perspective, associated {{with the introduction of}} lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B. Design: The analysis used a 2 -step modelling <b>approach.</b> <b>A</b> <b>decision</b> tree was used to estimate clinical outcomes and costs after 1 year. The 1 -year results were then extrapolated to 70 years using a Markov model. Patients: The study population comprised hypothetical cohorts of patients with chronic hepatitis B, representative of those likely to receive treatment in clinical practice in Australia. Main outcome measures and results: In the short term, more patients seroconverted when lamivudine was available, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 3341 Australian dollars ($A) per additional seroconversion. In the long term, the introduction of lamivudine increased life expectancy by 3. 9 years [3. 2 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) ] compared with when interferon-alpha was the only treatment, or 4. 6 years (3. 8 QALYs) compared with no treatment. There were reductions in lifetime risk of developing compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma of 5, 11 and 11 %, respectively, when lamivudine was available. The incremental cost of having lamivudine available, as opposed to interferon-alpha only, was $A 633 per year of life saved or $A 735 per QALY. Conclusion: The introduction of lamivudine is expected to reduce and delay the progression of chronic hepatitis B, increasing the life expectancy and quality of life of patients for a small overall increase in healthcare costs.

In recent years, {{there has been}} a steady growth in the use of information systems in the logistics domain towards facilitating an agile distribution process. This study investigates the problem of collaboration planning in logistics and proposes an agent based approach for better management of collaborative logistics. Based on the <b>approach,</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> support system is designed that utilizes RFID technology for ensuring inventory accuracy and monitoring carriers’ delivery movements. The proposed approach involves three steps. In the first step, a conceptual framework is designed. Afterwards, a simulation agent based model is developed including six autonomous agents namely (RFIDG, Supplier, Retailer, Carrier, Network, and City Administrator) interacting with each other, as well as, with the surrounding environment. In the second step, game theory is utilized to study and analyze suppliers’ collaboration and carriers’ collaboration behavior in detail. Modeled games are solved using Nash Equilibrium.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to passive detection and avoidance of collision and near-collision with moving obstacles by Uninhabited Aerial Systems (UAS) is proposed in this paper. It takes as inputs the bearings between the ownship and the moving obstacles (intruders) only. Bearings can be measured by passive sensors such as millimetre-wave (mmW) or infra-red (IR) imaging thus adding {{an important aspect of}} covertness. The first stage of the approach deals with the detection of the moving obstacle (intruder) and is called collision risk estimator (CRE). The proposed novel approach estimates the risk of collision based on the density of consecutive bearings (constant bearings correspond to high risk and variation in bearings corresponds to low risk). The approach is recursive and thus makes possible to take as many past values of the bearings as practically needed without memorising them. Once a collision is detected, in the second stage of the <b>approach,</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> is taken whether an emergency collision avoidance manoeuvre is necessary or a smoother and optimal (in terms of minimum time) rerouting can take place (de-confliction). The decision which of the two possible alternative avoidance actions is going to be taken can be based on the estimated ‘time-to-collision’ or on the degree of risk and is outside of the scope of the current paper. Emergency collision avoidance manoeuvres are taken in accordance to the Rules of the Air (RoA) and are limited by the ownship kinematic and aerodynamic characteristics only. Optimal re-routing provides a trajectory and the sequence of control actions that are necessary to be taken to ensure this trajectory of the ownship. As a whole, the above stages provide a {{new approach}} to passive detection and avoidance (in an optimal fashion) of moving obstacles (intruders) based on bearings only provided by passive sensors...|$|E
40|$|If an estuarine {{system is}} to be {{investigated}} using an oceanographic modeling <b>approach,</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> must be made whether to use a simple and robust framework based on e. g. mass-balance considerations, or if a more advanced process-resolving three-dimensional (3 -D) numerical model are necessary. Although the former are straightforward to apply, certain fundamental constraints must be fulfilled. 3 -D modeling, even though requiring significant efforts to implement, generates an abundance of highly resolved data in time and space, which may lead to problems when attempting to specify the "representative state" of the system, a common goal in estuarine studies. In this thesis, different types of models suitable for investigating estuarine systems have been utilized in various settings. A mass-balance model was applied to investigate potential changes of water fluxes and salinities due to the restoration of a mangrove estuary in northern Colombia. Seiches, i. e. standing waves, in the Baltic Sea were simulated using a 2 -D shallow-water model which showed that the dominating harmonic oscillation originates from a fjord seiche in the Gulf of Finland rather than being global. Another study pertaining to the Gulf of Finland used velocity-fields from a 3 -D numerical model together with Lagrangian-trajectory analyses to investigate the mixing dynamics. The results showed that water from the Baltic proper is mixed with that from the river Neva over a limited zone in the inner parts of the Gulf. Lagrangian-trajectory analysis was finally also used {{as a tool to}} compare mass-balance and 3 -D model results from the Gulf of Riga and the Bay of Gdansk, highlighting when and where each method is applicable. From the present thesis it can be concluded that the above described estuarine-modeling approaches not only require different levels of effort for their implementation, but also yield results of varying quality. If oceanographic aspects are {{to be taken into account}} within Integrated Coastal Zone Managment, which most likely should be the case, it is therefore important to decide as early as possible in the planning process which model to use, since this choice ultimately determines how much information about the physical processes characterizing the system the model can be expected to provide...|$|E
