Banksy had purchased <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>basic</b> painting of a landscape, added his own special touch {{in the form of}} a Nazi in full uniform resting on a bench and enjoying the view, and donated it back to the store, drastically increasing their patronage for the day.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{moved into}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>basic</b> ground-floor {{apartment}} in London, on Clarendon Road, Notting Hill. Given {{how hard it}} was to find decent housing, they decided instead to share with Helge Rubinstein and her husband, the literary agent Hilary Rubinstein, who at the time was working for his uncle, Victor Gollancz. In 1955 the four of them bought a four-storey, seven-bedroom house in Phillimore Place, Kensington, for ₤6,800, a home they lived in together for 14 years. Williams described it as one of the happiest periods of his life.|$|E

5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>basic,</b> elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} {{was first}} governed by William Henry Harrison {{who oversaw the}} negotiation with the native inhabitants to open {{large parts of the}} territory to settlement. In 1810 a popularly elected government was established as the territory continued to grow in population and develop <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>basic</b> road network, government, and education system. At the outbreak of Tecumseh's War, the territory was on the front line of battle and Harrison led a military force in the opening hostilities at the Battle of Tippecanoe, and then in the subsequent invasion of Canada during the War of 1812. Thomas Posey was appointed to the vacant governorship, but the opposition party, led by Congressman Jonathan Jennings, had dominance in the territorial affairs for its remaining years and began pressing for statehood. In June 1816, a constitutional convention was held and a state government was formed. The territory was dissolved on December 11, 1816, by an act of Congress granting statehood to Indiana.|$|E

25|$|Indeed it is right, that maqam Rast is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>basic</b> {{scale in}} Arabian music, {{comparable}} to C-Major in western music. For western listeners this tonality – approximately the Dorian scale with quartertone intervals – is anything else but catchy. In Shadd Araban {{it is the}} use of two 1½ intervals, that makes the scale abstractly sounding for western ears.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, {{possibly}} in a belated {{bid for the}} mass market, a stripped down basic version, the Panhard 24 BA was offered. In contrast to the 24s offered for sale thus far, this one had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>basic</b> interior. Even the lidded glove box was replaced by an open shelf. Very few 24 BAs were produced, although enthusiasts have suggested that they nevertheless compromised the upmarket image of the more expensive versions.|$|E

25|$|Ferrin are small, ratlike humanoids {{who live}} across the {{temperate}} world.

Most consider them a minor nuisance at best and vermin to be exterminated at worst. They are somewhat intelligent, though not as intelligent as humans. They have <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>basic</b> language and understand clothing and tools, including simple weapons.|$|E

25|$|There {{has also}} been a lot of {{criticism}} of the methodology used to teach Swedish and the lack of competence in many of the teachers.

Some students argue that they will never need Swedish as its utility in the Finnish job market is limited to a few fields. Moreover, the rationale of mandatory tuition in Swedish and other subjects is to give the students more of a general knowledge base, and not train them for a specific field.|$|E
