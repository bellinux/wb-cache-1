40|$|Marine Biotoxins affect farmed {{and wild}} fish and shellfish, {{as well as}} having a {{deleterious}} effect on humans. Jellett Rapid Testing has designed and developed rugged tests {{for the presence of}} Paralytic Shellfish Poison, <b>Amnesic</b> <b>Shellfish</b> <b>Poison</b> and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poison (under development {{at the time of this}} submittal). To facilitate the use of these tests in the field (for aquaculturists, campers, regulatory officials, etc.), Jellett Rapid Testing has developed a “low-tech ” rugged alternative to the standard AOAC method designed to extract the toxins in the field as well as the laboratory. The AOAC method requires the sample to be boiled in acid at low pH and the pH adjusted with strong acids. This requires a fully equipped laboratory and significant safety precautions. The JRT Rapid Extraction Method was designed for use in remote areas, with little sophisticated backup support, by average individuals with little training and education. It is faster, less labor-intensive and less expensive than the other available method. The rapid extraction method requires vinegar and rubbing alcohol to extract the toxins. A simple, rapid, safe method such as this would make rapid tests for marin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOkadaic acid (OA), a diarrhetic {{shellfish}} poison (DSP), {{domoic acid}} (DA), an <b>amnesic</b> <b>shellfish</b> <b>poison</b> (ASP) and saxitoxin (SAX), a paralytic shellfish poison (PSP), {{are three of}} the best-known marine biotoxins. The mouse bioassay is the method most widely used to detect many of these toxins in shellfish samples, but animal welfare concerns have prompted researchers to seek alternative methods of detection. In this study, three direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), each based on antibodies raised in rabbits against a conjugate of the analyte of interest, were developed for marine biotoxin detection in mussel, oyster, and scallop. One assay was for okadaic acid, one for saxitoxin, and one for domoic acid (DA) usually detected and quantified by HPLC-UV. All three compounds {{and a number of}} related toxins were extracted quickly and simply from the shellfish matrices with a 9 : 1 mixture of ethanol and water prior to analysis. The detection capabilities (CCβ values) of the developed ELISAs were 150 ug kg- 1 for okadaic acid, 50 ug kg- 1 for domoic acid, and 5 ug kg- 1 or less for saxitoxin. The assays proved satisfactory when used over a 4 -month period for the analysis of 110 real samples collected in Belgium...|$|E
40|$|Our {{coastal zones}} {{are subject to}} {{increasing}} anthropogenic pressure. Monitoring systems are required to protect them, prevent or mitigate risks and to ensure a sustainable management of their resources. PREVIMER is a partnership between Ifremer (French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea), SHOM (French Hydrographic Office) and several major French institutions (www. previmer. org). It provides coastal observations, analyses and 4 days forecasts for the French coasts of the English Channel, Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea: currents, water levels, waves, temperature, salinity, turbidity, nutrients and plankton concentrations. The service includes information based on in situ, satellite observations and numerical simulations. PREVIMER products and services are used by French marine environment monitoring and maritime safety agencies, for professionals (e. g. fish and shellfish farming industry), local authorities, consultants and scientists. Many applications are targeted: marine environment monitoring (Marine Strategy), alerts in case of eutrophication (bottom oxygen deficiency, excess of biomass) or harmful algal bloom (e. g. <b>amnesic</b> <b>shellfish</b> <b>poison</b> produced by Pseudo-Nitzschia diatoms), on-line tracking in the marine ecosystem of the nitrogen loaded by a specific river, storm surge forecast to prevent from coastal flooding risk, drift predictions and pollutant impacts, optimizing and monitoring renewable marine energy sites. PREVIMER numerical models (physics and ecosystems) resolution varies from 2. 5 km for regional models up to few hundred meters for coastal models. The regional models need boundary and initial conditions. PREVIMER is thus coupled to the Copernicus/MyOcean modelling. This allows a seamless description of the ocean from the open sea down to the coastal zone...|$|E

5000|$|Our insatiable {{appetite}} for seafood {{of all types}} has led to overfishing and has already significantly strained marine food stocks {{to the point of}} collapse in many cases. With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with global warming. As mentioned above increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed. Organisms, such as shellfish, marine crustaceans and even fish, feed on or near these infected blooms, ingest the toxins and can be consumed unknowingly by humans.

Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological problems or death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms.

40|$|Different {{clinical}} {{types of}} algae-related poisoning have attracted scientific and commercial attention: paralytic <b>shellfish</b> <b>poisoning</b> (PSP), diarrhetic <b>shellfish</b> <b>poisoning</b> (DSP), and <b>amnesic</b> <b>shellfish</b> <b>poisoning</b> (ASP). Bioassays are common methods for {{the determination of}} marine biotoxins. However, biological tests are not completely satisfactory, mainly due to the low sensitivity {{and the absence of}} specialized variations. Therefore, many efforts have been made to determine algal toxins using different chemical methods. In this context LC-MS methods replaced HPLC methods with optical detectors, allowing both effective seafood control and monitoring of phytoplankton in terms of the different groups of marine biotoxins. This chapter describes state-of-the-art LC-MS/MS methods for the detection and quantitation of different classes of phycotoxins in shellfish matrices. These classes include the highly hydrophilic paralytic <b>shellfish</b> <b>poisoning</b> (PSP) toxins., which have been traditionally separated by ion pair chromatography followed by derivatization and fluorescence detection. However, the ion pair reagents added to the mobile phases are not compatible with mass spectrometry, so a new chromatographic system had to be developed. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) {{has been shown to be}} useful in the separation of PSP toxins and is described in detail within this chapter. Another important class of phycotoxins are diarrhetic shellfish poising (DSP) toxins. This group traditionally comprises okadaic acid and dinophysistoxins (DTXs), pectenotoxins (PTXs) and yessotoxins (YTXs). The latter two groups are often associated with diarrhoea causing DTXs, but recently turned out not to have diarrhetic effects by themselves, which means in the strict sense they are no DSP toxins. For this reason the term “lipophilic” toxins rather than DSP is increasingly applied to for this group of toxins. The most recently described <b>shellfish</b> <b>poisoning</b> syndrome, azaspiracid <b>shellfish</b> poising (AZP) is caused by azaspiracids, which in turn are diarrhetic, but usually are treated separately as AZP. The last group of regulated shellfish toxins is the <b>amnesic</b> <b>shellfish</b> <b>poisoning</b> (ASP) toxin domoic acid, produced by species of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. ...|$|R

Histopathology evidence indicates that in addition to neurons, the astrocytes were also injured. Electron microscopy data reported in this study further supports the light microscopy findings.
