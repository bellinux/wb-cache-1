40|$|Abstract — Incremental-redundancy hybrid {{automatic}} repeatrequest (IR-HARQ) schemes {{are proposed}} in several wireless standards for increased throughput-efficiency and greater reliability. We investigate transmit power and modulation order adaptation {{strategies for the}} IR-HARQ schemes over correlated Rayleigh fading channels using semi-Markov decision processbased model. In order to jointly analyze physical layer and link layer, transmitter model incorporates a finite-size buffer that receives randomly varying traffic from a higher layer application. It is assumed that channel variations can be modeled with a firstorder Markov chain. We show that the optimal transmission power and rate adaptation laws under buffering delay and packet overflow constraints can be obtained using the framework of semi-Markov decision process. We discuss three different adaptation models for the IR-HARQ schemes and compare their performances with the non-adaptive scheme. It is shown that unique optimal policy exists for each case {{and it can be}} computed using linear programming approach. This optimal policy is then applied for realistic channel fading and incoming traffic samples to evaluate its performance for both hard-decision and softdecision decoding. Simulation results in general point out that substantial power savings can be achieved using adaptation and also if the transmission-delay requirements are relaxed.

In this framework, the optimal coding rate allocation policy maximizes the reward function, which is a weighted sum of throughput and buffer occupancy with appropriate sign. Since polynomial amount of space is needed to calculate the optimal policy even for a simple POMDP problem, we investigate maximum-likelihood, voting and Q-MDP policy heuristic approaches for the purpose of efficient and real-time solution. Our results show that three heuristics perform close to completely observable system state case if the fading and/or traffic state mixing rate is slow.

Two {{mobile station}} (MS) uplink communications {{to the base}} station (BS) with cooperative assistance of a relay station (RS) are considered.

The BS is assumed to have perfect channel statistical information and can feed back the appropriate superposition weighting factor to the RS regularly. The HARQ retransmissions, if needed, are then jointly performed by the RS for both MSs instead of separately for each MS. The superposition of the modulated packets is repeatedly retransmitted by the RS to the BS if needed. With the foregoing setting, we derive an information-theoretic achievable rate region and an approximation of the system outage probability. Based on the high SNR behaviors of the approximated system outage probability, we obtain the superposition weighting factor using a simple and efficient searching algorithm. We also analytically derive the HARQ system throughput as the performance metric for comparison.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at {{providing}} a unified treatment of non-orthogonal random waveform based multiuser communications, commencing from the underlying theory and providing the way to sophisticated applications. In Chapter 2, we introduce the general framework of non-orthogonal random waveform based multiuser communications, where we focus our attention on the fundamental theory behind this topic. We then {{pay particular attention to}} three general application aspects, where the principle of non-orthogonal random waveform based multiuser communications may be exploited. These are applied to cellular systems in Chapter 3, to cooperative systems in Chapter 4 and they are combined with a practical Hybrid <b>Automatic</b> <b>Repeat</b> <b>reQuest</b> (HARQ) <b>system</b> in Chapter 5. In the cellular system scenario presented in Chapter 3, we discuss three design tradeoffs ofMulti-Carrier Interleave Division Multiple Access (MC-IDMA) with the aid of EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts. Based on the analysis of IDMA, we generalise the principle of nonorthogonal random waveform based multiuser communications, leading to the so-called Interleaved Random Code Division Multiple Access (IR-CDMA) concept. We also consider an interferencelimited cooperative system in Chapter 4, where we propose a novel Interleaved Random Space Time Code (IR-STC) scheme, which is specifically designed for aMulti-Source Cooperation (MSC) scenario. Furthermore, the network coding concept is also employed, when designing a coded MSC arrangement for the sake of improving the attainable energy efficiency. More specifically, the proposed Physical-layer Algebraic Network Coding (PANC) scheme implicitly inherits the random coding principle applied in a distributed manner. In Chapter 5, we proceed by proposing a novel SuperPosition Coding (SPC) aided multiplexed HARQ scheme for substantially improving the overall end-to-end transmission efficiency. In parallel to presenting our general framework of non-orthogonal random waveform based multiuser communications, we bear inmind that employing a powerfulMulti-User Detector (MUD) for maintaining a near-single-user performance is of high importance. Hence, in Chapter 6 we propose a novel so-called Harmony Search (HS) algorithm for joint iterative channel stimation, data detection and channel decoding. The algorithm proposed can be readily employed to replace all detection algorithms used throughout Chapters 3 to 5, when a high throughput is desired.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of our research}} is to design practical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes which provide {{a wide range of}} code rates in a rate-compatible fashion. To this end, we first propose a rate-compatible puncturing algorithm for LDPC codes at short block lengths (up to several thousand symbols). The proposed algorithm is based on the claim that a punctured LDPC code with a smaller level of recoverability has better performance. The proposed algorithm is verified by comparing performance of intentionally punctured LDPC codes (using the proposed algorithm) with randomly punctured LDPC codes. The intentionally punctured LDPC codes show better bit error rate (BER) performances at practically short block lengths. Even though the proposed puncturing algorithm shows excellent performance, several problems are still remained for our research objective. First, how to design an LDPC code of which structure is well suited for the puncturing algorithm. Second, how to provide a wide range of rates since there is a puncturing limitation with the proposed puncturing algorithm. To attack these problems, we propose a new class of LDPC codes, called efficiently-encodable rate-compatible (E 2 RC) codes, in which the proposed puncturing algorithm concept is imbedded. The E 2 RC codes have several strong points. First, the codes can be efficiently encoded. We present low-complexity encoder implementation with shift-register circuits. In addition, we show that a simple erasure decoder can also be used for the linear-time encoding of these codes. Thus, we can share a message-passing decoder for both encoding and decoding in transceiver systems that require an encoder/decoder pair. Second, we show that the non-systematic parts of the parity-check matrix are cycle-free, which ensures good code characteristics. Finally, the E 2 RC codes having a systematic rate-compatible puncturing structure show better puncturing performance than any other LDPC codes in all ranges of code rates. The throughput performance of incremental redundancy (IR) hybrid <b>automatic</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>request</b> (HARQ) <b>systems</b> highly depends on the performance of high-rate codes. Since the E 2 RC codes show excellent puncturing performance in all ranges of code rates, especially at high puncturing rate, we verify that E 2 RC codes outperform in throughput than other LDPC codes in IR-HARQ systems.

30|$|Besides {{the above}} {{proposals}} for spectrum sharing with cognitive relays, the feedback mechanism of <b>automatic</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>request</b> (ARQ)-based primary <b>system</b> {{has also been}} exploited to gain secondary spectrum access [24 – 29]. In [24], the secondary user is able to eavesdrop on the handshaking signals of the ARQ-based primary system and adaptively adjust its input rate such that secondary spectrum sharing is achieved, while maintaining the target rate for the primary user. The interference that the secondary user causes to the primary user and how this interference impacts the retransmission process of the latter were studied in [25]. In [26 – 29], the authors addressed the coexistence problem {{by taking advantage of}} the opportunities that arise during ARQ retransmissions of the primary system. In [26] and [27], the structure of primary ARQ retransmissions is exploited to provide nontrivial rate for the secondary user while minimizing the impact on the primary user. In [28], the secondary user broadcasts a probing signal and listens to the corresponding ACK/NACK sent from the primary receiver and then decides whether to access the spectrum. In [29], a cooperation-and-access spectrum sharing protocol with a single secondary user is proposed where the secondary user alternates between cooperation and access modes by exploiting the ARQ ACK/NACK mechanism of the primary system. Although the basic idea of [29] is similar with our proposed spectrum sharing protocol, there are two major differences. One is that we extend the single secondary transmitter in [29] to multiple secondary transmitters. The other is that they [29] focused on different retransmission times while our work focus on one retransmission. When the multiple secondary transmitters are served as potential relays to help forward the primary packet, the spectrum sharing protocol is much different from the case in [29] with single secondary transmitter. We also derived the analytical upper bound of system throughput for primary and secondary system under cooperation and access mode with multiple secondary transmitters. Our results show that with a cluster of closely located secondary transmitter served as potential relay to help forward the primary packet, an overall higher throughput can be achieved for the secondary system. The secondary throughput gap between the scheme in [29] and our proposed scheme is given in this paper. It was noted that even though ARQ retransmissions may be relatively infrequent, it is still possible to achieve a reasonably good performance for the secondary user.|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} lattices [...] - a {{mathematical}} approach for representing infinite discrete points in Euclidean space, {{has become a}} powerful tool to analyze many point-to-point digital and wireless communication systems, particularly, communication systems that can be well-described by the linear Gaussian vector channel model. This is mainly due to the three facts about channel codes constructed using lattices: they have simple structure, their ability to achieve the fundamental limits (the capacity) of the channel, and most importantly, they can be decoded using efficient decoders called lattice decoders. Since its introduction to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems, sphere decoders has become an attractive efficient implementation of lattice decoders, especially for small signal dimensions and/or moderate to large signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In {{the first part of}} this dissertation, we consider sphere decoding algorithms that describe lattice decoding. The exact complexity analysis of the basic sphere decoder for general space-time codes applied to MIMO wireless channel is known to be difficult. Characterizing and understanding the complexity distribution is important, especially when the sphere decoder is used under practically relevant runtime constraints. In this work, we shed the light on the (average) computational complexity of sphere decoding for the quasi-static, LAttice Space-Time (LAST) coded MIMO channel. Sphere decoders are only efficient in the high SNR regime and low signal dimensions, and exhibits exponential (average) complexity for low-to-moderate SNR and large signal dimensions. On the other extreme, linear and non-linear receivers such as minimum mean-square error (MMSE), and MMSE decision-feedback equalization (DFE) are considered attractive alternatives to sphere decoders in MIMO channels. Unfortunately, the very low decoding complexity advantage that these decoders can provide comes at the expense of poor performance, especially for large signal dimensions. The problem of designing low complexity receivers for the MIMO channel that achieve near-optimal performance is considered a challenging problem and has driven much research in the past years. The problem can solved through the use of lattice sequential decoding that is capable of bridging the gap between sphere decoders and low complexity linear decoders (e. g., MMSE-DFE decoder). In the second part of this thesis, the asymptotic performance of the lattice sequential decoder for LAST coded MIMO channel is analyzed. We determine the rates achievable by lattice coding and sequential decoding applied to such a channel. The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff under such a decoder is derived as a function of its parameter [...] - the bias term. In this work, we analyze both the computational complexity distribution and the average complexity of such a decoder in the high SNR regime. We show that there exists a cut-off multiplexing gain for which the average computational complexity of the decoder remains bounded. Our analysis reveals that there exists a finite probability that the number of computations performed by the decoder may become excessive, even at high SNR, during high channel noise. This probability is usually referred to as the probability of a decoding failure. Such probability limits the performance of the lattice sequential decoder, especially for a one-way communication system. For a two-way communication system, such as in MIMO <b>Automatic</b> <b>Repeat</b> <b>reQuest</b> (ARQ) <b>system,</b> the feedback channel can be used to eliminate the decoding failure probability. In this work, we modify the lattice sequential decoder for the MIMO ARQ channel, to predict in advance the occurrence of decoding failure to avoid wasting the time trying to decode the message. This would result in a huge saving in decoding complexity. In particular, we will study the throughput-performance-complexity tradeoffs in sequential decoding algorithms and the effect of preprocessing and termination strategies. We show, analytically and via simulation, that using the lattice sequential decoder that implements a simple yet efficient time-out algorithm for joint error detection and correction, the optimal tradeoff of the MIMO ARQ channel can be achieved with significant reduction in decoding complexity...|$|R
