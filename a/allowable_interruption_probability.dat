30|$|In general, the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability</b> is not independent. Indeed, {{when the}} traffic load is high, {{whenever}} a SU is interrupted {{due to the}} arrival of a PU, it is highly probable that the next arrival of a PU also causes the interruption of another secondary session because resource occupancy conditions at the different time instants (primary arrival epochs) are not independent.

30|$|Several {{interesting}} observations can {{be extracted}} from Figs.  5, 6, and 7. For instance, from Fig.  5, {{it is observed}} that, when CDT and UST are modeled by the (unrealistic) exponential distribution and for any value of the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability,</b> the corresponding mean, CoV, and Sk of both CHTn and CHTh have the same value (this scenario {{is represented by the}} solid-red and dashed-red lines in Fig.  5). This is an expected behavior that validates our mathematical formulation and can be explained as follows. Due to the memory-less property of the exponential distribution, when CDT (UST) is exponentially distributed, the residual CDT (residual UST) is also exponentially distributed with the same parameter [12]. Thus, the random variables that represent CHTn and CHTh (whose probability distributions are given by Eqs. (12) and (35), respectively) are also exponentially distributed with the same expected value, and therefore, the CoV and Sk are, respectively, 1 and 2 for both CHTn and CHTh. Also, from Figs.  5 a, 6 a, and 7 a, it is observed that the mean value of both CHTn and CHTh is a monotonically decreasing function of the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability.</b> It is an intuitively understandable behavior {{due to the fact that}} as the <b>probability</b> of <b>interruption</b> increases, more ongoing secondary calls are prematurely terminated in detrimental of the mean value of both CHTn and CHTh.|$|R

30|$|Now let us {{study the}} impact of the {{variability}} of both UST and CDT on CHT statistics. To this end, it is important to notice that the CoV of the Erlang, exponential, and hyper-exponential/hyper-Erlang distributions are, respectively, smaller than 1, equal to 1, and larger than 1. Thus, the variability of UST increases as its probability distribution moves from the Erlang to the exponential and from the exponential to the hyper-exponential/hyper-Erlang. The same observation applies for the CDT. Considering this fact, the following observation can be extracted from Figs.  5, 6, and 7. Figures  5, 6, and 7 show that, in general terms, as the variability of the UST (CDT) increases (decreases), the mean value of the CHTn decreases {{and at the same time}} the mean value of the CHTh increases. This behavior can be explained as follows. First, note that as the CoV of UST (CDT) increases, the variability of UST (CDT) increases; that is, the values of UST (CDT) spread out over a larger range with respect to its mean value. Consequently, the service time (cell residence time) of calls that end their service in the cell where they were originated is, in general, considerable smaller (greater) than the mean UST (CDT), resulting in a diminution (increase) on the mean value of the CHTn. On the other hand, the service time (cell residence time) of calls that are handed off to another cell is, in general, considerably greater (lower) than the mean UST (CDT), resulting in an augment (diminution) on the mean value of the CHTh. The combined effects of these facts lead us to the behavior explained above and observed in Figs.  5, 6, and 7. Many others interesting observations can be extracted from Figs.  5, 6, and 7; however, the most important ones are summarized as follows. The mean values of both CHTn and CHTh are strongly sensitive to the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability.</b> For instance, when the UST is hyper-Erlang distributed and the CDT is exponential distributed (notice that this scenario corresponds to the green lines of Fig.  5 a), the mean value of CHTn (CHTh) decreases from 77.35 to 53.057  s (101 to 55.4  s) as the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability</b> goes from 0.001 to 0.1. Similar behaviors are observed when the CDT is modeled by either an Erlang or a hyper-exponential distribution. Also, from Figs.  5, 6, and 7, it is evident that the first three moments of both CHTn and CHTh are highly sensitive to the probability distribution of both CDT and UST. Thus, selecting a suitable model that effectively captures the realistic statistics of both CDT and UST is of paramount importance when analyzing the performance of mobile cognitive radio cellular networks.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, Figs.  5 a, 6 a, and 7 a show that, {{for a given}} CDT {{probability}} distribution and for a given value of the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability,</b> the quantitative difference between the mean value of the CHTn when the UST is hyper-exponentially distributed and the mean value of the CHTn when the UST is hyper-Erlang distributed is small but not negligible (differences not greater than 6.6 % are found). Referring to the CoV {skewness} of the CHTn, Figs.  5 b, c, 6 b, c, and 7 b, c show important differences between the case when the UST is hyper-exponential and the case when the UST is hyper-Erlang distributed (differences up to 12.75 and 15.20 % are observed for the CoV and Sk, respectively). Similar results are obtained when the CHTh is considered. Due {{to the fact that}} both distributions (i.e., hyper-exponential and hyper-Erlang) for modeling the UST have the same first three standardized moments, we conclude that the (not negligible) quantitative difference among the mean value, CoV, and Sk of both CHTn and CHTh when the UST is hyper-exponentially distributed compared to the case when the UST is hyper-Erlang distributed is due to moments higher than the third one. Analyzing the impact of moments of UST (and CDT) higher than the third one on channel holding time statistics represents a topic of our current research.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{teletraffic}} {{performance and}} channel holding time characterization in mobile cognitive radio cellular networks (CRCNs) under fixed-rate traffic with hard-delay constraints are investigated. To this end, {{a mathematical model}} to capture the effect of interruption of ongoing calls of secondary users (SUs) due {{to the arrival of}} primary users (PUs) is proposed. The proposed model relies on the use of an independent potential interruption time associated with the instant of possible interruption for each ongoing call in every visited cell. Then, a Poisson process is used to approximate the secondary users’ call interruption process due to the arrival of PUs. Based on this model and considering that unencumbered service time (UST) and cell dwell time (CDT) of SUs are independent generally distributed random variables, analytical formulae for both the probability distributions of channel holding times and inter-cell handoff attempts rate are derived. Also, a novel approximated closed-form mathematical expression for call forced termination probability of SUs is derived under the restriction that the UST is exponentially distributed. Additionally, by considering all the involved time variables exponentially distributed and employing fractional channel reservation to prioritize intra- and inter-cell handoff call attempts over new call requests, a queuing analysis to evaluate the call-level performance of CRCNs in terms of the maximum Erlang capacity is developed. The accuracy of our proposed mathematical models is extensively investigated under a variety of different evaluation scenarios for all the considered call-level performance metrics. Numerical results demonstrate that channel holding time statistics are highly sensitive to both <b>interruption</b> <b>probability</b> of ongoing secondary calls and type of probability distribution functions used to model CDT and UST. From the teletraffic perspective, numerical results reveal that the system Erlang capacity largely depends on the relative value of the mean secondary service time to the mean primary service time and the primary channels’ utilization factor. Also, the obtained results show that there exists a critical utilization factor of the primary resources from which it is no longer possible to guarantee the required quality of service of SUs and, therefore, services with hard-delay constraints cannot be even supported in CRCNs.|$|R

The accuracy, applicability, and robustness of our proposed mathematical models were extensively investigated under a variety of different evaluation scenarios for all the considered call-level performance metrics. Although numerical results are extracted from particular scenarios with certain set of parameter values, our contribution clearly shows that there exist relevant sensitive issues concerning interruption time (IT), cell dwell time (CDT), unencumbered service time (UST), and certain parameters of the primary network (i.e., mean service time, channels usage) that significantly influence the performance of the secondary network. Numerical results reveal that the first three standardized moments of both CHTn and CHTh are highly sensitive to both <b>interruption</b> <b>probability</b> and type of probability distribution functions used to model CDT and UST. From the teletraffic point of view, numerical results demonstrate that system Erlang capacity strongly depends on the relative value of the mean secondary service time to the mean primary service time, users’ mobility, whether or not spectrum handoff (SH) is used, and the primary channel utilization factor. Furthermore, numerical results reveal that there exists a critical utilization factor of the primary resources from which it is no longer possible to guarantee the required QoS of SUs and, therefore, delay sensitive services cannot be even supported in CRCNs. Thus, it is of paramount importance to develop mechanisms that effectively mitigate the adverse effects of service interruption of SUs in cognitive radio networks.

30|$|Besides, {{because of}} the absence of the license, the {{available}} spectrum resources for SUs are usually temporary and unstable, which results in transmission <b>interruption</b> with high <b>probability.</b> One of considerable solutions is to enable SUs to search for spectrum resources from multiple primary networks (PRNs) simultaneously. The authors of [10] considered the mobile users operating on different radio access technologies (RATs), and the single-user case is analyzed. In the multiple PRNs, however, the available spectrum resources are usually quite wide as well as discontinuous. This leads to that the cognitive radios operating on such spectrum resources are price prohibitive due to the increase of sampling rate. In addition, different PRNs restrict different power values of CRNs in one resource allocation, which greatly increases the computational complexity of ARA.|$|R
40|$|With the {{explosion}} of consumer demand, media streaming will soon be the dominant type of Internet traffic. Since such applications are intrinsically delay-sensitive, the conventional network control policies and coding algorithms may not be appropriate tools for data dissemination over networks. The major issue with design and analysis of delay-sensitive applications {{is the notion of}} delay, which significantly varies across different applications and time scales. We present a framework for studying the problem of media streaming in an unreliable environment. The focus of this work is on end-user experience for such applications. First, we take an analytical approach to study fundamental rate-delay-reliability trade-offs in the context of media streaming for a single receiver system. We consider the <b>probability</b> of <b>interruption</b> in media playback (buffer underflow) as well as the number of initially buffered packets (initial waiting time) as the Quality of user Experience (QoE) metrics. We characterize the optimal trade-off between these metrics as a function of system parameters such as the packet arrival rate and the file size, for different channel models. For a memoryless channel, we model the receiver's queue dynamics as an M/D/ 1 queue. Then, we show that for arrival rates slightly larger than the play rate, the minimum initial buffering required to achieve certain level of <b>interruption</b> <b>probability</b> remains bounded as the file size grows. For the case where the arrival rate and the play rate match, the minimum initial buffer size should scale as the square root of the file size. We also study media streaming over channels with memory, modeled using Markovian arrival processes. We characterize the optimal trade-off curves for the infinite file size case, in such Markovian environments. Second, we generalize the results to the case of multiple servers or peers streaming to a single receiver. Random linear network coding allows us to simplify the packet selection strategies and alleviate issues such as duplicate packet reception. We show that the multi-server streaming problem over a memoryless channel can be transformed into a single-server streaming problem, for which we have characterized QoE trade-offs. Third, we study the design of media streaming applications in the presence of multiple heterogeneous wireless access methods with different access costs. Our objective is to analytically characterize the trade-off between usage cost and QoE metrics. We model each access network as a server that provides packets to the user according to a Poisson process with a certain rate and cost. User must make a decision on how many packets to buffer before playback, and which networks to access during the playback. We design, analyze and compare several control policies. In particular, we show that a simple Markov policy with a threshold structure performs the best. We formulate the problem of finding the optimal control policy as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a probabilistic constraint. We present the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for this problem by expanding the state space, and exploit it as a verification method for optimality of the proposed control policy. We use the tools and techniques developed for media streaming applications in the context of power supply networks. We study the value of storage in securing reliability of a system with uncertain supply and demand, and supply friction. We assume storage, when available, can be used to compensate, fully or partially, for the surge in demand or loss of supply. We formulate the problem of optimal utilization of storage with the objective of maximizing system reliability as minimization of the expected discounted cost of blackouts over an infinite horizon. We show that when the stage cost is linear {{in the size of the}} blackout, the optimal policy is myopic in the sense that all shocks are compensated by storage up to the available level of storage. However, when the stage cost is strictly convex, it may be optimal to curtail some of the demand and allow a small current blackout in the interest of maintaining a higher level of reserve to avoid a large blackout in the future. Finally, we examine the value of storage capacity in improving system's reliability, as well as the effects of the associated optimal policies under different stage costs on the probability distribution of blackouts. by Ali ParandehGheibi.

40|$|Binary mass {{transfer}} {{is at the}} forefront {{of some of the most}} exciting puzzles of modern astrophysics, including Type Ia supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and the formation of most observed exotic stellar populations. Typically, the evolution is assumed to proceed in isolation, even in dense stellar environments such as star clusters. In this paper, we test the validity of this assumption via the analysis of a large grid of binary evolution models simulated with the SeBa code. For every binary, we calculate analytically the mean time until another single or binary star comes within the mean separation of the mass-transferring binary, and compare this time-scale to the mean time for stable {{mass transfer}} to occur. We then derive the probability for each respective binary to experience a direct dynamical <b>interruption.</b> The resulting <b>probability</b> distribution can be integrated to give an estimate for the fraction of binaries undergoing mass transfer that are expected to be disrupted as a function of the host cluster properties. We find that for lower-mass clusters (≲ 10 ^ 4 M_), on the order of a few to a few tens of percent of binaries undergoing mass-transfer are expected to be interrupted by an interloping single, or more often binary, star, over the course of the cluster lifetime, whereas in more massive globular clusters we expect ≪ 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOver {{the past}} decade, {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) {{has moved from}} the {{planning}} phase to experimental phase (e. g., Alabama Gulf Coast-Plant Barry and Illinois Basin-Decatur), but has yet to be implemented at a commercial scale from an Electric Utility Generating Unit (EGU). Barriers to commercial-scale deployment of CCS include concerns regarding potential risks and financial liability related to human health, safety, the environment, and business <b>interruption.</b> Although the <b>probability</b> of a release may be small, prudent risk management requires estimates of the funds required to remediate or compensate for harm, should a release occur. The analytic tools exist to estimate dollar values of potential risks. Such estimates are a function of location, plant design (fuel source, technology), and must be estimated on a site-specific basis. This paper applies a stochastic Monte Carlo model (“CCSvt Model”) that estimates financial consequences arising from potential human health, safety, environmental and business interruption risks (events) associated with CCS, in light of their anticipated site-specific likelihood and magnitude. The authors contend that use of the CCSvt Model, and corresponding results, foster a best practice understanding of the potential risks and financial liabilities associated with proposed CCS projects. In the authors’ view, the results of the CCSvt Model can contribute to a more productive public dialogue regarding CCS, improved siting of CCS projects, and ultimately support the commercial-scale deployment of CCS- technology. The authors conclude that the CCSvt Model is sufficiently flexible in design that it can be adapted to estimate damages distribution curves for myriad types of CCS projects, scaled for plant design and geographic location. As a proof of concept, the authors apply the CCSvt Model to the Alabama Gulf Coast-Plant Barry pilot project in Mobile, Alabama...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand on}} {{reducing}} circuit breaker failure, extending service life, increasing equipment reliability and lowering the related operating and maintenance costs are nowadays of prime {{importance for the}} electricity supply network. According to statistics, the major failure mode is originated from operating mechanism, whereas interrupter has {{the highest percentage of}} failure in high voltage component. Thus, the method to facilitate the assessment of internal mechanical conditions by using commercially available devices without opening major parts and the experimental investigation on electrical erosion inside the interrupter were performed in this work. The experimental investigation on the mechanical endurance of operating mechanism up to 6, 000 no-load switching was performed with 110 kV puffer type circuit breakers due to its requirement of large driving energy for hydraulic operating mechanism. The conventional measurement, e. g. coil current, contact timing, dynamic contact resistance and pumping motor current as well as additional vibration technique were carried out in both laboratory and field test. The investigation on electrical erosion focusing on aging of nozzle and electrode under current interruption was performed with a reduced-size SF 6 self-blast circuit breaker model and synthetic test circuit, providing the current density comparable to that in the real circuit breaker, because of the extensive use of nozzle ablation, the possibility for parameters variation and the reduction of cost and time. For mechanical investigation, the parameters were measured at the beginning as a reference and also thereafter every 500 switching under normal and variable operating conditions, e. g. variation of auxiliary supply voltage, hydraulic oil pressure and SF 6 gas pressure. The test result was verified by that from two of the same type circuit breakers and the theoretical calculation for vibration result in the frequency-domain analysis. Subsequently, the on-site measurement before and after maintenance and some simulated defects were executed. The electrical aging investigation was performed by successive tests with constant energy stresses until interrupting failure occurred. The effect of current amplitude, nozzle diameter, expansion volume, arcing time and recovery voltage on mass losses, geometry changes of nozzle and its influence on pressure build-up were investigated. The analysis of vibration signals in a combination with the other supervised parameters provides the useful information regarding the significant events occurring inside during circuit breaker operation, e. g. motion start of mechanism and within pole, contact touching and motion stop. The deviations of these measured values from the reference according to number of no-load switching operations, variable operating conditions and some incorporated defects were comprehensively determined. The relationship between the gradual changes in technical status of the supervised components and the number of no-load operations is helpful for selecting the proper maintenance method. Regarding the electrical erosion of the nozzle and the electrodes, the mass losses per switching and per energy; and the geometry change of nozzle especially between the arcing column and the expansion chamber were investigated. Moreover, volume loss and mass loss along the nozzle column; its effect on the pressure build-up reduction; and the dependences of mass losses on interrupting current amplitude, charge and generated heat have been determined. Furthermore by applying the wear equivalent law, the <b>allowable</b> number of <b>interruption</b> in function of the breaking current to rated short-circuit current ratio and the remaining lifetime can be determined. This result will be used to verify the accuracy of simulation tools in order to visualize the aging process, to evaluate the interrupter condition and to minimize the expensive experiment tests...|$|R
