"If {{there were}} no tobacco in the world, Mr. Blunt, I might feel {{disposed}} to waive the categories, and show the gentleman that courtesy," [...] returned the captain, who was preparing another cigar. [...] "But while the cruiser might not feel authorised to take an <b>absconding</b> <b>debtor</b> from this vessel, he might feel otherwise {{on the subject of}} tobacco, provided there has been an information for smuggling." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{caught the}} next express going east, and on {{reaching}} Ottawa, {{where he had}} some time to wait, half expected the man he had helped would come, or send somebody, to meet him. Although he wore the fur coat and stood in a conspicuous place, he was not accosted, and presently bought a newspaper. It threw no light upon the matter, {{and for a time}} he walked up and down, considering if he would go to the police. This was perhaps his duty, but it looked as if the owner of the coat had not been molested. After all, the fellow might be an <b>absconding</b> <b>debtor,</b> and if not it was obvious that he had some reason for keeping his secret. Foster decided to let him do so, {{and went back to the}} train.|$|E
50|$|The {{last known}} place he stayed was a Sydney hotel, Pfarhlert's, {{on the corner}} of Carrington and Margaret Streets. The hotel's proprietor, J Lichtscheindl, was {{originally}} from Wellington and proprietor of the Empire Hotel. From there Brown wrote several letters to acquaintances in Wellington stating that the reason he had left was because of debt. But early investigations into his finances revealed that he appeared to be financially sound. He was listed as an <b>absconding</b> <b>debtor</b> in Australia's 1892 New South Wales Police Gazette and the Victoria Police Gazette, but by that time he had already left Australia.|$|E

50|$|Going un-noted {{in early}} 19th-century British coastal surveys, Al Hamriyah {{struggled}} for {{independence in the}} late 19th century {{as a result of}} alleged negligence by the rulers of Sharjah, which held suzerainty over Al Hamriyah, in protecting the pearling families of the town from <b>absconding</b> <b>debtors</b> - a duty of the ruler who imposed a 'wali' over Al Hamriyah.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the start}} of the 20th century, Al Khan was {{administered}} by a tribal ruler and consisted of some 75 pearling boats and a settlement containing families of the Al Bu Mahair, Mazari and Manasir tribes. A British man-of-war was called to the area in 1917 following an argument between the ruler of Sharjah and the headman of Al Khan, Muhammad bin Ubaid bin Jarash, over <b>absconding</b> <b>debtors</b> from other pearling communities taking refuge in the township. The uneasy relations between Al Khan and Sharjah continued until after 1934, when the Ruler of Sharjah appointed his brother, Mohammad, as Wali over the township.|$|R
60|$|Polly, as {{she said}} this, looked rather faithless in her turn. Graham gave it. She <b>absconded</b> a <b>debtor,</b> darted to her father, and took refuge on his knee. Graham rose in mimic wrath and followed. She {{buried her face in}} Mr. Home's waistcoat.|$|R
50|$|Private {{investigators}} also {{engage in}} a variety of work not often associated with the industry {{in the mind of the}} public. For example, many are involved in process serving, the personal delivery of summons, subpoenas, and other legal documents to parties in a legal case. The tracing of <b>absconding</b> <b>debtors</b> can also form a large part of a PI's work load. Many agencies specialize in a particular field of expertise. For example, some PI agencies deal only in tracing. A handful of firms specialize in technical surveillance counter-measures, sometimes called electronic counter measures, which is the locating and dealing with unwanted forms of electronic surveillance (for example, a bugged boardroom for industrial espionage purposes). This niche service is typically conducted by those with backgrounds in intelligence/counterintelligence, executive protection, and a small number from law enforcement entities whose duties included the covert installation of eavesdropping devices as a tool in organized crime, terrorism and narco-trafficking investigations. Other PIs, also known as corporate investigators, specialize in corporate matters, including antifraud work, loss prevention, internal investigations of employee misconduct (such as EEO violations and sexual harassment), the protection of intellectual property and trade secrets, antipiracy, copyright infringement investigations, due diligence investigations, malware and cyber criminal activity, and computer forensics work. Some PIs act as professional witnesses where they observe situations with a view to reporting the actions or lack of them to a court or to gather evidence in antisocial behavior.|$|R
5000|$|By {{this time}} however Jack Reid had gone bankrupt. “Not {{content with the}} truly splendid profits made by the firm {{of which he was}} a partner, he had been {{engaging}} in some speculations on his own account in Canton, probably selling on extended terms to Chinese merchants goods obtained on credit from his constituents in India or lending money borrowed in India to Chinese merchants in Canton {{for the sake of the}} higher rate of interest promised by the Chinese. He overestimated the probity of his Chinese clients and when these <b>debtors</b> <b>absconded</b> he sustained such heavy losses that he had to declare himself insolvent. The Imperial Austrian Company closed its doors and John Reid left China, a victim of his own gullibility and covetousness” ...|$|R
2500|$|It {{became one}} of the twenty [...] "Legal Quays" [...] of the City of London in 1559 with state {{authorisation}} to serve as one of the official landing and loading points for traders. The wharf was listed as being [...] "for fyshe and eele shippers". During the Great Fire of London in September 1666, which started a short distance to the north in Pudding Lane, Fresh Wharf {{and all of the other}} Legal Quays were destroyed. They were quickly rebuilt and were all back in operation by the mid-1670s. Another fire on 18 April 1760 resulted in the wharf and some of the surrounding area burning down. The ownership of the wharf changed hands several times during the century, with its most notable owner being the famous actor David Garrick, who invested in a £1,500 mortgage (equivalent to £ today) on the wharf in 1776. However, the investment turned out to be a financial disaster for Garrick when the <b>debtor</b> <b>absconded</b> to the Far East.|$|R
