40|$|AbstractWe {{study and}} compare several {{mechanisms}} for defining sets of biinfinite words (ωω-languages), namely ωω-finite automata, <b>adherences</b> of regular languages and sofic systems. We {{show that a}} sofic system is a topologically closed ωω-regular set. We also {{show that there is}} a one-to-one correspondence between sofic systems and the <b>adherences</b> of regular languages. We give a complete proof of the closure of the ωω-regular sets under ωω-rational relations and under Boolean operations. Finally, we disprove Hurd's conjecture [15] on bi-extensible subsets of languages, and show that the conjecture would hold if a different definition were used...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of extending treatment duration as response guided therapy was previously reported for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1, {{but is still}} controversial for genotype 2. The present study is a retrospective cohort study to investigate the {{effectiveness of}} extending treatment duration in therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for patients with CHC genotype 2 {{by focusing on the}} timing at which patients obtained undetectable HCV RNA. A total of 306 patients who obtained undetectable HCV RNA by week 24 of treatment and completed 24 weeks of treatment were enrolled. Rapid virological response (RVR) to standard therapy was achieved by 122 patients (51 ｵ), and 89 ｵ of them obtained sustained virological response (SVR), while 69 ｵ of non-RVR patients achieved SVR. Non-RVR patients with undetectable HCV RNA at week 8, and insufficient adherence＜ 80 ｵ pegylated interferon and ribavirin during the first 24 weeks, significantly improved their SVR rate by extended therapy. Among patients receiving extended therapy, drug <b>adherences</b> did not differ between SVR and non-SVR patients, indicating that extending treatment duration might compensate for insufficient antiviral effects due to insufficient drug <b>adherences.</b> This finding might be useful in creating a guideline for extending treatment duration for patients with CHC genotype 2...|$|R
