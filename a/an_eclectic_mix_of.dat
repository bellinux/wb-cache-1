5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century the {{writings}} of Humphrey Repton (1752–1818) were highly influential in {{the return of the}} formal garden near to the house. His sons were directly involved in the restructuring of the landscape at Valleyfield, Fife. Walter Scott's dislike of the sweeping away of the old formal gardens was also influential in creating an emphasis on preservation and restoration. His ideas were taken up by John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843), the most prolific gardening author of the century in Britain, and were highly influential throughout the world. By 1850 ambitious formal gardens had been recreated at Drummond Castle, Dunrobin and Drumlandrig. New plants from around the world, often discovered and sampled by Scots, such as the rhododendron and monkey puzzle tree, meant that Victorian and Edwardian gardens were characterised by <b>an</b> <b>eclectic</b> <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> the formal, picturesque and gardenesque. By {{the end of the century}} the ideas of William Robinson (1838–1935), Gertrude Jekyll (1843–1932) and the Edinburgh-based Frances Hope (d. 1880), arguing for informal flower-based gardens, had begun to dominate. They resulted in a revival of the seventeenth-century mixed flower and kitchen garden, as carried out at Kellie Castle, and Earlshall, Fife by Robert Lorimer.|$|E

5|$|Novelist {{and social}} {{commentator}} Walter Besant proposed a 'Palace of Delight' with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, an art school and various classes, social rooms and frequent fêtes and dances.

Five acres of land were secured on the Mile End Road, and the Queen's Hall was opened by Queen Victoria on 14 May 1887. The complex was completed with a library, swimming pool, gymnasium and winter garden, by 1892, providing <b>an</b> <b>eclectic</b> <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> populist entertainment and education.
