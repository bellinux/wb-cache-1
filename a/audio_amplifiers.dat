25|$|The {{requirements}} for heat removal can significantly change {{the appearance of}} high-power vacuum tubes. High power <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and rectifiers required larger envelopes to dissipate heat. Transmitting tubes could be much larger still.|$|E
25|$|Applications are numerous, {{some common}} {{examples}} are <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{in a home}} stereo or public address system, RF high power generation for semiconductor equipment, to RF and microwave applications such as radio transmitters.|$|E

As this <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{is going to}} be a laboratory module, it is necessary to divide design into designs of individual functional blocks.

Measurement results are shown in standard protocol...|$|R
25|$|Power MOSFETs with lateral {{structure}} {{are mainly}} used in high-end <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and high-power PA systems. Their advantage {{is a better}} behaviour in the saturated region (corresponding to the linear region of a bipolar transistor) than the vertical MOSFETs. Vertical MOSFETs are designed for switching applications.|$|E
25|$|BJTs are {{manufactured}} in two types, NPN and PNP, {{and are available}} as individual components, or fabricated in integrated circuits, often in large numbers. The basic function of a BJT is to amplify current. This allows BJTs {{to be used as}} amplifiers or switches, giving them wide applicability in electronic equipment, including computers, televisions, mobile phones, <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> industrial control, and radio transmitters.|$|E
25|$|Historically, many {{headphones}} had {{relatively high}} impedance, often over 500ohms {{in order to}} operate well with high-impedance tube amplifiers. In contrast, modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance, enabling lower-impedance headphones. Unfortunately, this means that older <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern, low-impedance headphones. In this case, an external headphone amplifier may be beneficial.|$|E

25|$|Once the faulty {{stage is}} found, further probing can usually tell a skilled {{technician}} exactly which component has failed. Once the component is replaced, the unit can {{be restored to}} service, {{or at least the}} next fault can be isolated. This sort of troubleshooting is typical of radio and TVreceivers, as well as <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> but can apply to quite-different devices such as electronic motor drives.|$|E
25|$|The large {{capacitance}} {{per unit}} volume of electrolytic capacitors make them valuable in relatively high-current and low-frequency electrical circuits, e.g. in power supply filters for decoupling unwanted AC components from DC power connections or as coupling capacitors in <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> for passing or bypassing low-frequency signals and storing {{large amounts of}} energy. The relatively high capacitance value of an electrolytic capacitor combined with the very low ESR of the polymer electrolyte of polymer capacitors, especially in SMD styles, makes them a competitor to MLC chip capacitors in personal computer power supplies.|$|E
25|$|The gain of an {{amplifier}} is {{the ratio}} of output to input power or amplitude, and is usually measured in decibels. (When measured in decibels it is logarithmically related to the power ratio: G(dB)=10 log(Pout /(Pin)). RF amplifiers are often specified {{in terms of the}} maximum power gain obtainable, while the voltage gain of <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and instrumentation amplifiers will be more often specified (since the amplifier's input impedance will often be much higher than the source impedance, and the load impedance higher than the amplifier's output impedance). For example, an audio amplifier with a gain given as 20dB will have a voltage gain of ten (but a power gain of 100 would only occur in the event the input and output impedances were identical).|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} method for transmitting audio signals via {{the use of}} laser technology was presented here. The primary focus of this document is on the <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> subsystem including the design, simulation, and performance results. Simulations using the PSPICE computer simulation software were utilized to investigate the theoretical designs of the <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> subsystem. The <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> was examined in three junctures including the noise-canceling input stage, the high voltage gain cell, and the low impedance driver. Through the design procedure using theoretical calculations, simulations using PSPICE computer software, and examination of the finished product with an oscilloscope, the <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> was greatly investigated and verified for desired functionality. In addition, the pulse-width modulation technique was examined and implemented with precision 555 timers in order to transmit audio signals via laser...|$|R

25|$|With {{advances}} in power semiconductors, it became possible to output high voltage {{directly from the}} output stage of the amplifier. For example, in 1967, Crown International introduced the DC300 amplifier, which is capable of directly driving 70-volt lines, as well as traditional speaker loads, thanks to its overall power of 500W. In 1987, Crown introduced the Macrotech 2400, capable of driving 100-volt lines directly. Since that time, further developments in high-power amplifier technology have widened the choices; many manufacturers make amplifiers capable of direct connection to a high-impedance constant-voltage speaker line. High-voltage <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> have almost become a one chip solution. For example, National Semiconductor's LME49810 (and similar products LME49811 and LME49830) can output 100 V peak to peak signals, but have relatively low current output, so a standard circuit includes a Darlington or FET discrete output stage.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{located at}} 79 Washington Street in Brooklyn, New York, Amperex was a {{long-established}} manufacturer of transmitting tubes {{when they were}} acquired by the Dutch firm, Philips, (known more widely as Norelco in the US), around 1955. Philips continued to improve and enlarge the [...] tube plant in New York, but also used the Amperex name to distribute their new line of Dutch-made miniature tubes, (12AX7, 12AU7, 12AT7) to feed the booming U.S. hi-fi market. Classic hi-fi brands such as Marantz, Fisher, and H. H. Scott, Inc., used these tubes. Amperex also produced the 6DJ8, 6922 and 7308 frame grid tubes. Developed by Amperex in 1958 when transistors were beginning to supplant tubes and originally developed for video and radar use, the 6DJ8 also excelled in <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> needing its high transconductance, and it still has a niche market among audiophiles.|$|E

2500|$|Amplifiers can be {{categorized}} in different ways. One is by {{the frequency of the}} electronic signal being amplified. For example, <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> amplify signals in the audio (sound) range of less than 20kHz, RF amplifiers amplify frequencies in the radio frequency range between 20kHz and 300GHz, and servo amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers may work with very low frequencies down to direct current.|$|E
2500|$|Frequency ranges down to DC {{are only}} used when this {{property}} is needed. Amplifiers for direct current signals {{are vulnerable to}} minor variations in the properties of components with time. [...] Special methods, such as chopper stabilized amplifiers are used to prevent objectionable drift in the amplifier's properties for DC. [...] "DC-blocking" [...] capacitors {{can be added to}} remove DC and sub-sonic frequencies from <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After {{applying}} moderate {{amounts of}} negative feedback (10–15dB), the low-order harmonics are reduced, but higher-order harmonics are introduced. [...] Since {{these are not}} masked as well, the distortion becomes audibly worse even though the overall THD may go down. [...] This {{has led to a}} view that negative feedback is detrimental in <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> leading audiophile manufacturers to market their amplifiers as [...] "zero feedback" [...] (even if they use local feedback to linearize each stage).|$|E
