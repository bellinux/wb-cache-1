30|$|When a rock is {{subjected}} to increasing stress, it passes through three successive stages of deformation: elastic, ductile and brittle. Based on these behaviors, {{it is possible to}} classify the rocks into two classes: ductile and brittle. If the rock has <b>a</b> smaller <b>region</b> <b>of</b> elastic behavior and <b>a</b> larger <b>region</b> <b>of</b> ductile behavior, absorbing much energy before failure, it is considered ductile. In contrast, if the material under stress has <b>a</b> larger <b>region</b> <b>of</b> elastic behavior but only <b>a</b> smaller <b>region</b> <b>of</b> ductile behavior, the rock is considered brittle.|$|R

It forms a cavity in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the constellations of Ophiuchus and Taurus. (The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250pc or more.) This volume contains about 104–105 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars, with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the {{interstellar medium}}. The Local Bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000K and radii of 0.5–5pc.|$|E

5|$|A {{black hole}} is <b>a</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory {{of general relativity}} predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} from East Lenox, PA106 continues southeastward through {{fields and}} soon into <b>a</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> residences. The southeastern stretch continues for several {{miles into the}} community of West Clifford. There, PA106 passes some homes and intersects with PA374. The two designations become concurrent, paralleling the alignment of the Milford and Owego Turnpike Road through West Clifford. PA106 and PA374 head southward and soon turn southwestward through forestry, until clearing into the community of Royal. In the small community, PA106 and PA374 fork, with PA374 heading southwestward to Glenwood and PA106 heading southeastward through Royal. PA106 continues further, entering deep woods once again after leaving Royal. At the intersection with Cemetery Road, the highway enters a large cemetery and into Clifford. There, the route crosses through a large residential and commercial community, intersecting with State Route2008 (SR2008). The route continues southeastward through the residential area before crossing the county line into Lackawanna County.|$|E
5|$|After peaking, Isidore entered <b>a</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> {{stronger}} upper-level {{winds and}} quickly weakened. By September8 it had deteriorated into a tropical storm, although re-intensification occurred after the shear decreased. An eye feature redeveloped {{in the center}} of the convection, and Isidore re-intensified into a hurricane on September 9. It ultimately reached a secondary peak intensity of 90mph (150km/h). Isidore's motion slowed, briefly becoming stationary, although it remained a hurricane for several days. Cooler waters imparted weakening to a tropical storm on September16, and the next day it became extratropical to the east of Newfoundland. There were a few ships that came in contact with Hurricane Isidore, one of which reported hurricane-force wind gusts. The storm never approached land during its duration, and no damage or casualties were reported.|$|E
