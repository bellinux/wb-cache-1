5|$|Bulgaria's {{strategic}} {{geographic location}} and well-developed energy sector {{make it a}} key European energy centre despite its lack of significant fossil fuel deposits. Nearly 34 percent of its electricity is produced by the nuclear power station at Kozloduy and public opinion strongly supports nuclear energy development. The rapid expansion of alternative energy sources such <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> and solar power stations make Bulgaria {{one of the fastest-growing}} wind energy producers in the world. The country aims to produce 16 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020.|$|E
5|$|The towers were {{designed}} as framed tube structures, giving tenants open floor plans, unobstructed by columns or walls. This design {{was accomplished by}} using many closely spaced perimeter columns, providing much of the structure's strength, with the gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space {{to be used for}} office purposes by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques, such <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation.|$|E

5|$|AT Park is {{distinguished}} {{by having the}} San Francisco Bay beyond its right field bleachers. The body of water located adjacent to the ballpark is known as McCovey Cove, named for legendary Giants slugger Willie McCovey. McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in kayaks and boats hoping to retrieve a long home run ball hit there. Though dozens of fans waited in the cove during the Derby, no home runs were actually hit into the water, either on the fly or off the promenade next to the right field seats, though, one foul ball hit by Prince Fielder did reach the water. This was {{largely due to the}} three left-handed competitors all exiting in the first round, as well <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> currents blowing toward left field. Prior to the All-Star break, a total of 58 home runs were hit into the cove on the fly during the park's history.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} on August30, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward. By the early on August31, the storm featured well-define outflow in all directions {{and the center of}} circulation was close to the main area of convection. Intensity estimates around that time indicated sustained wind speeds of 70mph (110km/h). However, intensification halted later on August31 <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> shear increased over the storm, causing convection to become displaced from the center. Early on September1, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} the feature was displaced from the low-level center. The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation displaced from the main convective area several hours later.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} autumn 2007, long-rage {{forecast}} models {{indicated that a}} La Niña would develop by December of that year. In general, this event results in increased sea surface temperatures near Australia. Following this, a strong Madden–Julian oscillation phase took shape, leading {{to the development of}} Tropical Cyclone Melanie off the coast of Western Australia and an area of low pressure over the Top End by 28December. Situated over land, the system initially embedded within a disorganised trough and to intensify as it slowly tracked eastward. By 30December, it separated itself from the trough and travelled towards the west. The following day, the interaction between the two systems allowed the low to significantly deepen, attaining a barometric pressure of 993mbar (hPa; 29.32inHg). This strengthening was short-lived <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> shear over the low increased, displacing convection from its centre.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} week of May, low {{pressures}} persisted across the Bay of Bengal. An area of convection developed on May 11, and the next day the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified it as a depression. The system drifted northward, and initially moderate wind shear kept the deep convection {{on the periphery of the}} consolidating low-level circulation center. Gradually, banding features developed along the eastern semicircle, and with decreasing amounts of wind shear the system organized further. By May 13, the pressure had dropped to 1000mbar <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> shear levels dropped significantly. An anticyclone developed over the system, while a mid-latitude trough over northeastern India provided favorable outflow. Convection continued to consolidate around the low-level circulation, and with well-defined banding features and a central dense overcast over the center of circulation, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded it to Tropical Cyclone 01B at 1121UTC on May 13 while located about 545km (340mi) west-northwest of Yangon, Burma.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Danny in August2015 was {{the first}} major {{hurricane}} to develop between the Lesser Antilles and Western Africa since Hurricane Julia in 2010. The hurricane originated from a well-defined tropical wave that emerged over the Atlantic Ocean on August14. Traveling west, the system gradually coalesced into a tropical depression by August18. After becoming a tropical storm later that day, dry air slowed further development. On August20–21, dry air became removed from the system, and Danny rapidly intensified into a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Its peak was short-lived <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> shear soon increased and prompted significant weakening. Degrading to a tropical storm by August23, Danny approached the Lesser Antilles. It degenerated into a tropical wave as it traversed the archipelago on August24 and was last noted over Hispaniola the following day.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Fred {{was one of}} the easternmost forming major hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin since {{satellite}} observations became available. Forming out of a strong tropical wave on September7, 2009 near the Cape Verde Islands, Fred gradually organized within an area of moderate wind shear. The following day, decreasing shear allowed the storm to intensify and develop well-organized convective banding features. Later on September8, Fred attained hurricane intensity and underwent rapid intensification overnight, attaining its peak intensity as a strong Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120mph (195km/h) and a barometric pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). Shortly after reaching this intensity, the hurricane began to weaken <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> shear increased and dry air hampered convective development.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, Jimena {{encountered}} strong southerly wind shear, {{causing it}} to quickly weaken back to a tropical storm by September 1. Jimena then turned west-southwest where {{the center of the}} storm passed 105miles (165km) south of Hawaii at 1500 UTC. Jimena continued to weaken <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> shear increased and the storm weakened to a tropical depression on September 3. After weakening back to a depression, Jimena crossed the International Date Line on September 5 at 0600 UTC, where it became the first storm to exist in all three Pacific basins since 1999's Hurricane Dora. However, Jimena was only tracked briefly by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, since strong wind shear resulted in the low level circulation to be exposed from the center and at 1727 UTC, the low level had nearly dissipated. At 1800 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued their final advisory on Jimena as the storm dissipated 715miles (1151km) southeast of Wake Island.|$|E
5|$|On December25, a {{cold front}} dragged over the central Mozambique Channel. A weak {{circulation}} {{formed in the}} Channel and moderate convection appeared on December27. Then on December30, RSMC La Reunion designated this low pressure as a zone of disturbed weather and was classified as a tropical depression on January1, 2002. The JTWC also issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) early on December31 and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 08S the next day. As it moved further eastwards it strengthened quickly from a tropical depression into a severe tropical storm, with the Meteorological Services of Madagascar giving it the name Cyprien on January1. Cyprien soon became {{a serious threat to}} western Madagascar. Convection began to dissipate <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> shear increased and that resulted in quick weakening to a tropical depression. As it made landfall on western Madagascar, it dropped heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such <b>as</b> <b>wind,</b> cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E
5|$|The 1961 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured {{the highest number}} of major hurricanes – Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale – until being tied by 2005. The season officially began on June15, and lasted until November15. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. It was an above average season in terms of tropical storms, with a total of 11named storms. The first system, Hurricane Anna, developed in the eastern Caribbean Sea near the Windward Islands on July20. It brought minor damage to the islands, as well <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> and flood impacts to Central America after striking Belize as a hurricane. Anna caused one death and about $300,000 (1961USD) in damage. Activity went dormant for nearly a month and a half, until Hurricane Betsy developed on September2. Betsy peaked as a Category4 hurricane, but remained at sea and caused no impact.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Ireland {{has shown}} a strong {{commitment}} to renewable energy, ranking {{as one of the top}} 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index. Research and development in Ireland in renewable energy such <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> power has increased since 2004. Large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly. The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.|$|E

5|$|The cost {{has reduced}} <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> turbine {{technology}} has improved. There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades, improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital and maintenance costs {{have continued to}} decline. For example, the wind industry in the USA in early 2014 were able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300feet to 400feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been {{increasing the amount of}} wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone {{weakened}} {{while remaining}} nearly stationary, losing {{most of its}} deep convection due to upwelling; this is the process in which a stationary storm causes the water temperatures to decrease by bringing the cooler, deeper waters to the surface. It remained nearly stationary until beginning a steady south-southwestward motion late on February 26, a change due to an approaching mid-level trough to its south. On February 28, convection increased around a rebuilding eyewall as it accelerated southward, though on March 1 the cyclone again weakened <b>as</b> <b>wind</b> shear increased and as water temperatures gradually decreased. Gamede weakened to tropical storm status as its center became exposed from the deep convection, and late on March 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. After completing the transition, the storm became nearly stationary for about two days, during which its winds decreased to below gale force. The remnants of Gamede turned westward and persisted until dissipating on March 6.|$|E
