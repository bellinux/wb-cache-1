5|$|Alexander {{was also}} noted for his {{nepotism}} that was partially {{due to his}} advanced age and belief that his family would have little time to profit from his reign. This was in contrast to his predecessor Innocent XI, who was known for being <b>austere</b> and had not caused any scandals through nepotism.|$|E
50|$|Hedwig <b>Austerer</b> {{bought the}} Pension in 1967 and {{extended}} the 28 rooms {{at that time}} to a total of 53. Manfred <b>Austerer</b> took over his parents’ business in 1972. Manfred and his wife Elisabeth <b>Austerer</b> made several renovations and alterations to the building over the years. Their younger son Bernhard <b>Austerer</b> joined the family business in 1999. Ongoing extensions and modernisation finally transformed the Pension Zipser into today's Hotel Zipser.|$|R

5|$|Catholic worship was {{deliberately}} low key, {{usually in the}} private houses of recusant landholders or in domestic buildings adapted for services. Surviving chapels from this period are generally <b>austere</b> and simply furnished. Typical worship consisted of a sermon, long vernacular prayers and an unsung Low Mass in Latin. Musical accompaniment was prohibited until the nineteenth century, when organs began to be introduced into chapels.|$|E

5|$|Kiarostami's complex sound-images and {{philosophical}} approach have caused frequent comparisons with mystical filmmakers such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Robert Bresson. Irrespective of substantial cultural differences, much of western writing about Kiarostami positions {{him as the}} Iranian equivalent of such directors, by virtue of universal <b>austere,</b> spiritual poetics and moral commitment. Some draw parallels between certain imagery in Kiarostami's films with that of Sufi concepts.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque art was {{developing}} {{to a great}} extent under the patronage of the Catholic Church, which utilized the art to facilitate religious influence, allocating for this purpose the very substantial financial resources at its disposal. The most important in this context art form was architecture, with features rather <b>austere</b> at first, accompanied in due time by progressively more elaborate and lavish facade and interior design concepts.|$|E

60|$|For {{the health}} of the moral life, for ennobling the tone of an age or a nation, the <b>austerer</b> virtues have a strange power, {{exceeding}} the power of those not informed and purified by thought. Of these <b>austerer</b> virtues the love of truth is the chief, and in mathematics, more than elsewhere, the love of truth may find encouragement for waning faith. Every great study is not only an end in itself, but also a means of creating and sustaining a lofty habit of mind; and this purpose should be kept always in view throughout the teaching and learning of mathematics.|$|R

Adam taught me this, for though Geoffrey took you from him, he still held fast his friend, letting no disappointment sour, no envy alienate, no resentment destroy the perfect friendship years of mutual fidelity have built up between them." ...|$|R
5|$|While in Ferrara, Josquin wrote some of {{his most}} famous compositions, {{including}} the <b>austere,</b> Savonarola-influenced Miserere, which {{became one of the most}} widely distributed motets of the 16th century; the utterly contrasting, virtuoso motet Virgo salutiferi; and possibly the Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae, which is written on a cantus firmus derived from the musical letters in the Duke's name, a technique known as soggetto cavato.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early <b>austere</b> {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E

Exhibiting her paintings alongside those by Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, and Kees van Dongen, increased recognition led to her participation in Feminissima at Galerie Artcurial (Paris) as the sole Canadian among artists from 35 countries, and at the Palais des Expositions (Nice). The following year she exhibited at Donna Heuhhoff Gallery (Dallas), at Sandra Werther Fine Art (New York) in 1989, and held a solo show at Eleonore <b>Austerer</b> Gallery, San Francisco in 1991. Throughout this period, she honed her technique at the Vermont Studio Colony with Stanley Boxer, George McLean and Elmer Bischoff and with Elizabeth Lyons in Tuscany, Italy.|$|R

When you call over the scenes that have passed between us, you will survey the conduct of an honest man struggling successfully with temptations the most powerful that ever beset humanity, and preserving untainted honour in situations where the <b>austerest</b> virtue would have forgiven a fall; situations that, I will dare to say not a single individual of all his kind, even with half his sensibility and passion, could have encountered without ruin; and I leave you, Madam, to guess how such a man is likely to digest an accusation of [...] "perfidious treachery." ...|$|R
5|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation {{that created a}} predominantly Calvinist national Church of Scotland (kirk), which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll {{as a result of}} Protestant iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings. The nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more <b>austere</b> forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.|$|E
5|$|From the exterior, the {{building}} appears <b>austere,</b> as was much of Mountfort's early work: a central tower dominates two flanking gabled wings in the Gothic revival style. However {{the interior was}} a riot of colour and medievalism as perceived through Victorian eyes; it included stained glass windows, and a large double-faced clock, thought {{to be one of}} only five around the globe. The chamber is decorated in a rich, almost Ruskinesque style, with carvings by a local sculptor William Brassington. Included in the carvings are representations of indigenous New Zealand species.|$|E
5|$|Helped by a {{scholarship}} from {{the bishop of}} his home diocese, Fauré boarded at the school for 11 years. The régime was <b>austere,</b> the rooms gloomy, the food mediocre, and the required uniform elaborate. The musical tuition, however, was excellent. Niedermeyer, whose goal was to produce qualified organists and choirmasters, focused on church music. Fauré's tutors were Clément Loret for organ, Louis Dietsch for harmony, Xavier Wackenthaler for counterpoint and fugue, and Niedermeyer for piano, plainsong and composition.|$|E

6000|$|Merely {{insert the}} words [...] "sincere repentance and {{amendment}} {{of heart and}} life, and therefore for" [...] salvation,--and is not this truth, and Gospel truth?

This Barrister for ever forgets that the whole point in dispute is not concerning the possibility of an immoral Christian being saved, which the Methodist would deny as strenuously as himself, and perhaps give an <b>austerer</b> sense to the word immoral; but whether morality, or as the Methodists would call it, sanctification, be the price which we pay for the purchase of our salvation with our own money, or a part of the same free gift.
