5|$|In the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, {{financial}} decision-makers {{were able}} to benefit somewhat from the lessons and experiences of the previous cycle. Developing economies generally stayed better balanced {{than they did in}} the 1970s; the world economy was less oil-intensive; and global inflation <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> were much better contained. Oil exporters opted to make most of their investments directly into a diverse array of global markets, and the recycling process was less dependent on intermediary channels such as international banks and the IMF.|$|E
5|$|Other economists {{focused more}} on theory in their {{business}} cycle analysis. Most business cycle theories focused on a single factor, such as monetary policy or the impact of weather on the largely agricultural economies of the time. Although business cycle theory was well established by the 1920s, work by theorists such as Dennis Robertson and Ralph Hawtrey had little impact on public policy. Their partial equilibrium theories could not capture general equilibrium, where markets interact with each other; in particular, early business cycle theories treated goods markets and financial markets separately. Research in these areas used microeconomic methods to explain employment, price level, <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{estimate}} the impact of electricity crisis <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on the production of Pakistan textile industry. The Pakistan textile industry contributes more than 60 percent of total export and largest manufacturing sector of Pakistan’s industry. This sector faces crises of electricity <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> due to which its growth decreases. This study estimates the relationship between the production of textile, electricity crises <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> In order to check the impact of electricity crises <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on the production of textile industry, multiple regression analysis is used upon the 11 years data of electricity, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> textile industry. After investigation it was found that the Pakistan’s textile industry negatively affected by electricity crisis <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> The textile industry can once again be brought back on attractive track if government takes serious measures in removing the electricity crisis and normalizing the supply of electricity to the textile industry for increasing the textile growth of the country...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{takeover}} of Liverpool F.C. on 6 February 2007 by George Gillett and Tom Hicks, the proposed stadium was redesigned. In November 2007 the redesigned layout {{was approved by the}} council, and construction was due to start in early 2008. The new stadium, provisionally called Stanley Park Stadium, was to be built by HKS, Inc.. It was scheduled to open in August 2011 with a capacity of 60,000. If the new stadium is built, Anfield would be demolished. The land would become home to the centrepiece for the Anfield Plaza development, which would include a hotel, restaurants, and offices. However, the construction of Stanley Park was delayed following the economic crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession, which directly affected the then American owners. The situation was worsened because the club was bought with borrowed money, not the owners' capital, <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> were higher than expected. Hicks and Gillett promised to begin work on the stadium within 60days of acquisition of the club, but had trouble financing the estimated £500million needed for the Stanley Park development. The deadline passed and the plan was eventually cancelled by the Fenway Sports Group, as their preference was to re-develop Anfield.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009 the Chancellor {{announced}} an Asset Purchase Facility (APF), {{to be administered}} by the MPC, aimed at ensuring greater liquidity in financial markets. The committee had already started to cut rates the previous autumn, but the effect of such changes {{can take up to}} two years and rates cannot go below zero. By March 2009, faced with very low levels on inflation <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> already at 0.5%, the MPC voted to start the process of quantitative easing (QE) – the injection of money directly into the economy – via the APF. It had the Bank buy government bonds (gilts), along with a smaller amount of high-quality debt issued by private companies. Although non-gilts initially made up a non-negligible part of the APF portfolio, as of May 2015 the entirety of the APF was held as gilts. On 7 August 2013, Governor Mark Carney issued the committee's first forward guidance as a third tool for controlling future inflation.|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} fiscal {{accounts for}} the previous full calendar year are released each year in April (next time 23 April 2015).

Any EU member state may also ask the European Commission to conduct a compliance check, at any point of time during the remainder of the year, with HICP <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> always checked for the past 12 months – while debt and deficit compliance always will be checked for the three-year period encompassing the last completed full calendar year and the two subsequent forecast years. As of 10 August 2015, none of the remaining euro derogation states without an opt-out had entered ERM-II, which makes it highly unlikely that any of them will request that the European Commission conduct an extraordinary compliance check ahead of the publication of the next regular convergence report scheduled June 2016.|$|E
