500|$|Additionally, Paul Bettany was {{the first}} actor to portray two main {{characters}} within the universe, voicing Tony Stark's artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. in the Iron Man and Avengers films, and portraying Vision in Avengers films and Captain America: Civil War. Stan Lee, creator or co-creator {{of many of the}} characters seen in the MCU, has cameo appearances in all of the feature films and television series. In Iron Fist, it is revealed his on-set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as NYPD Captain Irving Forbush. His cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees Lee appearing as an informant to the Watchers, discussing previous adventures that include Lee's cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in Captain America: Civil War. This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos, with writer and director James Gunn noting that [...] "people thought Stan Lee is [...] and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU."
