5|$|Argentina {{was highly}} {{alarmed by the}} Brazilian move, and they quickly moved to nullify the {{remaining}} months of the naval-limiting restrictions in the 1902 pact with Chile. In November 1906, Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, , remarked that {{any one of the}} new Brazilian vessels could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets. Despite the seeming hyperbole, his statement—made before the Brazilian government reordered the ships as dreadnoughts—ended up being close to the truth: in 1910, at least, the new Brazilian warships were seemingly stronger than any other vessel in the world, let alone any one ship in the Argentine or Chilean fleets. With this in mind, the Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers opined that maintaining the older Libertad class or Capitán Prat (respectively) was now <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
5|$|Curing {{the leaks}} and {{cleaning}} up the contamination delayed the tunnel's completion by a year, and it was finally opened on 22 August 1999. The entire process was further complicated by conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the Scandinavian Rock Group. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during the incidents, which should have been addressed in 1995, but were never taken seriously. Compensation was paid for approximately 60 houses which were damaged {{as a result of}} tunnel construction. An evaluation by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was spent fixing the leaks, but the report claimed that this was to a large extent <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> resulting from inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the construction of the entire railway. In total the extraordinary additional costs for the tunnel totaled NOK1.3 billion.|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. Not only did it fail to polymerize and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> due to inefficient engineering procedures.

25|$|In Germany, anti-smoking groups, often {{associated}} with anti-liquor groups, first published advocacy against the consumption of tobacco in the journal Der Tabakgegner (The Tobacco Opponent) in 1912 and 1932. In 1929, Fritz Lickint of Dresden, Germany, published a paper containing formal statistical evidence of a lung cancer–tobacco link. During the Great Depression Adolf Hitler condemned his earlier smoking habit as <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> and later with stronger assertions. This movement was further strengthened with Nazi reproductive policy as women who smoked were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family.|$|E
25|$|In the North of England particularly, {{there was}} fierce resistance; {{the local people}} {{considered}} that the existing system there was running smoothly. They argued {{that the nature of}} cyclical unemployment meant that any new workhouse built would be empty for most of the year and thus <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> However, the unlikely union between property owners and paupers did not last, and opposition, though fierce, eventually petered out. In some cases, this was further accelerated as the protests very successfully undermined parts of the Amendment Act and became obsolete.|$|E

25|$|With the {{modernization}} of cigarette production compounded with the increased life expectancies during the 1920s, adverse health effects began to become more prevalent.

25|$|Light rail in the Salt Lake Valley {{was first}} seriously {{discussed}} in the late 1980s to provide an alternative to traffic congestion on I-15, but the idea was met with criticism. On October 10, 1988, Congress approved $5 million in funds to preserve land along the proposed light rail corridor. Funding for the light rail line, however, remained uncertain. After Salt Lake City won the bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics in 1995, UTA used the city's host status to accelerate obtaining funding through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Construction began in 1997. Protesters at the groundbreaking insisted light rail would be dangerous and <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Public opinion remained divided and businesses on Main Street in downtown Salt Lake City suffered during the construction period.|$|E
25|$|The Parachute Regiment {{had their}} own {{distinctive}} uniform: the maroon beret at first with the Army Air Corps cap badge and from May 1943 the Parachute Regiment cap badge which is still in use today. Parachute wings were worn on the right shoulder above the airborne forces patch of Bellerophon riding the flying horse Pegasus. On operations, Paras wore the airborne forces pattern steel helmet instead of the normal Brodie helmet. Initially they wore a 'jump jacket' modelled on the German Fallschirmjäger jacket. After 1942, the Denison smock was issued as the first camouflaged uniform for the British Army. In 1943, a green sleeveless jacket was designed to wear over the Denison smock when parachuting. British Paras did not use a reserve parachute, as the War Office considered the £60 cost <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E

500|$|After {{the lengthy}} {{political}} wrangling over the design had passed, {{the criticism of}} the scheme died down. Menzies strongly denounced the [...] "moaning" [...] by opponents of the lake. Most critics decried the project as <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> {{that should have been}} spent on essential services across Australia. Less strident concerns centred on the potentially negative effects of the lake, such as mosquitoes, ecological degeneration, siltation and the possibility that the lake would create fog. The latter of these concerns has proven to be unfounded.|$|E

Concerns were raised about how the iLoo would serve to extend waiting lines, how hygienic {{it would be to}} share keyboards in a public loo, and {{what would happen if the}} keyboard were to be urinated upon. Critics also questioned whether users would spend enough time in the loo to make use of the internet facilities, noting that [...] "most port-a-potty users stay only long enough to relieve themselves without having to inhale." ...|$|E

This was estimated to cost 1,275,000 roubles and would only add [...] to her displacement, but both proposals were rejected by the Naval Technical Committee which believed it was <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> given her obsolete layout. The General Staff made another proposal in 1909 to rearm her as with smaller guns as a guardship intended to defend Sevastopol from attacks by enemy light forces. This was initially approved by the Navy Minister, Admiral Ivan Grigorovich in June 1909, but this was later reversed.|$|E

500|$|On April 6, 2002, it was {{reported}} by the Brazilian media that Riotur, the tourist board of Rio de Janeiro, was planning on suing Fox for damaging the international image of the city. Riotur stated that Rio de Janeiro was portrayed in [...] "Blame It on Lisa" [...] as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and a rat infestation, and {{it was thought that}} this would discourage foreigners from visiting the city. Over a period of three years up to the airing of [...] "Blame It on Lisa" [...] in the United States, Riotur had spent US$18,000,000 on a campaign to attract tourists to Rio de Janeiro. The tourist board now saw this as <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> since they believed the campaign was undermined by the portrayal of the city in the episode. Riotur's planned lawsuit was supported by the Brazilian government, with president Fernando Henrique Cardoso stating that the episode [...] "brought a distorted vision of Brazilian reality".|$|E

500|$|Leslie seeks {{advice from}} city planner Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), who feels {{the project would}} prove {{practically}} impossible due to the logistics and bureaucratic red tape, but Leslie is undeterred. Leslie later fondly tells the documentary crew that she and Mark made love five years ago, but Mark only vaguely recalls the encounter. Leslie, Tom and uninterested intern April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) visit Ann and meet Andy, a lazy and demanding musician whom she is forced to wait on and support financially. Afterward, Leslie and Ann visit the pit, which Leslie accidentally falls into as Tom and April make fun of her. Ann quickly provides medical assistance. Afterward, Leslie leaves, and Ann tells the documentary crew, [...] "She's a little doofy, but she's sweet". Some time later, Leslie asks her boss Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) for permission to form an exploratory committee for the pit project. Ron initially refuses, but eventually agrees to consider it so that Leslie will leave his office. Ron explains {{that he does not}} want the Parks Department to build any parks because he believes government is <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> and that all government should be privatized and run by corporations for profit. Leslie repeatedly pesters Ron about the park project, but he refuses to commit.|$|E

500|$|Early in 1943 {{a policy}} change was mooted to remove female {{officers}} from the technical musterings they had so far filled in the WAAAF, and substitute male officers in these roles. In opposing this, Stevenson went around the new Air Member for Personnel, Air Commodore Frank Lukis, and wrote directly to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore John McCauley. She told McCauley, [...] "I contend that it is <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and training to take women cipher officers, women from Signals (S4) and casualty... when they have learnt their work and substitute these women by men who have to learn the job", and recommended that he direct the Air Member for Personnel to ensure that female officers continued to be employed in technical positions, and not simply for administration and welfare. McCauley agreed with Stevenson but Lukis appealed to Air Vice Marshal George Jones, the Chief of the Air Staff. Jones backed Lukis' authority, and the latter sent what Joyce Thomson described as a [...] "stinging rebuke" [...] to Stevenson, who was forced to apologise. In any event, women officers continued to be employed in technical positions as the WAAAF expanded {{over the next two}} years, peaking in strength at 18,667 members in October 1944. As of July that year, women comprised thirty-one per cent of Air Force ground staff and filled sixty-one trades, all previously occupied by men. By {{the end of the war}} around 27,000 women had served in the WAAAF.|$|E
