Because of the damaging effect of water, particular attention should be given in selecting quality waterproofing material to provide the proper in place performance. Waterproofing material’s life is shorter than building’s life. This study is to identify {{the source of the}} problem of waterproofing failure, the type of waterproofing material that frequently used and the most suitable material use for the flat roof. All the information is given by the maintenance department of every case study. The data collected the information about the type of material in use, and the history maintenance, basically to find out the method construction design and effective of material. Rubberized <b>Asphalt</b> <b>sheet</b> membrane is frequently used for the flat roof area followed by PVC/HDPE sheet membrane and lastly bitumen and the cost of PVC material is highest than the Rubberized and bitumen material. The conclusion of the findings; the rubberized <b>asphalt</b> <b>sheet</b> membrane is the best material to use for the flat roof. It can bee seen from the bar chart, that the rubberized asphalt has more good characteristic and the cost is also reasonably compared to other materials...|$|E

40|$|A {{new concept}} of wooden roof {{structure}} with an attached ceiling is idealized for construction in tropical climates. A scissors truss system {{is used for}} roof structure dictated by architectural considerations. The roof structure was developed using computer aided design {{in order to achieve}} an optimized construction system. This prototype project uses 3 trusses spaced 2. 75 m over a 5 -m span, with a 5 / 7 slope, and a 60 -cm overhang. The top chord and web members consist of 5 x 15 cm mixed hardwood species at 18 % moisture content. The roofing material is composed of 5 x 10 cm wood joists spaced 50 cm on center, 1 x 8 cm T&G wood panel ceiling, <b>asphalt</b> <b>sheet,</b> 1. 5 x 3 cm wood strips spaced 30 cm on center, and clay tiles. The use of a wood panel ceiling, besides its aesthetic appearance, is ecologically and economically correct by diminishing the amount of wood used in roof structures when compared to conventional systems in Brazil. This design also, inhibits the occupancy by undesirable bats under the roof, because there is little gap between roof and ceiling. This prototype project was built two years ago in the Amazon tropical rainforest, under extraneous adverse weather conditions: six months of severe rainfall and six months of severe heat and sparse rainfall. Monitoring the structural and material behavior {{for the past two years}} it is evident the applicability of this construction system for adverse environmental conditions of high heat and humidity together...|$|E

40|$|Asphalt {{mixtures}} have an various complicated element as dynamical properties. And, we {{can point}} out maximum grain size, and ratio of filler to asphalt as which {{have an effect}} on stability of asphalt mixtures. Asphalt mixtures are classified into <b>asphalt</b> concrete, topeka, <b>sheet</b> <b>asphalt,</b> and others, by the maximum grain size of using aggregate, and also divided coarse-graded type from dense-graded type, by the difference of its grading. In our previous paper, we proposed the method of deciding the amount of asphalt and the proportion which have a maximum density. But, when we tried Marshal test at standard proportion, stability value did not satisfy the standard value of Marshal test. So, we tried to make its reason clear. Then, we changed their ratio of filler to asphalt, and observed the variation of stability value about their all cases. The outcome of the observations were that the relations between stability value and ratios of filler to asphalt have been that of straight line, namely, if the ratios of filler to asphalt are getting larger and larger, stability values are also getting large. And, its order is the first. This is the report on it...|$|R
40|$|The asphalt {{pavements}} {{are classified}} into <b>asphalt</b> concrete, topeka, <b>sheet</b> <b>asphalt</b> etc. by the maximum grain size of using aggregate and also sectioned coarse-graded type, dense-graded type, one-sized type etc. by {{the difference of}} its grading. As the grain size and grading of aggregate give essentially the great influence {{on the nature of}} asphalt pavement i. e. stability, durability, flexibility and skid-resistance, the most adequate type of pavement becomes practically to be selected according to the object of construction. Then the best proportion of asphalt mixture comes into question and up to this time many suggestions have been exhibited due to the past experiences or various studies. Nevertheless, the conclusive point on this problem is not able to be obtaind yet. Writers have taken notice of Talbot's formula P= 100 ×(d/D) ^n being said to produce the maximum density and made the test pieces of asphalt mixture with the different grading aggregate by means of varying its maximum grain size D and exponent n. After performing Marshal test for them, it is tried to investigate the results from all directions. This is the report on it...|$|R

40|$|It is not {{yet clear}} that the filler plays any part in the asphalt pavement. But being {{generally}} believed to have a large effect upon the stability and durability of pavement, the study of filler is very important. Up to this time, the stone dust has usually been used as filler, but in this experiment the flyash is adopted instead of it. The reason is that the price of stone dust is higher than that of flyash. The main object of this experiment {{is to make sure that}} the flyash is able to be used as filler or not. According to this experiment, in case of asphalt concrete, the stability of asphalt mixture added the flyash is higher than that of the stone dust adding asphalt mixture. But in other mixtures, such as topeka and <b>sheet</b> <b>asphalt,</b> the former shows lower stability than the latter. In order to improve this fault of flyash, some additives are used at the next experiment. And the result obtained is reported in this paper...|$|R

This is particularly attractive for constructing lower trafficked road. Within this experiments waste polypropylene (PP) plastic was used as partial aggregate substitute in sand <b>sheet</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture, with objective to evaluate its properties. The amount of plastic used was 10 %, 20 %, and 30 %. The aggregate and plastic were proportioned. The aggregate were heated to around 155 - 160 °C, then pre-melted asphalt and the waste plastic were added then re-mixed until the asphalt evenly coat the materials. The mixture was compacted at 2 x 50 Marshall blows. It was found that at 8. 5 % optimum asphalt content, and at all range of plastic content the stability was 277. 41 - 283. 49 kg (> 200 kg), Void in Mixture within range (3 - 6 %), Void in Mineral Aggregate> 20 % and Void Filled with Bitumen> 75 %, all met the Indonesian specification.

40|$|WCCM - World Congress on Computational Mechanics, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIE, 19 -/ 07 / 2010 - 23 / 07 / 2010 This paper {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} of wearing courses on steel orthotropic decks such as the Millau viaduct in France. This is of great importance when dealing with durability: due to the softness of such a support, the pavement is subjected to considerable strains that may generate top-down cracks in the layer at right angles of the orthotropic plate stiffeners and shear cracks at the interface between pavement and steel. Therefore, a five-point bending fatigue test was developed and improved since 2003 at the ENTPE laboratory, to test different asphalt concrete mixes. This study aims at modelling the mechanical behavior of the wearing course throughout the fatigue test by a finite element method (Comsol Multiphysics software). Each material steel, sealing <b>sheet,</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete layer is considered and modelled. The modelling of asphalt concrete is complex since it is a heterogeneous material, a viscoelastic medium and it thermosensitive. The actual characteristics of the asphalt concrete (thermo physical parameter and viscoelastic complex modulus) are determined experimentally on cylindrical cores. Moreover, a damage law based on Miner's damage {{is included in the}} model. The modelling of the fatigue test leads to encouraging results. Finally, modelling's results are compared to the experimental data obtained from the five-point bending fatigue test device. The experimental data are very consistent with the numerical simulation...|$|R
