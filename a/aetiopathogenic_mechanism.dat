40|$|Independent of the aetiology, AD (Alzheimer’s disease) neurofibrillary {{degeneration}} of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau, {{a hallmark}} of AD and related tauopathies, is apparently required for the clinical expression {{of the disease and}} hence is a major therapeutic target for drug development. However, AD is multifactorial and heterogeneous and probably involves several different aetiopathogenic mechanisms. On the basis of CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) levels of Aβ 1 − 42 (where Aβ is amyloid β-peptide), tau and ubiquitin, five different subgroups, each with its own clinical profile, have been identified. A successful development of rational therapeutic disease-modifying drugs for AD will require understanding of the different aetiopathogenic mechanisms involved and stratification of AD patients by different disease subgroups in clinical trials. We have identified a novel <b>aetiopathogenic</b> <b>mechanism</b> of AD which is initiated by the cleavage of SET, also known as inhibitor- 2 (I 2 PP 2 A) of PP 2 A (protein phosphatase 2 A) at Asn 175 into N-terminal (I 2 NTF) and C-terminal (I 2 CTF) halves and their translocation from the neuronal nucleus to the cytoplasm. AAV 1 (adeno-associated virus 1) -induced expression of I 2 CTF in rat brain induces inhibition of PP 2 A activity, abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau, neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in rats. Restoration of PP 2 A activity by inhibition of the cleavage of I 2 PP 2 A/SET offers a promising therapeutic opportunity in AD with this <b>aetiopathogenic</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|E
40|$|Silver–Russell {{syndrome}} (SRS) and Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome {{are described}} in isolation. However, their co-occurrence has only been rarely reported. Here, we present a case report of an adolescent with SRS who was diagnosed with MRKH during the evaluation of primary amenorrhoea. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis showed a normal methylation pattern and normal dosage at 11 p 15. 5. A PubMed search for all peer-reviewed publications (original articles and reviews) using the key words Silver–Russell syndrome, Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, genetics, hypomethylation and reproductive anomalies identified three cases of SRS with MRKH, two of which were associated with significant hypomethylation of the H 19 imprinting control region of the 11 p 15. 5 locus. This report highlights the association between SRS and MRKH. The absence of hypomethylation and normal dosage at 11 p 15. 5 suggests these two rare entities share alternative <b>aetiopathogenic</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|E

40|$|Bullous pemphigoid {{is a rare}} chronic {{recurrent}} dermatosis that {{is often}} reported in association with various neurological diseases. No investigation involving {{a large number of}} patients has ever been carried out to demonstrate such an association. This study was accomplished by analysing the discharge diagnosis of all hospitalized patients, both day-patients and inpatients, during a 5 -year period (1995 - 2000) covering a total population group of 934, 023 living in a region of Italy that has approximately 1, 200, 000 inhabitants. The results support the hypothesis of an association between bullous pemphigoid, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease on a highly significant statistical basis.

40|$|Abstract: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{infection}} {{has been}} implicated in the <b>aetiopathogenic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of several neoplastic and non-neoplastic disorders. Although the precise mechanisms of the tumourigenic actions of EBV {{have not yet been}} fully elucidated, this virus has been strongly linked to subtypes of Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (especially Burkitt’s lymphoma), HIV/AIDS lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma, among several others. The fact that persistent infections occur in greater than 95 % of adults with an overall relatively low incidence of EBV related tumours compared with the prevalence of infection shows that there are definitely many other factors (genetic and environmental) that contribute to tumour development in EBV positive individuals. In this article, we review some of the currently available knowledge about these relationships in the commonly encountered EBV-associated malignancies. It is hoped that with continued research in the pathogenic mechanisms of EBV, specific roles will be identified that will facilitate the development of specific targeted therapy...|$|R
40|$|The <b>aetiopathogenic</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{underlying}} {{clear cell}} acanthoma (CCA) {{is not completely}} clear {{and it has been}} postulated that CCA and psoriasis may have a similar pathogenesis because of the common features shared by the two diseases. As it has been recently demonstrated that in psoriatic lesions the paracrine epithelial growth factors [keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) /fibroblast growth factor (FGF) - 7 and FGF- 10] are involved in promoting and sustaining the keratinocyte hyperproliferation, the aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the expression of KGF on CCA lesions and to search for a role of this growth factor in CCA pathogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed an up-modulation of KGF in CCA, although the immunostaining was variable among the different samples collected. Positive immunoreactivity for KGF was detected mainly on dermal areas where the inflammatory infiltrate was more pronounced suggesting a relationship between lymphocyte activation and KGF up-modulation. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay performed on mRNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CCA and normal skin (NS) samples further demonstrated the overexpression of the KGF/FGF- 7 gene in all CCA samples compared with NS. Moreover, the evaluation by immunohistochemistry of KGF receptor distribution, the high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor for KGF, showed a down-modulation of this receptor, as previously reported in the presence of increased levels of KGF. Taken together these results suggest the inflammatory nature of CCA and further support the hypothesis that this disease may represent, like psoriasis, an inflammatory dermatosis in which KGF up-modulation may be responsible for keratinocyte hyperproliferation and may represent a new common feature of both diseases...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} {{is related}} to ageing and discussed as an <b>aetiopathogenic</b> <b>mechanism</b> of neurodegenerative diseases. To date, {{a growing body of}} evidence shows that elevated levels of proinflammatory markers are also associated with cognitive aging. Inconsistent results, however, have been reported on the link between chronic inflammation and specific cognitive functions. In this context, numerous health and lifestyle factors, in particular risk factors of cardiovascular disease, are suggested to play a role. The present study investigates the association of defined cognitive functions with the pro-inflammatory C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) {{as well as with the}} anti-inflammatory interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) in a nonclinical sample of elderly adults. N = 1312 elderly adults (60 to 85 years, 50. 5 % females) who participated in the Berlin Aging Study II were included in the analyses. A comprehensive physical examination was carried out and information about previous illnesses, medication and health behavior was taken. Furthermore, several laboratory parameters, including serum levels of CRP, IL- 6 and IL- 10, were assessed. All participants underwent a neuropsychological examination of cognitive function and depressive symptoms. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were conducted to examine the linear relationship between latent factors underlying the cognitive tests and the inflammatory markers. In addition, separate analyses were conducted to statistically control for education, sex, depression and clinical parameters. Two cognitive composite scores were found and interpreted as „verbal memory“ and „executive function and processing speed“. Serum levels of IL- 6 (β = - 0. 084; p = 0. 002), IL- 10 (β = - 0. 070; p = 0. 012) and CRP (β = - 0. 061; p = 0. 028) were found to be predictive for „executive function and processing speed“. All three relationships remained significant when adjusted for demographic and clinical factors (p 0. 05). The ratio of IL- 6 and IL- 10 was not predictive for any of the cognitive factors (p > 0. 05). These findings suggest a relationship between higher overall (pro- and anti-inflammatory) activation of the immune system and executive function. Inflammatory markers might play a role in the pathophysiology of cognitive decline. However, the effect sizes were small, and the inflammatory markers should not be considered as predictors of individual risk. Further prospective studies are needed to address chronic inflammation as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of cognitive impairment...|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet ray B (UV-B) induced {{dermatitis}} in the rat {{may be a}} {{model for}} human psoriasis vulgaris. Detailed studies of this model are reported. Rat skin responded to UV-B irradiation quite differently from human, guinea-pig, or mouse skin. Rat UV-B dermatitis was characterized by a sharply demarcated brownish-red lesion with scale formation lasting for 10 days. Histologically, microvascular dilatation, intraepidermal accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes with microabscess, mononuclear cell infiltration at the papillary dermis and hyperproliferation of epidermal cells were observed. These features were similar to those of clinical psoriasis vulgaris in man. Leucocyte suppression, induced by systemic ferritin administration to the irradiated rats, resulted in loss of the epidermal hyperproliferation and inhibition of the tissue leucocytosis. This leucocyte suppression remodelled the picture of the rat UV-B dermatitis into that seen in other mammalian species, where microvascular dilatation and degeneration of keratinocytes (so-called sunburn cells) are characteristic. The irradiated epidermis of the rats treated with ferritin possessed an in vitro PMN chemotactic property. Rat UV-B dermatitis seems to be a useful model to investigate <b>aetiopathogenic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in psoriasis vulgaris. However, the former heals after injury and does not relapse as does psoriasis...|$|R
40|$|An acute-phase {{response}} (APR), manifested as {{an increase}} of acute-phase proteins {{has been shown in}} major depression. Panic disorder (PD) may share some <b>aetiopathogenic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> with depression, but APR has not been studied in this disorder. Forty-one panic patients in the first stages of their illness were compared with 32 healthy subjects of comparable sex, age, and body mass index. Clinical diagnosis was established with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and severity with the Panic Disorder Severity Scale and the CGI scale. Laboratory determinations included four acute phase proteins (APPs) [albumin, gammaglobulins, fibrinogen, C-reactive-protein (CRP) ] and basal cortisol level. Patients were studied after 8 -wk follow-up taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to assess the evolution of the APPs. Gammaglobulin levels were lower, and both cortisol and CRP levels were higher in PD patients than in controls. APP did not differ between patients with or without agoraphobia. At follow-up, patients who responded to SSRIs presented a decrease in albumin levels, and a trend towards a decrease in cortisol and CRP compared with levels at intake. The conclusions of this study are that there is an APR in patients suffering from PD, and this APR tends to diminish after a successful treatment with SSRIs...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{clinical}} study of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) in an Omani population. Clinical {{data in this}} condition has been lacking in Arabia. 1164 patients with heart failure referred to the only secondary care hospital in the Dhakliya region of Oman were evaluated. This region has an indigenous adult population of 225, 000 over 12 years of age.;Over a three-year period, 1992 to 1994, 97 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were identified, with a median age of 50 years (range 15 to 69) giving an yearly prevalence of 14. 4 / 100, 000. There was a male predominance of 1. 4 / 1. Parental consanguinity was high (30 %) but among the 770 (87 %) first-degree relatives screened, cases of IDC {{were found to be}} few (6. 5 %). Familial cases were younger at presentation and more often had consanguineous parents. Familial and sporadic forms did not differ in survival. There was no HLA-DR 4 association and cardiac specific antibodies were not detected making an autoimmune pathophysiology unlikely in these patients. During a mean follow-up period of 6 years (1 to 8 years) survivals were 94 % at 1 year, 76 % at 5 years, and 68 % at 8 years with a mean overall survival of 9. 8 years. As a predictor of poor outcome, severe dyspnoea (NYHA classes III & IV) at presentation, ventricular tachycardia and severe mitral regurgitation were significant on univariate analysis but left ventricular ejection fraction was the only significant factor identified by multivariate analysis. Plasma noradrenaline levels were elevated but did not correlate with the severity of the disease. In children with short duration of illness, such a correlation however, was evident. Mild coronary artery disease was present in 6. 3 % of cases at angiography but had not correlation with mortality.;No <b>aetiopathogenic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> could be identified and alcohol consumption was not involved. 75 % of the patients were from a low socio-economic background. This needs further evaluation. With the completion of this report further research is ongoing into the genetics and autoimmunity of IDC in the Omani population, with studies being extended to other regions of Oman to collect data at a national level...|$|R
40|$|Background: Huntington’s disease (HD) is {{a devastating}} {{neurodegenerative}} condition, {{caused by an}} expanded polyglutamine tract in the Huntingtin (Htt) protein. HD is manifested by personality changes, movement disorders and/or dementia. Prior evidence exists for sterol dysregulation in HD models, observed both in neurons and astrocytes. In the brain the cholesterol is produced in situ, as the blood brain barrier prevents the cholesterol metabolized in the periphery {{to be used by}} the brain cells. The consensus stablished supports the idea that neurons synthesize the cholesterol needed in the soma, but rely on the cholesterol delivered by astrocytes in the form of apolipoproteins at synapses. A key player studied to be responsible to communicate the cholesterol status of neurons to astrocytes is the 24 S-hydroxycholesterol (24 S-OHC) also knows as the cerebrosterol (the brain oxysterol). Aim: Prior results from the lab showed cholesterol accumulation in primary striatal neurons infected with lentiviral expression vectors encoding a mutant Htt fragment (Htt 171 ­ 82 Q) compared to cells expressing a wild-type Htt fragment (Htt 171 ­ 18 Q). Following on these results and the previous published work from different laboratories, the aim of this thesis was to investigate the sterol status of HD striatal neurons in order to better understand this process and the consequences for the neurons and astrocytes’ health in the context of HD. Methods: Filipin staining, cholesterol oxidase assay, isotope-dilution gas chromatography­mass spectrometry, NeuN positive staining cell count – neuronal cell death assay, Mitosox assay, Fluo- 4 AM imaging, extracellular multi-electrode array recordings, immunocytochemistry and real-time quantitative PCR. Results: I observed sterol accumulation in primary striatal neurons expressing mutant Htt, which one release into the medium significantly increased levels of 24 S-OHC. The cerebrosterol is toxic to striatal neurons and the mechanism elucidated was by inducing increased superoxide levels in the mitochondria. Besides the toxicity effect, 24 S-OHC was observed to sensitize N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function, measured by increased calcium influx in the presence of NMDA and increased amplitude and frequency of firing in the presence of glutamate, modulating NMDA receptor activity. In addition, the studies collected support that 24 S-OHC induces sterol dysregulation in astrocytes by downregulating SREBP 2 target genes and the purposed mechanism is by blocking the transcription factor’s migration into the nucleus, in this way promotes inhibition of cholesterol and its precursors synthesis. In parallel 24 S-OHC up-regulates LXR target genes aiming to increase cholesterol efflux. Conclusion: The results part of this thesis conveyed with others’ published work and brought novelty into the field. Like others I observed sterol accumulation at the plasma membrane and in lysosomes and stablished a link with the sterol dyshomeostasis observed in my model with HD hallmarks – mitochondrial stress and excitotoxicity, caused by the increased of 24 S­OHC efflux. In addition, I was also able to link the sterol dysregulation in neurons with astrocyte’s cholesterol dyshomeostasis, as evidenced by a different group. This thesis provides new insights into the potential <b>aetiopathogenic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of HD and reconcile some apparently disparate previous findings regarding sterol disposition in this disorder...|$|R
