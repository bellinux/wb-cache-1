5|$|By 1998, Apple has fired Sculley, {{purchased}} NeXT, {{and named}} Jobs CEO, and Jobs {{is about to}} unveil the iMac at Davies Symphony Hall. He is delighted by Hoffman's strong commercial forecasts, but furious that Lisa has allowed her mother {{to sell the house}} Jobs bought for them. Hoffman reminds Jobs that he threatened to withhold Lisa's college tuition – Hertzfeld admits that he paid Lisa's tuition and suggested she attend therapy. Wozniak again asks that Jobs credit the Apple II team during the presentation, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>he</b> refuses.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the entire}} Austrian force, {{including}} Klenau's column, withdrew into Ulm {{and its environs}} and Napoleon himself arrived to take command of the II, V, VI Corps, Ney's Cavalry and the Imperial Guard, numbering close to 80,000 men. Archduke Ferdinand and a dozen cavalry squadrons broke out through the French army and escaped into Bohemia. Again, {{as he had been}} at Mantua, Klenau was caught in a siege from which there was no escape, <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>he</b> helped to negotiate the terms, when, on 21 October, Karl Mack surrendered the encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry. Klenau and the other officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until exchanged, an agreement to which they held.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Dixon {{succeeded in}} {{bringing}} his ship alongside the Spanish frigate {{and opened a}} heavy fire, to which Gerraro replied with his own broadside. The larger and more powerful British ship was able to rapidly inflict severe damage to the Santa Dorotea, and within minutes the mizenmast had fallen and the mainmast and rudder were severely battered. As Santa Dorotea veered off course, O'Neil passed Lion for a third time, at an even greater distance than before, and once again his broadsides failed {{to have an effect}} <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>he</b> came under fire from the British vessel. His last attempt to save Santa Dorotea defeated, O'Neil turned away and his ships raised all sail in the direction of Cartagena at 13:10. Gerraro, his isolated ship trapped by Lion, which was slowly turning back towards the drifting frigate, raised the Union Flag upside down as a sign of surrender.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bomford stopped <b>and</b> coughed. <b>Again</b> <b>he</b> {{was pleased}} with himself.|$|R

5|$|Two {{years after}} the Arnou-le-Faucon lawsuit, Carrouges was once again in court facing Count Pierre, this time in dispute over the lands {{administered}} by his recently deceased father. Carrouges III's death early in 1382 vacated the captaincy of the castle of Bellême, a post Carrouges IV believed would be his by right. However, due to the failed lawsuit two years earlier, Count Pierre passed Carrouges over for the captaincy {{and gave it to}} another of his followers. The infuriated Carrouges again brought legal action against his overlord <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>he</b> was defeated in court. The only lasting result of the action was the further separation of Carrouges and Count Pierre's court.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Oxford, {{he spent}} some years playing club cricket in the Maidstone area. It {{was during this}} period, in 1908, that he learnt to bowl the then fairly new googly. The {{following}} May he made his first-class debut for Kent against his old university, and took seven wickets in the match, including 5/65 in the first innings. His next chances came in July, in two Gentlemen v Players games, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>he</b> met with success, taking a total of fifteen wickets in the four innings.|$|E
25|$|The {{contrast}} between Mao's top field commanders {{could hardly have}} been more sharp, but on the Long March they worked well together, Lin specializing in feints, masked strategy, surprises, ambushes, flank attacks, pounces from the rear, and stratagems. Peng met the enemy head-on in frontal assaults and fought with such fury that again <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>he</b> wiped them out. Peng did not believe a battle well fought unless he managed to replenish—and more than replenish—any losses by seizure of enemy guns and converting prisoners of war to new and loyal recruits to the Red Army.|$|E
25|$|Ligachyov denied time <b>and</b> <b>again</b> that <b>he</b> {{was opposed}} to Gorbachev in sources {{including}} his memoirs.|$|R
6000|$|... 'N-no,' said Smike, {{his teeth}} {{chattering}} in his head. 'But {{he brought me}} back before, <b>and</b> will <b>again.</b> <b>He</b> will, he will indeed.' ...|$|R
60|$|The angry {{eyes of the}} paralyzed man glittered {{brighter}} and brighter. His lips opened <b>and</b> closed <b>again.</b> <b>He</b> made no reply.|$|R
25|$|He {{started on}} a {{criminal}} career {{at a very early}} age, and continued on this path throughout the years, returning to prison again <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> <b>He</b> was convicted of bank robbery, drug dealing, extortion, armed robbery, and forgery. A repeating pattern of convictions, paroles, releases and escapes, further crimes and new convictions continued until he was released yet again from prison in 1975, at which point he finally left his criminal days permanently behind. Bunker stayed out of jail thereafter, and instead focused on his career as a writer and actor.|$|E
25|$|On 10 December 1992, at Hobart, Australia scored 228/7 from 50 overs. Pakistan top ordere batted {{too slowly}} and Mujtba, batting at no 6 felt the pressure. Fortunately, {{he found a}} willing partner in WK Rashid Latif. Together they put on 68 for the 7th wicket in double quick time. Still, the match seemed lost for the Paks, until Mujtaba hit the last ball of the match, a high full toss form Steve Waugh into the crowd to tie the match. His {{individual}} effort was 56*, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>he</b> was {{the man of the}} match.|$|E
25|$|Yarborough was {{inducted}} into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1993, the National Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame and the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1994, the Court of Legends at Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1996 and was named one of NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers (1998). In 2009, Yarborough was one of the 25 nominees for the first class to be inducted in the NASCAR Hall of Fame, though he was not selected. In 2010, he was nominated for induction in the second class of the Hall of Fame, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>he</b> failed to make the cut.|$|E
60|$|And {{the old man}} {{sipped his}} brown wine, <b>and</b> smiled <b>again.</b> <b>He</b> made quite a {{handsome}} picture: but he was frail.|$|R
25|$|Berenberg was a {{candidate}} for public office on the Socialist Party ticket {{on a number of}} different occasions, running for office each year from 1918 through 1924, inclusive. In 1918 <b>and</b> <b>again</b> in 1923 <b>he</b> stood as {{a candidate}} for the New York State Assembly. In 1919 <b>and</b> <b>again</b> in 1921 <b>he</b> ran for New York City Council. In 1920 Berenberg ran for New York State Senate, while in 1922 <b>and</b> <b>again</b> in 1924 <b>he</b> ran for U.S. Congress.|$|R
60|$|Julien glanced {{across the}} room. He met the girl's eyes <b>and</b> once <b>again</b> <b>he</b> saw {{in them that}} curious, almost impersonal invitation.|$|R
25|$|Billy is set {{to carry}} the Olympic Torch through Walford and has 30 minutes before he has to collect the torch. Billy takes a taxicab to the BBC be interviewed on The One Show but discovers that the other torchbearers have already been interviewed. He is chased out of the studio by a {{security}} guard. Billy's next stop is Wembley Stadium <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>he</b> discovers the torchbearers have already left. Billy then goes to West Ham United F.C. and catches up with the other torchbearers but unfortunately Billy has lost his pass and is not allowed in. His taxi driver, Hercules, appears with Billy's pass and he takes part in the celebrations. Billy then wakes up in the hair and beauty salon in Walford {{and it turns out}} he was dreaming.|$|E
25|$|Several {{times he}} {{prepared}} to head out, but each time was detained by the threats of his enemies in Piedmont or by economic restraints which compelled him to mortgage his marquisate to Frederick II. Finally, he cowed some cities into giving him aid in men. Nevertheless, he was present at Capua, Ferentino, and Sora with Frederick II in February 1223. Delayed again <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>he</b> drank a toast at Brindisi to his setting off in 1225, but he fell ill at the last minute. His fleet remained in port until Spring 1226, when, under urging from Honorius, it finally cast off. The delays had been fatal and William himself died at Almyros on 17 September. The rest of his army {{was hit by a}} dysentery epidemic and melted away.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{had to wait}} {{twelve years}} to play his second Test, {{allegedly}} and almost certainly due to upper class prejudice by the England captain Freddie Brown in early years, and of England selector Gubby Allen later. He was finally selected for the third Test against the 1961 Australians at Headingley, when he was 40 years old. Again, he was chosen to replace the first-choice fast bowler, Brian Statham, who had a side strain, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>he</b> provided able support, this time to Trueman, taking 2 for 57 and 2 for 26, as England won by eight wickets. Statham came back for the final two Tests, and Jack Flavell was picked ahead of Jackson. He never played Test cricket again. The 12-year gap between his appearances is the longest of any England Test player with only two caps.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we will {{consider}} that settled. Good morning, or perhaps I should say au revoir;" [...] <b>and,</b> bowing <b>again,</b> <b>he</b> left the office.|$|R
60|$|He {{took one}} step nearer to her, <b>and</b> stopped <b>again.</b> <b>He</b> lifted his hand, and pointed with his lean brown finger at her dress.|$|R

25|$|Prior to the 2008 season, Wood Brothers Racing and JTG Racing {{split into}} two teams. Ambrose was {{scheduled}} to drive for both teams in Sprint Cup competition in 2008. He {{was going to run}} twelve races in the No. 21 car for the Wood Brothers and another four in the No. 47 car for JTG Racing. However, due to various issues he only ran 11 of the 16 planned races. He ran well in the Toyota-Save Mart 350 at Infineon, qualifying 7th out of 47 drivers and was running in the top three, but his No. 21 spun through the famous Turn 11 hairpin and blowing his transmission, finishing a disappointing 42nd in the 43-car field. He attempted to make his second career Sprint Cup start in the Lenox Industrial Tools 301 at New Hampshire, but failed to qualify, qualifying 45 out of 45. Again, 43 cars would start, <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>he</b> attempted to qualify the 21 car. He also drove the full Nationwide Series schedule.|$|E
25|$|However, between 1770 and 1774, Fox's {{seemingly}} promising {{career in}} the political establishment was spoiled. In February 1770, Fox {{was appointed to the}} board of the Admiralty by Lord North, but on the 15th of the same month he resigned due to his enthusiastic opposition to the government's Royal Marriages Act, the provisions of which – incidentally – cast doubt on the legitimacy of his parents' marriage. On 28 December 1772, North appointed Fox to the board of the Treasury <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>he</b> surrendered his post, in February 1774, over the Government's allegedly feeble response to the contemptuous printing and public distribution of copies of parliamentary debates. Behind these incidents lay his family's resentment towards Lord North for refusing to elevate the Holland barony to an earldom. But the fact that such a young man could seemingly treat ministerial office so lightly was noted at court. George III, also observing Fox's licentious private behaviour, took it to be presumption and judged that Fox could not be trusted to take anything seriously.|$|E
25|$|Franklin Pierce was {{a member}} of the U.S. House of Representatives by the time they married and became a U.S. Senator in 1837. She was forced to become the {{political}} wife she never wanted to be. Jane hated life in Washington, D.C., and encouraged her husband to resign his Senate seat and return to New Hampshire, which he did in 1842. She blamed politics for all the troubles in her life including the death of her child and Franklin's excessive alcohol consumption. Service in the Mexican-American War brought him the rank of Brigadier General and local fame as a hero. He returned home safely, and for four more years the Pierces lived quietly at Concord, New Hampshire. Unfortunately their son Frank passed from typhus a year later, causing stress for the entire family and leading to health issues for Jane. In 1842, President James K. Polk offered Franklin the U.S. attorney post; however, due to Jane's objection, he turned it down. A senate seat and New Hampshire governor was also offered, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>he</b> turned it down for family reasons.|$|E

60|$|He sprang forward, {{and called}} Pelagia's name <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> Once <b>he</b> fancied he heard an answer: but the {{soldiers}} thrust him back.|$|R
60|$|<b>Again</b> <b>he</b> {{saw himself}} as he pressed the switch of his {{electric}} torch <b>and</b> looked. <b>Again</b> <b>he</b> saw the twin braids of heavy golden hair ere his thumb relaxed from the switch, leaving him in darkness.|$|R
500|$|... "For {{the defense}} {{it was big}} Len Ford, who sparked a forward wall that never let the Bucks threaten. His end was {{practically}} impregnable. [...] He smashed Ohio interference time <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>he</b> continually harassed Dick Slager and Pandel Savic, the Ohio passers, and he made life miserable for Pete Perini, blocking one punt and rushing the Buckeye punter on nearly all of his kicks." ...|$|E
500|$|The New Zealand defeat was {{the first}} tour loss for the British side, who then drew with a {{combined}} Taranaki-Wanganui-Manawatu side before travelling to Auckland. Gallaher played for Auckland against the tourists and scored one of the tries in their 13–0 victory. He {{was part of a}} forward pack that dominated their opponents, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>he</b> troubled Vile; his tackling of Vile and Bush killed many British attacks. The rugby historian Terry McLean would write in 1987 that [...] "his display could be ranked with the finest exhibitions of wing-forward play". Gallaher represented Auckland once more in 1904, a 3–0 loss to Taranaki.|$|E
500|$|Blitz hired Belgian Jo Willems as the cinematographer, having collaborated {{previously}} on commercials. Blitz admired Willems' [...] "European sensibility about shooting" [...] {{and wanted}} to use his aesthetic to [...] "tell a story that was equal parts deadpan and suggestive of the 'real' world". In creating a [...] "look" [...] for the film, {{he said that he}} relied upon [...] "almost opposite impulses"—to tell the story intimately but also carry the comedy. Through the film, he used lighting and art direction that felt real, while framing the shots to come across as deadpan. Production designer Rick Butler chose bland, simple furniture and commonplace houses and cars to give the film a sense of timelessness and familiarity. The color palette in both production and costume design was drab and ordinary to give a deadpan undertone. Blitz was most inspired by the cinematography and production design of Hal Ashby's films: [...] "I watched his films again <b>and</b> <b>again...</b> <b>He</b> has a masterful blending of absurd comedy and naturalism." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> once <b>again</b> <b>he</b> struck him; <b>and</b> his evil soul fled forth, {{and went}} down to Hades squeaking, like a bat into the {{darkness}} of a cave.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> then <b>again</b> <b>he</b> expostulated in a {{different}} tone. [...] "You'll ruin it all, Aby; you will indeed; you don't know all the circumstances; indeed you don't." ...|$|R
50|$|However, in 1979, Burnett was the Archbishop of Cape Town {{and thus}} {{president}} of the Anglican Provincial Synod <b>and</b> once <b>again,</b> <b>he</b> voiced {{a challenge to the}} Synod.|$|R
