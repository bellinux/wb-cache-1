From all the {{problems}} that could be brought up, I distinguish two: the distinguish two: the splitting between the university´s investigation and the teaching {{and the lack of}} clearly defined aims, both in lyric and in epic. Because of that, it is justified to consider some changes, envolving the formation of Portuguese teachers and the <b>ajustment</b> of the Programs and Methods, according to the needs and the circumstancies of the students...|$|E

40|$|Bundle <b>ajustment</b> is used {{to obtain}} {{accurate}} visual recon-structions by minimizing the reprojection error. The coor-dinate frame ambiguity, or more generality the gauge free-doms, has been dealt with in different manners. It has often been reported that standard bundle adjustment algorithms were not gauge invariant: two iterations within different gauges can lead to geometrically very different results. Sur-prisingly, most algorithms do not exploit gauge freedoms to improve performances. We consider this issue. We ana-lyze theoretically {{the impact of the}} gauge on standard al-gorithms. We show that a sufficiently general damping ma-trix in Levenberg-Marquardt iteration can be used to implic-itly reproduce a gauge transformation. We show that if the damping matrix is chosen such that the decrease in the repro-jection error is maximized, then the iteration is gauge invari-ant. Experimental results on simulated and real data show that our gauge invariant bundle adjustment algorithm out-performs existing ones in terms of stability. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{report on}} the {{operation}} of the Cooperative Urban Teacher Education Program (C 9 Tr) for the fall semester 10 F 0 is divided into two parts. Part 1 examines the objective data in terms of the hypotheses: 1) On each of the measures taken luring the semester, students participating in the proaram do not chance. 2) Or each of the measures taken, there is no difference between students who have experienced the proaram and comparable students vho have not experienced it. Tle conclusion indicated that the objective data obtained reject some of the null hypotheses, but fail to reject others. This means that if other factors were not operating, the program showed some desired effects. Part 2 examines the logs kept by students to record their reactions in oriel to determine if program objectives have been net or if curriculum <b>ajustments</b> are needed. The objectives include acceptance by the student of feelings abou...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the geometric inflight-calibration of the Modular Optoelectronic Multispectral Scanner MOMS- 2 P, which is collecting digital multispectral and threefold along track stereoscopic {{imagery of the}} earth´s surface from the PRIRODA module of the Russian space station MIR since September 1996. Goal is the verification and, if necessary, the update of the calibration data, which were deduced from the geometric laboratory calibration. The presented approach is based on combined photogrammetric bundle <b>ajustment</b> using an adapted functional model for {{the reconstruction of the}} interior orientation. It requires precise and reliable ground control information as well as navigation data of the navigation-package MOMSNAV. 11 subsequent image scenes of MIR-orbit T 083 C are evaluated, which were taken in April 1997 building an about 550 km long strip over southern Germany and Austria. In this paper the photogrammetric inflight calibration principle and the preprocessing of the input data are described and first results are presented...|$|E
40|$|Using the EU KLEMS dataset we {{test the}} capital-skill {{complementarity}} hypothesis in {{a cross-section of}} sectors in Spain between 1980 and 2005. We analyze three groups of workers, who are classed according to skill level: high, medium and low. Capital assets have been broken down into ICT (information and communication technologies) assets and non-ICT assets. Acquisition and usage costs of ICT assets declined throughout the period studied, both in absolute terms and relative to the other capital assets and workers. Our principal finding is that the substitutibility between workers and ICT assets falls as worker skill level rises. In fact, the ICT assets were strongly complement with highly skilled workers and were not substitutive with them. Throughout the period analyzed, the fraction of employed medium- and high-skill workers rose by 21 % and 12 %, respectively, to the disadvantage of low-skill workers. After decomposing these changes, {{we found that the}} latter were dominated by an <b>ajustment</b> within sectors more than by a composition effect or adjustment between sectors. These adjustments may be explained by reference to the estimated elasticities of substitution. capital-skill complementarity, ICT, translog cost function, elasticity of substitution. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine whether the {{estimation}} of labor demand can be affected by individual behavior heterogeneity. We shall consider an error-components model with variable-coefficients, where the coefficients are random and vary accross firms according to the values of time-constant explanatory variables and to a random firm-specific effect. The specification of labor demand which stems from the variable coefficients hypothesis is estimated by the generalized method of moments on a panel of 810 French manufacturing firms. Heterogeneities appear to be strongly significant. When the share of skilled workers is higher, the <b>ajustment</b> speed is lower and the influence of wages on labor demand decreases (in absolute value) as well as that of sector demand shocks. Moreover, a higher market-share leads to a smaller adjustment speed and to an increased influence of wages and industry demand on employment. Our estimates reveal strongly significant heterogeneities in labor demand behavior. However, the study of aggregation biases leads to the conclusion that they are very small. In fact our individual coefficients are uncorrelated with the explanatory variables, and this is a sufficient condition for the absence of aggregation biases. ...|$|E
40|$|Between 1994 and 2001, several {{experiments}} (ARCANE, SEFOS, INTERAFOS) {{were conducted to}} directly measure the general and mesoscale Lagrangian circulations over the Bay of Biscay abyssal plain and slopes. Two levels (~ 100 m and ~ 450 m) were selected to cover the North Atlantic Central Water range. Two types of Lagrangian instruments, drogued surface drifters tracked by satellite (Surdrift) and acoustically tracked subsurface floats (Rafos and Marvor), were used. Overall, more than 36 instrument-years were collected in the Bay of Biscay region (43 - 49 °N, 01 - 12 °W). The weak general circulation in the Bay of Biscay is seen to be highly influenced by the occurrence of several mesoscale coherent features, notably slope currents and eddies, and these affect the exchanges between the abyssal plain and the slopes. The objective {{of this paper is}} to depict some specific examples of the observed mesoscale field. Selected float trajectories are shown and used to discuss observations of slope currents and of both anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies. Slope currents exhibit alternation of poleward and equatorward directions, depending on both the period and the geographic area considered. Although the generation process of mesoscale eddies is difficult to observe unambiguously from Lagrangian instruments, eddies are nevertheless ubiquitous over the abyssal plain. Some characteristics of the observed cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are presented. Smaller anticyclones, localised over the outer shelf and interpreted in terms of <b>ajustment</b> of slope water intrusions, are also depicted...|$|E
40|$|This reasearch {{is carried}} out in two phases. Generally it is aimed to find the form and size or {{proportion}} of the building of people's house {{in the era of}} Majapahit Kingdom. It is important to give input to reconstruct the building for developing Kawasan Wisata Budaya Majapahit or Majapahit Park. The first phase of this research has concluded the form of the building with single mass through disciplinary approach of architectural science and fine arts, which is based on the excavation results of Segaran II site done by Prof. Mundardjito and the team from Archeological Department of Indonesia University. The purpose of the research's second phase is to find the proportion and size of the building whose form has been concluded in the first step of the research. The research method used in this second phase is tracing the history of house building in the era of Majapahit Kingdom through its cultural spread which, until now, still becomes the tradition {{in the life of the}} community in Bali and Java, especially East and Central Java. This is because the artefact in the form of whole building sites is not available anymore. What is left is only Segaran II site in the form of building foundation with its artefacts as the results of excavation. The primary data source used in this research are literary studies from lontars which contain notes about the history of cultural spread of Majapahit in Bali and Java, and interviews with some experts in Bali's traditional architecture. The techniques used in compiling data in this research is indepth interview, observation and document analysis. T o guarantee the validity of the data, the researchers use data source critical technique (triangulation). And to analyze the data, the researchers use diachronic analysis technique. Based on the findings and discussions done by the researchers, it can be concluded that in the making of a house in the era of Majapahit, people base it on Astha Kosali which is strongly enfluenced by Hindu philosophy. It is now still the tradition in the making of a house in Bali. The size standard used is the dimension of limbs of the building's owner, which is called Gegulak, although in its development it has gone through evolution dan <b>ajustment</b> with modern (W estern) size standard (meter, centimeter and inch). But the principle of using the dimension of limbs of the building's owner and the principles in Astha Kosali are still common in the tradition of Balinese architecture...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{records from}} the North Atlantic and the {{surrounding}} continents have shown rapid and large amplitude climate variability during the last glacial period. This variability has often been associated {{to changes in the}} Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Rapid climate change on the same time scales has also been reconstructed for sites far away from the North Atlantic, such as the tropical Atlantic, the East Pacific and Asia. The mechanisms explaining these climatic responses to the state of the AMOC are far from being completely understood, especially in a glacial context. Here we study three glacial simulations characterised by different AMOC strengths: 18, 15 and 2 Sv. With these simulations, we analyse the global climate sensitivity to a weak (18 to 15 Sv) and a strong (15 to 2 Sv) decrease in the AMOC strength. A weak decrease in the AMOC is associated, in our model simulations, to the classical North Atlantic and European cooling, but this cooling is not homogeneous over this region. We investigate the reasons for a lesser cooling (or even slight warming in some cases) over the Norwegian Sea and Northwestern Europe. It appears that the convection site in this area is active in both simulations, but that convection is unexpectedly stronger in the 15 Sv simulation. Due to the large variability of the atmosphere, it is difficult to definitely establish what is the origin of this climatic difference, but it appears that the atmospheric circulation anomaly helps sustaining the activity of this convection sites. Far from the North Atlantic, the climatic response is of small amplitude, the only significant change appearing in summer over the tropical Atlantic, where the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shifts southward. The climate differences between the 15 Sv and 2 Sv simulations are much larger and our analyses focus on three areas: the North Atlantic and surrounding regions, the Tropics and the Indian monsoon region. We study the timing of appearance of these responses to the AMOC shutdown, which gives some clues about the mechanisms for these teleconnections. We show that the North Atlantic cooling associated {{with the collapse of the}} AMOC induces a cyclonic atmospheric circulation anomaly centered over the North Atlantic, which modulates the eastward advection of the cold anomaly over the Eurasian continent. It can explain that the cooling is not as strong over Western Europe as over the North Atlantic and the rest of the Eurasian continent. Another modification in the northern extratropical stationary waves occurs over the Eastern Pacific, explaining a warming over Northwestern America. In the Tropics, the ITCZ southward shift in this simulation appears to be strongest over the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific and results from an <b>ajustment</b> of the atmospheric and oceanic transports. Finally, the Indian monsoon weakening also appears to be connected to the tropospheric cooling over Eurasia...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{elucidate}} {{the relationship between}} glycemic control (assessed by the level of HbA 1 c) and psychological status of the patients. Materials and methods. The study included 115 patients with type 1 diabetes aged 13 - 27 years. The following tests {{were used to assess}} the psychological status of the patients status (emotional state, social relations, attitude toward disease) : State-trait-anxiety Inventory (Spielberger C. D., Hanin Y. L), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Social <b>ajustment</b> scale by A. K. Osnizkiy based on Q-Sort Adjustment Scale developed by R. Dymond and C. R. Rogers (1954), Lusher colour test, Colour attitudes test, A. M. Etkind original technique, method for the assessment of attitude toward disease developed in V. M. Bekhterev Research Psychoneurologic Institute, Sankt-Peterburg. The patients were allocated to 3 groups differing in terms of 33. 3 % percentile of HbA 1 c levels. Results. Patients with good glycemic control (mean HbA 1 c level 7. 4 %) show the lowest level of social adaptation and emotional well-being. The reason for this phenomenon is the excessive focus of patient on the disease and narrow scope of interests, which suggest psychological dependence on diabetes. Patients with poor glycemic control (mean HbA 1 c level 13. 1 %) also experience emotional discomfort due to increased anxiety. Despite the fact they exhibit a higher degree of social adaptation than the patients of the above group, the main concern is the low level of communicative autonomy and the feeling of being unable to cope with the disease. Such personal characteristics also create a psychological dependence on diabetes, although of a different type than in the first group of patients. Patients with average glycemic control (mean HbA 1 c level 9. 5 %) in the sample have the most favorable psychological state in comparison with the other two groups. Their emotional state and social adaptation are significantly better than in the other two groups. These patients tend to psychological autonomy and independence and maintain multifaceted life motivation in terms of diabetes. They perceive the disease as a given, some life condition that allows to maintain a positive psychological state, high daily activity, not to feel overwhelmed with diabetes {{and at the same time}} pay attention to diabetes self-management even not quite sufficient. Conclusions. Glycemic control and psychological status in young adults does not coincide with each other, although there is a close relationship among them. Attitude toward the disease is the most important mediator of this relationship. Professional psychological help and educational interventions designed to develop skills of the practical management of diabetes may contribute to improvement of metabolic control, psychological well-being and social adjustment of patients...|$|E
