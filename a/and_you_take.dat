2500|$|In late 2013 {{he again}} {{suggested}} that African Americans possess a [...] "slick" [...] style of boxing which {{is superior to}} other styles (presumably practiced by non-African Americans). [...] "The great Sugar Ray Leonard, right now, if he was boxing, {{the way that they}} want you to fight, the people that pull the strings of the puppet, he would be boring today. Ray Robinson – the great Robinson – would be boring today…Because the feeders of the people that buy entertainment. They're being fed that if they duck, don't buy it. If they're slick, and they beat [...] nine out of the 12 rounds, and the guy just can't hit him because they were slick and smart enough to hit and not get hit, 'He's not crowd-pleasing, he don't sell tickets.' Because they done fed the followers and they done fed [...] to the customers. The customers will drink anything that you give them if it's promoted right…But when you take away the skill <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> away the slick, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> away the boxing ability and say that's not entertaining, or that's not entertainment, then, to me, it's like trying to erase a culture that you know has dominated the sport way back then where you were slick. And I'm talking about black fighters. Yes, I said it", said Hopkins.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{documented}} {{phrase in}} the Polish language reads [...] "Day ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai" [...] ("Let me grind, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> a rest"), reflecting {{the culture of}} early Poland. It was composed by an abbot named Piotr (Peter) within the Latin language chronicle Liber fundationis from between 1269 and 1273, which described {{the history of the}} Cistercian monastery in Henryków, Silesia. The sentence was allegedly uttered almost a hundred years earlier by a Bohemian settler, who expressed pity for his spouse's duty of grinding by the quern-stone. The sentence has been included in the UNESCO Memory of World Register.|$|E
2500|$|The {{model of}} an urn with {{green and red}} marbles can be {{extended}} to the case where {{there are more than}} two colors of marbles. If there are Ki marbles of color i in the urn <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> n marbles at random without replacement, then the number of marbles of each color in the sample (k1,k2,...,kc) has the multivariate hypergeometric distribution. [...] This has the same relationship to the multinomial distribution that the hypergeometric distribution has to the binomial distribution—the multinomial distribution is the [...] "with-replacement" [...] distribution and the multivariate hypergeometric is the [...] "without-replacement" [...] distribution.|$|E

5000|$|The {{wilderness}} {{will welcome}} <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> teach <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to its heart. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> will {{find your own}} soul there; and the discovery will be worth while!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> left it, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> {{to going}} to races, {{and they say that}} <b>you</b> gambled <b>and</b> are in debt, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have been reckless. Is not that true, George?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Suddenly, Batra {{realized}} {{that one of}} his men had been shot. Turning his face toward Subedar Raghunath Singh, who was sitting behind a nearby boulder, maintaining an iron grip on his AK-47, Batra shouted above the din of flying bullets: [...] "Aap aur main usko evacuate karenge," [...] (We wil evacuate him, you and I). With bullets flying around him, he pushed the JCO toward the safer side and taking his place instead, saying: [...] "You have a family and children to go back to, I'm not even married. Main sar ki taraf rahunga aur aap paanv uthayenge" [...] (I will take the head <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> his feet). Batra courageously exposed himself to enemy fire to drag the injured soldier to safety, and in the process was shot in the chest by an enemy sniper from very close range and a split-second later, by a splinter from an RPG which hit him in the head. Captain Batra collapsed next to the injured soldier, succumbing to the fatal wounds.|$|E
2500|$|A lighter {{incident}} occurred regarding that accusation during the Nebraska primary campaign. [...] The state's former governor, Frank Morrison, who was actively campaigning for McGovern, sought {{to counter the}} Jackson and Humphrey campaigns' effective use of the accusation. [...] During a campaign speech, Morrison declared, [...] "They say that George McGovern is for the legalization of marijuana, but I say --" [...] At this point there was thunderous applause from the younger people in the audience, which left Morrison puzzled, but when it died down, he finished, [...] "I tell you that George McGovern does not advocate the legalization of marijuana." [...] This produced cries of disappointment in the audience. [...] He continued, [...] "They say George McGovern is for abortion on demand, but I tell you--" [...] Again there was deafening applause, followed by sighs of regret when he finished the sentence: [...] "But I {{say to you that}} George McGovern is against tampering with our state laws on abortion." [...] Afterwards, Morrison confessed to McGovern, [...] "Maybe I'm too old to understand this new generation. [...] I'll get the oldsters for you, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> care of the young ones as you think best." [...] McGovern won the Nebraska primary.|$|E

5000|$|Jake Gold: [...] "I always {{wondered}} {{how you were}} going to do country <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> that song <b>and</b> made it Eva. You made it work" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Long, long ago! Before the winter. When {{the autumn}} leaves were falling, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> me out one evening for a sail. Ah, George, you have forgotten!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You may {{sometimes}} wish to invite Rosie {{to take your}} place outside, when it is very pleasant, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> her place inside," [...] suggested Mr. George.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Those are not weakness. Your will is indolent, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> {{refuge in}} fancying {{that you want}} strength. Rouse yourself, not to be drifted about--make a line for yourself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|We will swap anecdotes. I {{will take}} your anecdote <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> mine. I will say to the dukes and counts and princes of the ancient nobility of France: ...|$|E

6000|$|He went away, and Alice Deringham {{glanced at}} her father with a flush in her face. [...] "I did not {{understand}} before. The man had a pistol <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> it from him?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... 'Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you {{the kingdom}} {{prepared}} {{for you from}} {{the foundation of the}} world.

6000|$|While {{the servant}} was gone Havill {{cleared his throat}} and said, 'I am an architect, and I take in the Architect; you are an architect, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> in the Army and Navy Gazette.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. I {{want you}} to get this, miss. Here's a {{thousand}} dollars; they're yours for picking up <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> no risk. If you refuse and hold down the contract, you'll certainly go broke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor have I," [...] Ryan said. [...] "But I {{suppose there}} is no {{difficulty}} about it. You put up the sail, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> hold of the rope at the corner, and off you go." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE DEVIL. There! [Appealing to the statue] You hear, sir! Oh, by what {{irony of}} fate was this cold selfish egotist sent to my kingdom, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>taken</b> to the icy mansions of the sky! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I'm not {{thinking}} of this last time," [...] Hefferom interrupted, with a hard laugh. [...] "I am thinking {{of the time he}} put you on to the mine, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> possession of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I am not mistaken, Mr. Murthwaite," [...] I began, [...] "you were {{acquainted with}} the late Lady Verinder, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> some {{interest}} in the strange succession of events which ended {{in the loss of}} the Moonstone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't {{your health}} I mean. There are other things, {{as you well}} know. You do your day's work <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> your pleasure, and you go through both as if your feet were on a treadmill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You sneer, perhaps; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> a lofty air upon {{yourself}} perhaps!

6000|$|... "No?" [...] said Stimson. [...] "Now, I guess you're wrong, and {{it might}} be a good deal more serious than whisky-running. One night a man crawled up to your {{homestead}} through the snow, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> him in." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You're {{the kind}} of girl I admire," [...] he declared. [...] "I've been {{watching}} you--more than you have any idea of. You're adaptable.

6000|$|... "I'll {{take this}} street, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> that," [...] said Andy, {{as they came}} to a corner. [...] "Go around the block, and then take the next block. In that way we may find a store quicker. There is no use for both of us to go over the same ground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Carnally {{corrected}} {{him with}} a smile.

6000|$|... "It is all one," [...] she returned, [...] "for {{at least}} it was done with your sanction, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> a share in that cruel sport, instead of {{restraining}} it, as was clearly your duty. It is upon you, the captain, that the responsibility rests." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} looking for you everywhere, captain," [...] said he. [...] "What have you been after?
