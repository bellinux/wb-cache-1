5|$|During the Second World War, Britain {{commenced}} {{a nuclear}} weapons project, known as Tube Alloys, but the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged it with the American Manhattan Project. Several key British scientists worked {{as part of the}} British contribution to the Manhattan Project, but after the war the Americans ended cooperation on nuclear weapons. In January 1947, a cabinet sub-committee decided, in response to an apprehension of American isolationism <b>and</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> Britain losing its great power status, to resume British efforts to build nuclear weapons. The project was called High Explosive Research, and was directed by Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, with William Penney in charge of bomb design.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, <b>and</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E
5|$|Interest in Banak {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 <b>and</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway. Finnmark, {{located on the}} Norway–Soviet Union border, became of particular interest for the military. Although specific plans were articulated, no construction of an airbase was carried out. However, Norway's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak. Finnmark {{was regarded as a}} tripwire and was to be sacrificed in case of a Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, consisting of a short section of unmaintained wooden runway and the rest a grass strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} was to investigate the relationship between worry, intolerance <b>of</b> uncertainty, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> anxiety in a community sample of adolescents. Study 1 examined the association between adolescent worry, intolerance <b>of</b> uncertainty, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> anxiety (N = 258). The results showed that intolerance <b>of</b> uncertainty <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> anxiety were strongly, uniquely, and specifically related to adolescent worry above and beyond shared variance with gender, depression, and trait anxiety. The interaction between intolerance <b>of</b> uncertainty <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> anxiety did not significantly predict worry above their separate and unique effects. Study 2 sought to delineate the normative adolescent trajectories of worry, intolerance <b>of</b> uncertainty, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> anxiety over time, and explored the longitudinal nature of the associations between worry and intolerance of uncertainty, and between worry <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> anxiety (N = 338). Data were collected from each participant twice a year for five years. The findings revealed modest, concave upward (i. e. U-shaped) trajectories for adolescent worry, intolerance <b>of</b> uncertainty, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> anxiety over the 10 assessment points. Gender differences in these trajectories were observed, with girls reporting more worry <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> anxiety than boys across the study period. Unexpectedly, intolerance of uncertainty increased between the midpoint and endpoint of the study for girls, but not for boys. Support was found for a bidirectional and reciprocal relationship between adolescent worry and intolerance of uncertainty, with change in one partially mediating change in the other, even when controlling for depression and trait anxiety. Conversely, adolescent worry <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> anxiety showed a predominantly unidirectional relationship, with change in worry showing a stronger mediational effect on change in <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> anxiety than vice versa, a result which remained once the variance with depression and trait anxiety was partialled out. Overall, the findings highlight the important role of cognitive processes, such as intolerance <b>of</b> uncertainty <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> anxiety, in our understanding of adolescent worry. These findings have important implications for our understanding of worry during this critical period of development...|$|R

5|$|Many Portuguese colonials {{were not}} typical {{settlers}} in Mozambique. While most European communities in Africa {{at the time}} - {{with the possible exception}} of Afrikaners - were established from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, some white families and institutions in those territories still administered by Portugal had been entrenched for generations. Loss of their privileged status <b>and</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> FRELIMO reprisal resulted in an exodus of up to 200,000 white civilians at independence (in Europe they were popularly known as retornados). Cities, towns and villages saw their Portuguese names changed after independence - Lourenço Marques to Maputo, Vila Pery to Chimoio, Vila Cabral to Lichinga, or Vila Junqueiro to Gurúè.|$|E
5|$|The Presbyterian {{majority}} {{was quickly}} {{demonstrated by the}} election of their candidate the Duke of Hamilton as President of the Convention. On 12th March, James landed in Ireland and on 16th March, his Letter to the Convention was read out, demanding obedience and threatening punishment {{for those who did}} not comply. Public anger at the Letter's uncompromising tone meant some Episcopalians stopped attending the Convention, claiming to fear for their safety while others changed sides. Tensions were high, with Edinburgh Castle held by the Duke of Gordon, Dundee recruiting Highland levies for James <b>and</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> an Irish invasion. These factors exaggerated the Presbyterian majority in the Convention which now met behind closed doors guarded by its own troops.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{international}} border is firmly established and peaceful; {{there is a}} greater sense of Canadian nationality, <b>and</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> U.S. Manifest Destiny have all but disappeared. Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing up and down the valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E
40|$|Results of {{previous}} studies have demonstrated the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> success (FOS). Originally {{thought to be a}} gender-related construct pertaining to women, studies have also found FOS was experienced by men, sometimes even more so than by women. Recent researchers have attributed FOS more to the Bem Sex Role for individuals who are traditional feminine or undifferentiated than fo: traditional masculine or androgynous individuals. This study examiLea <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> success among community college students (N= 160), including 98 female and 62 male students. The community college serves a predominantly rural area. Four instruments were used: <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> Success Scale; Bem Sex Role Inventory, Short Form; Personal Attributes Inventory; and a demographic sheet. The results of the study appeared to support these generalizations: (1) females have more <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> success than males; (2) there is no association between Bem Sex Role <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> success; (3) there is no association between self-esteem <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> success; (4) there is no association between age <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> success; (5) there is no association between college classification <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> success; (6) there is no association between grade point average <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> success; <b>and</b> (7) there is no association between family structure <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> success.

40|$|Background: The goal of {{the current}} {{study was to examine the}} {{relation}} between attachment <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> terrorism. Furthermore, the study examined for a moderating effect of education level. Method: 207 Dutch participants aged 18 years and older completed a self-report questionnaire including attachment style and anxiety questions. Results: Results showed that a high score on preoccupied and avoidant attachment styles can be seen as predictors for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> terrorism. People who had a high score on the preoccupied attachment style are more fearful. However, people who had a high score on the avoidant attachment style are less fearful. There was a moderating effect of education level on the relation between secure attachment <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> terrorism. The mutual relation between the secure attachment style and education level was stronger for highly educated people. Conclusion: There is a relation between insecure attachment <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> terrorism.

40|$|Anxiety, as an {{important}} affective variable, {{has been found to}} be a significant factor adversely affecting language learning (Aydin 2008).   Many studies have explored sources and causes of anxiety among learners (Young, 1991; Tanveer, 2007; Aydin 2008; Williams& Andrade, 2008). However, to date little, if any, studies have examined levels and sources of anxiety and its relationship with <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> negative evaluation. To this end, the present study has been conducted in Iranian context. Data were gathered through administering two scales. Foreign language anxiety classroom scale (FLACS) <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> negative evaluation (FNE) scale were administered to a sample of 61 EFL learners. To analyze data, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, i. e. independent sample t-test, were run. Descriptive analysis indicated that participants suffer from language anxiety <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> negative evaluation. The result of independent sample t-test showed there was no significant difference between males and females in the levels of anxiety.
