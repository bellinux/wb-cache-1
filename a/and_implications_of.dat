5|$|Philosophy {{of science}} is a {{sub-field}} of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and truth.|$|E
5|$|Complementing his {{interest}} in the foundations of general relativity and, more generally, of physics, Ehlers researched the history of physics. Up until his death, he collaborated in a project on the history of quantum theory at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928. Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in the philosophical foundations <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as the basic status of scientific knowledge in physics.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} years at the White House, when Roosevelt was {{increasingly}} overworked, his daughter Anna Roosevelt Boettiger had moved in to provide her father companionship and support. Anna had also arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress, the now widowed Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd. A close friend of both Roosevelt and Mercer who was present, Elizabeth Shoumatoff, rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> infidelity. When Eleanor heard about her husband's death, she was also faced {{with the news that}} Anna had been arranging these meetings with Mercer and that Mercer had been with Franklin when he died.|$|E

25|$|The {{philosophy}} of mathematics is {{the branch of}} philosophy that studies the assumptions, foundations, <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> mathematics, and purports to provide a viewpoint {{of the nature and}} methodology of mathematics, and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives. The logical and structural nature of mathematics itself makes this study both broad and unique among its philosophical counterparts.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the {{government}} of Yucatán produced a handbook and DVD about the risks <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The guide told immigrants where to find health care, how to get their kids into U.S. schools, and how to send money home. Officials in Yucatán said the guide is a necessity to save lives but some American groups accused {{the government}} of encouraging illegal immigration.|$|E

The general purpose of this meeting was to provide facts in place of rumors so that every involved party could be properly informed.|$|E
25|$|The main {{evidence}} used by {{the prosecution}} in the trial were over thirty years of poetry and prose written by Su Shi. This was collected from many of his associates, and printed editions from the market place were also considered. The analysis as to the meanings <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> Su Shi's writings was not clear-cut, {{in terms of whether}} they were actually treasonous, or whether they were in the bounds of acceptable expression. Much of Su Shi's testimony revolved around these points, and what was said versus what he intended to imply, a matter much open to interpretation, much of it of an erudite nature, involving scholarly allusions, often obscure, dating back over a millennium and more of a continuous literary tradition.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Giddens {{delivered}} the BBC Reith Lectures {{on the subject}} of ‘Runaway World’, subsequently published as a book of that title. The aim was to introduce the concept <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> globalisation to a lay audience. He was the first Reith Lecturer to deliver the lectures in different places around the world; and the first to respond directly to e-mails that came in while he was speaking. The lectures were delivered in London, Washington, New Delhi and Hong Kong and responded to by local audiences. Giddens received the Asturias Prize for the social sciences in 2002. The award has been labelled ‘the Spanish Nobel Prize’, but stretches well beyond the sphere of science. Other recipients of the Prize that year included Woody Allen, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web and conductor Daniel Barenboim.|$|E

500|$|Bacon {{tended to}} draw images in series, and the Odessa nurse [...] become an obsessive motif for him. According to Peppiatt, [...] "it {{would be no}} exaggeration to say that, if one could really explain the origins <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> this scream, one would be far closer to {{understanding}} the whole art of Francis Bacon". Gilles Deleuze wrote that, in Bacon's screams, [...] "the entire body escapes through the mouth".|$|E

500|$|Although {{much of what}} Hutchinson {{wrote in}} the letters was not {{particularly}} new, Samuel Adams masterfully manipulated the contents <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> some of the statements by Hutchinson and Oliver to suggest they were conspiring with officials in London to deprive the colonists of their rights. [...] Hutchinson was defended in print by provincial attorney general Jonathan Sewall, who claimed that Hutchinson was not actually expressing desired changes {{in the state of}} affairs, but ruminating instead on possible consequences of present conditions.|$|E

[...] According to the Union of Concerned Scientists in 2015, the primer was: [...] "remarkable for indisputably showing that, while some fossil fuel companies’ deception about climate science has continued to the present day, at least two decades ago the companies’ own scientific experts were internally alerting them about the realities <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> climate change." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} months of 1610, Galileo Galilei—using his {{powerful}} new telescope—discovered four satellites orbiting Jupiter. Upon publishing his account as Sidereus Nuncius , Galileo sought the opinion of Kepler, in part to bolster the credibility of his observations. Kepler responded enthusiastically with a short published reply, Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo [...] He endorsed Galileo's observations and offered a range of speculations about the meaning <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> Galileo's discoveries and telescopic methods, for astronomy and optics as well as cosmology and astrology. Later that year, Kepler published his own telescopic observations of the moons in Narratio de Jovis Satellitibus, providing further support of Galileo. To Kepler's disappointment, however, Galileo never published his reactions (if any) to Astronomia Nova.|$|E
500|$|Philosophy of {{mathematics}} {{is concerned with}} the philosophical foundations <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> mathematics. The central questions are whether numbers, triangles, and other mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind and {{what is the nature of}} mathematical propositions. Is asking whether [...] "1+1=2" [...] is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was calculus invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires experience or reason alone. What does it mean to prove a mathematical theorem and how does one know whether a mathematical proof is correct? Philosophers {{of mathematics}} also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and logic, human capabilities such as intuition, and the material universe.|$|E
