5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.|$|E

As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} test-taking motivation in L 2 listening testing context by applying Expectancy-Value Theory as the framework. Specifically, {{this study was}} intended to examine the complex relationships among expectancy, importance, interest, listening anxiety, <b>listening</b> metacognitive awareness, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> test score using data from a large-scale and high-stakes language test among Chinese first-year undergraduates. Structural equation modeling {{was used to examine}} the mediating effect of listening metacognitive awareness on the relationship between expectancy, importance, interest, <b>listening</b> anxiety, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> test score. According to the results, test takers’ listening scores can be predicted by expectancy, interest, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> anxiety significantly. The relationship between expectancy, interest, <b>listening</b> anxiety, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> test score was mediated by listening metacognitive awareness.

5|$|Night Trap is an {{interactive}} movie video game developed by Digital Pictures and originally released by Sega for the Sega CD in 1992.

The player watches live surveillance footage of the house and triggers traps to capture anyone seen endangering the girls.

In this research, the correlational method was used and it was carried out in October to November 2014 at SMA Muhammadiyah 1 Surakarta. The population was science class of the eleventh grade students of SMA Muhammadiyah 1 Surakartain Academic Year 2014 / 2015, which consisted of three classes. The number of population was 73 students and this research took 30 students as the sample by cluster random sampling. A questionnaire was used to collect the data of students’learning motivation, whilean objective test was used to collect the data of vocabulary mastery <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension. Single <b>and</b> Multiple Linear Regression and Correlation were used to analyze the data. The result of the analysis shows that (1) there is a positive correlation between students’ learning motivation <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension (to= 2. 5); (2) there is a positive correlation between vocabulary mastery <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension(to= 2. 14); and (3) there is a positive correlation between students’ learning motivation, vocabulary mastery simultaneously, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension(Fo= 3. 54).

5|$|The Casbah Coffee Club was a {{rock and}} roll music venue in West Derby, Liverpool, England started by Mona Best in 1959 in the cellar of the family home. The Casbah, as it became widely known, was planned as a members-only club for Best's sons Pete, his younger brother, Rory, and their friends. Mona {{came up with the}} idea of the club after {{watching}} a TV report about The 2i's Coffee Bar in London's Soho where several singers had been discovered.

5|$|The {{wide variety}} of musical performances, {{whether or not they}} are artificially amplified (6, 7, 9, 10), all provide {{entertainment}} irrespective of whether the performance is from soloists (6), choral (2) or orchestral groups (5, 8), or ensemble (3). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation (5, 8). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate (7, 9). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> privately (10).|$|E
5|$|The {{golden jackal}} often hunts alone, and {{sometimes}} in pairs, but rarely hunts in a pack. When hunting alone, it trots around an area and occasionally stops to sniff <b>and</b> <b>listen.</b> Once prey is located, the jackal conceals itself, quickly approaches its prey and then pounces on it. Single jackals hunt rodents, hares, and birds. They hunt rodents in grass by locating them with their hearing before leaping {{into the air and}} pouncing on them. In India, they can dig Indian gerbils out from their burrows, and they can hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates up to 4–5 times their body weight. Jackals search for hiding blackbuck calves throughout the day during the calving period. The peak times for their searches are the early morning and the late evening. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides of narrow rivers or streams and drive their prey from one jackal to another.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the major}} record {{companies}} dominate the American music industry, an independent music industry (indie music) does exist. Most indie record labels have limited, if any, retail distribution outside a small region. Artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim {{to be signed}} to a major label; others choose to remain at an indie label for their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual, or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release {{some or all of}} their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download <b>and</b> <b>listen.</b> In addition to recording artists of many kinds, there are numerous fields of professional musicianship in the United States, many of whom rarely record, including community orchestras, wedding singers and bands, lounge singers, and nightclub DJs. The American Federation of Musicians is the largest American labor union for professional musicians. However, only 15% of the Federation's members have steady music employment.|$|E

Fletcher decides they should immediately report this incident, which further confuses Scully. She goes to Mulder’s apartment (where Fletcher is having a tryst with Kersh's assistant) and tells Fletcher that they traced the telephone call to a pay phone near Area 51 and she suspects it is Mulder's informant. Fletcher is indifferent to this news and Scully yells at him, sensing that his behavior is very strange and his lack {{of concern for the}} X-Files is completely out of character. Scully decides to investigate, and drives through the desert towards Area 51. She stops at a burned out gas station and finds a penny and a dime merged. Later, when Scully arrives at Fletcher's house, Mulder tries desperately to convince Scully that he is really Mulder. Scully remains skeptical and thinks that any information Mulder describes could be obtained in other ways. Mulder tells Scully that he will bring proof of the defect of the UFO and the resultant problems that night, but Fletcher, having eavesdropped on the conversation, calls his old office posing as Mulder to inform them of the source of the leak—Mulder posing as Fletcher. Military police arrive at the appointed hour, and Mulder is dragged away, kicking and screaming, desperately trying to convince Scully. Mulder asks if he would turn in an informant to the authorities in this manner as he is carried away, and Scully begins to realize that Mulder may be telling the truth.|$|E
