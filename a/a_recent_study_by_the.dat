25|$|Statistics for German World War II {{military}} casualties are divergent and contradictory. The wartime military casualty figures {{compiled by}} German High Command, up until January 31, 1945, are often cited by military historians when covering individual campaigns in the war. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German historian Rüdiger Overmans {{found that the}} German High Command statistics are not reliable, he estimated German military dead at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders, in Austria, and in east-central Europe. However the German government still maintains that its records list 4.3 million dead and missing military personnel. Civilian deaths during the war include air raid deaths, estimates of German civilians killed only by Allied strategic bombing have ranged from around 350,000 to 500,000.|$|E
25|$|Māori suffer more health problems, {{including}} {{higher levels}} of alcohol and drug abuse, smoking and obesity. Less frequent use of healthcare services mean that late diagnosis and treatment intervention lead to {{higher levels of}} morbidity and mortality in many manageable conditions, such as cervical cancer, diabetes per head of population than non-Māori. Although Māori life expectancy rates have increased dramatically in the last 50 years, they still have considerably lower life-expectancies compared to New Zealanders of European ancestry: in 2004, Māori males lived 69.0 years vs. non-Māori males 77.2 years; Māori females 73.2 yrs vs. non-Māori females 81.9 years. This gap had narrowed by 2013: 72.8 years for men and 76.5 years for women, compared to 80.2 years for non-Māori men and 83.7 years for non-Māori women. Also, <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse showed that Māori women and children are more likely to experience domestic violence than any other ethnic group.|$|E
500|$|During Stalinism, the {{preferred}} Soviet policy {{was to keep}} sensitive posts {{in the hands of}} non-Poles. As a result, [...] "all or nearly all of the directors (of the widely despised Ministry of Public Security of Poland) were Jewish" [...] as noted by Polish journalist Teresa Torańska among others. [...] <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Polish Institute of National Remembrance showed that out of 450 people in director positions in the Ministry between 1944 and 1954, 167 (37.1%) were of Jewish ethnicity, while Jews made up only 1% of the post-war Polish population. While Jews were overrepresented in various Polish communist organizations, including the security apparatus, relative to their percentage of the general population, the vast majority of Jews did not participate in the Stalinist apparatus, and indeed most were not supportive of communism. Krzysztof Szwagrzyk has quoted Jan T. Gross, who argued that many Jews who worked for the communist party cut their ties with their culture – Jewish, Polish or Russian – and tried to represent the interests of international communism only, or at least that of the local communist government. It is difficult to assess when the Polish Jews who had volunteered to serve or remain in the postwar communist security forces began to realize, however, what Soviet Jews had realized earlier, that under Stalin, as Arkady Vaksberg put it: [...] "if someone named Rabinovich was in charge of a mass execution, he was perceived not simply as a Cheka boss but as a Jew..." ...|$|E

In the WHO study, the prevalence of HIV-HCV co-infection was markedly higher at 82.4% in those who injected drugs compared to the general population (2.4%). In a study of HIV-HCV co-infection among HIV positive {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM), the overall prevalence of anti-hepatitis C antibodies was estimated to be 8.1% and increased to 40% among HIV positive MSM who also injected drugs.|$|E
