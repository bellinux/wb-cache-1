It is hypothesised that workers with egalitarian and collectivist cultural <b>attitudes</b> {{will be more likely}} to have pro-union <b>attitudes</b> than other workers, although if the impact of cultural <b>attitudes</b> is mediated by history and institutions, it might be expected that this relationship is stronger for British than Indian workers. Conversely, if union <b>attitudes</b> are largely a function of the call centre labour process, we would expect union <b>attitudes</b> to be similar among workers in both countries. Our results only partially support our hypotheses. Collectivist <b>attitudes</b> are only weakly related to union <b>attitudes</b> among the British sample but are more strongly related in the Indian sample. There are significant differences between union <b>attitudes</b> among our British and Indian samples. The article concludes that relationship between cultural <b>attitudes</b> and union <b>attitudes</b> are heavily dependent on institutional context.

Many researchers in information systems have studied user <b>attitudes</b> toward technology, and such <b>attitudes</b> have in fact {{been one of the most}} frequently studied phenomena in the IS field. User <b>attitudes</b> have generally been measured utilizing bipolar scales, on which the low end represents strong negative <b>attitudes</b> and the high end represents strong positive <b>attitudes.</b> However, psychologists have long recognized that the positive and negative dimensions of <b>attitudes</b> can be separated, and <b>attitudes</b> are thus bivariate. In the present research, we investigate whether the positive and negative aspects of user <b>attitudes</b> are separable using constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model, one of the most frequently tested models in information systems research.

40|$|Despite much {{research}} into vegetarianism, the psychological relationship between eating meat and evaluating animals remains relatively neglected. Through focus groups, questionnaires and experiments, {{this study investigated}} whether people experienced psychological inconsistency in this relationship and, if so, how they handled that inconsistency. Unlike vegetarians' <b>attitudes,</b> the content of meat-eaters' <b>attitudes</b> towards eating meat rarely included animals. Meat-eaters' positive <b>attitudes</b> towards eating meat were consistent with their eating behaviour; however, their <b>attitudes</b> towards farm animals were more positive than their <b>attitudes</b> towards eating meat. It therefore depends upon which <b>attitudes</b> are salient {{at any given time}} to determine whether psychological consistency is maximised overall. By focusing on the relationship between their own genuinely-held <b>attitudes</b> towards farm animals, animals' slaughter, and eating meat, meat-eaters' cognitive dissonance increased. Their <b>attitudes</b> towards eating meat were expected to become more positive in order to restore consonance between their <b>attitudes</b> and eating behaviour. However, meat-eaters' <b>attitudes</b> towards eating meat became less positive and their <b>attitudes</b> towards animals' slaughter became more negative. In contrast, their <b>attitudes</b> towards farm animals resisted change. Therefore meat-eaters' <b>attitudes</b> towards farm animals became relatively even more positive than their <b>attitudes</b> towards eating meat and animals' slaughter. Hence, the <b>attitudes</b> stimulated by this research, in an environment which prevented psychological denial strategies, caused (a) meat eaters' <b>attitudes</b> to become more inconsistent with their behaviour and (b) the consequent lack of consonance restoration. This study both helps to understand the empirical relationship between eating meat and evaluating animals and extends cognitive dissonance theory's explanatory power to real-world complex phenomena...|$|R

Unlike Shōnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an <b>attitude</b> which possibly impressed Michinaga.

The explicit and implicit <b>attitudes</b> of Muslims were more negative than the <b>attitudes</b> of Atheists. Explicit <b>attitudes</b> were more negative towards gay men than lesbians; implicit <b>attitudes</b> were negative towards gay men but were unexpectedly positive towards lesbians.
