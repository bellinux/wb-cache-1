25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the <b>applied</b> <b>torque.</b> Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{principal}} axis frame (which is rotating in absolute space), the angular momentum vector is not conserved {{even in the}} absence of <b>applied</b> <b>torques,</b> but varies as described by Euler's equations. However, in the absence of <b>applied</b> <b>torques,</b> the magnitude [...] of the angular momentum and the kinetic energy [...] are both conserved ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{moment of}} inertia of a {{rotating}} flywheel is used in a machine to resist variations in <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> to smooth its rotational output. [...] The {{moment of inertia}} of an airplane about its longitudinal, horizontal and vertical axis determines how steering forces on the control surfaces of its wings, elevators and tail affect the plane in roll, pitch and yaw.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, a bolt is {{tensioned}} (preloaded) by {{the application}} of a torque to either the bolt head or the nut. The <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> causes the bolt to [...] "climb" [...] the thread causing a tensioning of the bolt and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by the bolt. The preload developed in a bolt is due to the <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> and {{is a function of the}} bolt diameter, the geometry of the threads, and the coefficients of friction that exist in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut. The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness of the bolt and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of the bolt when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, a {{rotational}} analog of Newton's Second law of Motion might be, [...] "A {{change in}} angular momentum {{is proportional to}} the <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> and occurs about the same axis as that torque." [...] Since a torque applied over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum, then if torque is zero, angular momentum is constant. As above, a system with constant angular momentum is a closed system. Therefore, requiring the system to be closed is equivalent to requiring that no external influence, {{in the form of a}} torque, acts upon it.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{focus of}} the B7 RS 4 was on the {{introduction}} of the latest development of Audi's 'trademark' quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. [...] This utilised the 'third generation' asymmetric/dynamic Torsen T-3 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre differential, featuring a 'default' 40:60 front-to-rear torque split under normal conditions. [...] Audi stressed that this would result in a more neutral response in corners, and a more dynamic driving experience. [...] Also, a more aggressive Torque Bias Ratio (TBR) was used, and set to 4:1, as opposed to 2:1 (and later variants 3:1 TBR) on standard A4. [...] That means that one side of the differential can handle up to 80%, while the other side would have to only handle 20% of <b>applied</b> <b>torque.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A body's {{center of}} gravity is the point around which the {{resultant}} torque due to gravity forces vanishes. Where a gravity field can {{be considered to be}} uniform, the mass-center and the center-of-gravity will be the same. [...] However, for satellites in orbit around a planet, in the absence of other torques being applied to a satellite, the slight variation (gradient) in gravitational field between closer-to (stronger) and further-from (weaker) the planet can lead to a torque that will tend to align the satellite such that its long axis is vertical. [...] In such a case, it is important to make the distinction between the center-of-gravity and the mass-center. [...] Any horizontal offset between the two will result in an <b>applied</b> <b>torque.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rolling {{resistance}} greatly {{increases with}} <b>applied</b> <b>torque.</b> At high torques, which apply a tangential {{force to the}} road of about half {{the weight of the}} vehicle, the rolling resistance may triple (a 200% increase). This is in part due to a slip of about 5%. The rolling resistance increase with <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> is not linear, but increases at a faster rate as the torque becomes higher.|$|E

50|$|The Torsen {{differential}} {{works just}} like a conventional differential, but can lock up if a torque imbalance occurs, the maximum ratio of torque imbalance being defined by the Torque Bias Ratio (TBR). When a Torsen has a 3:1 TBR, that means that {{one side of the}} differential can handle up to 75% while the other side would have to only handle 25% of <b>applied</b> <b>torque.</b> During acceleration under asymmetric traction conditions, so long as the higher traction side can handle the higher percentage of <b>applied</b> <b>torque,</b> no relative wheelspin will occur. When the traction difference exceeds the TBR, the slower output side of the differential receives the tractive torque of the faster wheel multiplied by the TBR; any extra torque remaining from <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> contributes to the angular acceleration of the faster output side of the differential.|$|E

5000|$|The torsion wrench {{is always}} needed when picking a pin/tumbler or wafer lock, {{even with the}} use of a pick gun.
