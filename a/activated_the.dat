5|$|Later that year, Rindt drove, {{again in}} a Ferrari 250LM, at the 500 {{kilometre}} race at Zeltweg. He was able to win ahead of the better powered Ferrari of Mike Parkes owing to a special lever that manually <b>activated</b> <b>the</b> brake lights. Using the tool shortly before his actual braking point, Rindt was able to force Parkes to brake earlier than him which allowed him to stay ahead.|$|E

5|$|Governor Rick Perry <b>activated</b> <b>the</b> National Guard and mobilized {{emergency}} {{personnel to}} the region expected {{to be affected by}} the storm. Erin was expected to bring flooding {{to the region}}, which had already been declared a disaster area on August 7, 2007 due to widespread flooding on the Nueces River basin; this area remained flooded as of August 15, 2007. On August 15, oil futures rose to $74.01 (USD), due to fears of Erin disrupting oil supplies produced on Texan coasts, combined with low oil inventories. As a result of the threat from the storm, Shell Oil Company evacuated 188workers on oil platforms in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, biologically active hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were {{isolated}} from tobacco which <b>activated</b> <b>the</b> production of protease inhibitors {{in a similar}} way to systemin in tomatoes. Although they are structurally unrelated to systemins, their similar function resulted in them being named hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys). Following the initial discovery other HypSys peptides were found in tomato, Petunia and black nightshade. In 2007, HypSys were found outside the Solanaceae, in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and coffee (Coffea canephora). Systemins are highly conserved between species, whereas HypSys are more divergent but all contain a conserved proline or hydroxyproline-rich central domain.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the flooding in St. John's, Newfoundland, the city mayor <b>activated</b> <b>the</b> city's Emergency Preparedness Program. On September 27, {{about a week after}} the passage of the storm, the Emergency Measures Organization began accepting applications for flood-related damage. By about a month after the storm, 169 applications were processed, with an additional 1,762 received by the Emergency Measures Organization. Eligibility for the disaster assistance included restoration to property or household items of an essential nature. A few days after the passage of the storm, the government of Newfoundland appealed to the federal government for federal disaster relief fund; the government later approved. Ultimately, disaster relief assistance totaled $6.3million (2001 CAD), primarily to individual assistance.|$|E

40|$|Background Telephone-CPR (T-CPR) can {{increase}} rate of bystander CPR {{as well as}} CPR quality. Instructions for T-CPR were developed when most callers used a land line. Telephones today are often wireless and {{can be brought to}} the patient. They often have speaker function which further allows the rescuer to receive instructions while performing CPR. We wanted to measure adult lay peopleâ€™s ability to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> speaker function on their own mobile phone. Methods Elderly lay people, previously trained in CPR, were contacted by telephone. Participants with speaker function experience were asked to activate this without further instructions, while participants with no experience were given instructions on how to activate it. Participants were divided in three groups; Group 1 : Can <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> speaker function without instruction, Group 2 : Can <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> speaker function with instruction, and Group 3 : Unable to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> speaker function. Time to activation for group 1 and 2 was compared using Mann-Whitney U-test. Results Seventy-two elderly lay people, mean age 68 [*]Â±[*] 6 years participated in the study. Thirty-five (35) % of the participants were able to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> speaker function without instructions, 29 % with instructions and 36 % were unable to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> speaker function. The median time to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> speaker function was 8 s and 93 s, with and without instructions, respectively (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). Conclusion One-third of <b>the</b> elderly could <b>activate</b> speaker function quickly, and two-third either used a long time or could not <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> function...|$|R
