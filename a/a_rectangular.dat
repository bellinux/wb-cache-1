5|$|Directional {{anisotropy}} {{refers to}} a difference in diffusion mechanism or rate in a particular direction on a given crystallographic plane. These differences may {{be a result of}} either anisotropy in the surface lattice (e.g. <b>a</b> <b>rectangular</b> lattice) or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the more dramatic examples of directional anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E
5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the udema carried 14 to 18 {{pairs of}} oars. Rowers {{sat on the}} weather deck {{on either side of}} the main armament with the oar ports placed on <b>a</b> <b>rectangular</b> outrigger which improved their leverage. However, they were positioned {{on either side of the}} centerline battery and could not row under fire; in action, the udema had to rely on its sails for propulsion.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic design}} of the {{national}} flag of Belarus was first described in Presidential Decree No.214 of June 7, 1995.
