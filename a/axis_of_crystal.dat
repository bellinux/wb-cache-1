40|$|The {{structure}} and orientation of radio frequency sputtered lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) films on silicon substrates is determined using x-ray diffraction. The {{structure of the}} LiNbO 3 films is determined {{to be a strong}} function of the substrate temperature. The preferred crystal orientation of the film is found to depend on the substrate orientation. Of particular importance is the observation of LiNbO 3 polycrystalline films oriented with the c axis of the crystallites normal to the surface of 〈 111 〉 silicon substrates. This result is important since the ferroelectric polarization and photocurrents are directed along the c <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystal,</b> making the development of ferroelectric memory devices using LiNbO 3 possible. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the films were generally smooth, and no ferroelectric domain contrast was observed. Ellipsometry was used to determine the refractive indices and thicknesses of the films...|$|E

The {{inner tube}} layer of Pomatoceros americanus has a complex {{oriented}} ultrastructure, which cannot {{be explained by}} the standard granular secretion model, predicting a largely unoriented structure of the tube. In the lamello-fibrillar structure of the inner tube layer, the crystallization <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystals</b> has a uniform orientation, which is not continuous through successive growth increments. The complex biomineral structures of P. americanus suggest a matrix-controlled crystallization model rather than solidification of a slurry with calcareous granules deposited on the tube aperture...|$|R
30|$|For {{the effect}} of Δχ, {{paramagnetic}} anisotropy ΔχPARA is a dominant factor compared to diamagnetic anisotropy ΔχDIA {{for most of the}} natural oxides. The origin of ΔχDIA was attributed to preferential orientation of bond direction with respect to a magnetic principle <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystal</b> (Uyeda, 2004 a). Accordingly, the ΔχDIA of various silicates was expected to distribute in a range between 10 - 8 and 10 - 10 emu/g. In contrast, ΔχPARA is derived from the anisotropy of the local crystalline field of a site that is occupied by an isolated paramagnetic ion (Ballet and Coey, 1982). Hence, ΔχPARA is proportional to the concentration of the paramagnetic ion; it reaches a level of 10 - 5 emu/g when the concentration of Fe 2 + is about 1 mol%. Such concentrations of Fe 2 + are often observed in major rockforming minerals. The effect of paramagnetic Fe 2 + ions in reducing in Bs at room temperature was specifically observed for biotite grains, which is a typical sheet-silicate (Uyeda et al., 2005 a). The value of Bs was found to be as low as 220 Oe for biotite, which had a susceptibility of χPARA = 4.4 × 10 - 5 emu/g. This Bs was less than 1 % of the Bs value observed for synthetic phlogopite that was free of paramagnetic ions, whereas the Bs was 6.2 kOe for phlogopite with PARA = 1.2 × 10 - 6 emu/g. The concentration of Fe+ 2 is proportional to χPARA in the above three minerals. As almost equivalent crystal structures are reported for these minerals, they should have similar amounts of (Δχ)DIA. Hence, the large variation of Bs observed between the three materials {{can be attributed to the}} difference in the paramagnetic (Δχ)PARA.|$|E

30|$|In a total-body PET (TB-PET), {{depth of}} {{interaction}} (DOI) {{capability of the}} detector module is not very important because few gamma rays arrive at large angle relative to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crystals</b> pixels.
