5|$|Among {{his most}} {{prevalent}} skills are his speed <b>and</b> <b>wrist</b> shot, {{the latter of}} which has improved alongside his recent years of increased offensive production. He is also proficient at taking faceoffs. On the penalty kill, he is an efficient shot blocker, using his body {{to get in the}} way of pucks. While competing on the powerplay, he often uses his size and strength to maintain position in front of the opposing net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots.|$|E
5|$|Regehr {{struggled}} in 2001–02, finishing {{with a team}} worst −24 plus/minus while occasionally being {{left out of the}} lineup as a healthy scratch. Unhappy with his season, he focused on improving his game. He overcame rib, abdominal <b>and</b> <b>wrist</b> injuries in 2002–03 to establish himself as a top defender with the team and earned a second Masterton Trophy nomination for his dedication. The Flames rewarded him with a five-year contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. They also named him an alternate captain, a position he continuously held for the remainder of his stay in Calgary.|$|E

Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E

5|$|Upon turning {{professional}} in 1950–51, Armstrong {{was assigned to}} Toronto's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Pittsburgh Hornets. In 71 games for Pittsburgh, he recorded 15 goals and 48 points. Despite being hampered by hand <b>and</b> <b>wrist</b> injuries suffered in fights, Armstrong was the AHL's leading goal scorer and stood second in points by mid-season in 1951–52. He was recalled to Toronto during the season and scored his first NHL goal, against goaltender Gerry McNeil of the Montreal Canadiens. It was the first goal ever scored by a player with Native heritage. He finished the season with three goals and three assists in 20 games with Toronto.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack {{and see how they}} would act to defend the ship. Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played with wooden sticks with wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye <b>and</b> <b>wrist.</b> Many of the crew became very expert.|$|E
5|$|Tiktaalik {{generally}} had {{the characteristics}} of a lobe-finned fish, but with front fins featuring arm-like skeletal structures more akin to those of a crocodile, including a shoulder, elbow, <b>and</b> <b>wrist.</b> The fossil discovered in 2004 did not include the rear fins and tail. It had rows of sharp teeth indicative of a predator fish, and its neck could move independently of its body, which is not common in other fish (Tarrasius, Mandageria, placoderms, and extant seahorses being some exceptions; see also Lepidogalaxias and Channallabes apus). The animal had a flat skull resembling a crocodile's; eyes on top of its head, suggesting that it {{spent a lot of time}} looking up; a neck and ribs similar to those of tetrapods, with the ribs being used to support its body and aid in breathing via lungs; well developed jaws suitable for catching prey; and a small gill slit called a spiracle that, in more derived animals, became an ear.|$|E
40|$|Radiographs of {{the hands}} <b>and</b> <b>wrists</b> <b>and</b> {{cervical}} spine of 4415 residents of Tecumseh, Michigan, aged 16 yr and over, have been reviewed. Evidence of rheumatoid arthritis was observed in the hands <b>and</b> <b>wrists</b> of 0. 19 per cent of males and 0. 34 per cent of females. The prevalence of cervical spine changes, which {{could be attributed to}} rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis, was insignificant. Degenerative changes in both examined regions occurred much more frequently and showed a marked positive correlation with advancing age. Radiographic evidence of osteoarthrosis {{of the hands}} <b>and</b> <b>wrists</b> was observed in 19. 5 per cent of males and 23 per cent of females. In the cervical spine, degenerative disc disease (16 - 19 per cent) was noted somewhat more frequently than osteoarthrosis (11 per cent). Among the other radiographic lesions which were observed, those of post traumatic changes, including amputation of digits, in the hands <b>and</b> <b>wrists</b> <b>and</b> fusion of cervical vertebral bodies, thought to represent a failure of segmentation in embryonic life, were most frequent...|$|R

5|$|While in transit, as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} in training camps in the United Kingdom, the 1st Division was diverted to Egypt with the intention that it would complete its training there before moving to the Western Front at a later date. The decision by the Allies to force a passage through the Dardanelles interrupted this process, as the 1st Division was allocated {{to take part in the}} Gallipoli Campaign. During the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, Bennett fought on the southern flank of the Anzac beachhead. He led 300 men of his battalion to an advanced position on Pine Ridge, south of Lone Pine. While directing the defence of this position, Bennett was wounded in the shoulder <b>and</b> <b>wrist</b> and forced to retire to the beach for treatment. When the Turkish forces counter-attacked in the evening, the 6th Battalion force on Pine Ridge was isolated and killed to the last man, including Bennett's younger brother, Godfrey. Instead of accepting evacuation on a hospital ship, after having his wounds treated, Bennett returned to his battalion.|$|E
5|$|With {{training}} camp starting on January 13, 2013, Vancouver recalled 12 {{players from the}} Wolves. They also bolstered their defence corp by signing NHL veterans Jim Vandermeer and Cam Barker to one-year contracts. At the forward position, the Canucks were dealing with injuries to their second line. Centre Ryan Kesler, who was recovering from off-season surgeries to his shoulder <b>and</b> <b>wrist,</b> {{would be unable to}} start the season; it was unknown how long he would be out rehabbing the injuries. Winger David Booth was injured during the team's physicals to start camp. After having an MRI done on his injury, it was announced that Booth would miss four to six weeks recovering. Alain Vigneault stated that he hoped to keep his third and fourth lines intact, leaving the possible replacements as, Andrew Ebbett, Jordan Schroeder and Zack Kassian. Schroeder was a first-round draft pick for Vancouver in 2009, but had never played in an NHL game. Ebbett a utility, journeyman forward played in 18 games for Vancouver in 2011–12. While the second-year Kassian produced only four goals in his rookie campaign. Vancouver elected to start the season with Ebbett and put Kassian on their second line. In order to keep defensive depth, the Canucks decided to keep nine defenceman. Schroeder was sent back to the minors in order to comply with the 23-man roster and because he would not need to clear waivers.|$|E
