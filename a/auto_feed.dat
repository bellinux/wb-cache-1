40|$|AbstractNatural fiber {{reinforced}} {{polymer matrix}} composites (PMCs) find applications in many fields {{in terms of}} research, industrial applications and widely accepted by scientists, researchers and engineers due to their inherent superior properties. In this paper the sisal fibers are incorporated with glass fiber by using polymer matrix and the S-GFRP hybrid composites have been prepared. The drilling of the composites is carried out using an <b>auto</b> <b>feed</b> drilling machine and the thrust force, drilling induced damages have been evaluated for different feed rates using brad and spur drill. From the results {{it has been observed}} that all the above said parameters affect the thrust force of the hybrid composites and the tool material was found to be an important parameter which has more effect on the thrust force and subsequently the drilling induced damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} is conducted in an <b>auto</b> <b>feed</b> lathe. The temperature {{is controlled by}} a thermocouple and automated flame heating system. The statistical analysis is done by Taguchi method. Taguchi designs provide a powerful and efficient method for designing products that operate consistently and optimally over a variety of conditions. The primary goal is to find factor settings that minimize response variation, while adjusting (or keeping) the process on target. A process designed with this goal will produce more consistent output. A product designed with this goal will deliver more consistent performance regardless of {{the environment in which}} it is used. Taguchi method advocates the use of orthogonal array designs to assign the factors chosen for the experiment. The most commonly used orthogonal array designs are L 8, L 16, L 9 (i. e. eight experimental trials), L 16 and L 18. The power of the Taguchi method is that it integrates statistical methods into the engineering process. The significance of the control factors are found in the following order. Cutting speed â€“ 19. 55 m/min, Depth of Cut - 0. 5 mm, Temperature - 600 degree, Feed - 0. 05 mm/rev. From statistical design of experiments by Taguchi method (MINITAB software) and Hot Machining we find that the power required is decreased and the tool life is increased by 14. 8 %...|$|E
40|$|In {{the modern}} world, {{there is a}} need of {{materials}} with very high hardness and shear strength in order to satisfy industrial requirements. So many materials which satisfy the properties are manufactured. Machining of such materials with conventional method of machining was proved to be very costly as these materials greatly affect the tool life. So to decrease tool wear, power consumed and increase surface finish Hot Machining can be used. Here the temperature of the work piece is raised to several hundred or even thousand degree Celsius above ambient, so as to reduce the shear strength of the material. Various heating method has been attempted, for example, bulk heating using furnace, area heating using torch flame, plasma arc heating, induction heating and electric current resistance heating at tool-work interface. From the past experiments it was found the power consumed during turning operations is primarily due to shearing of the material and plastic deformation of the metal removed. Since both the shear strength and hardness values of engineering materials decrease with temperature, it was thus postulated that an increase in work piece temperature would reduce the amount of power consumed for machining and eventually increase tool life. The experiment is conducted in an <b>auto</b> <b>feed</b> lathe. The temperature is controlled by a thermocouple and automated flame heating system.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effect of different feed flavors on feed intake and intake behavior in growing pigs under <b>auto</b> <b>feeding</b> system. A total of 30 barrows (Landrace x Yorkshire) of 95 days old were selected and allocated to 1 of 5 treatments by BW for this 14 days experiment. There were 6 replicates in each treatment and 1 pig in each replicate. Diets containing: CON, the basal diet; BF, CON + 400 mg kg - 1 banana flavor; MF, CON + 400 mg kg - 1 sow milky flavor; SF, CON + 150 mg kg - 1 sweetener and BMS, CON + 400 mg kg - 1 banana flavor + 400 mg kg - 1 milky flavor + 150 mg kg - 1 sweetener. The ADFI in BF, MF, SF and BMS complex group was enhanced compared to the CON, respectively. The ADG and feed efficiency was respectively increased (p< 0. 05) related to the control treatment. The feed intake speeds and feed intake time of fruit, milky, sweetener and complex group were increased (p< 0. 05) than control. The results indicated that feed flavors affect feed intake behavior by elevating the feed intake speed and reducing the time of feed intake to enhance the feed intake of growing pigs and no difference {{was found between the}} three flavors...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{injection}} molding {{is probably the}} most important method of Processing of consumer and industrial goods, and is performed everywhere in the world. The developing of {{injection molding}} becomes a competition from day to day. This Process now integrated with computer control make the production better in quality and Better quantity. The trends of producing a plastics product in injection molding industries are recently changing from traditional method to using the FEA analysis. For injection molding industries, time and cost is very important aspects to consider because these two aspects will directly related to the profits at a company. The next issue to consider, to get the best parameter for the injection molding process, plastics has been waste. Through the experiment, operator will use large amount of plastics material to get the possibly parameters to setup the machine. To produce the parts with better quality and quantity these molding defects are the major obstacles in achieving the targets with quality & quantity. Various defects like Short shot, colour streaks and low productivity rates are associated with the material mixing and feeding as molded plastics are often a blend of two or more materials. Colors (master batch) and other additives are often mixed (blended) with the raw plastic material prior to the molding process in molding plants. So it is very necessary to work out auto blending and <b>auto</b> <b>feeding</b> of plastic granules to the machine hopper. This paper will cover the study of automatic blending unit & central conveying system for plastic granule feeding to machine & will help in optimizing the injection molding process...|$|R
50|$|Combined with accuracy, realism is a {{collection}} of factors that make the simulation seem realistic and lifelike. Factors such as the graphical realism of the course, 3D motion graphics, sound and visual effects such as the sound of the ball when it strikes the green or splashes into a lake make the game that much more realistic and lifelike. New developments such as <b>auto</b> ball <b>feed</b> and changes in the slope of the hitting area now allow the golfer to experience the feeling of playing the ball where it lies, no matter where it lies. This creates the feeling of thinking like you are on a golf course, rather than playing on a golf simulator - it is the feeling of planning your next golf shot, and not your next simulator command.|$|R
