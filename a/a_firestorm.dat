5|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin has exerted an {{influence}} equaled by few other novels in history. Upon publication, Uncle Tom's Cabin ignited <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> of protest from defenders of slavery (who created {{a number of}} books in response to the novel) while the book elicited praise from abolitionists. As a best-seller, the novel heavily influenced later protest literature.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{this scheme}} was the {{announcement}} of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> of protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, {{which led to the}} discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal. A major New York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel's charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being. While competitors may have been unhappy, Rockefeller's efforts did bring American consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil by-products. Before 1870, oil light was only for the wealthy, provided by expensive whale oil. But during the next decade, kerosene became commonly available to the working and middle classes.|$|E
5|$|The Great Fire {{started at}} the bakery (or baker's house) of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor) on Pudding Lane shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September and spread rapidly west across the City of London. The major {{firefighting}} technique of the time was to create firebreaks by means of demolition; this, however, was critically delayed owing to the indecisiveness of Lord Mayor of London Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time that large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, the wind had already fanned the bakery fire into <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> that defeated such measures. The fire pushed north on Monday {{into the heart of}} the City.|$|E

This does not exclude fires from being started, but means that these fires will not form into <b>a</b> <b>firestorm,</b> due largely to the differences between modern building materials and that used in World War II era Hiroshima.|$|E

25|$|By early 1943, American {{forces were}} {{beginning}} to build up in large numbers in the UK. Bomber Command was joined in its bombing efforts by the Eighth Air Force. Where Bomber Command operated by night, the Eighth flew by day. Raids were often coordinated so that the same target was hit twice within 24 hours. Hamburg {{was the victim of}} one of the most destructive air raids in history during 1943. The city was easy to find using radar, being located on the distinctively shaped Elbe estuary. It was devastated in a large raid that ignited <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> and killed some 50,000 people.|$|E
25|$|The raw and {{undifferentiated}} {{nature of}} Matthews' Appendix IX, which listed communists alongside liberals and even centrists {{in a single}} list, lead to <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> of criticism and a quick effort at the document's recall.

He continued to work for the Committee on Un-American Activities until 1945, at which time he left to become a consultant for the Hearst Corporation.|$|E
25|$|The City's {{population}} fell {{rapidly in}} the 19th century and {{through most of the}} 20th century, as people moved outwards in all directions to London's vast suburbs, and many residential buildings were demolished to make way for office blocks. Like many areas of London and other British cities, the City fell victim to large scale and highly destructive aerial bombing during World War II, especially in the Blitz. Whilst St Paul's Cathedral survived the onslaught, large swathes of the area did not and the particularly heavy raids of late December 1940 led to <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> called the Second Great Fire of London.|$|E
