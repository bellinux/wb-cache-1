5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration, in United States trademark law, {{is a federal}} trademark registration of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a registration is achieved by filing a {{concurrent use}} application (or by converting an existing application to a concurrent use application) and then prevailing in a concurrent use proceeding before the Trademark Trial and <b>Appeal</b> <b>Board</b> ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). A concurrent use application may be filed {{with respect to a}} trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may be allowed to go forward based on the assertion that the existing use can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E

The decision was not based on, nor did it address, the merits of Ali's claims per se; rather, the Court held that since the <b>appeal</b> <b>board</b> gave no reason for the denial of a conscientious objector exemption to Ali, and that it was therefore impossible to determine which of the three basic tests for conscientious objector status offered in the Justice Department's brief that the <b>appeal</b> <b>board</b> relied on, Ali's conviction must be reversed.|$|E

500|$|In October 1979 the Publications <b>Appeal</b> <b>Board,</b> on the {{recommendation}} of a panel of literary experts and a state security specialist, overruled the banning of Burger's Daughter. The state security specialist reported the book posed no threat to the security of South Africa, and the literary experts had accused the censorship board [...] "of bias, prejudice, and literary incompetence", and that [...] "t has not read accurately, it has severely distorted by quoting extensively out of context, it has not considered the work as a literary work deserves to be considered, and it has directly, and by implication, smeared the authoress [...]" [...] Notwithstanding the unbanning, the chairman of the <b>Appeal</b> <b>Board</b> told a press reporter, [...] "Don't buy —it is not worth buying. Very badly written... This is also why we eventually passed it." [...] The <b>Appeal</b> <b>Board</b> described the book as [...] "one-sided" [...] in its attack on whites and the South African Government, and concluded, [...] "As a result... the effect of the book will be counterproductive rather than subversive." ...|$|E

In March 2012, the U.S. Trademark Trial and <b>Appeal</b> <b>Board</b> (TTAB) ruled in Apple's favor and denied Sector Labs' registration, finding that the [...] "iPod" [...] mark was [...] "famous" [...] and therefore entitled to broad protection under U.S. trademark law.|$|E

500|$|The {{meaning of}} the term [...] "redskin" [...] was {{addressed}} in two cases challenging the trademark registrations held by Pro-Football, Inc., the team's corporate entity. The challange was based upon a disparagement provision of the Lanham Act which prohibited the registration of any mark that “may disparage persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute.” The first case, Harjo etal. v Pro-Football, Inc. was filed in 1992 by Suzan Shown Harjo and six other Native American leaders. In 1999 the Trademark Trial and <b>Appeal</b> <b>Board</b> (TTAB) canceled the federal registrations for the Redskins marks. In 2005 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia reversed the TTAB's decision on the grounds of insufficient evidence of disparagement. Subsequent appeals were also rejected on the basis of laches, that the Native American petitioners had pursued their rights in an untimely manner.|$|E

The TTAB's Notice of Publication was published in September 2007 and Apple filed an opposition with the TTAB the following January, claiming a likelihood of confusion. In June 2008, NYC filed a motion to amend its application to delete the leaf element from its design, leaving the stem, and the TTAB dismissed Apple's opposition and counterclaims in accordance with the parties' stipulation in July 2008. In November 2011, the TTAB issued NYC's trademark registration.|$|E

On June 18, 2014, the Trademark Trial and <b>Appeal</b> <b>Board</b> (TTAB) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) voted to cancel the Redskins federal trademark registrations, considering them [...] "disparaging to Native Americans". In June 2017 the Supreme Court of the United States came to a unanimous decision in a different case that barring the trademark of disparaging names is an unconstitutional infringement of freedom of speech, thus voiding the legal basis for the cancellation of the Redskins' trademarks.|$|E
