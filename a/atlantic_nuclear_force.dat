5000|$|There {{are four}} {{fundamental}} forces (electromagnetism, gravitation, the weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> {{and the strong}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>force).</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> (or nucleon-nucleon {{interaction}} or residual strong force) is a {{force that}} acts between the protons and neutrons of atoms. Neutrons and protons, both nucleons, {{are affected by the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> almost identically. Since protons have charge +1 e, they experience an electric force that tends to push them apart, but at short range the attractive <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic <b>force.</b> The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> binds nucleons into atomic nuclei.|$|R
25|$|Quantum field {{theories}} for {{the strong}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and the weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> {{have also been}} developed. The quantum field theory of the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons. The weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg. These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{the force}} of gravity and the {{electromagnetic}} forces, there are weak and strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> Weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> are the forces that cause radioactivity, or when [...] emits energy. Weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> works on particles with a spin of 1/2. Strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> are the forces that keep the quarks in a neutron and a proton together, and keeps the protons and neutrons together in an atom. The particle that carries the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is thought to be a gluon. The gluon is a particle with a spin of 1. The gluon holds together quarks to form protons and neutrons. However, the gluon only holds together quarks that are three different colors. This makes the end product have no color. This is called confinement.|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{the task}} of {{describing}} the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> phenomenologically was formidable. The first semi-empirical quantitative models came in the mid-1950s, such as the Woods-Saxon potential (1954). There was substantial progress in experiment and theory related to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> in the 1960s and 1970s. One influential model was the Reid potential (1968). In recent years, experimenters have concentrated on the subtleties of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> such as its charge dependence, the precise value of the πNN coupling constant, improved phase shift analysis, high-precision NN data, high-precision NN potentials, NN scattering at intermediate and high energies, and attempts to derive the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> from QCD.|$|R
40|$|From the {{standpoint}} of the meson theory of <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> results of current analysis on phenomenological nuclear potentials are reexamined. A new method of the theory of <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> is proposed. We employed meson potentials for the outside region, and phenomenological parameters for the inside region of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> § 1. Problem in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> The phenomenological treatments of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> have long been invest-gated since last ten years, but no definite results were obtained yet. The main reason for it was the scarcity of experimental results to be fitted to and there remained diversity of possibilities. However, as the problem must be treated meson theoretically in its final stage, these possibilities, which do not suggest the connection to or contradict with it, must be put aside. Here we shall investigate some features which the present meson theory imposes to the problem of <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> A. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>force</b> range Recent developments have introduced two restrictions in the theory of <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> The one concerns with the force range and the other with the neutron-proton and the proton-proton scattering at high energy region. The former restriction comes from the discovery of two mesons, of which 1 !'-meson interacts strongly with nucleons, while the,u-meson {{has nothing to do with}} the <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> The mass of 1 !'-meson is observed to be about 275 m. (m, being electron mass) and is heavier than that, assumed hitherto for <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> This fact indicates that the force range must be taken shorter, i. e., about 1. 3 X 10 - 13 cm. Although this alteration introduces only small effects in the phenomena of neutron-proton system, the quadrupole moment of deuterons is an exception, because it behaves as the inverse square of meson mass and the heavier meson mass reduces its value considerably. To investigate the reduction, we made the calculations, with zero cut-off, assuming the general form of nuclear potential...|$|R
50|$|Public pressure, led by {{the peace}} movements, {{prevented}} a compensatory increase in spending on conventional <b>forces</b> as <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> were reduced, amplifying NATOs existing disadvantage in conventional forces (this disadvantage had been evened out previously by the theater <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces).</b>|$|R
50|$|Nuclear {{potential}} energy is the {{potential energy}} of the particles inside an atomic nucleus. The nuclear particles are bound together by the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force.</b> Weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> provide the potential energy for certain kinds of radioactive decay, such as beta decay.|$|R
5000|$|Strong nuclear force: Unlike {{gravity and}} electromagnetism, the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> {{is a short}} {{distance}} force that takes place between fundamental particles within a nucleus. It is charge independent and acts equally between a proton and a proton, a neutron and a neutron, and a proton and a neutron. The strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is the strongest force in nature; however, its range is small (acting only over distances {{of the order of}} 10−15 m). The strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> mediates both <b>nuclear</b> fission and fusion reactions.|$|R
50|$|Some {{scientists}} {{have tried to}} make a theory that combines the electromagnetic <b>force,</b> the weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> and the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force.</b> This theory is called a grand unified theory (or a GUT). This theory tries to explain these forces in one big unified way or theory.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason the}} trend reverses after iron {{is the growing}} {{positive}} charge of the nuclei. The electric force may be weaker than the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> but its range is greater: in an iron nucleus, each proton repels the other 25 protons, while the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> only binds close neighbors.|$|R

40|$|<b>Nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> are {{considered}} based on chiral perturbation theory {{with and without}} explicit ∆-isobar degrees of freedom. We discuss the subleading corrections to chiral three-nucleon forces in the ∆-less formalism which contain no additional free parameters. In the formalism with explicit ∆-isobar we present the complete next-to-next-to-leading order analysis of isospin-conserving and next-to-leading order analysis of isospinviolating <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> The perturbative expansion of <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> in the ∆-full case is shown to have much better convergence compared with the ∆-less theory where the ∆-resonance is integrated out and is encoded in certain low-energy constants...|$|R
50|$|An {{example that}} {{illustrates}} nuclear binding energy is {{the nucleus of}} 12C (carbon-12), which contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons. The protons are all positively charged and repel each other, but the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> overcomes the repulsion and causes them to stick together. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is a close-range force (it is strongly attractive {{at a distance of}} 1.0 fm and becomes extremely small beyond a distance of 2.5fm), and virtually no effect of this force is observed outside the nucleus. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> also pulls neutrons together, or neutrons and protons.|$|R
50|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> {{holding an}} atomic nucleus {{together}} is very strong, in general {{much stronger than}} the repulsive electromagnetic forces between the protons. However, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is also short range, dropping quickly in strength beyond about 1 femtometre, while the electromagnetic force has unlimited range. The strength of the attractive <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> keeping a nucleus together is thus proportional {{to the number of}} nucleons, but the total disruptive electromagnetic force trying to break the nucleus apart is roughly proportional to the square of its atomic number. A nucleus with 210 or more nucleons is so large that the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> holding it together can just barely counterbalance the electromagnetic repulsion between the protons it contains. Alpha decay occurs in such nuclei as a means of increasing stability by reducing size.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is powerfully [...] between nucleons at {{distances}} of about 1 femtometre (fm, or 1.0 × 10−15 metres), but it rapidly decreases to insignificance at distances beyond about 2.5 fm. At distances less than 0.7 fm, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> becomes [...] This repulsive component {{is responsible for}} the physical size of nuclei, since the nucleons can come no closer than the force allows. By comparison, the size of an atom, measured in angstroms (Å, or 1.0 × 10−10 m), is five orders of magnitude larger. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is not simple, however, since it depends on the nucleon spins, has a tensor component, and may depend on the relative momentum of the nucleons.
