25|$|GUIs were <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>topic</b> in {{the early}} 1980s. The Apple Lisa was {{released}} in 1983, and various windowing systems existed for DOS operating systems (including PC GEM and PC/GEOS).

Popular Science discussed possible uses of fullerenes (graphene) in armor. In April 2003, fullerenes were under study for potential medicinal use: binding specific antibiotics to the structure to target resistant bacteria and even target certain cancer cells such as melanoma. The October 2005 issue of Chemistry & Biology contained an article describing the use of fullerenes as light-activated antimicrobial agents.|$|E
25|$|Perovskite {{solar cells}} are solar cells {{that include a}} perovskite-structured {{material}} as the active layer. Most commonly, this is a solution-processed hybrid organic-inorganic tin or lead halide based material. Efficiencies have increased from below 5% at their first usage in 2009 to over 20% in 2014, making them a very rapidly advancing technology and <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>topic</b> in the solar cell field. Perovskite solar cells are also forecast to be extremely cheap to scale up, making them a very attractive option for commercialisation.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Suzuki's arrival, Zen had become <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>topic</b> amongst some groups in the United States, {{especially}} beatniks. Particularly influential were several books on Zen and Buddhism by Alan Watts. Word began to spread about Suzuki among the beatniks through places like the San Francisco Art Institute and the American Academy of Asian Studies, where Alan Watts was once director. Kato had done some presentations at the Academy and asked Suzuki to come join a class he was giving there on Buddhism. This sparked Suzuki's long-held desire to teach Zen to Westerners.|$|E

25|$|Before the APEC {{summit in}} November 2006, {{the issue of}} human rights was <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>topic</b> on Harper's agenda.

At the APEC summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, Harper met with Hu, after tensions {{between the two countries}} nearly called off a scheduled meeting between the two leaders.

25|$|While Nuckolls and LLNL {{were working}} on hohlraum-based concepts, former weapon {{designer}} Ray Kidder {{was working on the}} direct drive concept, using a large number of laser beams to evenly heat the target capsule. In the early 1970s, Kidder formed KMS Fusion to directly commercialize this concept. This sparked off intense rivalry between Kidder and the weapons labs. Formerly ignored, ICF was now <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>topic</b> and most of the labs soon started ICF efforts of their own. LLNL decided early on to concentrate on glass lasers, while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide (e.g. ANTARES, Los Alamos National Laboratory) or KrF (e.g. Nike laser, Naval Research Laboratory).|$|E

25|$|Neural {{synchronization}} can be modulated by task constraints, such as attention, and {{is thought}} {{to play a role}} in feature binding, neuronal communication, and motor coordination. Neuronal oscillations became <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>topic</b> in neuroscience in the 1990s when the studies of the visual system of the brain by Gray, Singer and others appeared to support the neural binding hypothesis. According to this idea, synchronous oscillations in neuronal ensembles bind neurons representing different features of an object. For example, when a person looks at a tree, visual cortex neurons representing the tree trunk and those representing the branches of the same tree would oscillate in synchrony to form a single representation of the tree. This phenomenon is best seen in local field potentials which reflect the synchronous activity of local groups of neurons, but has also been shown in EEG and MEG recordings providing increasing evidence for a close relation between synchronous oscillatory activity and a variety of cognitive functions such as perceptual grouping.|$|E
25|$|During a fan-meet in Shanghai on August 26, 2007, Han Geng {{revealed}} that recording schedules for the album were finally active and the album {{would be released}} in September, followed up by Shindong's announcement {{that he would be}} on a short hiatus from hosting activities to work on the album, and an official announcement of the re-appearance of Kyuhyun in news articles.

40|$|Geospatial {{semantic}} querying to geographical databases {{has been}} recognized as <b>an</b> <b>hot</b> <b>topic</b> in GIS research. Most approaches propose to adopt an ontology as a knowledge representation structure {{on top of the}} database, representing the concepts the user can query.

The main advantage of this approach is that semantic-rich geospatial queries can be abstractly represented in the ontology and automatically translated into spatial SQL queries. JRC.

The Washington Post called Rise Against [...] "a Noam Chomsky band in <b>a</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Topic</b> world".|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} factors {{influenced}} the opera's very favourable reception. The initial cast contained leading singers of the period and, as it changed, equally brilliant stars (e.g. Falcon) were introduced as replacements. The sensational plot and the notoriety of the Nuns' ballet ensured that the opera was <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>topic</b> in journals and reviews. This was assisted by the marketing skills of the director Véron and the publisher Schlesinger. The scenery was of exceptional quality: [...] "This was as much an opera to see as to hear, {{and it has been}} argued that the real hero behind Robert le diable was Cicéri, the designer." [...] Meyerbeer was keen to keep influential persons on his side. For example, he sent free tickets for 'a good box' to Heinrich Heine. And of course the businessman Véron knew how to use (and pay) the claque and its leader Augustin Levasseur.|$|E
