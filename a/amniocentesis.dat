5|$|In {{the first}} episode, it is {{revealed}} that Pauline, aged 40, is {{pregnant with her}} third child. The character's pregnancy quickly became a prominent storyline within the series. Pauline, against her mother's opposition, is determined to keep the baby. The storyline was used to spread a public message on the increased risk of genetic defects in late pregnancies, with Pauline undergoing <b>amniocentesis</b> tests. The storyline culminates {{with the birth of}} the serial's first baby, Martin, in July 1985.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An <b>amniocentesis</b> can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
25|$|During pregnancy, testing can be {{performed}} on the placenta (chorionic villus sampling) or the fluid around the fetus (<b>amniocentesis).</b> However, chorionic villus sampling has a risk of fetal death of one in 100 and <b>amniocentesis</b> of one in 200; a recent study has indicated this may be much lower, about one in 1,600.|$|E
25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} may {{be diagnosed}} by <b>amniocentesis</b> or chorionic villus sampling during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|NF II can be {{diagnosed}} with 65% accuracy prenatally with chorionic villus sampling or <b>amniocentesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Amniocentesis</b> and {{chorionic}} villus sampling are procedures conducted {{to assess the}} fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. Chorionic villus sampling is a similar procedure {{with a sample of}} tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester. Miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis ({{chorionic villus}} sampling (CVS) and <b>amniocentesis)</b> is rare (about 1%).|$|E
25|$|<b>Amniocentesis</b> is the {{national}} standard (in what country) for women over 35 or who reach 35 by mid pregnancy or who {{are at increased risk}} by family history or prior birth history.|$|E
25|$|Topical anesthesia, in {{the form}} of lidocaine/prilocaine (EMLA) is most {{commonly}} used to enable relatively painless venipuncture (blood collection) and placement of intravenous cannulae. It may also be suitable for other kinds of punctures such as ascites drainage and <b>amniocentesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Referral for {{counseling}} in a prenatal genetics clinic to discuss {{risks to the}} pregnancy (advanced maternal age, teratogen exposure, family history of a genetic disease), test results (abnormal maternal serum screen, abnormal ultrasound), and/or options for prenatal diagnosis (typically <b>amniocentesis</b> or chorionic villus sampling).|$|E
25|$|Prenatal {{and other}} {{diagnostic}} techniques such as immunocytochemistry (ICC) evaluation are usually followed by FISH or Polymerase Chain Reaction to detect chromosomal aneuploidies. Maternal blood sampling for fetal cells, often used to identify risk of trisomies 18 or 21, poses less risk as compared to <b>amniocentesis</b> and chorionic villous sampling (CVS). Chorionic villus sampling utilizes placental tissue to give information about fetal chromosome status and has been used since the 1970s. In addition to CVS, <b>amniocentesis</b> {{can be used to}} obtain fetal karyotype by examining fetal cells in amniotic fluid. It was first performed in 1952 and became standard practice in the 1970s. The odds of having a child with polysomy increases as the age of the mother increases, so pregnant women over the age of 35 are tested.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal {{diagnosis}} of fetal varicella infection {{can be performed}} using ultrasound, though a delay of 5 weeks following primary maternal infection is advised. A PCR (DNA) test of the mother's amniotic fluid can also be performed, though the risk of spontaneous abortion due to the <b>amniocentesis</b> procedure {{is higher than the}} risk of the baby's developing fetal varicella syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal diagnosis. If {{both parents}} are {{identified}} as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), {{the most common form}} of prenatal diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. <b>Amniocentesis</b> is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{excellent}} postnatal prognosis, 99% of Turner-syndrome conceptions {{are thought to}} end in miscarriage or stillbirth, {{and as many as}} 15% of all spontaneous abortions have the 45,X karyotype. Among cases that are detected by routine <b>amniocentesis</b> or chorionic villus sampling, one study found that the prevalence of Turner syndrome among tested pregnancies was 5.58 and 13.3 times higher, respectively, than among live neonates in a similar population.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} Edwards {{syndrome}} occur due to problems during {{the formation of}} the reproductive cells or during early development. The rate of disease increases with the mother's age. Rarely cases may be inherited from a person's parents. Occasionally not all cells have the extra chromosome, known as mosaic trisomy, and symptoms in these cases may be less severe. Ultrasound can increase suspicion for the condition, which can be confirmed by <b>amniocentesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Triple X {{syndrome}} can {{be diagnosed}} prenatally through <b>amniocentesis</b> or chorionic villus sampling. In Denmark, between 1970 and 1984, 76% of the prenatally diagnosed fetuses with triple-X were aborted. Between 1985-1987, this figure dropped to 56%. With improved information, {{the number of}} abortions diminished. In the Netherlands, between 1991 and 2000, 33% (18/54) of the couples that were confronted with a prenatal diagnosis of 47, XXX elected to abort. If balanced information is provided to prospective parents, prenatally, the incidence of voluntary termination (abortion) is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{the fetus}} is an {{affected}} girl {{can be determined}} by chorionic villus sampling at 9–11 weeks of gestation, or by <b>amniocentesis</b> at 15–18 weeks gestation. In each case the fetal sex can be determined quickly, and if the fetus is a male the dexamethasone can be discontinued. If female, fetal DNA is analyzed {{to see if she}} carries one of the known abnormal alleles of the CYP21 gene. If so, dexamethasone is continued {{for the remainder of the}} pregnancy at a dose of about 1mg daily.|$|E
25|$|Mixing {{of fetal}} cells {{carrying}} paternal RhD antigens into maternal blood {{may result in}} the sensitization of an RhD-negative mother. Rhesus blood group (D antigen) is {{used to determine the}} risk of hemolytic disease in the fetus. In hemolytic disease, the maternal antibodies destroy RhD-positive fetal red blood cells. This leads to lethality for the fetus. A significant amount of blood can be exchanged between mother and infant during birth, CVS, <b>amniocentesis</b> and accidents. 50 defined antigens on the surface of red blood cells indicate Rhesus blood group and E antigens {{are one of the most}} important. RHD gene determines the Rhesus D status. Chinen et al. 2010 shows that 15% of Caucasian females, 3-5% of black African females and <3% of Asian females are RhD-negative. In the United Kingdom and other countries, cffDNA tests are now routinely being offered to RhD-negative patients at increased risk of isoimmunization. Anti-RhD immune globulin, a blood derivative, is only offered in the event of a RhD-positive fetus for these women (21, 48, 54). In United States, prophylactic treatment is recommended for all RhD-negative pregnant women to prevent isoimmunization in case of RhD incompatibility. In the United States, <b>amniocentesis</b> still serves as the gold standard diagnostic tool for those women who require antenatal fetal blood genotyping, but it has been suggested that technology using cell-free fetal DNA may ultimately replace this invasive procedure.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{aspects of}} a genetic {{disorder}} rests on the inheritance of genetic material. With an in depth family history, {{it is possible to}} anticipate possible disorders in children which direct medical professionals to specific tests depending on the disorder and allow parents the chance to prepare for potential lifestyle changes, anticipate the possibility of stillbirth, or contemplate termination. Prenatal diagnosis can detect the presence of characteristic abnormalities in fetal development through ultrasound, or detect the presence of characteristic substances via invasive procedures which involve inserting probes or needles into the uterus such as in <b>amniocentesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{often can}} be made through {{clinical}} examination and urine tests (excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted in the urine). Enzyme assays (testing a variety of cells or body fluids in culture for enzyme deficiency) are also used to provide definitive diagnosis {{of one of the}} mucopolysaccharidoses. Prenatal diagnosis using <b>amniocentesis</b> and chorionic villus sampling can verify if a fetus either carries a copy of the defective gene or is affected with the disorder. Genetic counseling can help parents who {{have a family history of}} the mucopolysaccharidoses determine if they are carrying the mutated gene that causes the disorders.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal diagnosis: Used {{to detect}} {{changes in a}} fetus's genes or {{chromosomes}} before birth. This type of testing is offered to couples with {{an increased risk of}} having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. In some cases, prenatal testing can lessen a couple's uncertainty or help them decide whether to abort the pregnancy. It cannot identify all possible inherited disorders and birth defects, however. One method of performing a prenatal genetic test involves an <b>amniocentesis,</b> which removes a sample of fluid from the mother’s amniotic sac 15 to 20 or more weeks into pregnancy. The fluid is then tested for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and Trisomy 18, which can result in neonatal or fetal death. Test results can be retrieved within 7–14 days after the test is done. This method is 99.4% accurate at detecting and diagnosing fetal chromosome abnormalities. Although there is a risk of miscarriage associated with an <b>amniocentesis,</b> the miscarriage rate is only 1/400. Another method of prenatal testing is Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). Chorionic villi are projections from the placenta that carry the same genetic makeup as the baby. During this method of prenatal testing, a sample of chorionic villi is removed from the placenta to be tested. This test is performed 10–13 weeks into pregnancy and results are ready 7–14 days after the test was done. Another test using blood taken from the fetal umbilical cord is percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling.|$|E
25|$|Abortion {{was portrayed}} in 2001 {{with a story}} which divided the country when Kay decided to abort her {{pregnancy}} against {{the wishes of the}} father Malachy. As an older mother Kay has <b>amniocentesis</b> tests done which reveal the child has trisomy-13 which means that the child would be born severely disabled and probably would not survive long after birth. The storyline was seen by the actors and producers as controversial and heart-breaking. They recognised the time sensitive nature of the decisions that had to be made and the potential impacts and worked to show it all. This storyline caused anti-abortion viewers to complain to the Justice Minister {{on the grounds that the}} story was hate speech against people with disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have looked}} at, {{and some have}} even optimized, {{protocols}} for testing for various issues, including non-compatible RhD factors, sex determination for X-linked genetic disorders and testing for single gene disorders. Current studies are now looking at determining aneuploidies in the developing fetus. These protocols can be done earlier than the current prenatal testing methods, and have no risk of spontaneous abortion, unlike current prenatal testing methods. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) and Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) have been implemented in the UK {{and parts of the}} US; it has clear benefits above the standard tests of chorionic villi sample (CVS), <b>amniocentesis,</b> and other techniques which have procedure-related miscarriage risks of about 1 in 100 pregnancies and 1 in 200 pregnancies, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Spina bifida is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. After having one child with the condition or if one of the parents has the condition, there is a 4% chance that the next child will also be affected. Not having enough folate in the diet before and during pregnancy also plays a significant role. Other risk factors include certain antiseizure medications, obesity, and poorly controlled diabetes. Diagnosis may occur either before or after a child is born. Before birth if a blood test or <b>amniocentesis</b> finds a high level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), there is a higher risk of spina bifida. Ultrasound examination may also detect the problem. Medical imaging can confirm the diagnosis after birth. It is a type of neural tube defect with other types including anencephaly and encephalocele.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{clinical}} genetics assessment is commonly {{performed by the}} high-risk obstetrician or genetic counselor where they may ask for a blood sample from the fetus or will perform an <b>amniocentesis.</b> These samples are used to perform several tests, one {{of which may be}} to check for the proper number of chromosomes, called a karyotype, of the fetus. Some birth defects are known to be associated with missing a chromosome, having an extra chromosome, such as in Down syndrome, as well as by having a part of one chromosome break off and relocate to a portion of another chromosome (called a translocation). However, on each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes are thousands of different genes. While chromosomes are easy to visualize under a microscope and count, the genes on them are not. Genes are very small pieces of DNA when compared to the chromosomes they reside on. A gene contains a code for a protein and if the gene is mutated (different from normal) the protein that is made from it may not function properly - if at all. Unfortunately, genetic abnormalities could still exist despite having normal chromosomes. The only way to determine genetically inherited mutations in the infant is to perform a genetic analysis of the mother, father, affected infant and any unaffected siblings of the affected fetus. These analyses will reveal what genetic mutations are present in the affected infant, and by comparing these results to the surviving siblings and parents, it can be determined which mutations were inherited or were not.|$|E
500|$|Non-invasive {{prenatal}} diagnostic {{testing for}} Down's Syndrome: Previously, women underwent invasive testing such as <b>amniocentesis</b> or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This new maternal blood test {{has the potential}} {{to reduce the number of}} women referred for invasive testing for Down's syndrome by 98 percent. Developed by Chinese researchers in Hong Kong in 2008, this is hailed as a breakthrough.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Rapp {{published}} , which Adele Clark {{describes as}} [...] " [...] significant and enduring contributions to...sociology {{and science and}} technology, medical sociology and anthropology, research methods, women’s studies, feminist theory, clinical genetics, medicine, [...] nursing." [...] The book examines {{the effects of the}} routinization of fetal diagnosis and analyzes its cultural and social significance in a U.S. context, positing that pregnant women's experience with <b>amniocentesis</b> is deeply influenced by gender, race, and class. Rapp drew on her own experience with <b>amniocentesis</b> in her approach towards the book, participating in fifteen years of fieldwork and engaging with laboratory technicians, geneticists, support groups (of women who terminated pregnancies and families with disabled children), families of children with Down syndrome, genetic counselors, women who underwent <b>amniocentesis</b> or who refused the test, and some male partners. Rapp also suggests ideological links between abortion rights and disability rights activists, and argues that society should cultivate better communication between the two [...] "realms".|$|E
2500|$|Karyotyping {{involves}} performing an <b>amniocentesis</b> {{in order}} to study the cells of an unborn fetus during metophase 1. [...] Light microscopy {{can be used to}} visually determine if aneuploidy is an issue.|$|E
2500|$|These {{tests can}} also be {{performed}} prenatally to detect aneuploidy in a pregnancy, through either <b>amniocentesis</b> or chorionic villus sampling. [...] Pregnant women of 35 years or older are offered prenatal diagnosis because the chance of chromosomal aneuploidy increases as the mother's age increases.|$|E
2500|$|The test {{claimed that}} it offered an {{alternative}} to <b>amniocentesis</b> and ultrasound. [...] Gender Mentor claimed that women had many motivations for using the test to learn the sex of their fetuses early in pregnancy, including mental preparation and planning gender-specific purchases, or more controversially, sex-selective abortion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main and}} most {{frequent}} sensitizing event is child birth (about 86% of sensitized cases), but fetal blood may {{pass into the}} maternal circulation earlier during the pregnancy (about 14% of sensitized cases). [...] Sensitizing events during pregnancy include c-section, miscarriage, therapeutic abortion, <b>amniocentesis,</b> ectopic pregnancy, abdominal trauma and external cephalic version.
