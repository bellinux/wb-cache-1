25|$|It is <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> to {{note that}} the {{selective}} breeding of cattle was almost impossible before the enclosure of land by dykes and ditches in the 18th-century, because prior to this the cattle were free to mix without much control from the farmer and establishing or maintaining a 'pure breed' was therefore practically impossible.|$|E

White, with <b>a</b> {{particularly}} <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> that the spider's full name is Charlotte A. Cavatica, a reference to the barn spider's scientific name, Araneus cavaticus. Also one of Charlotte's daughters, after asking what her mother's middle initial was, names herself Aranea.|$|R
25|$|As {{capital of}} British Punjab, the area {{south of the}} Walled City {{contains}} many British colonial municipal structures built in the Indo-Saracenic style, such as the General Post Office, and Lahore Museum. The predominant architectural style {{is a mixture of}} Victorian and Islamic architecture, and {{is often referred to as}} Indo-Gothic. <b>An</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> about Lahore's architecture is that unlike the emphasis on functional architecture in the west, much of Lahore's architecture has always been about making a statement as much as anything else.|$|E
25|$|<b>An</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> of Jewish Law {{arises in}} that Rav Yisroel raised the {{question}} how could the Tribe of Reuven have kept the semikhah alive, since they were outside the Land of Israel and the semikhah can be granted only in Land of Israel. He answered that since the Bnei Reuven had been distant {{from the rest of}} Klal Yisroel before this ruling had been accepted, {{there is no reason to}} assume that they accepted this ruling, and there was a chance that they were still keeping the institution of semikhah alive.|$|E
25|$|<b>An</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> of {{the design}} was {{that it did not}} use a {{traditional}} helical coiled recoil spring, but used a spiral spring, much like a large clock spring, in a semicircular housing {{just in front of the}} trigger. The operating rod had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force of the bolt assembly. At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the operating rod forward for the next round. As with a clock spring, the Lewis gun recoil spring had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. Unusual as it seems, the Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.|$|E

The next question is: are there constraint vectors γ satisfying such a condition?

The presence of large foramen in the turtle's skull where salt glands where is <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> evolutionary <b>point.</b> It is pointed out that this suggests that the evolutionary return to oceanic waters of the sea turtle line evolved before the finalization and streamlining of the line's paddles.|$|R

It was not the idea of a boy breaking out of his house at night that occurred to him first as particularly heinous; {{it was the fact that}} the boy had broken out via his herbaceous border.

Furthermore, the sensitivity of these economies to abrupt changes in oil prices seems widely accepted. It then seems reasonable to expect oil exporters' pricing decisions to be influenced by concerns about the rate of return on their assets. In particular, Saunders argues that oil exporters would want to avoid abrupt price changes because the ensuing shock effects would tend to reduce the rate of return on capital. ...|$|R

6000|$|The Octavia of Dryden is a {{much more}} {{important}} personage than in the [...] "Antony and Cleopatra" [...] of Shakespeare. She is, however, more cold and unamiable; for, in the very short scenes in which the Octavia of Shakespeare appears, she is placed in rather <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> of view. But Dryden has himself informed us, that he was apprehensive the justice of a wife's claim upon her husband would draw the audience to her side, and lessen their interest in the lover and the mistress. He seems accordingly to have studiedly lowered the character of the injured Octavia, who, in her conduct towards her husband, shews much duty and little love; and plainly intimates, that her rectitude of conduct flows from a due regard to her own reputation, rather than from attachment to Antony's person, or sympathy with him in his misfortunes. It happens, therefore, with Octavia, as with all other very good selfish kind of people; we think it unnecessary to feel any thing for her, as she is obviously capable of taking very good care of herself. I must not omit, that her scolding scene with Cleopatra, although anxiously justified by the author in the preface, seems too coarse to be in character, and is a glaring exception to the general good taste evinced {{throughout the rest of the}} piece.|$|E
60|$|From having many {{experiments}} in hand, I did not sow the seed obtained by crossing both {{forms of the}} primrose and cowslip with both forms of the oxlip, which I now regret; but I ascertained <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>point,</b> namely, {{the character of the}} offspring from oxlips growing in a state of nature near both primroses and cowslips. The oxlips were the same plants which, after their seeds had been collected, were transplanted and experimented on. From the seeds thus obtained eight plants were raised, which, when they flowered, might have been mistaken for pure primroses; but on close comparison the eye in the centre of the corolla was seen to be of a darker yellow, and the peduncles more elongated. As the season advanced, one of these plants threw up two naked scapes, 7 inches in height, which bore umbels of flowers of the same character as before. This fact led me to examine the other plants after they had flowered and were dug up; and I found that the flower-peduncles of all sprung from an extremely short common scape, of which no trace {{can be found in the}} pure primrose. Hence these plants are beautifully intermediate between the oxlip and the primrose, inclining rather towards the latter; and we may safely conclude that the parent oxlips had been fertilised by the surrounding primroses.|$|E
