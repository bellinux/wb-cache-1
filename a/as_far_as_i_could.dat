500|$|In 2008, she {{starred in}} the home {{invasion}} horror film The Strangers with Scott Speedman, a film about a young couple who are terrorized one night by three masked assailants in their remote country house. Although the film garnered a mixed reception among critics, {{it was a major}} box office success, earning over $80 million over its considerably smaller $9 million budget. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she noted that The Strangers was the most challenging role of her career. [...] "It was <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> push myself in every way: physically, emotionally, mentally." ...|$|E
500|$|James Whale {{lived as}} an openly gay man {{throughout}} {{his career in the}} British theatre and in Hollywood, something that was virtually unheard of in the 1920s and 1930s. He and David Lewis lived together as a couple from around 1930 to 1952. While he did not go {{out of his way to}} publicize his homosexuality, he did not do anything to conceal it either. As filmmaker Curtis Harrington, a friend and confidant of Whale's, put it, [...] "Not in the sense of screaming it from the rooftops or coming out. But yes, he was openly homosexual. Any sophisticated person who knew him knew he was gay." [...] While there have been suggestions that Whale's career was terminated because of homophobia, and Whale was supposedly dubbed [...] "The Queen of Hollywood", Harrington states that [...] "nobody made a thing out of it <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> perceive".|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{fundamental}} {{differences between the}} film and the original source material. For example, the comic {{is set in the}} 1990s, while the film is set sometime between 2028 and 2038: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowski [...] Brothers to fit a modern US political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between liberalism and neo-conservatism, and abandons the original anarchist–fascist themes. Moore states that [...] "here wasn't a mention of anarchy <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to racial purity had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity." [...] Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story. Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the [...] "St. Mary's virus", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.|$|E

[...] "The blacks, whom he [...] forced from their homes in this neighborhood, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> learn, gave him no voluntary assistance." [...] Lee attributed John Brown's [...] "temporary success" [...] by creating panic and confusion and by [...] "magnifying" [...] the number of participants involved in the raid.|$|E

2500|$|In 1971, Holly {{left the}} Buckaroos, stating, [...] "(I) went just <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go" [...] with the Buckaroos. He formed a band called the Vanishing Breed and signed with Andy Williams' label Barnaby Records. He {{recorded}} two albums {{and some of}} his own songs, such as [...] "Woman Truck Drivin' Fool", [...] "Queen of the Silver Dollar", and [...] "Lila". [...] Seven singles hit the country music charts, of which [...] "Lila" [...] made the most successful peak at No.17 in 1973. Holly continued to record and release singles throughout the 1970s and scored a minor hit with [...] "A Rainbow in My Hand" [...] and a jukebox hit [...] "Richard and the Cadillac Kings." [...] Holly is honored in the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and received a block in the Walkway of Stars at the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|Nick was not {{away from}} Walford for long. In 1991, he {{returned}} with a heroin addiction but Dot initially shunned him and ignored his pleas for help. It was only after discovering Charlie had died that Nick was her only family left and was determined to reform him. Discussing the storyline, Altman has said: [...] "I found the heroin addiction quite exhausting actually, because I grew a really thick beard and my hair was always really filthy. When I was shooting those scenes I met {{with a guy who}} was an addict, and he told me things that you go through, like you can’t relax when you’re trying to come off it. You can‘t sleep so you drink loads of alcohol to try and kill the pain. The clock barely seems to move. For me as an actor, they really let me go <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> on that. We had letters as well from people saying how it‘s put them off heroin for life, so I guess we did a good job." [...] As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey with the help of Pete Beale. During this period, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle is murdered. The murder was the key storyline of the show during the autumn of 1991. The episode Eddie was murdered was written by Tony McHale, it finished with a cliffhanger featuring Clyde Tavernier in the gardens standing over Eddie's body and holding a knife, which Nick witnessed from his bedroom window. Nick tells the police what he saw, leading to Clyde going on the run with the help of Michelle Fowler. Joe Wallace eventually came forward, saying he saw Nick out on the square on the night of Eddie’s murder, having escaped his room and climbed down a drain pipe. Nick confesses to Dot that he was responsible but insists that it was an accident. Nick is subsequently arrested and charged with Eddie’s murder and he stands trial in January 1993. A week's worth of episodes were devoted to the trial, and were all written by Tony Jordan. To present the story of Nick's trial the programme-makers themselves had to review the evidence and watch the episodes leading up to the death of Eddie. In the end, although it was clear that Nick was responsible for stabbing Eddie, it was not clear that it was murder and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Altman summarised: [...] "Through having a really good defence and lying his head off once again, he got away with murder".|$|E
