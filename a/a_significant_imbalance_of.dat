To {{identify}} {{the features of}} clinical and biochemical parameters and indicators of neurohumoral regulation in patients with chronic hepatitis C and mixed cryoglobulinemia depending on the infection with different genotypes of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Methods. The study involved 78 patients with chronic hepatitis C and mixed cryoglobulinemia. The content of cryoglobulins in the blood serum was determined by spectrophotometry, of cortisol — by enzyme immunoassay.

40|$|Abstract—Most current-generation P 2 P content {{distribution}} protocols use fine-granularity {{blocks to}} distribute content {{to all the}} peers in a decentralized fashion. Such protocols often suffer from <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>imbalance</b> in block distributions, especially when the users are highly dynamic. As certain blocks become rare or even unavailable, content availability and download efficiency are adversely affected. Randomized network coding may improve block diversity and availability in P 2 P networks, as coded blocks are equally innovative and useful to peers. However, the computational complexity of network coding mandates that, in reality, network coding needs to be performed within segments, each containing a subset of blocks. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate how network coding may improve content availability, block diversity and download performance {{in the presence of}} churn, as the number of blocks in each segment for coding varies. Based on stochastic models and a differential equation approach, we explore the fundamental tradeoff between the resilience gain of network coding to peer dynamics and its inherent coding complexity. We conclude that a small number of blocks in each segment is sufficient to realize the major benefits of network coding, with acceptable coding cost.

However, haemorrhage in this setting is not a rare event. We aimed to investigate by meta-analysis the risk of haemorrhage with ticlopidine plus aspirin versus clopidogrel plus aspirin after coronary artery stenting. Methods: A literature search was conducted for studies comparing ticlopidine plus aspirin with clopidogrel plus aspirin in patients undergoing coronary artery stenting procedures. Studies {{were included in the}} meta-analysis if they provided data on haemorrhage for both therapies. Results: Seven randomised and 5 non-randomised studies met the entry criteria. After adjustment for <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>imbalance</b> in use <b>of</b> abciximab in one study, the total number of haemorrhages was 82 with ticlopidine (among 4093 patients) and 78 for clopidogrel (among 3714 patients). Meta- analysis found that ticlopidine plus aspirin was associated with a lower risk of haemorrhage than clopidogrel plus aspirin (odds ratio 0. 69; 95 % confidence interval 0. 50 - 0. 97; p= 0. 03). In the studies providing information on these events, the rate of blood dyscrasias was higher with ticlopidine than with clopidogrel (0. 66 % vs 0. 45 %), but this was offset by the lower rate of haemorrhage with ticlopidine (0. 71 % vs 1. 00 %). Conclusion: This meta-analysis found that ticlopidine plus aspirin was associated with a significantly lower risk of haemorrhage than clopidogrel plus aspirin after coronary artery stenting.

40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of the horizontal electric field on the Sun's visible surface are important not only for estimating the Poynting flux of magnetic energy into the corona but also for driving time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic models of the corona. In this paper, a method is developed for estimating the horizontal electric field from a sequence of radial-component magnetic field maps. This problem of inverting Faraday's law has no unique solution. Unfortunately, the simplest solution (a divergence-free electric field) is not realistically localized in regions of non-zero magnetic field, {{as would be expected}} from Ohm's law. Our new method generates instead a localized solution, using a basis pursuit algorithm to find a sparse solution for the electric field. The method is shown to perform well on test cases where the input magnetic maps are flux balanced, in both Cartesian and spherical geometries.

30|$|To {{classify}} {{images with}} a fine-grained resolution, {{a considerable amount}} of training data is necessary for a respectable model generalization. Thus, fine-grained datasets were collected for specific object categories. Some examples are aircraft datasets [6, 7]; Caltech-UCSD bird species dataset [8] consisting of 12 K images, car make, and model datasets; Standford cars dataset [9] containing 16 K car images; and CompCars dataset [10] of 130 K images. One work related to marine vessel recognition is [11], where 130, 000 random example images from the Shipspotting website [12] is utilized and a convolutional neural network [2] is trained for classifying vessel types. In our dataset, 140, 000 images are engaged for vessel type classification among 26 superclasses constructed using a semi-supervised clustering approach. Furthermore, constructed vessel superclasses are balanced; the training set is arranged to have an equal number of examples from each superclass, after augmenting data for vessel type classes with lower number of examples. However, there is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> examples among the classes in [11], which may result in a bias in classification towards the dominant classes with more examples.

We investigated the hypothesis that Fen may disrupt mitral valve interstitial cell (MVIC) homeostasis through its effects on mitogenesis and extracellular matrix biosynthesis. Normal and myxomatous mitral valves, both human and canine, were harvested, and primary MVIC cultures were established. 5 HT caused increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase in MVIC; Fen alone did not. However, Fen combined with 5 HT increased the level of MVIC extracellular signal-related kinase, when compared with 5 HT alone. In addition, MVIC mitogenesis per 3 H-thymidine (3 HTdR) demonstrated a 5 HT dose-dependent increase, with no effect of Fen alone. In contrast, Fen combined with 5 HT inhibited the MVIC 3 HTdR response when compared with 5 HT alone. Furthermore, fluoxetine, a 5 HT transporter inhibitor, while having no effect alone, suppressed Fen- 5 HT 3 HTdR inhibition when administered with Fen plus 5 HT. Finally, MVIC incorporations of 3 H-proline and 3 H-glucosamine, measures of extracellular matrix collagen and glycosaminoglycan respectively, were increased with 5 HT alone; however, Fen did not affect MVIC glycosaminoglycan or collagen either alone or in combination with 5 HT. Taken together, the ratios of 3 H-proline or 3 H-glycosaminoglycan to 3 HTdR in MVIC, normalized to 5 HT alone, demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> extracellular matrix production versus proliferation in MVIC cultures with Fen plus 5 HT exposure.

40|$|Visual {{selective}} {{attention is}} the fundamental cognitive ability to filter out irrele-vant sensory information in favor of relevant information. In order to make this possi-ble, an integration of exogenous, stimulus-dependent, and endogenous, context-dependent, attentional factors is necessary. The anatomical basis for this integration is formed by a highly complex network of cortical feedforward and feedback projections which connect areas at every sensory processing level. Lesions in distinct areas of this attention network lead to the clinical pathology of visual unilateral neglect, in which the failure of one network component results in the inability to orient or respond to stimuli appearing in the visual field contralateral to a lesion. Frequently, in humans {{as well as in}} animal models, a gradual improvement up to a complete restoration of the behavioral performance can be observed some time after the initial lesion. Based on findings from behavioral studies, {{it has been suggested that}} <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> neuronal activity levels between the two hemispheres and a resulting unequal distri-bution of limited attention capacities could be the neural basis of visual neglect.

To date, there are no neurophysiological studies in awake animals which consider the neglect syndrome and its recovery in the behavioral context.

One of the objectives {{of the study was to}} collect information on existing Child Rights and Protection policies and structures in five selected countries in the MENA region in addition to the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). The other aim of the study was to carry out a survey of the different child protection services within the oPt that target especially vulnerable groups of children. The methodology included a review of available documents on child protection systems in the five countries in the MENA region and in the oPt. For the survey on service providers, a questionnaire was designed and tested. Two hundred and thirty one institutions ranging from the Palestinian Authority, UNRWA, NGOs to the charitable sector were interviewed, mainly by telephone. Results show wide variations among the different countries analyzed, namely Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Tunisia, in their approaches to ensuring the rights and protection of children. A major difference lies with the reliance on governmental structures as opposed to nongovernmental ones, while no system has proven to be most effective. Each of these countries has one main body with the primary responsibility to monitor or ensure children’s rights. In the oPt, no such body exists. Structures are still rudimentary, with a lack of development and sustained coordination between the main stakeholders and the relevant sectors. The results of the mapping of child protection services in the oPt show that 26 % of these focus on disabilities (26 %) often targeting adults as well as children. Twenty-two percent of services target the poor, 20 % children without family care, 12 % victims of Israeli occupation and war, and 11 % abuse and neglect. Three percent of services address the needs of children in conflict with the law, 3 % child laborers, and 2 % provide support for children in Israeli detention. Finally, 4 organizations provide support for children with special problems: children with cancer and their families and victims of substance abuse. Of the institutions interviewed, 53 % are charitable organizations. Another 33 % of the institutions are Palestinian and international NGOs (60 % and 17 % of the institutions, respectively), with government institutions at 11 % and finally, UNRWA. The overall distribution <b>of</b> services reveals <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>imbalance</b> in favor <b>of</b> the West Bank over the Gaza Strip, with 72 % of the surveyed institutions located in the West Bank and only 28 % in the Gaza Strip. Distribution of services between districts and by locality is also uneven, leaving the bulk of the rural population most disadvantaged in terms of access to and quality of services. Only about half of the interviewees said they were aware of the Palestinian Child Law, while over 88 % of the interviewees reported they had heard of the concept of child protection. More than half of the service providers (55 %) said their institutions were unable to reach all children in need. As for challenges, the two most important ones are related to financial constraints (26 %) and the Israeli military occupation (26 %). Nearly a quarter of the respondents criticized the role of PA institutions, in particular for the lack of law implementation, policies and coordination especially with regard to special needs. In conclusion, the results show a concerted effort to address the issue of child protection in five of the Arab countries. A similar attempt is made in the oPt to address this issue within both the political and social context with NGO’s as the main service providers...|$|R

This is due to the <b>significant</b> <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> socioeconomic development among geographical regions, urban and rural regions, as well as labour market segmentation...|$|R
40|$|The Prime Minister {{recently}} {{pledges to}} make university admissions ‘name-blind’, responding to statistics which showed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> racial <b>imbalance</b> in terms <b>of</b> who is admitted to university, with obvious {{implications for social}} mobility, fairness, and access to higher education. Steven Jones argues that while this idea {{is in some ways}} sensible, it overlooks other more significant barriers when considering widening access...|$|R

[...] There is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>imbalance</b> on how Kovalyov views himself, and how the outside world perceives him. Rather than focusing on his inner appearance, all of his energy and thought goes towards maintaining his outward appearance. [...] "The collegiate assessor’s private and public faces seem almost unrelated." [...] This kind of portrayal of an average citizen of Saint Petersburg reflects Gogol's position as a transplant to the city, who views the social hierarchy of the city from an outside perspective.|$|R

We found evidence <b>of</b> <b>significant</b> <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> alpha- and beta-chain production particularly at short times of incubation. There was a progressive decrease in alpha/beta-chain production ratio with increasing incubation time which was due to a decreased rate of net alpha-chain production, indicating that {{a large proportion of}} the newly synthesized alpha chains are degraded, particularly in bone marrow, within a few minutes of synthesis, leading to relatively low alpha/beta ratios if these are measured solely at incubation times greater than 10 min. The significant degradation of excess alpha chains explains why inclusion body formation and ineffective erythropoiesis, notable in beta-thalassemia homozygotes where there is gross chain imbalance, are not observed to any marked degree in heterozygotes...|$|R
