500|$|McCartney {{said about}} the line [...] "I'd love to turn you on", which concludes both verse sections: [...] "This was the time of Tim Leary's 'Turn on, tune in, drop out' and we wrote, 'I'd love to turn you on.' John <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> each other a knowing look: 'Uh-huh, it's a drug song. You know that, don't you?'" [...] George Martin commented that he had always {{suspected}} that the line [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke" [...] was a drug reference, recalling how the Beatles would [...] "disappear and have a little puff", presumably of marijuana, but {{not in front of}} him. [...] "When [...] was doing his TV programme on Pepper", McCartney recalled later, [...] "he asked me, 'Do you know what caused Pepper?' I said, 'In one word, George, drugs. Pot.' And George said, 'No, no. But you weren't on it all the time.' 'Yes, we were.' Sgt. Pepper was a drug album." ...|$|E
500|$|Super Mario 64 {{features}} more puzzles than earlier Mario games. It was developed simultaneously with , but as Ocarina of Time was released {{more than two}} years later, some puzzles were taken for Super Mario 64. Information about Super Mario 64 leaked in November 1995, and a playable version of the game was presented days later as part of the Nintendo 64 premiere (then known as the [...] "Ultra 64") at Nintendo Space World. At this point, the basic controls had been implemented and the game was 50% finished, featuring 32 courses, though only about 2% of mapping was complete. Miyamoto had hoped to create more courses, but only 15 courses could fit. According to Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln, Miyamoto's desire to add more to the game was {{a major factor in the}} decision to delay the Nintendo 64 release from Christmas 1995 to April 1996. Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi later commented, [...] "Game creators can finish games quickly if they compromise. But users have sharp eyes. They soon know if the games are compromised. [...] asked for two more months <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> them to him unconditionally." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{began to}} grow {{suspicious}} that Secor was keeping the money from selling the tape, and contacted their lawyer – Joe Escalante of The Vandals, who also owned independent record label Kung Fu Records. The group informed as Escalante that they believed [...] "someone's bootlegging it," [...] and requested his legal help to stop Secor. In exchange for legal fees, Blink-182 would allow Escalante's label, Kung Fu, to re-release Buddha on compact disc. The band had told Secor to not sell any more copies of the tape, but they held suspicions that he had anyway. Anonymously, Escalante ordered a tape from Secor, and Secor sold it to him. The band asserted {{that they were not}} receiving royalties for these sales. [...] "I paid off all of the royalties for the remaining stash of tapes that I had of Buddha," [...] said Secor in 2001. [...] "It was about 25. The tapes sold for five bucks, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> them half of what their profit would be. I wanted to have a few to give to people and to have on hand." [...] Secor felt it was his right to sell his stock of the tape, as the band [...] "had been paid royalties for that already." ...|$|E

In an interview, Victor said, [...] "I hated that lady. I drew her a card once with a little rose on it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> it to her.

Hitchcock said he chose the two actresses to provide glamor, and later quipped, [...] "Claude Jade is a rather quiet young lady, but I wouldn't guarantee [...] about her behavior in a taxi".

2500|$|Medcalf has {{revealed}} to the Walford Gazette how she prepared for the role: [...] "I actually watched the show a bit when Danniella had been on so I had a distinct memory of her to work with. What I basically did was to read a prepared, detailed biography of the character which {{was provided by the}} production office. I did sit down to watch a five-minute clip of Danniella but I quickly realised I didn't want to carry on watching because I was afraid of falling into doing an imitation of her, d'ye know what I mean? I'll tell you something weird-when I first started getting the scripts I used to hear the lines first in my head with HER voice saying them! But that changed over time, thank God, as I hopefully made the character my own <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> her my voice." [...] Medcalf added that contrastingly to Westbrook, who played Sam as a young girl who was overprotected by her brothers and sheltered, she played Sam as a young woman [...] "trying to find her place both in a career and in relationships with the opposite sex." ...|$|E

2500|$|Harper's first album, Sophisticated Beggar, was {{recorded}} in 1966 after he was spotted at Les Cousins and signed to Strike Records. The album consisted of Harper's songs and poetry backed by acoustic guitar, recorded with a Revox tape machine by Pierre Tubbs and with contributions from English guitarist Paul Brett. [...] Columbia Records recognised Harper's potential and hired American producer Shel Talmy to produce Harper's second album, Come Out Fighting Ghengis Smith, which was released in 1968. The 11 minute track [...] "Circle", [...] "a soundscape of Harper's difficult youth", was notable for marking a widening of his musical style away from the more traditional side of contemporary folk music heard at the time. Harper {{had an interest in}} traditional folk but did not consider himself a bona fide member of the folk scene. He later explained: Harper's record company had different expectations. [...] "They wanted me to write commercial pop songs and when they heard the album I made for them, they didn’t have a clue. They wanted hits. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> them [...] "Circle"". Bert Jansch contributed sleeve notes for the album and Harper paid tribute to Jansch with the song [...] "Pretty Baby"; the B-Side non album track of his first single (released in March 1966). During this period, Harper was managed by American music entrepreneur Jo Lustig, manager of The Pentangle and former agent to Julie Felix.|$|E
