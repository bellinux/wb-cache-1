50|$|Robert Blair was {{the first}} Regius Professor of Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh (1785 until death). He invented the <b>aplanatic</b> lens and also coined this term. This was a {{significant}} step in reducing the aberration in optical systems. He also experimented with hollow lenses, holding different solutions.|$|E
50|$|Coma of {{a single}} lens or a system of lenses can be {{minimized}} (and in some cases eliminated) by choosing the curvature of the lens surfaces to match the application. Lenses in which both spherical aberration and coma are minimized at a single wavelength are called bestform or <b>aplanatic</b> lenses.|$|E
5000|$|As Descartes discovered, Cartesian ovals {{may be used}} in lens design. By {{choosing}} the ratio of distances from [...] and [...] to match the ratio of sines in Snell's law, and using thesurface of revolution of one of these ovals, it is possible to design a so-called <b>aplanatic</b> lens, that has no spherical aberration.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} are the multichannel or stepped flow-line optics {{in which}} light is split into several [...] "channels" [...] and then recombined again {{into a single}} output. <b>Aplanatic</b> (a particular case of SMS) versions of these designs have also been developed. The main application of this method is {{in the design of}} ultra-compact optics.|$|E
5000|$|Grubb Glacier (...) is {{a glacier}} flowing into Lester Cove, Andvord Bay, {{to the west}} of Bagshawe Glacier, on the west coast of Graham Land, Antarctica. The glacier appears on an Argentine {{government}} chart of 1952. It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1960 for Thomas Grubb, an Irish optician who designed and introduced the first <b>aplanatic</b> camera lens, in 1857.|$|E
50|$|Hans Wolter (11 May 1911 - 17 August 1978) was a German {{physicist}} {{who designed}} an <b>aplanatic</b> system of grazing incidence mirrors that satisfied the Abbe sine condition (i.e. free of both spherical aberration and coma).Wolter showed {{such a system}} could be produced {{using a combination of}} a paraboloid with either a hyperboloid or ellipsoid secondary. The three simplest designs are outlined and are known as Wolter telescopes of types I, II and III.|$|E

5000|$|Steinheil Point (...) {{is a point}} 5 {{nautical}} miles (9 km) southeast of Duthiers Point {{on the west side}} of Andvord Bay, on the west coast of Graham Land. First roughly charted by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition under Gerlache, 1897-99. Named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1960 for Adolf Steinheil (1832-1893), German mathematical optician who designed and introduced an improved <b>aplanatic</b> camera lens in 1866 and, independently, the telephoto lens in 1891.|$|E
50|$|Dark {{field and}} phase {{contrast}} setups {{are based on}} an Abbe, <b>aplanatic,</b> or achromatic condenser, but to the light path add a dark field stop or various size phase rings. These additional elements are housed in various ways. In most modern microscope (ca. 1990s-), such elements are housed in sliders that fit into a slot between the illuminator and the condenser lens. Many older microscopes house these elements in a turret-type condenser, these elements are housed in a turret below the condenser lens and rotated into place.|$|E
50|$|The Abbe {{condenser}} {{is named}} for its inventor Ernst Abbe, who developed it in 1870. The Abbe condenser, which was originally designed for Zeiss, is mounted below {{the stage of the}} microscope. The condenser concentrates and controls the light that passes through the specimen prior to entering the objective. It has two controls, one which moves the Abbe condenser closer to or further from the stage, and another, the iris diaphragm, which controls the diameter of the beam of light. The controls can be used to optimize brightness, evenness of illumination, and contrast. Abbe condensers are difficult to use for magnifications of above 400X, as the <b>aplanatic</b> cone is only representative of an NA 0.6.|$|E
5000|$|The stand {{was made}} by an {{employee}} of Tulley, James Smith, and is preserved in the Wellcome Institute. Smith set up on his own in 1837, later taking on Richard Beck, a nephew of Lister, as an apprentice finally becoming a partner in 1847 when the company was renamed Smith & Beck.Lister published his work in 1830 in a paper entitled [...] "On Some Properties in Achromatic Object-Glasses Applicable to the Improvement of the Microscope" [...] submitted to the Royal Society, and collaborated with Smith and with Andrew Ross, who had established {{what was to become}} one of the finest microscope manufacturers in 1832. Lister's law of <b>aplanatic</b> foci remained the underlying principle of microscopic science.|$|E
50|$|A {{spherical lens}} has an <b>aplanatic</b> point (i.e., no spherical aberration) {{only at a}} radius that equals the radius of the sphere divided by the index of {{refraction}} of the lens material. A typical value of refractive index for crown glass is 1.5 (see list), which indicates that only about 43% of the area (67% of diameter) of a spherical lens is useful. It is often {{considered to be an}} imperfection of telescopes and other instruments which makes their focusing less than ideal due to the spherical shape of lenses and mirrors. This is an important effect, because spherical shapes are much easier to produce than aspherical ones. In many cases, it is cheaper to use multiple spherical elements to compensate for spherical aberration than it is to use a single aspheric lens.|$|E
50|$|In 1930 Maksutov {{established}} the Laboratory of Astronomical Optics at the State Optical Institute of Leningrad and led it until 1952. This laboratory {{was one of}} the leading astronomical research groups in the USSR. While there he published Анаберрационные отражающие поверхности и системы и новые способы их испытания reflective surfaces and systems and new methods of testing them (1932), in which he analyzed <b>aplanatic</b> double mirror systems and introduced the compensating method, which he proposed as early as 1924. This became the main control method of mirror study along with the shadow method. In 1944 he became a professor {{as a result of his}} famous paper, and from 1946 a Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. From 1952 he worked in Pulkovo Observatory. Maksutov died in what was then Leningrad (aka St. Petersburg) in 1964.|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} for the reproduction of a surface element {{in the place of}} a sharply reproduced point — the constant of the sine relationship must also be fulfilled with large apertures for several colors. E. Abbe succeeded in computing microscope objectives free from error of the axis point and satisfying the sine {{condition for}} several colors, which therefore, according to his definition, were <b>aplanatic</b> for several colors; such systems he termed apochromatic. While, however, the magnification of the individual zones is the same, it is not the same for red as for blue; and there is a chromatic difference of magnification. This is produced in the same amount, but in the opposite sense, by the oculars, which Abbe used with these objectives (compensating oculars), so that it is eliminated {{in the image of the}} whole microscope. The best telescope objectives, and photographic objectives intended for three-color work, are also apochromatic, even if they do not possess quite the same quality of correction as microscope objectives do. The chromatic differences of other errors of reproduction have seldom practical importances.|$|E
50|$|If rays issuing from O (fig. 1) be concurrent, it {{does not}} follow that points in a portion of a plane {{perpendicular}} at O to the axis will be also concurrent, even if the part of the plane be very small. With a considerable aperture, the neighboring point N will be reproduced, but attended by aberrations comparable in magnitude to ON. These aberrations are avoided if, according to Abbe, the sine condition, sin u'1/sin u1=sin u'2/sin u2, holds for all rays reproducing the point O. If the object point O is infinitely distant, u1 and u2 are to be replaced by h1 and h2, the perpendicular heights of incidence; the sine condition then becomes sin u'1/h1=sin u'2/h2. A system fulfilling this condition and free from spherical aberration is called <b>aplanatic</b> (Greek a-, privative, plann, a wandering). This word was first used by Robert Blair (d. 1828), professor of practical astronomy at Edinburgh University, to characterize a superior achromatism, and, subsequently, by many writers to denote freedom from spherical aberration. Both the aberration of axis points, and the deviation from the sine condition, rapidly increase in most (uncorrected) systems with the aperture.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} the efficacy of two types of contact lenses (spherical disposable and <b>aplanatic)</b> as treatment in a patient with esotropia with a high Accommodative Convergence/Accommodation Ratio (AC/A). Due to the possibility of the appearance of accommodative insufficiency in this kind of patient, (i. e., following many years of bifocal glasses use), the elimination of the plus addition lens is advisable. Nevertheless, in some patients, this change leads to the appearance of a residual angle of esodeviation in near vision. It was expected that monofocal <b>aplanatic</b> contact lenses could achieve, due to their optical characteristics, an accurate and orthotropic binocular alignment, without aggravating an undesirable manifestation of the accommodative insufficiency. METHODS: An experimental design of a single case (N= 1) was used in which the subject acted as his own control. With bifocal glasses the subject displayed stability in his binocular and accommodative system at every distance of vision for the past three years. We compared the efficacy of two different types of hydrophilic contact lenses to control the angle of deviation, both at distance and at near vision. RESULTS: Neither of the two contact lenses produced the results of stability and the correct binocular alignment that had been achieved with bifocal glasses. This subject experienced a worse manifest esodeviation in distance vision with <b>aplanatic</b> lenses than with the disposable ones. CONCLUSIONS: These monofocal contact lenses did not create acceptable binocular alignment and stability in a subject with a high AC/A accommodative esotropia...|$|E
