60|$|It {{was evident}} that Athelny would. It was {{interesting}} to see the ascendency which the uneducated woman, bound to him by no legal tie, had acquired over the brilliant, unstable man. Mrs. Athelny treated Philip with motherly kindness {{now that he was}} in a different position, and he was touched by her anxiety that he should make a good meal. It was the solace of his life (and when he grew used to it, the monotony of it was what chiefly appalled him) that he could go every Sunday to that friendly house. It was a joy to sit in the stately Spanish chairs and discuss all manner of things with Athelny. Though his condition seemed so desperate he never left him to go back to Harrington Street without a feeling of exultation. At first Philip, in order not to forget what he had learned, tried to go on reading his medical books, but he found it useless; he could not fix his attention on them after the exhausting work of the day; and it seemed hopeless to continue working when he did not know in how long he would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hospital. He dreamed constantly {{that he was in the}} wards. The awakening was painful. The sensation of other people sleeping in the room was inexpressibly irksome to him; he had been used to solitude, and to be with others always, never to be by himself for an instant was at these moments horrible to him. It was then that he found it most difficult to combat his despair. He saw himself going on with that life, first to the right, second on the left, madam, indefinitely; and having to be thankful if he was not sent away: the men who had gone to the war would be coming home soon, the firm had guaranteed to take them back, and this must mean that others would be sacked; he would have to stir himself even to keep the wretched post he had.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} case, {{the patient had}} {{deranged}} coagulation, fever, and elevated CRP, {{and in the absence}} of infection or others diagnoses, malignancy was presumed to be the cause. Tumor-produced inflammatory cytokines sometimes cause fever, which is commonly seen in hematologic disease, but also occurs in solid tumors.
