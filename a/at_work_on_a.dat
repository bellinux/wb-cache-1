500|$|Many dog writers {{after the}} early 19th century {{seem to agree}} {{that there were two}} {{varieties}} of terrier existing in Britain at the time—a rough-haired so-called Scotch Terrier and a smooth-haired English Terrier. Thomas Brown, in his Biological Sketches and Authentic Anecdotes of Dogs (1829), states that [...] "the Scotch terrier is certainly the purest in point of breed and the (smooth) English seems to have been produced by a cross from him". [...] Brown went on to describe the Scotch Terrier as [...] "low in stature, with a strong muscular body, short stout legs, a head large in proportion to the body" [...] and was [...] "generally of a sandy colour or black" [...] with a [...] "long, matted and hard" [...] coat. [...] Although the Scotch Terrier described here is more generic than specific to a breed, it asserts the existence of a small, hard, rough-coated terrier developed for hunting small game in the Scottish Highlands in the early 19th century; a description that shares characteristics with what was once known as the Aberdeen Terrier and is today known as the Scottish Terrier. In addition, the paintings of Sir Edwin Landseer and an 1835 lithograph entitled [...] "Scottish Terriers <b>at</b> <b>Work</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Cairn in the West Highlands" [...] both depict Scottie type terriers very similar to those described in the first Scottish Terrier Standard.|$|E
500|$|Osborne {{was already}} <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new play, The Entertainer, an allegory of Britain's post-colonial decline, centred on a seedy variety comedian, Archie Rice. Having {{read the first}} act—all that was {{completed}} by then—Olivier asked to be cast in the part. He had for years maintained that he might easily have been a third-rate comedian called [...] "Larry Oliver", and would sometimes play the character at parties. Behind Archie's brazen façade there is a deep desolation, and Olivier caught both aspects, switching, {{in the words of}} the biographer Anthony Holden, [...] "from a gleefully tacky comic routine to moments of the most wrenching pathos". Tony Richardson's production for the English Stage Company transferred from the Royal Court to the Palace Theatre in September 1957; after that it toured and returned to the Palace. The role of Archie's daughter Jean was taken by three actresses during the various runs. The second of them was Joan Plowright, with whom Olivier began a relationship that endured for the rest of his life. Olivier said that playing Archie [...] "made me feel like a modern actor again". In finding an avant-garde play that suited him, he was, as Osborne remarked, far ahead of Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, who did not successfully follow his lead for more than a decade. Their first substantial successes in works by any of Osborne's generation were Alan Bennett's Forty Years On (Gielgud in 1968) and David Storey's Home (Richardson and Gielgud in 1970).|$|E
