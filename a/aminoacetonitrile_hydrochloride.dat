40|$|Indolizines and pyrroles are {{considered}} as “privileged” structures since their skeletons {{were found in}} many biologically active natural products and they possess {{a wide range of}} pharmaceutical properties. Syntheses of these small drug-like molecules are very important in medicinal chemistry. However, most existent methodologies are usually limited to specific substitution patterns or require impractical starting materials or expensive catalysts. Therefore, developing new methodologies for the synthesis of indolizines and pyrroles from commercially available or readily accessible sources is highly desirable. rnIn this PhD thesis, several methods has been described for the synthesis of indolizines and pyrroles. In the first part, indolizines carrying substituents in positions 1 - 3 were synthesized via a formal [3 + 2]-cycloaddition of pyridinium ylides and nitroalkenes. Pyridinium salts were prepared by N-alkylation of pyridines with cyanohydrin triflates which could be prepared from corresponding aldehydes via a Strecker reaction followed by O-triflylation. Nitroalkenes were simply prepared from the corresponding aldehydes and nitroalkanes in a nitroaldol condensation. Overall, this modular approach allows to construct the indolizine framework with various substitution patterns starting from a pyridine, two different aldehydes and a nitroalkane. In contrast to reported methods, the produced indolizines do not have to contain an electron-withdrawing group. rnIt has also been found that nitrile-stabilized 2 -alkylpyridinium ylides cyclize to unstable 2 -aminoindolizines via an intramolecular 5 -exo-dig cyclization. Using an in situ acetylation of the amino group, N-protected 2 -aminoindolizines could be synthesized. As a less common substitution pattern, indolizines carrying substituents in positions 5 – 8 were synthesized from enones and 2 -(1 H-pyrrol- 1 -yl) nitriles obtained from α-aminonitriles using a modified Paal-Knorr pyrrole synthesis. The decoration of the pyridine unit in the indolizine skeleton has been achieved by a one-pot conjugate addition/cycloaromatization sequence. rnIn {{the second part of the}} thesis, the diversity-oriented synthesis of pyrroles from 3, 5 -diaryl substituted 2 H-pyrrole- 2 -carbonitriles (cyanopyrrolines) obtained in a cyclocondensation of enones with <b>aminoacetonitrile</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is being discussed. 2, 4 -Di-, 2, 3, 5 -trisubstituted pyrroles, pyrrole- 2 -carbonitriles and 2, 2 ’-bipyrroles were synthesized in a one- or two-step protocol. While the microwave-assisted thermal elimination of HCN from cyanopyrrolines gave 2, 4 -disubstituted pyrroles, DDQ-oxidation of the same intermediates furnished pyrrole- 2 -carbonitriles. Furthermore, 2, 3, 5 -trisubstituted pyrroles were obtained via a C- 2 -alkylation of the deprotonated cyanopyrrolines followed by the elimination of HCN. Finally, it has also been found that tetraaryl substituted 2, 2 ’-bipyrroles could be synthesized by the oxidative dimerization of cyanopyrrolines using copper (II) acetate at 100 °C. r...|$|E
