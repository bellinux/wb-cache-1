5|$|Aside from {{professional}} wrestling performances, celebrity involvement {{has been a}} major key in the production of WrestleMania events. WWE involves celebrities in the WrestleMania events to gain more hype and media attention for the event, in this way receiving more <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> event, pay-per-view buys, and ticket sales. The celebrities involved with WrestleMania events have come from a range of occupations, including singing, acting, professional boxing, and modeling, and usually appear in non-wrestling roles, such as singing, promoting a subject, or managing wrestlers at ringside. There have been exceptions, however, in which celebrities have had a professional wrestling role.|$|E
5|$|Rodriquez had {{initially}} refused {{to audition for}} the series as {{he wanted to be}} a part of the 2000 drama The Street instead. After being contacted repeatedly by All Souls producers, he read for the parts of Fortado and Sterling; he had to go through the lines a total of five times. During the audition, he met and talked to Aaron Spelling. After failing to be cast in The Street, Rodriquez committed to portraying Fortado. He said that his main <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> television project was the ability to work on a show produced by Spelling.

5|$|Titanium was {{discovered}} in 1791 by the clergyman and amateur geologist, William Gregor, as an inclusion of a mineral in Cornwall, Great Britain. Gregor recognized {{the presence of a}} new element in ilmenite when he found black sand by a stream and noticed the sand was attracted by a magnet. Analyzing the sand, he determined the presence of two metal oxides: iron oxide (explaining the <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> magnet) and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify. Realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match any known element, Gregor reported his findings to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall and in the German science journal Crell's Annalen.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metal cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes (+); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
5|$|Rudy's <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> veterinarian's wife {{leads to}} them having consensual sex {{in front of}} her husband. Humiliated, the vet hangs himself in a motel bathroom. Rudy and Fran move on, barely {{acknowledging}} the suicide. They check into an El Paso hotel used by criminals as a safe house because Rudy knows that the McCoys will be heading to the same place. When Doc and Carol check in at the hotel, they ask for food to be delivered, but the manager, Laughlin, says he is working alone and cannot leave the desk. Doc soon realizes that Laughlin sent his family away because something is about to happen. He urges Carol to dress quickly so they can escape. An armed Rudy comes to their door while Fran poses as a delivery girl who needs to be paid for the food. Peering from an adjacent doorway, Doc is surprised to see Rudy alive. He sneaks up behind Rudy, knocks him out, and does the same to Fran.|$|E

5|$|Poole Quay is {{a visitor}} <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{south of the}} town centre lined {{with a mixture of}} {{traditional}} public houses, new bars, redeveloped warehouses, modern apartment blocks and historic listed buildings. Once the busy centre of Poole's maritime industry, all port activities moved to Hamworthy in the 1970s as the Quay became increasingly popular with tourists. The Grade II* listed Customs House on the quay-front was built in 1814 and now functions as a restaurant and bar. Nearby the Grade I listed Town Cellars, a medieval warehouse built in the 15th century on the foundations of a 14th-century stone building, houses a local history centre. Scaplen's Court, another Grade I listed building, also dates from the medieval era. Poole Pottery has been redeveloped into an apartment block. Boats regularly depart from the quay during the summer and provide cruises around the harbour and to Brownsea Island, the River Frome and Swanage. Public artworks along the Quay include Sea Music – a large metal sculpture designed by Sir Anthony Caro, and a life-size bronze sculpture of Robert Baden-Powell created to celebrate the founding of the Scout Movement on Brownsea Island. At the western end of the quay near the mouth of Holes Bay is Poole Bridge. Built in 1927, it is the third bridge to be located on the site since 1834.|$|E

25|$|Magnus Hirschfeld {{argued that}} adult sexual {{orientation}} {{can be explained}} in terms of the bisexual nature of the developing fetus: he believed that in every embryo there is one rudimentary neutral center for attraction to males and another for attraction to females. In most fetuses, the center for <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opposite sex developed while the center for <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same sex regressed, but in fetuses that became homosexual, the reverse occurred. Simon LeVay has criticized Hirschfeld's theory of an early bisexual stage of development, calling it confusing; LeVay maintains that Hirschfeld failed to distinguish between saying that the brain is sexually undifferentiated at an early stage of development and saying that an individual actually experiences sexual attraction to both men and women. According to LeVay, Hirschfeld believed that in most bisexual people the strength of <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same sex was relatively low, and that it was therefore possible to restrain its development in young people, something Hirschfeld supported.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> {{influence}} of athlete leadership behaviors on perceptions of team cohesion. The participants were 315 athletes from 26 varsity and club teams. Each participant completed the Group Environment Questionnaire (Carron, Widmeyer, 2 ̆ 6 Brawley, 1985), which assessed cohesion and the Leadership Scale for Sport (Chelladurai 2 ̆ 6 Saleh, 1980) that assessed athlete leadership behaviors. Because athletes are nested within teams, a multilevel multivariate analysis was used <b>to</b> analyze <b>the</b> data at the individual and team level. Overall, it was found that Training and Instruction, and Social Support positively influenced all four dimensions of cohesion (Individual <b>Attractions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Group - Task, Individual <b>Attractions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Group - Social, Group Integration -Task and Group Integration - Social). Furthermore, Autocratic Behavior was negatively associated with the four dimensions of cohesion. Finally, Democratic Behaviour was positively related <b>to</b> Individual <b>Attractions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Group - Task. Findings from the present study provide coaches and sport psychologist with evidence that it is important <b>to</b> foster <b>the</b> development of athlete leader behaviors in order <b>to</b> influence <b>the</b> team environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} whether perceptions of cohesion served as a mediator between motivation and future participation (operationalized as intention <b>to</b> return). <b>The</b> participants were 162 intramural athletes participating in various team sport activities.

25|$|Hydrogen {{can be used}} in cars in two ways: {{a source}} of {{combustible}} heat, or a source of electrons for an electric motor. The burning of hydrogen is not being developed in practical terms; it is the hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicle (HFEV) which is garnering all the attention. Hydrogen fuel cells create electricity fed into an electric motor to drives the wheels. Hydrogen is not burned, but it is consumed. This means molecular hydrogen, H2, is combined with oxygen to form water. 2H2 (4e−) + O2 --> 2H2O (4e−). The molecular hydrogen and oxygen's mutual affinity drives the fuel cell to separate the electrons from the hydrogen, to use them to power the electric motor, and to return them to the ionized water molecules that were formed when the electron-depleted hydrogen combined with the oxygen in the fuel cell. Recalling that a hydrogen atom {{is nothing more than a}} proton and an electron; in essence, the motor is driven by the proton's atomic <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> oxygen nucleus, and the electron's <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ionized water molecule.|$|E
