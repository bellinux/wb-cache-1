25|$|Pharmaceutical formulation, in pharmaceutics, is {{the process}} in which {{different}} chemical substances, including the <b>active</b> <b>drug,</b> are combined to produce a final medicinal product. The word formulation is often used {{in a way that}} includes dosage form.|$|E
40|$|Adrenergically <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) include the alpha-agonists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclics and the selective noradrenergic re-uptake inhibitors. In addition to a longer duration of treatment effect than the predominantly dopaminergic psychostimulant drugs, a theoretical advantage of the adrenergically <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> is a lesser tendency to aggravate common comorbidities of ADHD, such as anxiety, obsessionality, depression and tics. Nevertheless, adrenergically <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> have always been considered second-line treatments to the psychostimulant drugs. No study has demonstrated superiority of adrenergically <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> over the psychostimulants in reducing the core symptoms of ADHD, although several small trials have suggested 'equivalence'. The case for superiority of the adrenergically <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> over psychostimulants in alleviating comorbid symptoms remains largely unproven, as there have been few comparative trials. Safety data have favoured the psychostimulant drugs. The advantage of once daily or morning and evening dosing of the adrenergically <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> has been diminished since the introduction of sustained release preparations of methylphenidate and amphetamine. Although adrenergically <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> may be the preferred treatment in the presence of severe comorbidity, {{for the most part they}} remain second-line treatment for ADHD...|$|R

25|$|The two {{extremes}} of this spectrum are the poor metabolizers and ultra-rapid metabolizers. Efficacy of a medication {{is not only}} based on the above metabolic statuses, but also the type of drug consumed. Drugs can be classified into two main groups: <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> and prodrugs. <b>Active</b> <b>drugs</b> refer to drugs that are inactivated during metabolism, and prodrugs are inactive until they are metabolized.|$|R
25|$|Another {{important}} medical {{application of}} a simulator—although, perhaps, denoting a slightly different meaning of simulator—is {{the use of a}} placebo drug, a formulation that simulates the <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> in trials of drug efficacy (see Placebo (origins of technical term)).|$|E
25|$|MJIB {{officers}} {{are equipped with}} a strong laboratory-testing capacity regarding controlled substances. This gives a necessary advantage and training for the investigators of MJIB. However, the police forces in the ROC still maintain several <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> enforcement squads at the local police departments and the Criminal Investigation Bureau of NPA.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} serious doubts about the used methods and the {{interpretation}} of the results, especially the use of 0.5 as cut-off point for the effect-size. A complete reanalysis and recalculation based on the same FDA data discovered that the Kirsch study suffered from important flaws in the calculations. The authors concluded that although {{a large percentage of the}} placebo response was due to expectancy, this was not true for the <b>active</b> <b>drug.</b> Besides confirming drug effectiveness, they found that the drug effect was not related to depression severity.|$|E

25|$|Azathioprine is a prodrug, a {{substance}} {{that is not an}} <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> itself but is activated in the body. This happens in several steps; at first it is slowly and almost completely converted to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) by reductive cleavage of the thioether (–S–). This is mediated by glutathione and similar compounds in the intestinal wall, the liver and on red blood cells, without the aid of enzymes. 6-MP is metabolized analogously to natural purines, giving thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP) and thio-deoxyguanosine triphosphate (TdGTP) via thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP) and several further intermediates. On a second path, the sulfur atom of 6-MP and TIMP is methylated. The end products of azathioprine metabolism are thiouric acid (38%) and various methylated and hydroxylated purines, which are excreted via the urine.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the <b>active</b> <b>drug.</b> The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E

40|$|Background. There {{is little}} {{information}} about the efficacy of <b>active</b> alternative <b>drugs</b> to carbapenems except beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors {{for the treatment of}} bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E). The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the outcomes of patients with BSI due to ESBL-E who received empiric therapy with such <b>drugs</b> (other <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> [OADs]) or carbapenems...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{question}} has been raised whether {{the use of the}} plant itself produces [...] "severe psychological or physical dependence" [...] as required by a schedule I or even schedule II criterion. Since there is still a considerable void in our knowledge of the plant and effects of the <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> contained in it, our recommendation is that marijuana be retained within schedule I at least until the completion of certain studies now underway to resolve the issue.|$|E
2500|$|Appropriate use of {{a placebo}} in a {{clinical}} trial often requires or at least benefits from a double-blind study design, which means that neither the experimenters nor the subjects know which subjects are in the [...] "test group" [...] and which are in the [...] "control group". This creates a problem in creating placebos that can be mistaken for active treatments. It therefore can be necessary to use a psychoactive placebo, a drug that produces physiological effects that encourage {{the belief in the}} control groups that they have received an <b>active</b> <b>drug.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Liver {{transplantation}} is {{a potential}} treatment for many acute or chronic condition which cause irreversible and severe liver dysfunction, provided that the recipient does not have other conditions that will preclude a successful transplant. Such contraindications may include advanced age, serious heart or lung disease. Several circumstances are considered [...] "absolute" [...] contraindications, such as metastatic cancer outside of the liver, <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> or alcohol abuse, and active systemic infections. While HIV infection was once considered an absolute contraindication, this has been changing recently. may also prevent transplantation (relative contraindications). Some centers use the Milan criteria to select patients with liver cancers for liver transplantation.|$|E

40|$|The {{causes of}} {{antibiotic}} resistance are often complex {{and it is}} difficult to identify strategies to prevent or delay its emergence. One strategy has been to use less active members of a drug class, so that when resistance develops the more active members will still prevail. This stratagem may often fail because this resistance may form the basis of resistance to the whole class. Often, less <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> are the first to be discovered and more active versions follow, so we have had no choice; however, increasingly less <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> are available to deal with specific infections and this may have a detri-mental effect on the class as a whole...|$|R
2500|$|It is {{unlikely}} that formulation studies will be complete by the time clinical trials commence. This means that simple preparations are developed initially for use in phase I clinical trials. These typically consist of hand-filled capsules containing {{a small amount of}} the drug and a diluent. Proof of the long-term stability of these formulations is not required, as they will be used (tested) in a matter of days. Consideration has to be given to what is known as [...] "drug loading" [...] - the ratio of the <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> to the total contents of the dose. A low drug load may cause homogeneity problems. A high drug load may pose flow problems or require large capsules if the compound has a low bulk density.|$|E
2500|$|Nanotechnology {{is helpful}} in {{delivering}} drugs and other molecules across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). [...] Nanoparticles allow drugs, or other foreign molecules, to efficiently cross the BBB by camouflaging themselves and tricking the brain into {{providing them with}} the ability to cross the BBB in a process called the Trojan Horse Method. [...] Using nanotechnology is advantageous because only the engineered complex is necessary whereas in ordinary applications the active compound must carry out the reaction. This allows for maximum efficacy of the <b>active</b> <b>drug.</b> Also, the use of nanoparticles results in the attraction of proteins to the surfaces of cells, giving cell membranes a biological identity. They also use endogenous active transport where transferrin, an iron binding protein, is linked to rod-shaped semiconductor nanocrystals, in order to move across the BBB into the brain. This discovery is a promising development towards designing an efficient nanoparticle-based drug delivery system.|$|E

50|$|If the <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> is metabolized by the {{inhibited}} enzyme, {{then the}} fruit {{will stop the}} drug being metabolized, leaving elevated concentrations of the medication in the body, which can cause adverse effects.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{search for}} new <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> that can {{alleviate}} or cure different diseases is a constant challenge to researchers in the biological area and to the pharmaceutical industry. Historically, {{research has focused on}} the study of substances from plants. More recently, however, animal venoms have been attracting attention and studies have been successful in addressing treatment of accidents. Furthermore, venoms and their toxins have been considered good tools for prospecting for new <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> or models for new therapeutic drugs. In this review, we discuss some possibilities of using different toxins, especially those from arachnid venoms, which have shown some potential application in diseases involving pain, hypertension, epilepsy and erectile dysfunction. A new generation of drugs is likely to emerge from peptides, including those found in animal venoms...|$|R
40|$|Vagina {{is one of}} {{the best}} routes for drugs {{administration}} like contraceptive steroids, metronidazole, anti-retroviral, etc. An intra-vaginal controlled-release drug delivery system is an effective means for achieving a continuous delivery of therapeutic agents, not only the systemically <b>active</b> <b>drugs,</b> such as contraceptive steroids, but also the locally <b>active</b> <b>drugs,</b> such as metronidazole and other drugs like Zidovudine, Lamivudine, etc. This continuous “infusion” of drugs through the vaginal mucosa can prevent the possibility of hepato-gastrointestinal first-pass metabolism gastric irritation of drugs and fluctuation of dosaging interval. The advantage of intra-vaginal controlled drug administration over conventional/traditional oral administration is the drug absorbed systemically, because due to the presence of dense network of blood vessels in vaginal wall.
