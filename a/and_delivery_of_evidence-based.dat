Method: The Therapy Process Observational Coding System for Child Psychotherapy – Revised Strategies Scale (McLeod et al., 2015) was used to characterize therapeutic interventions delivered within and outside of the Coping Cat program with youths aged 7 - 15 receiving treatment in one efficacy (n = 51; 41 % female; 84 % Caucasian, M age = 10. 37) and one effectiveness (n = 17; 56 % female, 39 % Caucasian, M age = 10. 90) trial. Youth- and parent-report symptom checklists and diagnostic interviews were used to assess symptom and diagnostic remission. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses and hierarchical binomial logistic regression were used to investigate the relation between adherence and differentiation and symptom change and remission of principal diagnosis. Results: Neither adherence nor differentiation were significantly related to symptom or diagnostic outcomes. No clear trend emerged, and results were inconsistent across parent and youth report, outcome type, and setting. Conclusion: These results are consistent with past literature.

40|$|Information {{literacy}} (IL) {{within an}} everyday life context {{is connected to}} searching for, critically evaluating and using information effectively. Everyday life IL is {{about being able to}} address a range of information needs (e. g., financial, health, or legal) that relate to everyday practices as well as making informed decisions that are of significant value to individuals and communities. IL is regarded as an important condition for civic participation and engagement, informed citizenship, health, well-being and, generally, people's quality of life (Leung, 2010). However, compared to the vast amount of IL research within educational and workplace settings, there has been relatively little research conducted so far on examining the effective use of information and its impact in relation to people's everyday life situations. For example, although IL has been researched within quite diverse contexts and with a variety of foci, such as age (e. g., older adults/fourth age/retired people, young people/men, early years/preschool, nursery, aging women), different roles (e. g., parents, retired, citizens) and situations (e. g. pregnant women, immigrants, unemployed, job seekers, carers, health issues), the literature lacks a holistic view to this body of research. In addition, so far, IL in everyday life context has received less attention in terms of empirical research when compared to other conceptual lenses that have been adopted within the wider spectrum of user-focused information research, such as that of information seeking behaviour, that do not address the critical positioning and value of IL. Thus, this paper presents a critical review of relevant literature on everyday life IL. It seeks to offer a snapshot of existing research within this area and aims to develop a research agenda for further exploration of the growing everyday life IL domain. We based the review on literature published between 2000 - 2016 and sourced from a range of different databases (Science Direct, Library and Information Science and Technology Abstracts, ERIC, Emerald, ABI/Inform, Library and Information Science Abstracts, Library Literature and Information Science, and Google Scholar). We conducted the search using two terms, 'information literacy' and 'everyday life' in all search fields of the individual databases. Additional related terms, such as 'community', were found to be closely connected to other contexts, for example, that of education and the workplace, which were {{beyond the scope of this}} research. We also excluded from the retrieved results articles that focused directly on students' education and the workplace. Our paper emphasises the importance of examining IL within different everyday life settings and highlights existing gaps that need further development in terms of empirical research. A comprehensive review of everyday life IL research is particularly of importance since it will help us understand the diversity and the dynamic nature of IL needs and activities. It will also help us highlight the implications of the lack of IL and identify the key players in the advocacy of IL within different everyday life settings. The review suggests that the outcome of everyday life IL research has the potential to inform the design <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence-based</b> information services offered by decision makers and practitioners in different sectors and communities (Yates and Partridge, 2014).

We examined {{the feasibility of}} using practice facilitation to assist federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to increase colorectal cancer screening rates in North Carolina. MethodsThe intervention consisted of 12 months of facilitation in 3 FQHCs. We conducted chart audits to obtain data on changes in documented recommendation for colorectal cancer screening and completed screening. Key informant interviews provided qualitative data on barriers to and facilitators of implementing office systems. ResultsOverall, the percentage of eligible patients with a documented colorectal cancer screening recommendation increased from 15 % to 29 % (P <. 001). The percentage of patients up to date with colorectal cancer screening rose from 23 % to 34 % (P =. 03). Key informants in all 3 clinics said the implementation support from the practice facilitator was critical for initiating or improving office systems and that modifying the electronic medical record was the biggest challenge and most time-consuming aspect of implementing office systems changes. Other barriers were staff turnover and reluctance {{on the part of}} local gastroenterology practices to perform free or low-cost diagnostic colonoscopies for uninsured or underinsured patients. ConclusionPractice facilitation is a feasible, acceptable, and promising approach for supporting universal colorectal cancer screening in FQHCs.

40|$|Aim. This paper {{describes}} {{the evolution of}} Australian practice nursing and documents seminal events in crystallizing {{the importance of the}} nursing role in general practice. Background. Internationally, the potential for nurses to improve health in primary care settings is acknowledged. The general practice setting is a focal point for primary care in many health systems. Despite the important role played in the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> primary health care by nurses working in general practice in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the role of nurses in Australian general practice is much less clearly defined, as reflected by the paucity of research and scholarship in this area. Fuelled by the increasing challenges of workforce shortages and the increasing need for multidisciplinary care, interest in the developing role of the Australian practice nurse among clinicians, researchers and policy makers is increasing. Discussion. Australian practice nursing has reached a critical point in its evolution. It is imperative for the promotion of nursing in general practice that knowledge from descriptive, exploratory research be used to inform strategic decision-making in terms of professional development issues, policy, research and scholarship. These data also need to inform systematic outcome studies. To date, the embryonic nature of practice nursing as a discrete professional entity in Australia has inhibited its representation in nursing curricula and professional bodies. Conclusion. In order to advance the Australian practice nurse movement and demonstrate its important contribution to primary health care, nurses need {{to take the lead in}} strategic planning of this emerging specialty. As well as leadership from an academic, research and policy perspective, clinical leaders need to be fostered among the ranks of practice nurse clinicians to drive clinical practice development <b>and</b> the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence-based</b> primary care...|$|R

This paper describes the participatory process {{that has resulted in}} a physical activity intervention for women aged > 55  years, ready for pilot-testing in a Bingo club setting. Methods Studies using different quantitative and qualitative approaches were conducted among customers and staff of a Bingo club in a city of 85, 000 inhabitants in central Scotland. These were designed to take the views of different stakeholders into account, with a view to enhancing uptake, engagement and effectiveness with any proposed intervention. Results Sixteen relevant studies were identified in a literature review that generated ideas for intervention components. A questionnaire completed by 151 women in the Bingo club showed that almost half (47  %) aged > 55  years were not meeting physical activity guidelines; evidence backed up by accelerometer data from 29 women. Discussions in six focus groups attended by 27 club members revealed different but overlapping motivations for attending the Bingo club (social benefits) and playing Bingo (cognitive benefits). There was some scepticism as to whether the Bingo club was an appropriate setting for an intervention, and a dietary intervention was not favoured. It was clear that any planned intervention needed to utilise the social motivation and habitual nature of attendance at the Bingo club, without taking women away from Bingo games. These results were taken forward to a 5 -h long participative workshop with 27 stakeholders (including 19 Bingo players). Intervention design (form and content) was then finalised during two round table research team meetings. Conclusions It was possible to access and engage with women living in areas of socio-economic disadvantage through a Bingo club setting.

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} two decades, mental health reform in Australia has {{received}} unprecedented government attention. This study explored how five policy levers (organisation, regulation, community education, finance and payment) were used by the Australian Federal Government to implement mental health reforms. Methods: Australian Government publications, including the four mental health plans (published in 1992, 1998, 2003 and 2008) were analysed according to policy levers used to drive reform across five priority areas: [1] human rights and community attitudes; [2] responding to community need; [3] service structures; [4] service quality and effectiveness; and [5] resources and service access. Results: Policy levers were applied in varying ways; {{with two or three}} levers often concurrently used to implement a single initiative or strategy. For example, changes to service structures were achieved using various combinations of all five levers. Attempts to improve service quality and effectiveness were instead made through a single lever-regulation. The use of some levers changed over time, including a move away from prescriptive, legislative use of regulation, towards a greater focus on monitoring service standards and consumer outcomes. Conclusions: Patterns in the application of policy levers across the National Mental Health Strategy, as identified in this analysis, represent a novel way of conceptualising the history of mental health reform in Australia. An improved understanding of the strategic targeting and appropriate utilisation of policy levers may assist in the <b>delivery</b> <b>and</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>evidence-based</b> mental health reform in the future...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mental {{illness is}} an {{escalating}} concern worldwide. The management of {{disorders such as}} anxiety and depression largely falls to family doctors or general practitioners (GPs). However, GPs are often too time constrained and may lack the necessary training to adequately manage the needs <b>of</b> such patients. <b>Evidence-based</b> Internet interventions represent a potentially valuable resource to reduce the burden of care {{and the cost of}} managing mental health disorders within primary care settings and, at the same time, improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The present study sought to extend the efficacy of a therapist-assisted Internet treatment program for panic disorder, Panic Online, by determining whether comparable outcomes could be achieved and maintained when Panic Online was supported by either GPs or psychologists. METHODS: Via a natural groups design, 96 people with a primary diagnosis of panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) completed the Panic Online program over 12 weeks with the therapeutic assistance of their GP (n = 53), who had received specialist training in cognitive behavioral therapy, or a clinical psychologist (n = 43). Participants completed a clinical diagnostic telephone interview, conducted by a psychologist, and a set of online questionnaires to assess panic-related symptoms at three time periods (pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6 month follow-up). RESULTS: Both treatments led to clinically significant improvements on measures of panic and panic-related symptomatology from pretreatment to posttreatment. Both groups were shown to significantly improve over time. Improvements for both groups were maintained at follow-up; however, the groups did differ significantly on two quality of life domains: physical (F 1, 82 = 9. 13, P =. 00) and environmental (F 1, 82 = 4. 41, P =. 04). The attrition rate was significantly higher among those being treated by their GP (χ 21 = 4. 40, P =. 02, N = 96).

40|$|Background. A {{review of}} {{existing}} literature {{is necessary to}} determine the future directions required in research exploring friendships and leisure for school-aged children with Down syndrome. Purpose. This review examines research published in peer-reviewed journals describing participation in friendships and leisure for school-aged children with Down syndrome. The review is guided by the theoretical framework of the World Health Organisation 2 ̆ 7 s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Methods. Electronic searches of PubMed, PsychInfo, CINAHL, SportsDiscus and ERIC were conducted using the key terms Down syndrome, leisure and friendships. Keywords identified while using the ICF framework to explore factors impacting on friendship and leisure for school-aged children with Down syndrome were also searched. Relevant studies were critically analysed and discussed. Results. Electronic searches yielded 25 potential studies fulfilling components of the search criteria. Only 8 of these related to friendships and leisure in pa 1 iicular for this population. Other studies were identified using the keywords identified as impairment and contextual factors for school-aged children with Down syndrome under the ICF theoretical framework. A systematic review was not possible due to the paucity of research describing participation in friendships and leisure for this population. School-aged children with Down syndrome can have as few as no friends and friendships may not be confirmed by all parties eg, the child with Down syndrome, their parents and their designated friend. The most frequently participated in leisure pursuits are television watching, listening to music, playing independently with toys, games, reading and writing, shopping or running errands, going to the movies, or spending times with family members. Parents are instrumental in directing both friendships and leisure experiences for children with Down syndrome. Practice Implications. The majority of relevant studies identified in this review are descriptive, cross-sectional and observational in nature and do not address the ongoing need for the provision and evaluation of social interventions for school-aged children with Down syndrome to ensure a greater quality of life. Additionally, current research on factors of body structure or function, environment, and person affecting participation for school-aged children with Down syndrome does not encompass outcome measures or relate to changes in functional performance or participation. Further research is required to investigate the effect of factors described within the ICF theoretical framework on friendships and leisure for school-aged children with Down syndrome. This research would support the development <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>evidence-based</b> leisure programs for school-aged children with Down syndrome. Background/Aim. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe leisure participation for school-aged children with Down syndrome in 2004, and to investigate how impairment and contextual factors classified by the World Health Organisation 2 ̆ 7 s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) influence their leisure participation. Methods. Data was collected from the 2004 Down Syndrome Needs, Opinions, 2 ̆ 6 Wishes (NOW) questionnaire. Results. One third of families report one or no friends for their school-aged child with Down syndrome. Cases participated in predominantly solitary and sedentary leisure types. Conclusion. Leisure participation is affected by complex factors both within and external to the child with Down syndrome. Further investigation of the relevance of these factors to leisure may provide more satisfying and meaningful participation in leisure for school-aged children with Down syndrome...|$|R

40|$|There are {{professional}} and legislative expectations that nurses deliver care to their patients' that is evidence-based. Previous research findings have indicated nurses do not value {{research in the}} clinical setting, yet believed they deliver evidence-based practice. This study explores what practising nurses understand by the term evidence-based practice and how it shapes their clinical decision making. There was interest in the individual nurses' experiences and interpretations, {{as well as their}} preparation for practice. Contextual influences were also a focus, to give insight into influences that might affect the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence-based</b> practice. A qualitative interpretive research approach was used, and implemented using a naturalistic paradigm. Case Study methodology, using complexity theory, provided the theoretical framework to explore contextual variables that might affect the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence-based</b> practice. Relationships, interdependencies and interconnections became the focus to allow a depth to the inquiry and understanding of the case. A review of the literature, focus group and semi-structured interviews (n= 10). provided the source of data collection, and were completed during 2006. Despite evidence-based practice being a {{professional and}} legislative requirement of the practising nurse, there remains a significant gap between what the professional and legislative documents state and the reality of clinical practice. The extent to which evidence-based practice is delivered within the case is based {{on the extent to which}} evidence is incorporated in policy statements. There are concerns associated with education, organisational culture, and contextual variables which impede the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence-based</b> practice. Existing skill levels are variable, and there is potential to encourage individual creativity and contribution, but there are significant skill deficits which need to be addressed Findings confirm progress is being made, but also reinforce the need for further education review and support, and a culture 'makeover' in some contexts within the case to advance the evidence-based practice agenda...|$|R
