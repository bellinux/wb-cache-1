5|$|After a drawn first Test {{the second}} match {{was a game}} of two halves. England {{developed}} a 233 run lead at the half way stage and had the West Indies on 204/5 when Butcher was caught. This dismissal caused a riot <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> point onwards England struggled with the spin bowling of Sobers and Gibbs, narrowly avoiding defeat by two wickets. The third Test saw another drawn match due to the slow batting of the West Indies, taking over two days to score 349 runs which included a spell of four runs in one hour. England took a 1–0 lead after the fourth Test, {{in a game that}} they seemed least like winning. The win was mainly due to Sobers' decision to declare on 92/2 in the West Indies second innings. Good batting by Alan Knott and a 127 sixth wicket partnership ensured the final game ended in a draw as England maintained their 1–0 lead to win the series.|$|E

Among his best known works are {{a group of about}} 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh.

5|$|Although {{the results}} of this {{experiment}} were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the fashion for {{portraiture}} had spread down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who, having trained in the Netherlands, {{became one of the}} most successful portrait painters of the reign of Charles I. He trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright (1617–94), who painted both Scottish and English subjects.

5|$|In 1948, Shostakovich {{acquired}} {{a book of}} Jewish folk songs, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> he composed the song cycle From Jewish Folk Poetry. He initially wrote eight songs that were meant to represent the hardships of being Jewish in the Soviet Union. However in order to disguise this, Shostakovich ended up adding three more songs meant to demonstrate the great life Jews had under the Soviet regime. Despite his efforts to hide the real meaning in the work, the Union of Composers refused to approve his music in 1949 {{under the pressure of}} the anti-Semitism that gripped the country. From Jewish Folk Poetry could not be performed until after Stalin’s death in March 1953, along with all the other works that were forbidden.|$|E

5|$|The 28th (Māori) Battalion had {{its origins}} {{before the start}} of the Second World War. In mid-1939, as war in Europe began to be seen as inevitable, Sir Āpirana Ngata started to discuss {{proposals}} for the formation of a military unit made up of Māori volunteers similar to the Māori Pioneer Battalion that had served during the First World War. This proposal was furthered by two Māori MPs, Eruera Tirikatene and Paraire Paikea, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> support within the Māori community for the idea began to grow as it was seen as an opportunity for Māoris to participate as citizens of the British Empire and to test their warrior skills. At first the New Zealand government was hesitant, but on 4 October, the decision was announced that the proposal would be accepted and that the battalion would be raised in addition to the nine battalions and support units that had already been formed into three brigades of the 2nd New Zealand Division.|$|E
5|$|The Cliff House Sandstone is the area's {{youngest}} rock layer.

Like the Point Lookout Sandstone, it is about 400 feet thick. It contains numerous fossil beds of different types of shells, fish teeth, and other invertebrate leftovers from the receded sea.

5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{fast mail}} route to the Pacific coast was {{prompted}} largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population.

5|$|The site abuts a major ancient intersection. Opposite lay a {{large public}} square {{fronting}} the Temple's main Hulda Gates. The Tyropoeon street itself {{was lined with}} shops and formed part of the city's Lower Market. The Royal Stoa, an exceptionally large basilica complex which served various commercial and legal functions, looked down on the intersection from atop the Temple platform. Although the Stoa stood on the Temple esplanade, it was constructed upon an expansion added by Herod. It was therefore evidently not considered sacred by some at the time, allowing it {{to be used for}} mundane activities. The heavy public traffic to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> edifice accounts for the width of the stepped street, which approximates that of a modern four-lane highway.|$|E
5|$|A seminal {{paper by}} Noether, Helmut Hasse, and Richard Brauer {{pertains}} to division algebras, which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a local-global theorem stating {{that if a}} finite-dimensional central division algebra over a number field splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>this,</b> deduced their Hauptsatz ("main theorem"): every finite dimensional central division algebra over an algebraic number field F splits over a cyclic cyclotomic extension. These theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra D are splitting fields. This paper also contains the Skolem–Noether theorem which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field k into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over k, are conjugate. The Brauer–Noether theorem gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field.|$|E
5|$|As Boyce's {{interest}} in philanthropy grew, {{he turned to}} his childhood experiences in the outdoors as a resource, but could not find a way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while en route to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> expedition would lead to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become distended from their rural roots. Many youth organizations such as the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes. By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in Algeria saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America.|$|E

5|$|Scottish estate {{houses were}} {{increasingly}} adorned with paintings, including portraits, landscapes and later classical, genre and historical paintings. Thomas Warrender (fl. 1673–1713) {{made his living}} as a house decorator, working closely with architects, including William Adam. He may have trained James Norie (1684–1757), who with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766) also worked with the Adams, painting the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch scenes. They tutored many artists and have been credited with {{the inception of the}} tradition of Scottish landscape painting that would come to fruition from the late eighteenth century. The painters Allan Ramsay (1713–84), Gavin Hamilton (1723–98), the brothers John (1744–68/9) and Alexander Runciman (1736–85), Jacob More (1740–93) and David Allan (1744–96), mostly began {{in the tradition of the}} Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland. Henry Raeburn (1756–1823) was the most significant artist of the eighteenth century to pursue his entire career in Scotland, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> point Scottish painters would be able to be professionals in their homeland, often supplying the nobility and lairds with works to fill the walls of their houses.|$|E
