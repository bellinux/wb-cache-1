40|$|AbstractObjectivesAnk encodes a {{transmembrane protein}} that is {{involved}} in pyrophosphate (PPi) transport and mutations in the Ank gene {{have been associated with}} pathological mineralization in cartilage and bone. To understand how Ank works in normal skeletal development {{it is also important to}} know which cells within the developing skeleton express Ank. To this end, we examined the expression pattern of Ank mRNA during mouse embryonic development as well as in mouse hind limb joints with emphasis on the period when articular cartilage forms. Since it was previously shown that TGF-β regulates PPi transport in cells in culture, we also tested the hypothesis that TGF-β regulates Ank expression. Methods The localization of Ank mRNA was determined by radioactive in situ hybridization in E 15. 5 and E 17. 5 mouse embryos as well as in 1 and 3 week post-natal mice. Ank expression was compared to that of other cartilage markers. In situ hybridization and semi-quantitative RT-PCR were used to determine the effects of TGF-β on Ank expression in metatarsal organ cultures. Results Ank expression was detected at high levels at sites of both endochondral and intramembranous bone development. In endochondral bones, expression was detected in a subset of hypertrophic cells at ossification centers. Expression was also detected in osteogenic/chondrogenic cells of the perichondrium/periosteum lining the metaphysis, an area associated with the formation and extension of the bone collar. High levels of expression were also detected in non-mineralized tissues of the skeletal system including tendons and the superficial layer of the articular cartilage. Treatment with TGF-β resulted in an approximately four-fold induction of Ank mRNA in prehypertrophic chondrocytes and perichondrium of metatarsal cultures. Conclusions The expression pattern of <b>Ank</b> <b>suggests</b> an important role both in inhibiting and regulating mineralization in the developing skeletal system. In addition, TGF-β 1 is able to mediate Ank mRNA expression in chondrocytes suggesting a possible role for TGF-β and Ank in the regulation of normal mineralization.

Linkage studies mapped the locus for the autosomal dominant form of CMD to an ∼ 5 -cM interval on chromosome 5 p, which is defined by recombinations between loci D 5 S 810 and D 5 S 1954. Mutational analysis of positional candidate genes was performed, and we describe herein three different mutations, in five different families and in isolated cases, in ANK, a multipass transmembrane protein involved in the transport of intracellular pyrophosphate into extracellular matrix. The mutations are two in-frame deletions and one in-frame insertion caused by a splicing defect. All mutations cluster within seven amino acids {{in one of the}} six possible cytosolic domains of <b>ANK.</b> These results <b>suggest</b> that the mutated protein has a dominant negative effect on the function of ANK, since reduced levels of pyrophosphate in bone matrix are known to increase mineralization...|$|R
40|$|The {{canonical}} form comprises 839 aa (MW~ 96 kDa) and {{is composed of}} six transmembrane spanning domains and a pore forming region between transmembrane domains 5 and 6. The N-terminal and C-terminal tails are in cytoplasmatic side. Three N terminal ankyrin (ANK) repeats are present in N-terminal tail. The variant form TRPV 1 b is identical to TRPV 1 except for the partial deletion of the third ankyrin repeat domain and adjoining polypeptide sequence. Aminoacid modifications has been found (according to Swiss-Prot) in different residues (Table 1). The N-terminal intracellular domain appears to play {{a pivotal role in}} intracellular activation of TRPV 1, in fact, by mutagenesis analysis a loss of sensitivity to capsaicin has been found related to residue Tyr- 511 (Gavva et al., 2004). Modification of a single N-terminal cysteine altered activation of TRPV 1 by pungent compounds ranging from onions to garlic (Salazar et al., 2008). The N-terminal intracellular domain also interacts with adjacent modulatory proteins and with the C-terminal intracellular domain. In the closed state, the N-terminal domain is likely exposed to the binding of ATP and a C-terminal region residues interact with PIP- 2, facilitating channel activation. In contrast, a desensitized state may be promoted through the interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains through modulatory action involving calcium-calmodulin interacting regions. Moreover, the ankyrin repeat domains residing within the N-terminal intracellular domain forming a region of three repeats spanning amino acids participating in protein-protein (subunit) interactions (Bork, 1993). The presence of concave binding surfaces for ATP within the <b>ANK</b> regions <b>suggest</b> a role of ANKs in modulating channel activation and function (Lishko et al., 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) have implicated ANK 3 as a susceptibility {{gene for}} bipolar disorder (BP). We examined whether epistasis with ANK 3 {{may contribute to}} the missing heritability in BP. We first identified via the STRING database 14 genes encoding proteins with prior biological evidence that they interact molecularly with ANK 3. We then tested for statistical evidence of interactions between SNPs in these genes in association with BP in a discovery GWAS dataset and two replication GWAS datasets. The most significant interaction in the discovery GWAS was between SNPs in ANK 3 and KCNQ 2 (p = 3. 18 x 10 - 8). A total of 31 pairwise interactions involving combinations between two SNPs from KCNQ 2 and 16 different SNPs in ANK 3 were significant after permutation. Of these, 28 pairwise interactions were significant in the first replication GWAS. None were significant in the second replication GWAS, but the two SNPs from KCNQ 2 were found to significantly interact with 5 other SNPs in <b>ANK</b> 3, <b>suggesting</b> possible allelic heterogeneity. KCNQ 2 forms homo- and hetero-meric complexes with KCNQ 3 that constitute voltage-gated potassium channels in neurons. ANK 3 is an adaptor protein that, through its interaction with KCNQ 2 and KCNQ 3, directs the localization of this channel in the axon initial segment (AIS). At the AIS, the KCNQ 2 / 3 complex gives rise to the M-current, which stabilizes the neuronal resting potential and inhibits repetitive firing of action potentials. Thus, these channels act as dampening components and prevent neuronal hyperactivity. The interactions between ANK 3 and KCNQ 2 merit further investigation, and, if confirmed, may motivate a new line of research into a novel therapeutic target for BP...|$|R
40|$|The Rel/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) {{and nuclear}} factor of {{activated}} T-cells (NFAT) transcription {{factors contribute to}} the regulation of an assortment of biological processes by binding DNA with high specificity using their Rel homology domain (RHD). Recently, {{it has been shown}} that members of these gene families are present in the genome of the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, indicating that they predate the evolution of the most recent ancestor to living bilaterians. By identifying a single NF-κB gene in the genome of the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica, a representative of an even earlier branching metazoan lineage, we demonstrate here that the Rel/NF-κB family originated at the dawn of the Metazoa. There is no evidence of RHDs in fungal and choanoflagellate genomes, supporting the notion that the RHD is a metazoan-specific innovation. The A. queenslandica gene (AmqNF-κB) encodes a protein that is highly similar in structure to the vertebrate NF-κB p 50 /p 52 proteins, possessing both a RHD and ankyrin (ANK) repeats. The intact AmqNF-κB contrasts with the N. vectensis NF-κB, which lacks <b>ANK</b> repeats, and <b>suggests</b> that the ancestral metazoan NF-κB was configured identically to contemporary vertebrate and sponge forms. AmqNF-κB is expressed during A. queenslandica embryogenesis, suggesting a developmental role...|$|R
40|$|PINCH is {{a widely}} {{expressed}} and evolutionarily conserved protein comprising primarily five LIM domains, which are cysteine-rich consensus sequences implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions. We report here that PINCH is a binding protein for integrin-linked kinase (ILK), an intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase that plays important roles in the cell adhesion, growth factor, and Wnt signaling pathways. The interaction between ILK and PINCH has been consistently observed {{under a variety of}} experimental conditions. They have interacted in yeast two-hybrid assays, in solution, and in solid-phase-based binding assays. Furthermore, ILK, but not vinculin or focal adhesion kinase, has been coisolated with PINCH from mammalian cells by immunoaffinity chromatography, indicating that PINCH and ILK associate with each other in vivo. The PINCH-ILK interaction is mediated by the N-terminal-most LIM domain (LIM 1, residues 1 to 70) of PINCH and multiple ankyrin (ANK) repeats located within the N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 163) of ILK. Additionally, biochemical studies indicate that ILK, through the interaction with PINCH, is capable of forming a ternary complex with Nck- 2, an SH 2 /SH 3 -containing adapter protein implicated in growth factor receptor kinase and small GTPase signaling pathways. Finally, we have found that PINCH is concentrated in peripheral ruffles of cells spreading on fibronectin and have detected clusters of PINCH that are colocalized with the α 5 β 1 integrins. These results demonstrate a specific protein recognition mechanism utilizing a specific LIM domain and multiple <b>ANK</b> repeats and <b>suggest</b> that PINCH functions as an adapter protein connecting ILK and the integrins with components of growth factor receptor kinase and small GTPase signaling pathways...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Myotrophin is a 12. 5 kDa {{protein that}} appears to have {{a key role in the}} {{initiation}} of cardiac hypertrophy, a central process in many heart diseases. Myotrophin primarily comprises ankyrin-like (ANK) repeats, the 33 amino acid motifs involved in a wide range of protein–protein interactions. As a first step in the structure-based search for cardiac hypertrophy antagonists and in order to gain insight into the molecular basis of action of the ubiquitous and multifunctional ANK repeat motif, we have determined the solution structure of myotrophin using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Results: The myotrophin structure determination was based on 2786 experimental NMR restraints, and the precision of the coordinates for the final 45 simulated-annealing structures is 0. 43 å for the backbone atoms and 0. 87 å for all atoms. The structure of myotrophin is well defined and is ellipsoidal: approximately 46 å long and 21 å wide. The ANK repeats, which constitute the main part of the myotrophin structure, are characteristic of a hairpin-like protruding tip followed by a helix-turn-helix motif. The V-shaped helix-turn-helix of the ANK repeats stack sequentially in bundles and are stabilized by compact hydrophobic cores, whereas the protruding tips are less ordered. This arrangement is quite different to the continuous β-sheet topology observed in the corresponding regions of another ANK protein, 53 BP 2, the structure of which was determined in complex with p 53. Conclusions: The solution structure of myotrophin provides important insights into the structural and dynamic features of the <b>ANK</b> motif, and <b>suggests</b> that the protruding tips with highly variable sequences may be critical to facilitate diverse protein–protein recognition. The present structure also provides a molecular basis for the further functional characterization of myotrophin and the development of therapeutics for hypertrophy-related heart diseases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Anion {{exchanger}} 2 (AE 2) is {{a member}} of the anion exchanger gene family, which includes three additional members, AE 1, AE 3, and AE 4. They are also known as Na+-independent Cl-/HCO 3 - exchangers, and their major function is to regulate intracellular pH and chloride concentration. All four isoforms have several N-terminally truncated variants that are often expressed cell type specifically. Red blood cells express the full-length AE 1 isoform that interacts with ankyrin, an adapter protein linking plasma membrane to the spectrin-based membrane skeleton. This membrane skeleton association is essential for maintaining the membrane integrity of red blood cells. AE 3 variants are mainly found in the brain and heart, whereas AE 4 is localized in the kidney. Anion exchanger 2 is expressed in every cell line and tissue studied thus far, and it has been mainly localized to the plasma membrane. However, we found two types of localization/targeting of the AE 2 protein in several of the cell lines studied. The protein was localized to either the plasma membrane or the Golgi complex, depending on the cell type. The AE 2 variant expressed in these cells was identified as the full-length AE 2 protein. The determinants of differential intracellular targeting were assessed. We hypothesized that Golgi-AE 2 is anchored to the Golgi membranes via its association with the Golgi membrane skeleton. We were able to show that the Golgi localization of AE 2 correlated with the cell type specific expression of Ank 195, a Golgi membrane skeletal protein. In cells where AE 2 was targeted to the plasma membrane, Ank 195 was not expressed. In addition, the detergent insolubility and co-redistribution properties of AE 2 and <b>Ank</b> 195 strongly <b>suggested</b> that these proteins interact with each other. The Golgi membrane skeleton has been shown to be necessary for maintaining the Golgi structure. Our studies were consistent with these findings, showing that in cells in which AE 2 expression was reduced by using AE 2 -specific antisense oligonucleotides, the Golgi complex was dispersed. The spectrin-based membrane skeleton was probably partially detached from the Golgi membranes leading to breakdown of the Golgi structure and disorganization of the microtubules associated with it. The present findings suggest that the targeting of AE 2 is cell type specific, and that Golgi-localized AE 2 serves as a membrane association site for the spectrin-based Golgi membrane skeleton, thereby participating in the maintenance of the Golgi structure...|$|R
40|$|Plasmodium falciparum {{causes the}} most severe form of human malaria and is {{responsible}} for most malaria-associated deaths. In 2015, about 214 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide, killing 438, 000 people, mostly children. The remodeling of parasite-infected red blood cells contributes to the pathogenesis of falciparum malaria. P. falciparum extensively modifies the infected red blood cell (iRBC), resulting in changes in iRBC deformability, shape and surface properties. These alterations suggest that the red blood cell (RBC) cytoskeleton is a major target for modifications during infection. These modifications are attributed to the actions of hundreds of proteins that are exported by the parasite to iRBC. However, the cytoskeletal binding partners of most of these exported proteins are not known. This dissertation summarizes {{the findings from the}} studies designed to identify and investigate protein-protein interactions between P. falciparum exported proteins and erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins. A large-scale screening using the split luciferase assay was performed to identify the cytoskeletal targets of twenty-four parasite-exported proteins, which yielded cytoskeletal binding partners for 15 parasite proteins. In total, 56 interactions were identified between 15 parasite proteins and 14 RBC cytoskeletal protein fragments. Seventeen of the above interactions were confirmed using protein co-precipitation assays. The polyhelical interspersed subtelomeric (PHIST) domain-containing proteins (PFD 0090 c, PF 14 _ 0018, MAL 8 P 1. 163 and PFD 0095 c) interacted with both ankyrin 1 (ANK 1) and band 4. 1 (4. 1 R). Out of these four proteins, PF 14 _ 0018 and PFD 0095 c also contained the MESA erythrocyte cytoskeletal (MEC) binding motif. These MEC motif proteins including MESA and PF 10 _ 0381 targeted the ANK 1 fragment composed of spectrin binding domain. Yeast two hybrid assays and split-luciferase assays were used to investigate the minimum-binding region of MESA and PF 14 _ 0018. The MEC motif was sufficient for the interaction of MESA and PF 14 _ 0018 with the ANK 1 fragment and in absence of the MEC motifs, the interactions were obliterated. Similarly, protein co-purification assays were used to identify the minimum-binding domain of ANK 1 repeats targeted by parasite proteins. I found that the parasite proteins that targeted the ANK 1 repeats interacted with D 2 subdomain of the <b>ANK</b> 1 repeats, <b>suggesting</b> that the interaction may disrupt the interaction between ANK 1 and band 3 in the iRBC membrane. In order to assess the role of parasite proteins in host cell rigidity, I performed microsphiltration assays by loading erythrocyte ghosts with the parasite proteins and testing their retention rate in a matrix composed of metal beads. Ghost erythrocytes loaded with RESA, PF 14 _ 0018 and PFD 0090 c were retained at a significantly higher rate than control samples, suggesting the possible role of these parasite proteins in host cell rigidity. In summary, the research reported in this thesis identified and characterized protein-protein interactions between P. falciparum exported proteins and erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins and began to define their roles in altering host cell rigidity. ...|$|R
40|$|All {{animals have}} evolved {{mechanisms}} to recognise and eliminate nonself {{in order to}} defend against invading pathogens and to prevent chimerism, the fusion between genetically distinct conspecifics. Like other metazoans, sponges are known to rely on sophisticated systems to maintain their self-integrity. As poriferans are also {{considered one of the}} most ancient extant metazoan phyla, they represent a critical comparative model for understanding the early evolution of immunity and self/nonself recognition in animals. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling cascade plays a crucial role in immunity, and recent findings in the sponge Suberites domuncula suggest that its origin could predate eumetazoan cladogenesis. My genome and expressed sequence tag (EST) screens of the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica detected homologues to most components of this pathway, supporting the notion that a primordial TLR signalling cascade emerged at the dawn of the Metazoa. The sponge also encodes a couple of putative TLR-related proteins (AmqIgTIRs) that consist of at least one extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) and an intracellular Toll/Interleukin- 1 receptor/resistance (TIR) domain. The presence of other unconventional TLRs in S. domuncula and in cnidarian representatives, implies that an ancestral TLR probably existed in the last common ancestor of all living metazoans, and independent duplication and divergence events led to the variety of forms observed in animals. Among the putative transcription factors present in Amphimedon, which are known to be activated by the TLR signalling cascade in other eumetazoans, I detected a single member of the Rel/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) family, AmqNF-κB, which is also the only Rel homology domain (RHD) -containing gene present in the sponge. This gene encodes a protein that is equipped with both a RHD and ankyrin (<b>ANK)</b> repeats, <b>suggesting</b> that the ancestral metazoan NF-κB was configured identically to contemporary vertebrate and sponge forms, and that the truncated NF-κB found in Nematostella vectensis resulted from the secondary loss of ANK. Aside from immunity, the Toll and TLR pathways contribute to a variety of biological processes in bilaterians, however their functions have only been investigated in detail in a limited number of metazoan model organisms. While studies have tested the immune role of various sponge genes, including components of the TLR cascade, no research has yet established whether they are also involved in development. Therefore, I investigated the expression of some of the immunity-related genes I isolated in Amphimedon in a developmental and immune context to shed light on the potential ancestral function(s) of the proteins they encode. Using in situ hybridisation, I demonstrate that AmqIgTIR 2, AmqMyD 88, AmqTollip, AmqPellino and AmqNF-ĸB are expressed during A. queenslandica early development. In contrast, the spatial and temporal expression of AmqIgTIR 1 suggests it might encode a receptor that is specifically involved in the detection of metamorphic cues in larvae. A real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) study performed on a pool of adult sponge cDNAs indicates that the expression levels of AmqIgTIR 1, AmqIgTIR 2, AmqMyD 88 and AmqTollip are significantly affected by a nine-hour incubation in 50 µg/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and to a lesser extent by 105 colony forming units (cfu) /ml of live Vibrio harveyi. The gene expression of AmqIgTIR 1 and AmqIgTIR 2 suggests that they may encode proteins with antagonistic immunological functions. While AmqPellino and AmqNF-ĸB do not appear to be affected by LPS and Vibrio exposure, it is possible that these genes do not participate in the early immune response of poriferans. Together, my data indicate that the sponge genes surveyed might encode proteins that perform developmental, sensory and immunological functions, suggesting their roles could have also been multifaceted in the last common ancestor to all living metazoans. As is observed in other invertebrates, poriferans display an ontogenic shift in allorecognition; genetically different individuals can fuse during early development but, in most instances, not as adults. However, there is a limited understanding of the cellular organisation of sponge chimeras and the onset of poriferan allorecognition response. By following the fates of fluorescently tagged cells derived from genetically distinct Amphimedon larvae that are fused together at metamorphosis, I establish that there is a rapid ontogenic shift in the sponge allogeneic response about two weeks after the initiation of metamorphosis. Moreover, the molecular basis of the poriferan allorecognition system is possibly involved in creating differential cell affinities, which underlie the construction of the sponge body plan. Compatible with this scenario is the observation that cells from postlarvae that are allowed to develop for two weeks before contact do not fuse, and form a distinct boundary between genotypes. The molecules responsible for sponge cell reaggregation, the aggregation factors (AFs), have been proposed to drive the allorecognition response in poriferans. Notably, the Amphimedon genome encodes six putative AFs, of which five occur in a cluster. These findings indicate that the polymorphic variation observed in other poriferan AFs is probably the result of allelic variations of multiple genes belonging to the same family...|$|R
