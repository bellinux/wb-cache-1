40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} HBV-DNA load on portal venous pressure and its possible molecular mechanism in HBsAg positive chronic HBV liver cirrhosis. Methods: From January 2014 to April 2015, 86 patients with HBsAg positive chronic HBV of early and mid-term liver cirrhosis were recruited and divided randomly into two groups as observation group and control group. The observation group accepted anti-virus treatment (adefovir dipivoxil tablet, 10 mg qd for 6 months) beside regular liver-protecting therapy. And the control group accepted regular therapy only. The levels of HBV-DNA, portal venous congestion index (PV-CI) and NO, CO, ET- 1 in two groups {{before and after the}} treatment were compared and Logistic regression was used to analyze the influence factors of PV-CI. Results: In observation group, the <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> of lgHBV-DNA before treatment was (6. 42 ± 2. 11) and the <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> of lgHBV-DNA after treatment was (4. 38 ± 2. 20). The comparison before and after treatment showed significant difference. In control group, the <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> of lgHBV-DNA before treatment was (6. 40 ± 2. 08) and the <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> of lgHBVDNA after treatment was (5. 38 ± 3. 31). The comparison before and after treatment showed significant difference. To compare above indexes of observation group before and after treatment, PV-CI, ET- 1, CO and NO were all decreased and the differences were significant. To compare above indexes between observation group after treatment and control group, the levels of PV-CI, ET- 1, CO and NO were all decreased and the differences were significant. To compare the indexes before and after treatment of control group, the differences of PV-CI, CO, NO and ET- 1 levels were not significant. The analyzed results of multi-variable logistic regression showed that the course of disease, Child classification and l g HBV-DNA were the risk factors to affect portal venous pressure indexes (PV-CI). Conclusions: Anti-virus therapy in HBsAg positive chronic HBV of early and mid-term liver cirrhosis could improve portal venous pressure and might prevent the development of serious related complications...|$|E
40|$|Airborne {{transmission}} of influenza A virus (IAV) in swine is speculated {{to be an}} important route of virus dissemination, but data are scarce. This study attempted to detect and quantify airborne IAV by virus isolation and RRT-PCR in air samples collected under field conditions. This was accomplished by collecting air samples from four acutely infected pig farms and locating air samplers inside the barns, at the external exhaust fans and downwind from the farms at distances up to 2. 1 km. IAV was detected in air samples collected in 3 out of 4 farms included in the study. Isolation of IAV was possible from air samples collected inside the barn at two of the farms and in one farm from the exhausted air. Between 13 % and 100 % of samples collected inside the barns tested RRT-PCR positive with an <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> of 3. 20 E+ 05 IAV RNA copies/m³ of air. Percentage of exhaust positive air samples also ranged between 13 % and 100 % with an <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> of 1. 79 E+ 04 RNA copies/m³ of air. Influenza virus RNA was detected in air samples collected between 1. 5 and 2. 1 Km away from the farms with viral levels significantly lower at 4. 65 E+ 03 RNA copies/m³. H 1 N 1, H 1 N 2 and H 3 N 2 subtypes were detected in the air samples and the hemagglutinin gene sequences identified in the swine samples matched those in aerosols providing evidence that the viruses detected in the aerosols originated from the pigs in the farms under study. Overall our results indicate that pigs can be a source of IAV infectious aerosols and that these aerosols can be exhausted from pig barns and be transported downwind. The results from this study provide evidence of the risk of aerosol transmission in pigs under field conditions...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the study: To {{determine}} {{velocity of}} immunological and virological progression of HIV-infection {{in respect to}} pregnancy and short-termed HAART. Methods: Comparative retrospective study. Retrospective period - 4 years. All women had initial CD 4 + cell count {{in the range from}} 500 to 700 cells/mm 3 and <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> less then 5 log 10 copies/ml. The study group - women having had pregnancy and short termed HAART (16 cases). The control group - women not having had pregnancy and episodes of HAART. 3 endpoints were determined: (i) average year CD 4 + T-lymphocyte loss (cells/mm 3); (ii) average year% CD 4 + T-lymphocyte loss; (iii) <b>average</b> year <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> elevation (log 10 copies/ml). Endpoints were calculated by the least square regression. Summary of results: Women in the study group showed higher progression rates of HIV infection, as shown in table 1 and figure 1 The difference in average year CD 4 + T-lymphocyte loss was 2, 9 fold, average year% CD 4 + T-lymphocyte loss was 2, 8 fold, <b>average</b> year <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> elevation - 4, 5 fold. All differences were statistically significant. Figure 1. 95 % confidence intervals showing significant influence of pregnancy and HAART termination on HIV-disease progression. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the age of women and initial <b>viral</b> <b>load.</b> If the initial CD 4 + counts were more the 700 cells/mm 3, pregnancy and HAART termination does not have significant effect on immunological progression, difference in <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> dynamics being still present (data not shown). The study does not allow to differentiate effects of pregnancy itself or of HAART termination. According to literature effect of pregnancy on HIV disease progression is not clear [1], that is why the most reliable hypothesis is the unfavourable influence of HAART termination on the course of HIV-infection. This provides a reliable evidence not to stop HAART after delivery if initial CD 4 + count is less then 700 cells/ml. Conclusions: 1 : Higher level of immunological progression is proved by elevated average year CD 4 + T-lymphocyte loss: in absolute count (cells/mm 3) and in% to the previous level. 2 : Higher level of virological progression is proved by elevated <b>average</b> year <b>viral</b> <b>load.</b> 3 : Enhancing progression of HIV-infection is due to changing level of HIV after HAART termination on the background of weakened and disbalanced cellular immunity...|$|R

Methods: Venous blood was collected from 60 consenting HIV- 1 -positive patients, plasma separated within 4 hours, and stored at 20 C. Venous blood, 50 mL, was blotted on 4 designated areas of Whatman filter paper and air-dried at room tempera-ture for 2 hours. Results: There was a strong statistically significant correlation between HIV- 1 RNA <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> using plasma and DBS (r. 955, P <. 001). On <b>average</b> plasma <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> were only slightly higher than DBS <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> (mean difference: 0. 06 log 10 copies/mL).

40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{the most}} common sexually transmitted infection worldwide. About 99  % of cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection with high-risk types of HPV. It can take over 10  years from the time of an initial human papillomavirus infection until a cervical cancer. In most cases, HPV infections are transient and go away within 1  year. There is evidence that cell mediated immune responses of the host, both systemic and local, are important determinants of the course of infection, thus, it is reasonable to use immunocorrective therapy. Many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of interferon alpha in complex therapy of HPV infection. The aim – to determine the efficacy of interferon alpha- 2 b in reducing the viral load of high-risk HPV among infected women of reproductive age. Materials and methods. 60  high-risk HPV positive women were included in the study. Qualitative and quantitative determination of high-risk HPV (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59) was carried out by PCR in real time. Patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 (n = 30) received alfa-interferon in the form of rectal suppositories; group 2 (n = 30) did not receive the drug. Control study was conducted 1  month later. The average age in group 1 was 31, 7  ± 1, 6  years, in group 2 – 35, 0  ± 1, 6  years (p = 0, 08). In group 1 monoinfection diagnosed in 72, 4  % of cases, mixed infection in 27, 6  % of cases in group 2 – at 64, 3  % and 35, 7  %, respectively. Results. The <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> was 3, 5  ± 0, 2  Lg (HPV on 105  cells) in group 1 and 3, 4  ± 0, 3 in group 2 (p = 0, 473). Сlinically significant viral load dominated in group 1 (41, 4  %), insignificant viral load was dominated in group 2 (42, 9  %). After 1  month the <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> was 1, 9  ± 0, 3  Lg (HPV on 105  cells) in group 1 and 2, 8  ± 0, 4  Lg in group 2 (р = 0, 04). There were statistically significant difference in both groups before and after 1  month (p < 0, 05). Elimination of HPV occurred in 34, 5  % of cases in group 1 and at 28, 6  % of cases in group 2. The viral load in the group that used interferon alfa- 2 b decreased by 45, 5  %, in the comparison group only 18, 3  % Conclusion. The treatment with interferon alfa- 2 b is effective in reducing viral load in HPV infected women of reproductive age.

The LTR-assay was found to be sensitive and cost-effective (50 - 70 % cheaper than commercial assays) with the lowest coefficient of variation (%CV). Introduction of an internal standard further improved assay reliability. Therefore, this LTR assay was implemented in West Java, Indonesia. Linearity and precision of the LTR assay were good: %CV ranged from 1. 0 % to 10. 4 %. The limit of quantitation was 616 copies/ml.

Materials : We examined 36 patients with HIV infection with signs of pathology of the central nervous system. All patients was done completed a standard investigation of cerebrospinal fluid, cytological examination and detection viral load of HIV in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Results. A different of opportunistic and HIV-related disease was diagnosed in 29 patients. The most frequent pathology of the nervous system (12 cases) is a diffuse HIV-associated brain damage occurring in 7 patients in the form of aseptic non purulent meningitis and in 5 patients in the form of encephalitis. The average value of the absolute and relative count of CD 4 -lymphocytes in patients amounted 147, 0  cells/μl (40, 0; 408, 75) and 10. 0 % (4, 00; 18, 50). Pathological changes in cellular composition and protein concentration of cerebrospinal fluid detected in 19 cases. Replication of HIV in the cerebrospinal fluid are detected in 31 of  32 patients not receiving antiretroviral therapy, including  17 patients with normal values of cerebrospinal fluid.  The <b>average</b> HIV <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> in the cerebrospinal fluid was  15 133, 0 copies/ml (2501, 0; 30624, 0) or 4, 18 (3, 35; 4, 48) lg HIV RNA, <b>average</b> HIV <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> in serum – 62 784, 0 copies/ml (6027, 5; 173869, 0) or 4, 80 4, 80 (3, 7; 5, 2) lg HIV RNA.  The concentration of HIV in the cerebrospinal fluid was significantly lower than in serum (4, 18 and 4, 80 lg HIV RNA, p= 0. 027). 4 patients with severe, multietiology damage of the central nervous system viral, microbial and fungal etiology, there was an inverse relationship between the concentration of HIV in the cerebrospinal fluid and in serum, the concentrations of HIV was higher in the cerebrospinal fluid. Conclusion: Among the majority of HIV-infected patients with signs of the central nervous system pathology HIV replication in the cerebrospinal fluid was detected.

However, {{the positive and}} negative predictive values of BK viral load are still controversial. In this prospective, single-center study, BKV DNA was measured 1, 3 and 6 months after transplantation. The viral load in urine and plasma was quantified with the real-time Q-PCR (Argen kit) in 73 renal allograft recipients Three of them showed acute rejection. To determine the cutoff value of viral load, 60 sera samples of healthy blood donors, matched for age and sex, were tested. The mean plasmatic viral load one month post-transplantation was statistically higher in renal transplant recipients (17. 23 copies/ml) compared to that in controls (2 copies/ml) (p: 0. 06). This difference of the distribution of viremia values is more evident in the third and sixth month (p: 0. 002 and 0. 010 respectively). Furthermore, analysis of the kinetic of viral load revealed an average rise of viremia at 3 months (1589. 14 copies/ml) followed by its decrease at 6 months (249. 75 copies/ml).

This pilot {{study was conducted to}} investigate CMV reactivation induced by chemotherapy. Seven blood samples were collected from each of 15 patients with newly diagnosed malignant disease, at baseline before chemotherapy, and once every month after chemotherapy was commenced. CMV viral loads in leukocytes were determined by real-time PCR. Host responses to changes in viral loads were assessed by assaying CMV-specific IgG titres and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α and interferon (IFN) -γ levels in each of the blood samples, and by scoring the number of CMV-associated clinical symptoms that developed. All except one patient experienced CMV reactivation during the course of chemotherapy, with the <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> peaking after the third course of treatment. Titres of CMV-specific IgG increased in line with the increase in viral load. Plasma levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ initially decreased from baseline, and then rose to peak levels at the same time as, or shortly after, the highest viral loads were recorded. Clinical symptoms potentially attributable to CMV infection appeared as the viral load increased. It was concluded that the incidence of CMV reactivation in patients receiving conventional chemotherapy is high. Reactivation is not asymptomatic, but was self-limiting in most of these cases.

From April 2002 to March 2004, 101 protease and RT sequences were determined for HIV- 1 isolates from patients who were failing antiretroviral therapy. The resistance profile was evaluated using the Stanford Database program. Male patients predominated (76. 2 %), the median age was 38 years, the average CD 4 count was 279. 21 cells/mm³ and the <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> was 4. 49 log.

Antibodies and serum neutralizing activities were determined over the course of disease. Results.  One hundred ninety-nine LRT samples collected during the 3 weeks following diagnosis yielded virus RNA in 93 % of tests. <b>Average</b> (maximum) <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> were 5 × 106 (6 × 1010) copies/mL. <b>Viral</b> <b>loads</b> (positive detection frequencies) in 84 URT samples were 1. 9 × 104 copies/mL (47. 6 %). Thirty-three percent of all 108 serum samples tested yielded viral RNA. Only 14. 6 % of stool and 2. 4 % of urine samples yielded viral RNA. All seroconversions occurred during the first 2 weeks after diagnosis, which corresponds to the second and third week after symptom onset. Immunoglobulin M detection provided no advantage in sensitivity over immunoglobulin G (IgG) detection.

40|$|The {{promiscuous}} {{presentation of}} epitopes by similar HLA class I alleles holds promise for a universal T-cell-based HIV- 1 vaccine. However, in some instances, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) restricted by HLA alleles with similar or identical binding motifs {{are known to}} target epitopes at different frequencies, with different functional avidities and with different apparent clinical outcomes. Such differences may be illuminated by the association of similar HLA alleles with distinctive escape pathways. Using a novel computational method featuring phylogenetically corrected odds ratios, we systematically analyzed differential patterns of immune escape across all optimally defined epitopes in Gag, Pol, and Nef in 2, 126 HIV- 1 clade C-infected adults. Overall, we identified 301 polymorphisms in 90 epitopes associated with HLA alleles belonging to shared supertypes. We detected differential escape in 37 of 38 epitopes restricted {{by more than one}} allele, which included 278 instances of differential escape at the polymorphism level. The majority (66 to 97 %) of these resulted from the selection of unique HLA-specific polymorphisms rather than differential epitope targeting rates, as confirmed by gamma interferon (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT) data. Discordant associations between HLA alleles and viral load were frequently observed between allele pairs that selected for differential escape. Furthermore, the total number of associated polymorphisms strongly correlated with <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load.</b> These studies confirm that differential escape is a widespread phenomenon and may be the norm when two alleles present the same epitope. Given the clinical correlates of immune escape, such heterogeneity suggests that certain epitopes will lead to discordant outcomes if applied universally in a vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Background: Noroviruses (NoV) are {{a leading}} cause of {{gastroenteritis}} worldwide. Few epidemiologicaldata regarding the NoV strains circulating in African countries are available. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of NoV in Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) in both symptomaticand asymptomatic gastroenteritis patients. Study design: Patients both with and without gastro-intestinal disorders were selected. Clinical andepidemiological data, as well as stool samples, were collected through March to April 2011. NoV molecular detection (genogrouping and genotyping) and viral load quantification were also per-formed for all samples. Results: NoV were detected in 22. 2 % of the 418 collected stool samples (21. 2 % and 24. 8 % from the 293 symptomatic patients (SP) and the 125 asymptomatic patients (ASP) respectively). Genogroup (G) distribution was 7. 5 %, 10. 2 % and 3. 4 % for GI, GII and both GI/GII respectively among SPand 12. 0 %, 11. 2 % and 1. 6 % for GI, GII and both GI/GII, respectively, among ASP. <b>Average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> values were higher in SP than in ASP for GI (p = 0. 03) but not for GII.

40|$|HIV- 1 viral {{load testing}} is {{essential}} to the management of HIV- 1 -infected patients, and proper specimen handling ensures accurate viral load (VL) results. This study was performed to (i) evaluate the effect of freezing plasma in situ in BD Vacutainer plasma preparation tubes (PPT) on the accuracy of HIV- 1 viral load results using the Abbott RealTime HIV- 1 assay and (ii) evaluate the effect of whole-blood storage in the PPT for 6 h at room temperature prior to centrifugation (PPT 6 H) rather than 2 h as specified in the PPT product insert. Of the 64 HIV-positive subjects evaluated, 29 had <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> counts of > 40 copies/ml in {{at least one of the}} tubes tested and 35 subjects had a result of either “undetected target” or “below the limit of quantification” (LOQ) for all or some of the tubes regardless of handling condition. For the 29 subjects with VLs that were >LOQ, the mean biases between plasma from Vacutainer K 2 EDTA tubes and plasma frozen in situ in PPT and between K 2 EDTA tube plasma and plasma from PPT 6 H (log 10 copies/ml) were 0. 005 and − 0. 001, respectively, and r 2 was > 0. 92 for all correlations. We conclude that VLs determined from plasma frozen in situ in PPT are equivalent to VLs in K 2 EDTA tube plasma and can be used for accurate quantification of HIV- 1 RNA in the Abbott RealTime HIV- 1 assay. Furthermore specimens collected in PPT can be stored for 6 h at room temperature with no effect on viral load results as measured by the Abbott RealTime HIV- 1 assay...|$|E

In most cases it causes an acute self limited illness but rarely fulminant. There is growing concern about change in pattern from asymptomatic childhood infection to an increased incidence of symptomatic disease in the adult population. Objective In-depth analysis of immunological, viral quantification and genotype of acute and fulminant hepatitis A virus. Methods Serum samples obtained from 1009 cases of suspected acute viral hepatitis was employed for different biochemical and serological examination. RNA was extracted from blood serum, reverse transcribed into cDNA and amplified using nested PCR for viral quantification, sequencing and genotyping. Immunological cell count from freshly collected whole blood was carried out by fluorescence activated cell sorter. Results Fulminant hepatitis A was mostly detected with other hepatic viruses. CD 8 + T cells count increases in fulminant hepatitis to a significantly high level (P = 0. 005) compared to normal healthy control. The immunological helper/suppressor (CD 4 + /CD 8 +) ratio of fulminant hepatitis was significantly lower compared to acute cases. The serologically positive patients were confirmed by RT-PCR and total of 72 (69. 2 %) were quantified and sequenced. The <b>average</b> quantitative <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> of fulminant cases was significantly higher (P Conclusions Immunological factors in combination with <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> defines the severity of the fulminant hepatitis A.

Because they cause human disease with high {{lethality}} and could potentially be used as a bioweapon, these viruses are classified as CDC Category A Bioterrorism Agents. Filoviruses are relatively stable in aerosols, retain virulence after lyophilization, and can be present on contaminated surfaces for extended periods of time. This study explores the characteristics of aerosolized Sudan virus (SUDV) Boniface in non-human primates (NHP) belonging to three different species. Groups of cynomolgus macaques (cyno), rhesus macaques (rhesus), and African green monkeys (AGM) were challenged with target doses of 50 or 500 plaque-forming units (pfu) of aerosolized SUDV. Exposure to either viral dose resulted in increased body temperatures in all three NHP species beginning on days 4 &ndash; 5 post-exposure. Other clinical findings for all three NHP species included leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anorexia, dehydration, and lymphadenopathy. Disease in all of the NHPs was severe beginning on day 6 post-exposure, and all animals except one surviving rhesus macaque were euthanized by day 14. Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) concentrations were elevated during the course of disease in all three species; however, AGMs had significantly higher ALT and AST concentrations than cynos and rhesus. While all three species had detectable <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> by days 3 - 4 post exposure, Rhesus had lower <b>average</b> peak <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> than cynos or AGMs. Overall, the results indicate that the disease course after exposure to aerosolized SUDV is similar for all three species of NHP...|$|R

Patients {{were divided into two}} groups: group 1 (genotyped), included those switching to new antiretroviral drugs based on HIV- 1 genotyping data, and group 2 (standard of care -SOC), comprised those in rescue therapy who had not used this test. This was an open and non-randomized study, with 74 patients, followed up for a mean period of 12 months, from February 2002 to May 2003. The groups differed in the duration of antiretroviral use, experience with diverse drug classes (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors) and <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> < 2. 6 log 10 copies/mL at any time during treatment. In 23 patients (group 1), the switch in antiretroviral (ARV) regimen was based on genotyping data; this test was not used for 51 patients (group 2). Two CD 4 + lymphocyte counts and <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> counts were made for each patient during the study. Data from the pharmacy where patients received antiretroviral agents, medical charts, and direct interviews with patients to assess compliance to treatment, were analyzed. In the genotyped group, the <b>average</b> drop in <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> was 2. 8 log 10, compared with a 1. 5 log 10 difference in group 2; the difference was significant in the first assessment performed six months after switching (p= 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Surveillance drug {{resistance}} mutations (SDRMs) in drug-naive patients are typically used to survey HIV- 1 -transmitted {{drug resistance}} (TDR). We test here how SDRMs in patients failing treatment, the original source of TDR, contribute to assessing TDR, transmissibility and transmission source of SDRMs. DESIGN: This is a retrospective observational study analyzing a Portuguese cohort of HIV- 1 -infected patients. METHODS: The prevalence of SDRMs to protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in drug-naive and treatment-failing patients was measured for 3554 HIV- 1 subtype B patients. Transmission ratio (prevalence in drug-naive/prevalence in treatment-failing patients), <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> and robust linear regression with outlier detection (prevalence in drug-naive versus in treatment-failing patients) were analyzed {{and used to}} interpret transmissibility. RESULTS: Prevalence of SDRMs in drug-naive and treatment-failing patients were linearly correlated, but some SDRMs were classified as outliers - above (PRO: D 30 N, N 88 D/S, L 90  M, RT: G 190 A/S/E) or below (RT: M 184 I/V) expectations. The normalized regression slope was 0. 073 for protease inhibitors, 0. 084 for NRTIs and 0. 116 for NNRTIs. Differences between SDRMs transmission ratios were not associated with differences in viral loads. CONCLUSION: The significant linear correlation between prevalence of SDRMs in drug-naive and in treatment-failing patients indicates that the prevalence in treatment-failing patients can be useful to predict levels of TDR. The slope is a cohort-dependent estimate of rate of TDR per drug class and outlier detection reveals comparative persistence of SDRMs. Outlier SDRMs with higher transmissibility are more persistent {{and more likely to}} have been acquired from drug-naive patients. Those with lower transmissibility have faster reversion dynamics after transmission and are associated with acquisition from treatment-failing patients. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Background: Highly active {{antiretroviral}} therapy (HAAR 7) in HIV/AIDS infection induces {{an important}} {{reduction of the}} viral load (VL) and an immune system reconstitution. CD 4 + T lymphocyte count is the immunological measurement commonly used for the follow tip of HIV/AIDS patients. Aim: To study prospectively {{the restoration of the}} innate immune system in patients with HIV/AIDS infection during their first year on HAART Patients and Methods. 25 naive HIV/AIDS patients, from San Jose Hospital and University of Chile Clinical Hospital, Santiago, Chile, were studied between years 2002 - 2003. Every 4 months after HAART initiation, CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 + T lymphocytes and CD 16 / 56 + natural killer (NK) cells were quantified by flow cytometry. NK cell cytotoxicity was measured using radioactive chrome liberation (Cr 51). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and viral load was determined using Amplicor HIV- 1 from Roche Diagnostics Systems. Results: Thirteen of the 25 patients continued in the study. They were all males, average age 35 years old (23 - 50). At baseline average CD 4 + count was 146 cells/mu L (31 - 362) and <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> was 82 - 000 copie/mL (4. 000 - 290. 000). A raise in CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 16 / 56 cells was noted at months 9 - 12 of therapy. Viral load became undetectable in the same period. NK cell function was decreased {{at the beginning of the}} therapy (1 - 4 months), reaching its highest values at months 9 - 12. There was no significant change in IL- 10. TNF-alpha increased in six patients during the study. Conclusions: In this group of patients, innate immunity was restored during HAART.

40|$|In {{wildlife}} communities, {{the diversity}} of both host species and pathogens can affect disease and transmission dynamics. However, the various mechanisms leading to these biodiversity effects occur at strikingly different spatial scales. For my dissertation, I used empirical and theoretical tools to understand how pathogen and host diversity affect transmission at multiple scales. First, I {{conducted a series of}} laboratory experiments using a genus of viruses, Ranavirus, which can cause devastating die-offs in amphibian populations. I asked how multiple virus types might interact to affect individual-level probabilities of infection and, subsequently, population-level transmission dynamics. I found that co-exposure to two Ranavirus species substantially increased the probability of an amphibian larva becoming infected, as well as the <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> among individuals. Concordantly, the presence of multiple Ranavirus species led to larger epidemics in experimental populations, as well as an increased probability of mortality. This research illustrates that Ranavirus coinfection could strongly mediate epidemic dynamics in natural amphibian populations. In the next part of my dissertation, I created an epidemiological model in which a single pathogen circulates through a vertebrate host community. I found that the relationship between host species richness and pathogen transmission could be positive, negative, or non-monotonic depending on how the host 2 ̆ 7 s total community density scales with host richness and the type of pathogen transmission assumed. These results highlight that host community composition influences transmission in complex ways, suggesting that observing a consistent effect of host diversity in natural systems is unlikely. Finally, scaling up and using a metacommunity framework, I developed a statistical method to explore how symbiont (including pathogen) communities are structured across space. I then applied this method to a large scale, longitudinal data set of amphibian symbiont communities and discovered that the structure of these communities changes through time and is predominantly influenced by temporal changes in host community composition. Overall, my research illustrates that transmission dynamics are influenced by factors at multiple spatial scales and that integrating across scales is important for understanding how, where, and when biodiversity will affect disease dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The viral {{and host}} factors {{involved}} in transmission of HIV through breastfeeding are largely unknown, and intervention strategies are urgently {{needed to protect}} at-risk populations. To evaluate the viral and immunological factors directly related to milk transmission of virus, we have evaluated the disease course of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) in lactating rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) {{as a model of}} natural breast milk transmission of HIV. Results Fourteen lactating macaques were infected intravenously with SIV/DeltaB 670, a pathogenic isolate of SIV and were pair-housed with their suckling infants throughout the disease course. Transmission was observed in 10 mother-infant pairs over a one-year period. Two mothers transmitted virus during the period of initial viremia 14 – 21 days post inoculation (p. i.) and were classified as early transmitters. Peak <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> in milk and plasma of early transmitters were similar to other animals, however the early transmitters subsequently displayed a rapid progressor phenotype and failed to control virus expression as well as other animals at 56 days p. i. Eight mothers were classified as late transmitters, with infant infection detected at time points in the chronic stage of the maternal SIV disease course (81 to 360 days). Plasma <b>viral</b> <b>loads,</b> CD 4 + T cell counts and SIV-specific antibody titers were similar in late transmitters and non-transmitters. Late breast milk transmission, however, was correlated with higher <b>average</b> milk <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> and more persistent viral expression in milk 12 to 46 weeks p. i. as compared to non-transmitters. Four mothers failed to transmit virus, despite disease progression and continuous lactation. Conclusion These studies validate the SIV-infected rhesus macaque as a model for breast milk transmission of HIV. As observed in studies of HIV-infected women, transmission occurred at time points throughout the period of lactation. Transmission during the chronic stage of SIV-infection correlated with a threshold level of virus expression as well as more persistent shedding in milk. This model will be a valuable resource for deciphering viral and host factors responsible for transmission of HIV through breastfeeding. </p...|$|R
40|$|Determining which antigen must be {{included}} in AIDS vaccines to confer maximum protection is of utmost importance. In primate models, vaccines consisting of or including accessory viral proteins have yielded conflicting results. We investigated the protective potential of the accessory protein ORF-A of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in cats. All three immunization strategies used (protein alone in alum adjuvant, DNA alone, or DNA prime-protein boost) clearly generated detectable immune responses. Upon challenge with ex vivo homologous FIV, ORF-A-immunized cats showed distinct enhancement of acute-phase infection relative to mock-immunized animals given alum or empty vector DNA. This effect was tentatively attributed to increased expression of the FIV receptor CD 134 that was observed in the immunized cats. However, at subsequent sampling points that were continued for up to 10 months postchallenge, the <b>average</b> plasma <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> of the ORF-A-immunized animals were slightly but consistently reduced relative {{to those of the}} control animals. In addition, CD 4 + T lymphocytes in the circulation system declined more slowly in immunized animals than in control animals. These findings support the contention that immunization with lentiviral accessory proteins can improve the host's ability to control virus replication and slow down disease progression but also draw {{attention to the fact that}} even simple immunogens that eventually contribute to protective activity can transiently exacerbate subsequent lentiviral infections...|$|R
40|$|Although {{antiviral}} agents which block {{human immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) replication can result in long-term suppression of <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> to undetectable levels in plasma, long-term therapy fails to eradicate virus, which generally rebounds after a single treatment interruption. Multiple structured treatment interruptions (STIs) have been suggested as a possible strategy that may boost HIV-specific immune responses and control viral replication. We analyze viral dynamics during four consecutive STI cycles in 12 chronically infected patients with a history (> 2 years) of viral suppression under highly active antiretroviral therapy. We fitted a simple model of viral rebound to the <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> data from each patient by using a novel statistical approach {{that allows us to}} overcome problems of estimating viral dynamics parameters when there are many <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> measurements below the limit of detection. There is an approximate halving of the <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> growth rate between the first and fourth STI cycles, yet the average time between treatment interruption and detection of <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> in the plasma is approximately the same in the first and fourth interruptions. We hypothesize that reseeding of viral reservoirs during treatment interruptions can account for this discrepancy, although factors such as stochastic effects and the strength of HIV-specific immune responses may also affect the time to viral rebound. We also demonstrate spontaneous drops in <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> in later STIs, which reflect fluctuations in the rates of viral production and/or clearance that may be caused by a complex interaction between virus and target cells and/or immune responses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{protease}} inhibitor, TL- 3, demonstrated broad efficacy {{in vitro}} against FIV, HIV and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), and exhibited very strong protective effects on early neurologic alterations in the CNS of FIV-PPR infected cats. In this study, we analyzed TL- 3 efficacy using a highly pathogenic FIV-C isolate, which causes a severe acute phase immunodeficiency syndrome, with high early mortality rates. Results Twenty cats were infected with uncloned FIV-C and half {{were treated with}} TL- 3 while the other half were left untreated. Two uninfected cats were used as controls. The general health and the immunological and virological status of the animals was monitored for eight weeks following infection. All infected animals became viremic independent of TL- 3 treatment and seven of 20 FIV-C infected animals developed severe immunodepletive disease in conjunction with significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) higher viral RNA loads as compared to asymptomatic animals. A marked and progressive increase in CD 8 + T lymphocytes in animals surviving acute phase infection was noted, which was not evident in symptomatic animals (p ≤ 0. 05). Average viral loads were lower in TL- 3 treated animals and of the 6 animals requiring euthanasia, four were from the untreated cohort. At eight weeks post infection, half of the TL- 3 treated animals and only one of six untreated animals had viral loads below detection limits. Analysis of protease genes in TL- 3 treated animals with higher than average viral loads revealed sequence variations relative to wild type protease. In particular, one mutant, D 105 G, imparted 5 -fold resistance against TL- 3 relative to wild type protease. Conclusions The findings indicate that the protease inhibitor, TL- 3, when administered orally as a monotherapy, did not prevent viremia in cats infected with high dose FIV-C. However, the modest lowering of viral loads with TL- 3 treatment, the greater survival rate in symptomatic animals of the treated cohort, and the lower <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> in TL- 3 treated animals at eight weeks post infection is indicative of a therapeutic effect of the compound on virus infection. </p...|$|E
40|$|Mesozooplankton are of {{critical}} importance to marine food webs by transferring energy from the microbial food web to higher trophic levels and depositing energy to the deeper ocean layers through fecal deposition. While decades of research have shown that viruses have significant impacts in the oceans, and infect {{a wide range of}} organisms from bacteria to whales, there is still little known about the impacts of viruses on the mesozooplankton community. As copepods are the most abundant mesozooplankton group, this study sought to characterize the viruses present in natural populations of the calanoid copepods Acartia tonsa and Labidocera aestiva in Tampa Bay, Florida. Viral metagenomics revealed two virus genomes, named Acartia tonsa copepod circovirus (AcCopCV) and Labidocera aestiva copepod circovirus (LaCopCV), which were discovered in their respective copepod species. Both viruses show amino-acid similarities to known circoviruses, and phylogenetic and genomic analyses suggest they may be divergent members of the Circoviridae family. LaCopCV was found to be extremely prevalent in the L. aestiva population, with up to 100 % of individuals infected. High viral loads for LaCopCV were observed by quantitative PCR, with an <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> of 1. 3 x 105 copies per individual. In addition, transcription of the LaCopCV replication gene was detected in L. aestiva, demonstrating active viral replication. AcCopCV could be detected sporadically in A. tonsa populations throughout the year. The circoviruses were specific to their respective hosts, and were not detected in the other copepod species or surrounding seawater. Virus-like particles were observed in A. tonsa and L. aestiva under transmission electron microscopy, demonstrating that viruses were actively proliferating in copepod connective tissue, as opposed to gut tissue, parasites, or symbionts. Preliminary results from in-situ hybridization show that the AcCopCV genome can be detected in A. tonsa tissue, linking the discovered genomes to virus propagation in copepod tissue. This is the first study describing viruses in copepods, as well as the first discovery of circoviruses infecting marine organisms. These results suggest that viruses impact marine copepod populations, necessitating further studies to determine the ecological impacts of viruses on the mesozooplankton community...|$|E

This study presents the results of this screening program. Methods: A prospective, descriptive study was designed to include all the immigrant patients diagnosed of HIV infection attending in Hospital Central de Asturias, Spain, 2006 &#x 2013; 2011. We included demographic variables, CD 4 +cells count and viral load at time of diagnosis. Screening comprised blood count, biochemistry, basic urinalysis, hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis serologic analysis, stool parasites, blood test for filarias, PCR for malaria and Chagas disease serologic analysis and PCR in persons from Latin America. Qualitative variables were compared using the &#x 03 C 7; 2 test, the Fisher exact test, when necessary. For quantitative variables, the Student t test for nonpaired variables or the Mann-Whitney U test were used. Significance was designated at p&# 60; 0. 05. Results: 57 patients were analyzed. 70 % are sub-Saharan immigrant and the rest Latin American. The most frequent countries of origin were Equatorial Guinea (43 %), Nigeria (10 %), Senegal (9 %), Colombia (9 %). Average time in Spain: 1, 061 days (3 &#x 2013; 9, 876). Average Cd 4 +cells were 209 cells/mm 3. The <b>average</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> were 47, 000 RNA viral copies. Intestinal parasites were diagnosed in 27 patients: T. trichuria (22 %), strongyloidiasis (11 %), amebiasis (7 %), and schistosomiasis (5 %), G. intestinalis (4 %). All infections by T. trichuria were diagnosed in Equatorial Guinea patients. Other parasites diseases were: filariasis by M. perstans (9 %); malaria (9 %, all from Equatorial Guinea), Chagas disease (4 %). Eight patients had chronic hepatitis B virus and 2 patients had HCV hepatitis. 19 % of patients had latent syphilis, significantly more frequent in sub-Saharan patients (9 vs 2; p= 0. 04). In 12 patients the screening did not show any disease. Conclusions: Given the high prevalence of certain parasite infections and the potential lack of suggestive symptoms and signs, selected screening for strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis or use of empiric antiparasitic therapy may be appropriate among foreign-born, HIV-infected patients.
