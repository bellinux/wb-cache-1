5|$|The Mecoptera {{are closely}} related to the Siphonaptera (fleas), <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> distantly to the Diptera (true flies). They are {{somewhat}} fly-like in appearance, being small to medium-sized insects with long slender bodies and narrow membranous wings. Most breed in moist environments such as leaf litter or moss, and the eggs may not hatch until the wet season arrives. The larvae are caterpillar-like and mostly feed on vegetable matter, and the non-feeding pupae may pass through a diapause until favourable weather conditions occur.|$|E
5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} {{at a pace}} that would eventually catch up with the United States and Western Europe. This was true despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West came to an abrupt end, and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output per head of Western Europe <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than one third that of the U.S.|$|E

[...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave a mixed review, but was impressed by Madonna's performance. [...] "Dick Tracy is an honest effort but finally {{a bit of a}} folly.

500|$|Speaking to film music fan site Maintitles, Arnold said {{he wanted}} [...] "You Know My Name" [...] {{to act as a}} {{substitute}} for the James Bond theme, to represent Bond's immaturity. The song's main notes are played throughout the film, and the classic theme only plays during the end credits to signal the end of his character arc. Arnold felt the song should tie closer to the score, and have the [...] "DNA of the James Bond music".

It was never meant to be something that would alienate anybody." [...] The article's author, Tom Bryant, describes the album's effect on subsequent Blink-182 albums: [...] "It allowed , and therefore the band, to assess whether, approaching or in their 30s, they still really wanted to be writing songs about splitting up from teenage sweethearts or whether it was time to address something a little more serious <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> important." ...|$|E

He added: [...] " [...] highlights include some searing Velvet Underground feedback and an unusually witty epigram that just about sums up the Spirit of '67: Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea." [...] Rodriguez recognises the timing of the song's release on its public perception. While he notes that the recording was [...] "positively anarchic" [...] in mid-1967, by 1969, when it received widespread release, the song was [...] "slightly less groundbreaking <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> reactionary to the psychedelic movement that the band itself had helped popularize".|$|E
500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album.

[...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E

A writer for PAPER hailed the track as [...] " [...] first 2013 party jam", adding that the song [...] "will jolt you awake this Wednesday morning more quickly than that venti coffee you've been nursing since 9 am". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen gave [...] "BBD" [...] three-and-a-half stars out of five, describing the song as [...] "a typically fleet, flashy collection of disses and boasts that glory in estrogen power, Sapphic delights, and the fun of cuckolding stupid dudes". Spin writer Marc Hogan thought that the track reflected well on Banks' sense of style, writing [...] "With the squiggly high-end and wobbly sub-bass of what we’re really calling trap-rave now, huh, plus some masterfully timed quiet-loud dynamic shifts, the track displays the virtuosically foul-mouthed rapper’s usual immaculately stylish beat selection".|$|E

500|$|Although more commercially {{successful}} than the band's previous albums, Mother's Milk received mixed reviews from critics who were unimpressed with the excessive distortion {{found throughout the}} record. However, it was praised as well; Amy Hanson of AllMusic called it [...] "a pivotal album for the Red Hot Chili Peppers," [...] and believed that [...] "if anyone doubted the pulsating power that leapt from the blistering opener, 'Good Time Boys', {{it took only a}} few bars of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' outrageous, and brilliant, interpretation of the Stevie Wonder classic 'Higher Ground' to prove that this new lineup was onto something special. Wrapping up with the aptly titled and truly punked-out 'Punk Rock Classic' and the band's own punched-up tribute to 'Magic Johnson', Mother's Milk was everything the band had hoped for, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> besides." [...] Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called it a [...] "high-octane fusion of metal, funk and rap—sort of Prince meets Jimi Hendrix in the Twilight Zone," [...] while noting that [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] combined [...] "electrifying musicianship".

500|$|A {{scientist}} {{studying the}} Kaiju. Day stated: [...] "Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide {{a little bit}} of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." [...] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a [...] "big personality". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: [...] "He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both." [...] Trek Buccino portrays Geiszler as a child.|$|E
500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> hopeful." ...|$|E
