40|$|Recycling {{of asphalt}} {{pavements}} has increased significantly since 1970 and in Malaysia {{the use of}} foamed bitumen as stabilizing agent was first introduced in year 2001. Recycling of asphalt pavements involves mixing of existing pavement material with stabilizing agent such as foamed bitumen, bitumen emulsion, cement or lime and placed on the milled pavement and compacted. Although the asphalt pavements recycling with foamed bitumen as stabilizing agent is gaining recognition and acceptance as a cost effective method of rehabilitating distressed pavement, so far in Malaysia no study {{has been carried out}} on the characteristic of foamed bitumen stabilized mix.

The main advantages of asphalt cold recycling techniques are the use of reclaimed materials and the fact that there is no need of aggregate heating to make the mixtures. This paper describes the evolution with time of in-situ performances of different foam bitumen-stabilised mixtures made with different <b>active</b> <b>fillers</b> (cement and lime), monitored during the first year from construction. Results are part of a more extensive research programme aimed to investigate the effects of using lime as an active filler in cold-recycled mixtures. Mixtures have been laid down on a specifically designed trial section in Italy, close to Florence. Short-term bearing capacity, immediately after construction, has been evaluated using a light weight deflectometer while to evaluate the mid-term performances falling weight deflectometer (FWD) tests have been performed after 24 hours, 14 days, 28 days and 9 months from construction. During these 9 months the test road was not opened to traffic, so the mixtures experienced almost no traffic (only construction traffic loads). This fact allowed to have the curing process without any influences other than the temperature: it means same curing conditions for all mixtures. Subsequent FWD tests are still ongoing to evaluate the evolution over time of pavement bearing capacity due to traffic. Results obtained positively support the use of lime as an active filler in the foam bitumen-stabilised material and allow to underline the effect of different <b>active</b> <b>fillers</b> in the material behaviour, even if all the mixtures underline excellent performances under traffic loading.

The mechanical metallization Of Si 3 N 4 with Ti was employed as an alternative route to deposit active metallic films prior to brazing with stainless steel using 72 % Ag- 28 % Cu or 82 % Au- 18 % Ni eutectic alloys. The brazing temperatures were set to 40 degrees C or 75 degrees C above the eutectic temperature of each filler alloy. Ti-films of average thickness 4 mu m produced adequate spreading of both filler alloys onto Si 3 N 4 substrates, which were subsequently brazed to stainless steel. The interface Of Si 3 N 4 / 310 stainless steel basically consisted of a reaction layer, a precipitation zone and an eutectic microconstituent. Mechanically sound and vacuum-tight joints were obtained, especially upon brazing at relatively lower temperatures. Increasing the brazing temperature resulted in thermal cracking of the Si 3 N 4, possibly due to increased thermal stress. (c) 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc...|$|R
