Creedish members have been {{steadily}} killing themselves since the mass suicide, in keeping with their belief that the deliverance is at hand. At the start of his story, Tender works as the housekeeper for a rich couple he never sees in Oregon. They issue directions via a daily planner and a speaker phone. At his dingy apartment, he gets phone calls from people who want to kill themselves - the result of a newspaper misprint which printed his phone number as the number for a suicide prevention hotline. Tender, enjoying the thrill of passing divine judgment on these people tells them to kill themselves <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>not,</b> and sees this as an act of mercy. Although the newspaper prints a retraction, the calls keep coming, and when they dwindle, Tender prints up fliers for a fake crisis hotline with his number on them so the calls will continue.|$|E

40|$|There is no {{consensus}} {{about the value of}} objective measurements of nasal patency. To assess the correlation between the subjective sense of nasal patency and the outcomes found with rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry. Structured literature search. SEARCH STRATEGY AND EVALUATION METHOD: Review of English-language articles in which correlations were sought between subjective nasal patency symptoms and objective scores as found with rhinomanometry [nasal airway resistance (NAR) ] and acoustic rhinometry [minimal cross-sectional area (MCA) ]. Correlations were related to unilateral or combined assessment of nasal passages and to symptomatic nasal obstruction or unobstructed nasal breathing. Sixteen studies with a level of evidence II-a or II-b fit the inclusion criteria and were further analysed. Almost every possible combination of correlations or lack thereof in relation to the variables included was found. However, when obstructive symptoms were present, a correlation between the patency symptoms with nasal airway resistance and minimal cross-sectional area was found more often than in the absence of symptoms. In cases of bilateral assessment a correlation was found almost <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> it was <b>not</b> between patency symptoms and total nasal airway resistance or combined minimal cross-sectional areas, while in the limited amount of studies in which unilateral assessment was done a correlation was found each time between patency symptoms and nasal airway resistance. The correlation between the outcomes found with rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry and an individual's subjective sensation of nasal patency remains uncertain. Based on this review, it seems that the chance of a correlation is greater when each nasal passage is assessed individually and when obstructive symptoms are present. There still seems to be only a limited argument for the use of rhinomanometry or acoustic rhinometry in routine rhinologic practice or for quantifying surgical result...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{mnemonic}} {{methods of}} teaching vocabulary in the Second Language (L 2) classroom are not providing the students with sufficient vocabulary knowledge to facilitate effective communication, i. e. students do not use the words they have learnt for communication as textbook presentation and drill do not ensure student use of these same structures in the student’s own spontaneous expression (Savignon, 2000). The strategies to facilitate meaning-vocabulary 1 learning {{as part of a}} wider outcome to teaching elements of functional communication in a multilingual society is not clearly defined in the Revised National Curriculum Statement (DoE, 2003). This research report set in a constructivist framework, will attempt to raise awareness in language teachers of a need to recognize the importance to facilitate meaning-vocabulary in L 2 in OBE and collaborative learning. The aim of this research was therefore to find an effective strategy to facilitate collaborative L 2 meaning-vocabulary learning to develop functional communication. The research question in this study was: * How can facilitators more effectively guide collaborative meaning-vocabulary learning to improve functional communication? Secondary questions to this study were: * Why do L 2 facilitators not spend enough time on collaborative meaning-vocabulary learning? * What {{is the role of the}} facilitator in L 2 collaborative meaning-vocabulary learning through communicative teaching strategies? * How should meaning-vocabulary be taught to ensure students acquire the ability to use the L 2 critically and creatively in functional communicative situations outside the classroom? I have set my methodology in a qualitative paradigm, used an action research design, made use of interviews and interpreted the interviews to clarify the research topic by means of a ‘thick description’ (Henning, et al. 2004 : 142). The data used in this research were not only gathered from describing and analyzing the practices of the classroom community, but it also originated in real life classroom situations and both of these are characteristics of action research (Burns, 2000). I have used different data collection methods to ensure the validity of the findings and the recommendations. The methodology used to gather the data guided me to explore qualitative content analysis, grounded theory analysis and to a lesser extent discourse analysis. I have used these three methods to condense the data to find some meaning in the form to enable me to construct a theory around facilitating meaning-vocabulary learning, i. e. construct my own interpretive text. Qualitative content analysis was the basis for grounded theory analysis, while the discourse was dissected to find alternative proof for the findings. Some of the findings included guidelines which a teacher should keep in mind when facilitating meaning-vocabulary learning: 1. Know your students. 2. Keep meaning-vocabulary learning enjoyable – use different strategies when possible, but let them ‘construct’ their own knowledge. The students must ‘do’ something when they are learning meaning-vocabulary. 3. Encourage the students to use the words during functional communication exercises and essay writing. 4. Encourage the students to engage in their L 2 inside and outside the classroom <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible, e. g. listen to radio, watch television, engage in conversation with friends or family in the L 2. 5. Focus on meaning-vocabulary in communicative language. 6. Engage in conversation with your students <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible, <b>not</b> only about a theme or topic but also about their experiences and feelings in your classroom. 7. Use pictures to explain word meanings. Let them create their own images where possible. 8. Use the new meaning-vocabulary during discussions. Mr. W. A. Janse van Rensbur...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the writer}} {{presents}} the important of vocabulary {{in the process}} of teaching and learning English. By mastering the vocabulary of the target language, pupils will be able to learn the skills; listening, speaking, reading, and writing easier (Nation, 1994 : 8). From the teaching practice, the writer realizes that the technique of teaching vocabulary using word lists with its meaning is still used. However, teaching vocabulary by using word lists is considered monotonous by some people. Shepperd (1973 : 2) supported by stating that vocabulary learning can be dull if the teacher only gives a list of words to be memorized. It is because the pupils inclined to look up the list of words as drudgery. Teacher usually gives word lists and asks pupils to memorize them. After a long period of time, most of the vocabularies learnt disappear from the pupils’ memories. In line with the fact, the writer would like to suggest the use of pictorial crossword puzzle in the vocabulary teaching. Furthermore, she conducts a studying in order to obtain statistically proved data which will provide a point of consideration whether the suggested technique can really improve the pupils’ vocabulary. The statement of problem reveals in this study: “Do year seven pupils who are taught vocabulary using pictorial crossword puzzle have a higher vocabulary achievement than those taught using word lists?” Teachers can use pictorial crossword puzzle to teach vocabulary. Wharton (1995 : 47) supported by mentioning that one of the objectives of using crossword puzzle is to reinforce pupils’ vocabulary. They can ask pupils to expand their vocabularies by finding the words based on the clues and the pictures given. The reason for giving pictures besides clues is to help pupils understand the vocabularies given easier since they will find not only noun but also verb and adjective. Moreover, by using pictorial crossword puzzle in teaching vocabulary, pupils can learn to discuss the answer of the puzzle with their friends by using the target language. Wharton (1995 : 47) supported by stating that crossword puzzle is as one media of providing pupils with practice in the use of incorporating crossword puzzle into communicative activity. In addition, an interesting media can be used to create situations where the subject is seen freshly <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible <b>not</b> only for the pupils but also for the teacher (Davis, 1991 : 1). Besides that, pictorial crossword puzzle for teaching vocabulary can be made by the teachers themselves since it is quite easy to create. First, make a list of words with which the pupils should be familiar., and then give the clue and picture for each number. After that search a letter common to two words and it is done. In conducting this experiment, the writer took the seven year pupils of SLTPK Santo Yosef Surabaya of the school year 2007 - 2008 as the population of the study. While for the sample, the writer took two classes from the population as the experimental and the control groups. The experimental group received vocabulary teaching through the pictorial crossword puzzle, while the control group received vocabulary teaching through the word lists. Based on the scores obtained from the post-test, the data show that there is a significant difference on the pupils’ vocabulary achievement between the two groups. The pupils who are taught using the pictorial crossword puzzle have better vocabulary achievement than the ones who are taught using the word lists. In short, the finding of this study leads {{to the conclusion that the}} pictorial crossword puzzle can be applied as a means of the teaching of vocabulary for the Junior High School pupils...|$|R
