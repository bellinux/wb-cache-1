This paper addresses the problems of increased flight delays and aircraft fuel consumption through the integrated control <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> <b>arrival</b> and departure operations.

The proposed control framework calculates the optimal times of departure of aircraft from the gates, as a function <b>of</b> the <b>arrival</b> and departure traffic as well as airport characteristics such as taxiway layout and gate capacity. The integrated control formulation is solved using dynamic programming, which allows calculation of policies for real-time implementation.

40|$|A {{standard}} descent {{procedure with}} a fixed flight-path-angle (FPA) is {{proposed to improve}} trajectory predictability for arriving small jets in the transition airspace into congested terminal area. Three candidate strate-gies for selecting fuel-efficient and flyable descent FPAs are proposed. The three strategies vary in operational complexity and fuel-burn merits. To mitigate variation of wind among flights, the two simpler strategies are adapted to <b>airport,</b> directions <b>of</b> <b>arrival,</b> and time. Three major US airports with different degrees of wind variation and disparate arrival traffic flows are analyzed. Results show that, {{when compared to the}} simple Airport-Static adaptation, the finest adaptation of the simpler strategies recover up to 50 %- 75 % of the extra fuel burn relative to the minimum-fuel strategy. Wind variation, descent altitude restrictions, arrival directions, and fleet composition all affect the fuel efficiency of the simple strategies. Trade-offs between fuel burn and planned speed brake usage in the choice of the FPA are discussed. Fuel efficiency of simple strategies for the entire national airspace in the United States is estimated. Considerations and implications for air navigation service providers are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, several {{stochastic}} optimization {{models are}} presented {{to determine the}} number <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> <b>arrival</b> slots that should be made available for distribution via a market mechanism. Considerable attention is paid to the structure and mathematical properties of each of these models, with regards to obtaining integer-valued solutions.

In addition, an analysis of the average pecuniary valuations assigned to each slot is presented, as this is an essential input to these models. Several methods are suggested by which each of these values can be estimated. The models are intended to be taken in a general context, but extensive computational examples making use of data for LaGuardia Airport are provided as a case study in the application of the various techniques presented herein...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} demand {{management}} approaches to curbing flight delays {{is predicated on}} an accurate and reliable a-priori determination <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> <b>arrival</b> and departure capacity. The assignment of declared capacity, completed {{more than one year}} in advance, must consider the inherent variability in the actual throughput capacity for each 15 minute period during the day. For airports with large variations in airport capacity, the capacity limit must be set to high enough avoid long periods of under utilization <b>of</b> the <b>airport</b> resources and low enough to avoid extended periods of excessive delays. This paper examines: (i) the variability of throughput capacity at the OEP- 35 airports during the convective weather season in 2008, (ii) established the average costs of delays due to reduced capacity and the average profits per flight at each airport, (iii) given the cost of delays and lost profits, an optimum capacity is determined at each airport to minimize both the under-utilization <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> capacity and flight delays due to variability in the available throughput capacit...|$|R

Significant reduction of noise impact on perimeters <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> via <b>arrival</b> trajectory optimization is considered {{as one of the}} major targets of the project. In this paper, an aircraft model and its acoustic performance are introduced to assist the development of the optimization tool since the CleaenEra project is still ongoing. Interval analysis is explained in details because interval algebra is employed to deal with real intervals rather than real numbers in the so-called interval-related optimization algorithms. The largest advantage of such algorithms is that they are capable of finding the global optimum out of the multiple local minima to a given optimization problem. Two numerical examples are presented to show the usefulness of such algorithms while solving both static and dynamic optimization problems. In the end, a third example is given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed optimization tool to trajectory optimization for arriving passenger aircraft.
