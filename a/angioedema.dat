5|$|Aspirin can induce {{swelling}} of skin tissues in some people. In one study, <b>angioedema</b> appeared one {{to six hours}} after ingesting aspirin {{in some of the}} people. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause <b>angioedema</b> in these people; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when <b>angioedema</b> appeared.|$|E
5|$|Croup is {{typically}} diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The {{first step is}} to exclude other obstructive conditions of the upper airway, especially epiglottitis, an airway foreign body, subglottic stenosis, <b>angioedema,</b> retropharyngeal abscess, and bacterial tracheitis.|$|E
5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, <b>angioedema,</b> or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, <b>angioedema</b> of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and <b>angioedema</b> are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
25|$|C1 Esterase {{inhibitor}} deficiency (hereditary <b>angioedema),</b> a rare disease, generally causes {{attacks of}} <b>angioedema,</b> but can present solely with abdominal pain and occasional diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angioedema</b> can {{be due to}} {{antibody}} formation against C1INH; this is an autoimmune disorder. This acquired <b>angioedema</b> {{is associated with the}} development of lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors can induce <b>angioedema.</b> ACE inhibitors {{block the}} enzyme ACE {{so it can}} no longer degrade {{bradykinin}}; thus, bradykinin accumulates and causes <b>angioedema.</b> This complication appears more common in African-Americans. In people with ACE inhibitor <b>angioedema,</b> the drug needs to be discontinued and an alternative treatment needs to be found, such as an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) which has a similar mechanism but does not affect bradykinin. However, this is controversial, as small studies have shown some patients with ACE inhibitor <b>angioedema</b> can develop it with ARBs, as well.|$|E
25|$|Future {{attacks of}} {{hereditary}} <b>angioedema</b> {{can be prevented}} {{by the use of}} androgens such as danazol, oxandrolone or methyltestosterone. These agents increase the level of aminopeptidase P, an enzyme that inactivates kinins; kinins (especially bradykinin) are responsible for the manifestations of <b>angioedema.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{acquired}} <b>angioedema,</b> HAE types I and II, and nonhistaminergic <b>angioedema,</b> antifibrinolytics such as {{tranexamic acid}} or ε-aminocaproic acid may be effective. Cinnarizine {{may also be}} useful because it blocks the activation of C4 {{and can be used}} in patients with liver disease, while androgens cannot.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angioedema</b> is {{classified}} as either hereditary or acquired.|$|E
25|$|Heinrich Quincke first {{described}} the clinical picture of <b>angioedema</b> in 1882, though {{there had been}} some earlier descriptions of the condition.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in the C1 {{inhibitor}} gene {{can cause}} hereditary <b>angioedema,</b> a genetic condition resulting from reduced regulation of bradykinin by C1-INH.|$|E
25|$|Omapatrilat (dual {{inhibitor}} of NEP and angiotensin-converting enzyme) {{developed by}} BMS {{did not receive}} FDA approval due to <b>angioedema</b> safety concerns.|$|E
25|$|Some {{patients}} develop <b>angioedema</b> due {{to increased}} bradykinin levels. A genetic predisposition may exist toward this adverse effect in patients who degrade bradykinin more slowly than average.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{captopril}} include cough due {{to increase in}} the plasma levels of bradykinin, <b>angioedema,</b> agranulocytosis, proteinuria, hyperkalemia, taste alteration, teratogenicity, postural hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukopenia.|$|E
25|$|There {{are as many}} as 80,000 to 112,000 {{emergency}} department (ED) visits for <b>angioedema</b> annually, and it ranks as the top allergic disorder resulting in hospitalization in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in factor XII {{have been}} {{associated}} with an asymptomatic prolongation in the clotting time and possibly a tendency toward thrombophlebitis. Other mutations have been linked with a rare form of hereditary <b>angioedema</b> (type III) essentialism.|$|E
25|$|Omapatrilat (dual {{inhibitor}} of NEP and angiotensin-converting enzyme) {{developed by}} BMS {{did not receive}} FDA approval due to <b>angioedema</b> safety concerns. Other dual inhibitors of NEP with ACE/angiotensin receptor are (in 2003) being developed by pharmaceutical companies.|$|E
25|$|Ketorolac is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with hypersensitivity, allergies to the medication, cross-sensitivity to other NSAIDs, prior to surgery, history of peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, alcohol intolerance, renal impairment, cerebrovascular bleeding, nasal polyps, <b>angioedema,</b> and asthma.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{adverse effect}} specific for ACE inhibitors, {{but not for}} other RAAS blockers, {{is an increase in}} bradykinin level. Elevated bradykinin level due to ACE inhibition can be a cause of dry cough, <b>angioedema</b> and/or rash, hypotension, and inflammation-related pain.|$|E
25|$|Various {{mechanisms}} {{that interfere with}} bradykinin production or degradation can lead to <b>angioedema.</b> ACE inhibitors block ACE, the enzyme that among other actions, degrades bradykinin. In hereditary <b>angioedema,</b> bradykinin formation is caused by continuous activation of the complement system due to a deficiency {{in one of its}} prime inhibitors, C1-esterase (aka: C1-inhibitor or C1INH), and continuous production of kallikrein, another process inhibited by C1INH. This serine protease inhibitor (serpin) normally inhibits the association of C1r and C1s with C1q to prevent the formation of the C1-complex, which - in turn - activates other proteins of the complement system. Additionally, it inhibits various proteins of the coagulation cascade, although effects of its deficiency on the development of hemorrhage and thrombosis appear to be limited.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angioedema</b> {{is an area}} of {{swelling}} of the lower layer of skin and tissue just under the skin or mucous membranes. The swelling may occur in the face, tongue, larynx, abdomen, or arms and legs. Often it is associated with hives, which are swelling within the upper skin. Onset is typically over minutes to hours.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to protect}} the airway may include {{intubation}} or cricothyroidotomy. Histamine related <b>angioedema</b> can be treated with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine. In those with bradykinin related disease a C1 esterase inhibitor, ecallantide, or icatibant may be used. Fresh frozen plasma may be used instead. In the United States the disease affects about 100,000 people a year.|$|E
25|$|Acquired <b>angioedema</b> (AAE) can be immunologic, nonimmunologic, or idiopathic. It {{is usually}} caused by allergy and occurs {{together}} with other allergic symptoms and urticaria. It can also occur as a side effect to certain medications, particularly ACE inhibitors. It is characterized by repetitive episodes of swelling, frequently of the face, lips, tongue, limbs, and genitals. Edema of the gastrointestinal mucosa typically leads to severe abdominal pain; in the upper respiratory tract, it can be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Paradoxically yet uncommonly, {{indometacin}} {{can cause}} headache (10 to 20%), sometimes with vertigo and dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, blurred vision (with or without retinal damage). There are unsubstantiated reports of worsening Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Cases of life-threatening shock (including <b>angioedema,</b> sweating, severe hypotension and tachycardia {{as well as}} acute bronchospasm), severe or lethal hepatitis and severe bone marrow damage have all been reported. Skin reactions and photosensitivity are also possible side effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects are fine tremor, anxiety, headache, muscle cramps, dry mouth, and palpitation. Other {{symptoms}} may include tachycardia, arrhythmia, flushing of the skin, myocardial ischemia (rare), and disturbances {{of sleep and}} behaviour. Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of paradoxical bronchospasms, urticaria (hives), <b>angioedema,</b> hypotension, and collapse. High doses or prolonged use may cause hypokalemia, which is of concern especially in patients with renal failure and those on certain diuretics and xanthine derivatives.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} is {{made on the}} clinical picture. Routine blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function, liver enzymes) are typically performed. Mast cell tryptase levels may be elevated if the attack was due to an acute allergic (anaphylactic) reaction. When the patient has been stabilized, particular investigations may clarify the exact cause; complement levels, especially depletion of complement factors 2 and 4, may indicate deficiency of C1-inhibitor. HAE type III is a diagnosis of exclusion consisting of observed <b>angioedema</b> along with normal C1 levels and function.|$|E
25|$|Reported {{side effects}} of {{cimetidine}} include diarrhea, rashes, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, and muscle pain, {{all of which are}} usually mild and transient. It has been reported that mental confusion may occur in the elderly. Because of its hormonal effects, cimetidine rarely may cause sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction and gynecomastia (0.1–0.2%) in males during long-term treatment. Rarely, interstitial nephritis, urticaria, and <b>angioedema</b> have been reported with cimetidine treatment. Cimetidine is also commonly associated with transient raised aminotransferase activity; hepatotoxicity is rare.|$|E
25|$|Since thiazide diuretics {{affect the}} {{transport}} of electrolytes and water in the kidney, they can be responsible for abnormalities of water balance and electrolyte levels. Removal of too much fluid can cause volume depletion and hypotension. Various electrolyte abnormalities may result, including hyponatremia (low sodium), hypokalemia (low potassium), hypochloremia (low chloride), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), hypercalcemia (high calcium), and hyperuricemia (high uric acid). These may result in dizziness, headache, or heart arrhythmias (palpitations). Serious, though rare, side effects include aplastic anemia, pancreatitis, agranulocytosis, and <b>angioedema.</b> Metolazone, like other thiazide diuretics, may unmask latent diabetes mellitus or exacerbate gout, especially by interacting with medicines used to treat gout. In addition, thiazide diuretics, including metolazone, are sulfonamides; those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamides ("sulfa allergy") may also be allergic to metolazone.|$|E
25|$|The {{hereditary}} form (HAE) {{often goes}} undetected {{for a long}} time, as its symptoms resemble those of more common disorders, such as allergy or intestinal colic. An important clue is the failure of hereditary <b>angioedema</b> to respond to antihistamines or steroids, a characteristic that distinguishes it from allergic reactions. It is particularly difficult to diagnose HAE in patients whose episodes are confined to the gastrointestinal tract. Besides {{a family history of}} the disease, only a laboratory analysis can provide final confirmation. In this analysis, it is usually a reduced complement factor C4, rather than the C1-INH deficiency itself, that is detected. The former is used during the reaction cascade in the complement system of immune defense, which is permanently overactive {{due to the lack of}} regulation by C1-INH.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of serpin diseases {{are due to}} protein aggregation and are termed [...] "serpinopathies". Serpins are vulnerable to disease-causing mutations that promote formation of misfolded polymers due to their inherently unstable structures. Well-characterised serpinopathies include α1-antitrypsin deficiency (alpha-1), which may cause familial emphysema and sometimes liver cirrhosis, certain familial forms of thrombosis related to antithrombin deficiency, types1 and 2 hereditary <b>angioedema</b> (HAE) related to deficiency of C1-inhibitor, and familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB; a rare type of dementia caused by neuroserpin polymerisation).|$|E

2500|$|In {{allergic}} <b>angioedema,</b> {{avoidance of}} the allergen {{and use of}} antihistamines may prevent future attacks. Cetirizine is a commonly prescribed antihistamine for <b>angioedema.</b> [...] Some patients have reported success with {{the combination of a}} nightly low dose of cetirizine to moderate the frequency and severity of attacks, followed by a much higher dose when an attack does appear. [...] Severe <b>angioedema</b> cases may require desensitization to the putative allergen, as mortality can occur. Chronic cases require steroid therapy, which generally leads to a good response. In cases where allergic attack is progressing towards airway obstruction, epinephrine may be life-saving.|$|E
