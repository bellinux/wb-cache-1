The NHC {{noted that they}} did not have <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the storm and were unsure of its future track and intensity. Below average sea surface {{temperatures}} ahead of the system would hamper significant development. Continuing on this track, Christine gradually intensified and on September2, the storm attained its peak intensity just below hurricane-status while situated roughly 300mi (500km) east of Guadeloupe. At this time, a reconnaissance aircraft recorded sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). Shortly after Christine attained this intensity, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{placed the}} young heir to Ludlow, another Edmund Mortimer, {{under house arrest}} {{in the south of}} England, and kept <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> Ludlow Castle himself. This persisted until Henry V finally granted Edmund his estates in 1413, with Edmund going on to serve the Crown overseas. As a result, the Mortimers rarely visited the castle during {{the first part of the}} century, despite the {{surrounding}} town having become prosperous in the wool and cloth trades. Edmund fell heavily into debt and having sold his rights to his Welsh estates to a consortium of nobles, before dying childless in 1425.|$|E

By the 1920s, the Soviets had <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> power in Russia, {{and the return of}} the monarchy was not a serious possibility. Nevertheless, George's cousin, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich, declared himself Emperor Cyril and George a prince.|$|E

The edge of the cam lever that faces the webbing is usually knurled to provide <b>a</b> <b>firmer</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the webbing. Tension is added by pulling the excess webbing through the fastener until the necessary tension is achieved and then releasing the cam lever to lock the webbing in place.|$|R
25|$|Rákosi's {{priorities}} for the economy were developing military industry and heavy industry and providing the Soviet Union with war compensation. Improving standards of living were not a priority, {{and for this reason}} the people of Hungary saw living standards fall. Although his government became increasingly unpopular, he had <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> power until Stalin died on 5 March 1953 and confused power struggle began in Moscow. Some of the Soviet leaders perceived the unpopularity of the Hungarian regime and ordered Rákosi to give up his position as prime minister in favor of another former Communist-in-exile in Moscow, Imre Nagy, who was Rákosi's chief opponent in the party. Rákosi, however, retained his position as general secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party and {{over the next three years}} the two men became involved in a bitter struggle for power.|$|E
25|$|For the Turks, {{it was the}} {{beginning}} of a new era of power. Despite further invasions and attacks by Crusaders from the west and the Mongols and Turkic tribes from the east, the Turks slowly emerged as a superpower under the Ottomans. The rise of the Ottomans was parallel to the fall of the Sultanate of Rum and the carving up of the Byzantine Empire. The power vacuum left in Anatolia was easily exploited by one of the Sultanate's nobles, Osman I. Matters were made worse for the Byzantine Empire due to the Latin presence in the Peloponnese and the rising power of the Bulgarians who continued to press hard against the borders of Byzantium. In time, the Byzantines would be forced to call on the aid of the Ottomans to head to the European mainland and fight the Bulgarians, giving the Ottoman Turks <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> Europe. The close proximity of Osman's Beylik ensured that confrontation between the Byzantines and the Ottomans would be inevitable. The Byzantines were a match for the Ottomans but events west of Constantinople coupled with civil war and incompetent leadership left the Byzantines reeling from one siege after another until Constantinople fell in 1453.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time that Olivier made his attack, Salme's Advanced Guard and Watrin's division, which had {{previously}} been in reserve, crossed the Trebbia on the far right flank. Moving in two bodies, the French force brushed aside the Austrian outpost line. The right thrust reached Ca' Pernici on the Po's south bank while the left thrust carried almost to Calendasco. Here Watrin paused because the noises from Olivier's fight were not encouraging. By this time, Melas had Olivier on the run and wished to attack across the Trebbia. Hearing of the Watrin-Salme incursion, the Austrian general was forced to deal with it first. Melas sent Liechtenstein with a task force composed of one squadron of the Lobkowitz Dragoons, two squadrons of the Archduke Joseph Hussars, 200 Cossacks and nine companies of infantry. Meanwhile, an artillery battery detached from the Mantua siege corps under the command of Colonel Kinsky unlimbered on the north bank of the Po. The Austrian guns proceeded to bombard their enemies, encouraging them in their decision to recross the Trebbia though the Austrians made prisoners of 300 French. The firing ended in the northern sector about 9:00 pm. The French maintained <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> {{the west bank of the}} Trebbia, but MacDonald's division commanders were not able to give him any estimate of their remaining strength. In a scene of horror, thousands of dead and wounded soldiers littered the bed of the Trebbia while Piacenza's Austrian garrison blindly fired cannons into the night. Realizing that neither Moreau nor La Poype were coming to his assistance, MacDonald issued the orders to retreat at 10:00 pm. As soon as the engineers bridged the Nure River, the artillery and wagon train were sent across, followed by the infantry starting about midnight.|$|E

500|$|Ndlovu-Gatsheni {{argued that}} since the mid-1990s, Mugabe's rhetoric and speeches came to be {{dominated}} by three main themes: an obsession with a perceived British threat to re-colonise Zimbabwe, to transfer the land controlled by white farmers to the black population, and issues of belonging and patriotism. References to the Rhodesian Bush War featured prominently in Mugabe's speeches. The scholar of African studies Abiodun Alao noted that Mugabe was determined to [...] "take advantage of the past in order to secure <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> national security".|$|E
500|$|Although Constantine {{created his}} {{apparent}} heirs [...] "Caesars", following a pattern established by Diocletian, {{he gave his}} creations a hereditary character, alien to the tetrarchic system: Constantine's Caesars were {{to be kept in}} the hope of ascending to Empire, and entirely subordinated to their Augustus, {{as long as he was}} alive. Therefore, an alternative explanation for the execution of Crispus was, perhaps, Constantine's desire to keep <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> his prospective heirs, this—and Fausta's desire for having her sons inheriting instead of their half-brother—being reason enough for killing Crispus; the subsequent execution of Fausta, however, was probably meant as a reminder to her children that Constantine would not hesitate in [...] "killing his own relatives when he felt this was necessary".|$|E

Our novel {{analysis of the}} European Monetary System confirms that liquidity support was provided under {{the discretion of the}} anchor country (Germany), and was indeed asymmetric across member countries and/or periods. In particular, it was less forthcoming (i) to countries further away from Germany (less politically influential there), (ii) to larger countries (interfering more with the Bundesbank's monetary control) and (iii) during periods when German inflation accelerated (and the Bundesbank needed <b>a</b> <b>firmer</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> liquidity).

500|$|The often uneasy {{relationship}} between the larger, wealthier ranches and smaller ranch settlers became steadily worse after the harsh winter of 1886–1887, when a series of blizzards and temperatures of -50 to -40°F (-45 to -40°C) followed by an extremely hot and dry summer, ravaged the frontier. Thousands of cattle were lost and the large companies began appropriating land and the water supply in the area. Some of the harsher tactics included forcing settlers off their land, setting fire to their properties, and excluding them from participating in the annual roundup. They justified these excesses on what was public land by using the catch-all allegation of rustling. Hostilities worsened when the Wyoming legislature passed the [...] "Maverick Act," [...] which stated that all unbranded cattle in the open range automatically belonged to the cattlemen's association. The cattlemen also held <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> Wyoming's stock interests by {{limiting the number of}} small ranchers that could participate.|$|E
500|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{has a strong}} and well {{developed}} neck and forequarters, but relatively underdeveloped hindquarters. The rump is rounded rather than angular, which prevents attackers coming from behind from getting <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> it. The head is wide and flat with a blunt muzzle and broad rhinarium. In contrast to the striped hyena, the ears of the spotted hyena are rounded rather than pointed. Each foot has four digits, which are webbed and armed with short, stout and blunt claws. The paw-pads are broad and very flat, with the whole undersurface of the foot around them being naked. The tail is relatively short, being [...] long, and resembles a pompom in appearance. Unusually among hyaenids, and mammals in general, the female spotted hyena is considerably larger than the male. Both sexes have a pair of anal glands which open into the rectum just inside the anal opening. These glands produce a white, creamy secretion which is pasted onto grass stalks by everting the rectum. The odour of this secretion is very strong, smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The spotted hyena has a proportionately large heart, constituting close to 1% of its body weight, thus giving it great endurance in long chases. In contrast, a lion's heart makes up only 0.45–0.57 percent of its body weight. The now extinct Eurasian populations were distinguished from the modern African populations by their shorter distal extremities and longer humerus and femur.|$|E
40|$|In 1550 {{the last}} Catholic bishop in Iceland was {{executed}} by Icelandic Lutherans and the Danish governors. The {{country on the}} outer fringes of the Danish kingdom thus succumbed to a Reformation {{that had already been}} established in the other territories of Denmark and Norway. This article examines contemporary sources and modern scholarship in order to demonstrate that the success of the new movement was based largely on two factors. Firstly, this was a Reformation that was deliberately light on theology, a "changing of fashions" as it came to be known in Icelandic. Secondly, it was an inevitable consequence of the growing national strength of early modern Denmark that was keener to establish <b>a</b> <b>firmer</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> its territories than it had ever had before...|$|R
