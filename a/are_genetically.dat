5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids are {{unlikely}} to occur. The only reported hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata has resulted in germination, indicating that these two species <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely because the two species flower at different times.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{great white}} sharks {{were added to}} California's Endangered Species Act. From data collected, the {{population}} of great whites in the North Pacific {{was estimated to be}} fewer than 340 individuals. Research also reveals these sharks <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa, Australia, and the east coast of North America, having been isolated from other populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{control of}} migration, its timing and {{response}} <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> controlled {{and appear to}} be a primitive trait that is present even in non-migratory species of birds. The ability to navigate and orient themselves during migration is a much more complex phenomenon that may include both endogenous programs as well as learning.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{surrogacy}} (also {{known as}} partial, genetic, or straight surrogacy) involves natural or artificial insemination of a surrogate. If the intended father's sperm {{is used in}} the insemination, then the resulting child <b>is</b> <b>genetically</b> related to the intended father and genetically related to the surrogate. If donor sperm is used, the resulting child <b>is</b> not <b>genetically</b> related to either intended parent(s) but <b>is</b> <b>genetically</b> related to the surrogate.|$|R

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas), meaning that they originate from the single layer of epithelial cells that line the endometrium and form the endometrial glands. There are many microscopic subtypes of endometrial carcinoma, but they are broadly organized into two categories, Type I and Type II, based on clinical features and pathogenesis. The two subtypes <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> distinct.|$|E
5|$|These {{characteristics}} <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> inherited and {{has been}} interpreted as {{the early stages of}} the speciation process. The two ecotypes will eventually become separate species once reproductive isolation is achieved.

5|$|Worker {{policing}} {{occurs when}} worker bees {{in the colony}} <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> {{more closely related to}} the queen than the reproductive female. In many instances, the eggs of the female worker are eaten, or she is repeatedly attacked by other workers. This mechanism of egg removal ensures that the queen's sons predominate.|$|E

5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> modified {{to make them more}} useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid.

5|$|At least 40% {{of people}} with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have a positive family history, suggesting that some people <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> predisposed to suffering with oral ulceration. HLA-B12, HLA-B51, HLA-Cw7, HLA-A2, HLA-A11, and HLA-DR2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis. However, these HLA types are inconsistently associated with the condition, and also vary according to ethnicity. People who have a positive family history of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form of the condition, and {{at an earlier age}} than is typical.|$|E
5|$|Auxois {{horses are}} usually bay or bay roan in color, {{although}} {{they can also}} be chestnut or red roan, similar to the Ardennais. gray and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> brown, not black with pangaré markings) are also accepted for registration; all other colors are excluded. The Auxois is known for its power and docility, having a calm and gentle temperament. Like the Ardennais, it is an easy keeper, able to survive outdoors in all seasons, even in the harsh climatic conditions sometimes seen in Morvan and Nievre.|$|E

5|$|Cerebrates are {{secondary}} {{agents in}} the Zerg Swarm, each of which commands an individual brood of Zerg that possesses a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Alongside the Overmind, the cerebrates are the only Zerg with full sapience, {{each with its own}} personality and methods, although they <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> incapable of disobeying the Overmind. Cerebrates can be reincarnated by the Overmind upon death, though dark templar energies are capable of preventing this. The death of a cerebrate causes the Overmind to lose control of its respective brood, which will then run amok.|$|E
5|$|Colors {{accepted}} by the breed registry include chestnut, bay and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> brown, not black with pangaré markings). Bays with white markings are the most popular. Norman Cobs are known as calm, willing horses with strong personalities. The breed's Thoroughbred ancestry gives them energy and athleticism, and makes them mature faster than other draft breeds. They show great endurance when ridden, and are relatively hardy, accepting outdoor living and changes in climate. Traditionally the Norman Cob had its tail docked, a practice that continued until January 1996, when the practice became illegal in France.|$|E
5|$|Early genetic {{studies were}} focused on lions from eastern and {{southern}} parts of Africa, and already showed that lions can possibly be divided in two main clades: one {{to the west of}} the Great Rift Valley and the other to the east.

5|$|In a {{different}} study, tissue and bone samples of 32 lion specimens in museums were used. Results indicated that lions form phylogeographic groups, one each in North Africa / Asia, West Africa, eastern Sahel, south-eastern Africa and south-western Africa. Results of another phylogeographic {{study indicate that}} southeastern Ethiopia, western Somalia and northern Kenya are genetic admixture regions between lions from Central Africa and Southern Africa, and that lions {{in the northern part}} of Central Africa <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> closer to lions in North and West Africa, and those in the southern part closer to lions in Southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Like other wattles, Acacia pycnantha fixes {{nitrogen}} {{from the}} atmosphere. It hosts bacteria known as rhizobia that form root nodules, where they make nitrogen available in organic form and thus help the plant grow in poor soils. A field study across Australia and South Africa {{found that the}} microbes <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> diverse, belonging to various strains of the species Bradyrhizobium japonicum and genus Burkholderia in both countries. It is unclear whether the golden wattle was accompanied by the bacteria to the African continent or encountered new populations there.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{species that}} <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> {{compatible}} may not hybridize in nature for various reasons, including geographical isolation, differences in flowering period, or differences in pollinators. Species that are brought together by humans in gardens may hybridize naturally, or hybridization can be facilitated by human efforts, such as altered flowering period or artificial pollination. Hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that {{have some of}} the characteristics of each of the parent species. Much work is now being done with hybrids between crops and their wild relatives to improve disease-resistance or climate resilience for both agricultural and horticultural crops.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to modern}} times, horse breeds {{throughout}} Europe were known {{primarily by the}} name of the region where they were bred. The Lusitano takes its name from Lusitania, an ancient Roman name for the region that today is Portugal. A very similar horse, the Spanish Andalusian, originally described the horses of distinct quality that came from Andalusia in Spain. Some sources state that the Andalusian and the Lusitano <b>are</b> <b>genetically</b> the same breed, and the only difference is the country in which individual horses are born. The Lusitano is also known as the Portuguese, Peninsular, National or Betico-lusitano horse.|$|E
5|$|Results of an mtDNA {{analysis}} of 55 jungle cats from various biogeographic zones in India indicate a high genetic variation and {{a relatively low}} differentiation between populations. It appears that the central Indian F. c. kutas population separates the Thar F. c. prateri populations from the rest and also the south Indian F. c. kelaarti populations from the north Indian F. c. affinis ones.
