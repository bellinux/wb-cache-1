40|$|Abstract Background The novel {{pandemic}} A (H 1 N 1) {{virus was}} first identified in Mexico in April 2009 {{and since then}} it spread world wide over {{a short period of}} time. Although the virus infection is generally associated with mild disease and a relatively low mortality, it is projected that mutations in specific regions of the viral genome, especially within the receptor binding domain of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein could result in more virulent virus stains, leading to a more severe pandemic. Results Here, we found that a single amino acid substitution of Asp-to-Gly at position 222 in the HA protein of the A (H 1 N 1) virus occurred after two passage propagation in the <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavities</b> of chicken embryonated eggs, and this single residue variation dramatically increased the viral replication ability in MDCK cells and pathogenicity in BALB/c mice. Conclusions A substitution of Asp-to-Gly at position 222 in the HA protein was prone to occur under positive selection pressures, and this single amino acid mutation could dramatically increase the virus replication ability in vitro and pathogenicity in vivo. Our finding offers {{a better understanding of the}} transmission and evolution of the 2009 pandemic A (H 1 N 1) virus and brings attention to further potentially severe influenza pandemic that may result from cross-host evolution of the influenza viruses. </p...|$|R

The positive results for PPR growth on embryonated chicken eggs and cell culture were confirmed by use of agar gel immune diffusion test and immunoperoxidase staining technique. The embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated by four different routes (allantoically, amniotically, chorioallantoic membrane and yolk sac). The PPRV was passage twice in embryonated chicken eggs (passage one and passage two). The virus grew on embryonated chicken eggs when inoculated by the four different routes but without any lesions in embryos and chorioallantoic membranes in the two passages, then the growth of the virus was detected by agar gel immune diffusion test. In passage one, allantoic fluid gave negative results in agar gel immune diffusion test when inoculated by allantoic routes. In passage one and passage two, inoculation by amniotic and allantoic routes showed that the virus grew in amniotic and allantoic fluids but not in yolk. In passage one and passage two, inoculation by chorioallantoic membrane route showed thatthe virus grew in amnioticand allantoic fluids and yolk. In passage one and passage two, inoculation by yolk sac route showed that the virus grew in yolk, which became pale and lost its constitution. The amniotic and allantoic fluids gave inaccurate results inagar gel immune diffusion test. In passage one and passage two, the embryos homogenate gave positive results to agar gel immune diffusion test when inoculated by the four different routes. The PPRVwhich was used in this study was passage in cell culture twice; the PPR vaccine used alsowas passage twice. Nine tissue culture tubes containing semiconfluent Vero cells were inoculated with 0. 2 ml virus 5 stock containing 10 6. 62 CCID 50 /ml and incubated in 35 °C, 37 °C and 39 °C; three tissue culture tubes for each temperature degree were used. The tissue culture tubes were incubated for 48 hrs, 72 hrs and 96 hrs, using three tissue culture tubes for each incubation time interval. After incubation periods the tissue culture tubes were harvested and titrated. At 35 °C, the titers were 10 2. 5, 10 4. 27 and 10 5 in 48, 72 and 96 hours post inoculation, respectively. At 37 °C, the titers were 10 3. 5, 10 5 and 10 5. 55 in 48, 72 and 96 hours post inoculation respectively, while cultivation of the virus at 39 °C for 48 hrs gave titer 10 1. 8 CCID 50 /ml, but there was no viral growth detected when the virus was cultivated for 72 and 96 hrs. The highest titer was at 37 °C after 96 hours incubation (10 5. 5 CCID 50 /ml), while the lowest titer was at 39 °C after 48 hrs (10 1. 8 CCID 50 / ml).

We now describe a system, based on a Sendai virus minigenome, to produce large amounts of heterologous viral glycoproteins in the <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavity</b> of embryonated eggs. Results Soluble forms of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) fusion (F) proteins, devoid of their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, were produced in allantoic fluids using the Sendai minigenome system. The first step was rescuing in cell cultures Sendai virus minigenomes encoding the proteins of interest, with the help of wild type Sendai virus. The second step was propagating such recombinant defective viruses, together with the helper virus, in the <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavity</b> of chicken embryonated eggs, and passage to optimize protein production. When compared with the production of the same proteins in the culture supernatant of cells infected with vaccinia recombinants, the yield in the allantoic fluid was 5 – 10 fold higher. Mutant forms of these soluble proteins were easily constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in eggs using the same approach. Conclusion The simplicity and economy of the Sendai minigenome system, together with the high yield achieved in the allantoic fluid of eggs, makes it an attractive method to express soluble glycoproteins aimed for structural studies. </p...|$|E

Histologically, the chorio-allantoic mambrane showed proliferation of fibroblasts and epithelial cells and infiltration of monocytoid cells and eosinophils in the interstitial tissue. In the inoculation of the fluorocarbon-purified viral materials from myelogenous and lymphocytic leukemia, the changes of the chorioallantoic membrane were almost the same as findings described above. But in the case of mammary cancer, changes such as thickning, opacities, hyperemia and edema of the inoculated areas of the chorioallantoic membrane were more remarkable and sometimes hemorrhages and tumor-like nodular swellings were also observed. Histologically, proliferation of epithelial cells, fibroblasts and infiltration of eosinophils, lymphoid and monocytoid cells were much more prominent. No pathologic changes of other embryonic organs were observed following inocuration of the viral materials isolated by either method. 2) Inoculation in the <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavity.</b> In all cases, no significant organ changes were observed and no death of the embryos occurred. 3) Inoculation in the yolk sac. Inoculation of the filtered viral materials caused 100 % desth of the embryos by the ninth day after inoculation in the case of myelogenous leukemia, by the twelfth day in lymphocytic lukemia and by the fifth day in mammary cancer. On the other hand, in the inoculation of the fluorocarbon-purified viral materials, 100 % mortality occurred by the fifth day in myelogenous leukemia and mammary cancer and by the ninth day in lymphocytic leukemia. These varied experimental results are considered {{to be related to the}} differences in strains and virulencies of the viruses...|$|E
40|$|Neospora caninum causes {{economical}} {{impact in}} cattle-raising farms {{since it is}} implicated as the major cause of bovine abortions. Although infection by the parasite has been widely described in mammals, the role of birds in its life-cycle is still obscure. Therefore, this work aimed to evaluate the infection by N. caninum in different chicken models. Experimental infections were conducted in 7 -day-old chicks, laying hens and embryonated eggs, where samples were analysed for parasite burden, IgG antibodies and lesions promoted. Chickens demonstrated an asymptomatic infection, although with seroconversion and systemic replication of the parasite. In laying hens, no signs of vertical transmission were observed. However, embryonated eggs inoculated by the <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavity</b> route demonstrated susceptibility to infection, with mor-tality rates around 50 % independent of the inoculum dose. Additionally, dogs became infected after ingestion of different amounts of inoculated eggs, producing either oocysts or specific IgG antibodies. The results herein presented demonstrate that chickens may be intermediate hosts of N. caninum and that embryonated eggs could be a useful model to study the parasite’s biology...|$|E
40|$|Published {{studies on}} the {{interaction}} of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) with Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells have utilized two different forms of virus: (a) ordinary laboratory strains propagated by serial passage in the <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavity</b> of the chick embryo and referred to in this paper as "chick embryo-adapted NDV, " and (b) NDV which has been adapted to growth in EAT cells, referred to in this paper as "EAT-adapted NDV. " The EATadapted virus is able to undergo an apparently normal growth cycle in EAT cells (1), while chick embryo-adapted NDV is not (2 - 5). Although chick embryo-adapted virus is able to infect EAT cells, causing cell death, newly synthesized infective virus has never been detected in this latter system (2 - 4). The present paper {{will be limited to}} further consideration of the interaction of chick embryo-adapted NDV with EAT cells. The technique of infecting EAT cells with chick embryo-adapted NDV in vitro and the events which follow such infection have been described (2 - 4). Following adsorption of virus to the tumor cells, virus was found to lose infectivit...|$|E
40|$|Addition of iron componds to inocula of the {{relatively}} avirulent T 3 or T 4 colony types of gonococci increased their lethality for chicken embryos after intravenous inoculation but {{had little or no}} effect on the highly virulent T 1 or T 2 types. The toxicity of nonviable inocula, killed cells or sonicates, was not significantly affected by ecogenous iron. Addition of the iron-binding protein conalbumin reduced or delayed the lethal effect of T 1, but not T 3, gonococci although growth of both colony types in the <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavity</b> of the embryo was inhibited by this protwin. This effect can be attributed specifically to deprivation of iron since the iron-complexed form of conalbumin had no apparent influence on growth or virulence. The results indicate that the ability to acquire iron in vivo is a significant factor in gonococcal virulence. The virulent colony types appear to have enhanced ability to compete with the host for iron and this {{may be related to the}} presence of pili, other surface components, or the synthesis of iron-chelating compounds...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that aureomycin has an inhibitory effect on the multiplication of the agents of the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma group. In experimental infection of laboratory animals and embryonated hens ' eggs, this drug {{has been shown to}} suppress, but not completely inhibit, the multiplication of the viruses and to extend the survival time of the infected host (1, 2). Reports also indicate that it is of some therapeutic value in relieving clinical symptoms in human infections caused by these agents (3, 4). A study of the growth cycle of meningopneumonitis virus in the <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavity</b> of the fertile hen's egg, reported elsewhere (5), strongly suggests that the pattern of multiplication of this agent is similar to that described for other viruses; i. e., an early period of virus adsorption followed by a change into a non-infectious stage and a subsequent appearance of the new generation of virus. If the type of growth of this agent resembles that of true viruses, the question arises as to why this agent is susceptible to the action of antibiotics which have no effect on other viruses...|$|E
40|$|Upon {{injection}} of active influenza A or B virus into the <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavity</b> {{of the developing}} chick embryo, an average of only 70 per cent of the agent was adsorbed onto the tissue, {{as measured by the}} difference between the quantity of virus injected and that found free in the allantoic fluid of the injected eggs during the constant period. The degree of adsorption was similar, regardless of whether 109 or 102 ID 50 of active virus was injected. Attempts to demonstrate the adsorbed virus in suspensions of the infected tissue met with partial success only in that not more than 1 to 5 per cent of the amount calculated to be adsorbed was actually found. All efforts to increase the yield of virus have failed. These results led to the suggestion that the seed virus, which participates in the propagation, becomes altered {{in such a way that}} it no longer may be demonstrated by infectivity titrations, whereas the active virus found represents superficially adsorbed virus, which does not multiply...|$|E
40|$|Recombinant lentogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) of {{the vaccine}} strain Clone- 30 was {{reproducibly}} generated after simultaneous expression of antigenome-sense NDV RNA and NDV nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from plasmids transfected into cells stably expressing T 7 RNA polymerase. For this purpose, the genome of Clone- 30, comprising 15186 nt, was cloned and sequenced prior to assembly into a full-length cDNA clone under control of a T 7 RNA polymerase promoter. Recombinant virus was amplified by inoculation of transfection supernatant into the <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavity</b> of embryonated specific-pathogenfree (SPF) chicken eggs. Two marker restriction sites comprising {{a total of five}} nucleotide changes artificially introduced into noncoding regions were present in the progeny virus. The recombinant NDV was indistinguishable from the parental wild-type virus with respect to its growth characteristics in cell culture and in embryonated eggs. Moreover, an intracerebral pathogenicity index of 0 � 29 was obtained for both viruses as determined by intracerebral inoculation of day-old SPF chickens, proving that the recombinant NDV is a faithful copy of the parental vaccine strain of NDV...|$|E
40|$|The Newcastle disease virus (NDV) {{occurring}} in Australia is apathogenic for chickens following natural infections. Some {{properties of the}} avirulent Australian V 4 strain of NDV and of 12 new isolates of NDV were compared. The viruses grew to high titres following infection of chick embryos by the <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavity</b> and allantoic fluid had infectivity titres of from 108 · 7 to 109 · 5 EID 50 0. 2 ml. With only two isolates did sufficient mortalities occur to allow calculation of mean death times and these were in excess of 140 h. Five of nine isolates failed to kill 100 % of embryos when doses in excess of 107 · 9 EID 50 were used. When strain V 4 was inoculated into the yolk sac of 10 -day-old embryos, the LD 50 {{was similar to the}} ID 50 obtained with <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavity</b> inoculation, and the mean death time was 103 h. The intracerebral pathogenicity index for strain V 4 was 0. 91 and 1. 02 in two experiments. The index was not significantly reduced when the virus was taken through a further cycle of plaque purification or when the inoculum was heated at 56 °C for 30 min. Chickens with maternally derived antibody to NDV were not susceptible to intracerebral inoculation with strain V 4. Chickens dying after intracerebral inoculation with strain V 4 had haemorrhagic and necrotic liver lesions. The intracerbral pathogenicity indices for four other isolates varied from 0 to 0. 22. The infectivity of V 4 and three other isolates was relatively stable at 56 °C and that of another eight isolates was labile. Haemagglutinins of all viruses studied were stable at 56 °C for longer than 60 min. None of four isolates tested lost haemagglutinin activity on treatment with ether. Haemagglutination-elution patterns were variable but four isolates did not elute from chicken erythrocytes after 24 h at 4 °C and strain V 4 and isolate PM 12 did not elute after 96 h at 4 °C. Six viruses, including V 4, agglutinated erythrocytes from all of six test horses. The haemagglutinin activity of the remaining viruses varied between horses. Four viruses including V 4 haemolysed chicken erythrocytes. Gradient centrifugation allowed the separation of an infectious and a noniffectious haemagglutinin. Haemolytic activity was associated with the infectious haemagglutinin...|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies on}} the interrelationships between animal viruses and their {{respective}} hosts have been restricted {{to an analysis of}} the response to infection of the host animal as a whole, or of the affected organs. If one could study host-virus interactions in individual host cells, or groups of identical cells, it is obvious that much could be learned regarding the mechanism of infection. There are not many animal host-virus systems available at present which lend themselves as readily to such analyses as do bacterial host-virus systems, but the entodermal layer of the allantoic sac of the developing chick embryo infected with influenza virus provides an approach to such a system, although it is far from ideal. In the analysis of the mechanism of infection of the cells lining the <b>allantoic</b> <b>cavity</b> of the chick embryo by influenza virus, one may reason, a priori, that the infectious process is divided into at least four major steps: (a) adsorption of the virus onto the host cells; (b) entrance of the virus into the cells;l (c) propagation of the virus within the host cells; 1 and (d) liberation of the newly forme...|$|E
