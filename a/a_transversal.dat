500|$|Unlike {{arterial}} ultrasonography, venous ultrasonography {{is carried}} out with the probe in <b>a</b> <b>transversal</b> position, (perpendicular to the vein axis). [...] All collateral veins are better detected this way, including perforator veins, but of most importance is the detection of venous thrombosis. The most reliable sign of thrombosis (even when a good image and color is present) {{is the absence of}} compressibility. However, if the probe is parallel to the vein axis, when the examiner compresses it, the probe can slide to the right or to the left giving a false negative for thrombosis as the probe has moved away and the vein will not then be evident. Nevertheless, when the examiner needs to show the head thrombus in a printout, the probe will be presented parallel to the vein axis.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{bipartite graph}} G = (U,V,E), one may form a matroid {{in which the}} {{elements}} are vertices on one side U of the bipartition, and the independent subsets are sets of endpoints of matchings of the graph.

2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>transversal</b> matroid {{is defined}} {{from a family}} of sets: its {{elements}} are the elements of the sets, and a set [...] of these elements is independent whenever there exists a one-to-one matching of the elements of [...] to disjoint sets containing them, called a system of distinct representatives. Equivalently, a tranversal matroid may be represented by a special kind of gammoid, defined from a directed bipartite graph [...] that has a vertex in [...] for each set, a vertex in [...] for each element, and an edge from each set to each element contained in it.|$|E

40|$|Consider the {{following}} fundamental geometric problem: given {{a family of}} convex sets in the plane, does there exist a line that intersects {{every member of the}} family? Such a line is known as <b>a</b> line <b>transversal</b> for the family. The problem has been considered for many different families of objects. In general, $ Omega(n log n) $ time is required to compute <b>a</b> line <b>transversal</b> of <b>a</b> family of n objects. In this thesis, it is shown that several line transversal problems can be solved in $O(n) $ time. The problem of computing a shortest line segment that intersects every member of a family of objects is also considered. In particular, $O(n log n) $ time algorithms are proposed for computing <b>a</b> shortest <b>transversal</b> of <b>a</b> family of n lines and of a family of n line segments. As well, an $O(n log sp 2 n) $ time algorithm for computing <b>a</b> shortest <b>transversal</b> of <b>a</b> family of convex polygons with a total of n vertices is presented. Our algorithm for the line segment version of the shortest transversal problem is optimal...|$|R
40|$|Poisson transversals {{are those}} sub{{manifold}}s in a Poisson manifold which intersect all symplectic leaves transversally and symplectically. In a previous note we proved a normal form theorem around such submanifolds. In this communication, we promote that result {{to a normal}} form theorem for Poisson maps around Poisson <b>transversals.</b> <b>A</b> Poisson map pulls <b>a</b> Poisson <b>transversal</b> back to <b>a</b> Poisson <b>transversal,</b> and our first main result states that simultaneous normal forms exist around such transversals, for which the Poisson map becomes transversally linear, and intertwines the normal form data of the transversals. Our second main result concerns symplectic integrations. We prove that a neighborhood of <b>a</b> Poisson <b>transversal</b> is integrable exactly when the Poisson transversal itself is integrable, {{and in that case}} we prove a normal form theorem for the symplectic groupoid around its restriction to the Poisson transversal, which puts all its structure maps in normal form.
