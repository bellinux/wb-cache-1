50|$|There are {{two types}} of PAV <b>alias</b> <b>addresses,</b> static and dynamic. A static <b>alias</b> <b>address</b> is defined, in both DASD {{hardware}} and z/OS, to refer to a specific single base address. Dynamic means that the number of <b>alias</b> <b>addresses</b> assigned to a specific base address fluctuates based on need. The management of these dynamic aliases is left to WLM, running in goal mode (which is always the case with supported levels of z/OS). On most systems that implement PAV, there is usually a mixture of both PAV types. One, perhaps two, static aliases are defined for each base UCB and a bunch of dynamic aliases are defined for WLM to manage as it sees fit.|$|R

50|$|Parallel Access Volume (PAV) allow UCBs {{to clone}} {{themselves}} to allow multiple I/O to run simultaneously. With appropriate support by the DASD hardware, PAV provides support {{for more than}} one I/O to a single device at a time. To maintain backward compatibility, operations are still serialized below the UCB level. But PAV allows the definition of additional UCBs to the same logical device, each using an additional <b>alias</b> <b>address.</b> For example, a DASD device at base address 1000, could have <b>alias</b> <b>addresses</b> of 1001, 1002 and 1003. Each of these <b>alias</b> <b>addresses</b> would have their own UCB. Since there are now four UCBs to a single device, four concurrent I/Os are possible. Writes to the same extent, an area of the disk assigned to one contiguous area of a file, are still serialized, but other reads and writes occur simultaneously. The first version of PAV the disk controller assigns a PAV to a UCB. In the second version of PAV processing, Work Load Manager (WLM) reassigns a PAV to new UCBs from time to time. In the third version of PAV processing, with the DS8000 controller series, each I/O uses any available PAV with the UCB it needs.|$|R
50|$|The {{net effect}} of PAVs is to {{decrease}} the IOSQ time component of disk response time, often to zero. , the only restrictions to PAV are the number of <b>alias</b> <b>addresses,</b> 255 per base address, and overall number of devices per logical control unit, 256 counting base plus aliases.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of the Lucent Personalized Web Assistant (LPWA). LPWA is a software system that enables a user to browse the Web in a personalized, simple, private, and secure fashion and to filter junk e-mail (spam). LPWA generates secure, consistent and pseudonymous aliases (personae) for Web users. Each alias consists of an alias username, an alias password and an <b>alias</b> e-mail <b>address.</b> The <b>alias</b> e-mail <b>addresses</b> allow web-sites to send messages to users and enable effective filtering of junk e-mail (spam). LPWA forwards mail <b>addressed</b> to the <b>alias</b> e-mail <b>address</b> to the actual user. LPWA allows users to filter incoming messages based on the recipient <b>address</b> (the <b>alias</b> e-mail), which is an effective method for detecting and blocking spam. A trial version of LPWA became available to the public at [URL] in June, 1997. It has so far (as of May, 1998) attracted more than 21000 users. 1 Introduction In recent years the World-Wide Web (WWW) ha [...] ...|$|R
50|$|For {{communication}} to exist, secure relationships must be established. These {{must have a}} defined purpose and restrict membership to the group, which serves as the base of trust {{to carry out the}} desired work. Within a wired systems, data transfers imply a controlled physical connection; this translates into the wireless domain through the concept of ownership: the user grants trust to the devices, which in turn prove this trust to others (interacting in so-called ceremonies) in order to form the desired associations. The USB <b>address</b> <b>identifier</b> is a token of the owner's trust. Applications may require other bases of trust not directly supported by this USB-specific model, in which case they can be implemented on top of the core USB stack.|$|R

Starting with observation of the patterns how those terms are used, a new definition for the terms and their relations are presented. First, name and address are defined based on assignment, where a name denotes an entity itself and an address denotes a point to which the entity is attached. On the other hand identifier and locator are defined based on their use, where identifier is used for identifying an entity from others without ambiguity and locator is used for locating an entity within a given space. Next, the relationship among those four terms is presented. Finally, we show how communication is performed {{with respect to the}} new definition...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{challenges}} {{arising from}} using virtual coordinates for routing in ad hoc and sensor networks in multi-domain network scenarios. Recently, {{it has been}} shown that virtual coordinate based routing techniques are able to overcome several problems in ad hoc networks. They are independent of known geographic locations and less prone to routing failures. Additionally, some of the proposed solutions are exploiting the concept of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) to support data management. A typical example is the Virtual Cord Protocol (VCP). However, it is unclear how to integrate multiple networks or network domains in the concept of virtual <b>address</b> <b>identifiers.</b> We propose a solution for interdomain routing in virtual coordinate based protocols by exploiting the available DHT. Together with appropriate indirections, efficient inter-domain routing becomes possible...|$|R

50|$|Another {{approach}} to reducing SMS spam that {{is offered by}} some carriers involves creating an <b>alias</b> <b>address</b> rather than using the cell phone's number as a text message address. Only messages sent to the alias are delivered; messages sent to the phone's number are discarded. A New York Times article provided detailed information on this in 2008. Another countermeasure {{is to use a}} service that provides a public phone number and publishes the SMS messages received at that number to a publicly accessible website. Google Voice can be used in this way, but with numbers and messages kept private. most cell phone providers offer the option of completely disabling all text messaging services on a user's account. This extreme solution, however, is satisfactory only for those users who have neither the need nor the desire to utilize SMS at all.|$|R
50|$|UCBs were {{introduced}} in the 1960s with OS/360. Then a device addressed by UCB was typically a moving head hard disk drive or a tape drive, with no internal cache. Without it, the device was usually grossly outperformed by the mainframe's channel processor. Hence, {{there was no reason}} to execute multiple input/output operations at the same time, as these would be impossible for a device to physically handle. In 1968 IBM introduced the 2305-1 and 2305-2 fixed-head disks, which had 8 exposures (<b>alias</b> <b>addresses)</b> per disk, and the OS/360 support provided a UCB per exposure in order to permit multiple concurrent channel programs. Similarly, later systems derived from OS/360 required an additional UCB for each allocated virtual volume in a 3850 Mass Storage System (MSS) and for each exposure on a 3880-11, 3880-13 and their successors.|$|R
50|$|A12 Authentication (Access Authentication for 1xEV-DO) is a CHAP-based {{mechanism}} {{used by a}} CDMA2000 Access Network (AN) {{to authenticate}} a 1xEV-DO Access Terminal (AT). A12 authentication occurs when an AT first attempts to access the AN and is repeated after some authentication timeout period. The element in the AN that performs this authentication is the Radio Network Controller (RNC) using its Access Network AAA (AN-AAA). In order to support A12 authentication, matching A12 credentials (i.e., an A12 Network <b>Address</b> <b>Identifier</b> (NAI) and A12 CHAP key) must be provisioned into the AT and the user‚Äôs home AAA server. Since these credentials are only shared between the AT and its home AAA, the AN-AAA forwards A12 challenge responses received from an AT to its home AAA {{to determine whether they}} are correct. A12 authentication is separate from packet data authentication that may occur later when a data session is being established.|$|R
