50|$|In November 2006, the High Court of Justice in London {{agreed to}} hear a group action by about 30,000 claimants from Côte d'Ivoire against Trafigura over the <b>alleged</b> <b>dumping</b> of toxic waste from the Probo Koala.|$|E
50|$|To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what {{assessment}} he {{has made}} {{of the effectiveness of}} legislation to protect (a) whistleblowers and (b) press freedom following the injunctions obtained in the High Court by (i) Barclays and Freshfields solicitors on 19 March 2009 on the publication of internal Barclays reports documenting alleged tax avoidance schemes and (ii) Trafigura and Carter-Ruck solicitors on 11 September 2009 on the publication of the Minton report on the <b>alleged</b> <b>dumping</b> of toxic waste in the Ivory Coast, commissioned by Trafigura.|$|E
50|$|The {{first major}} publicised event {{involving}} {{the use of}} injunctions to prevent reporting in the UK was in October 2009, when The Guardian newspaper reported {{that it had been}} prevented by a legal injunction applied for by London libel lawyers Carter Ruck from covering remarks made in Parliament. Other sources, including The Spectator and the blogger Guido Fawkes, then speculated that it related to previous reports the Guardian had printed regarding the oil company Trafigura and their <b>alleged</b> waste <b>dumping</b> in the Ivory Coast.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the water}} {{and much of the}} land {{along the banks of the}} Gowanus Canal have been {{severely}} polluted by combined sewer outflows (CSOs) along the canal designed to relieve sewage and storm water when the sewer treatment plant is overwhelmed, as well as by decades of industrial use and extensive coal gas manufacturing during the late 19th century. The Gowanus Canal was also an <b>alleged</b> Mafia <b>dumping</b> ground. Even so, in the early 1980s, alongside the canal, an old 19th-century munitions factory at 230 3rd Street in Gowanus became the site of the massive Gowanus Memorial Artyard, whose remains are still visible.|$|R
50|$|In January 2014 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed {{on behalf of the}} {{residents}} of the community of Cannon's Campground and other residents of the area surrounding a former Hoechst Celanese industrial site in South Carolina. The lawsuit <b>alleged</b> the <b>dumping</b> of a number of toxic chemicals into local waters, which has diminished property values and caused a number of illnesses. Hoechst Celanese asked the courts to dismiss these charges as spurious, claiming that its discharges have not caused substantial harm to anyone or to the environment, and further asserting that a 3-year limit on tort claims has expired, relieving the company of any responsibility for damages which might be eventually discovered.|$|R
50|$|In June 2011, the Southern African Poultry Association (SAPA) filed a {{complaint}} with the International Trade Administration Commission (ITAC) of South Africa about the <b>alleged</b> <b>dumping</b> of Brazilian frozen chicken products in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) countries, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa. ITAC launched its investigation in June 2011. After examining the relevant data in the South African market between 2008 and 2010, the ITAC imposed provisional anti-dumping duties of between 6% and 63% in January 2012, following an investigation that concluded that three major Brazilian exporters sold chicken products at prices below their domesticmarket cost.|$|E
50|$|Generally speaking, an {{anti-dumping}} investigation usually develops along the following steps: domestic producer(s) make(s) {{a request to}} the relevant authority to initiate an {{anti-dumping investigation}}. Then investigation to the foreign producer is conducted {{to determine if the}} allegation is valid. It uses questionnaires completed by the interested parties to compare the foreign producer's (or producers') export price to the normal value (the price in the exporter’s domestic market, the price charged by the exporter in another country, or a calculation based on the combination of the exporter’s production costs, other expenses and normal profit margins). If the foreign producer's export price is lower than the normal price and the investigating body proves a causal link between the <b>alleged</b> <b>dumping</b> and the injury suffered by the domestic industry, it comes to a conclusion that the foreign producer is dumping its products. According to Article VI of GATT, dumping investigations shall, except in special circumstances, be concluded within one year, and in no case more than 18 months after initiation. Anti-dumping measures must expire five years after the date of imposition, unless a review shows that ending the measure would lead to injury.|$|E
40|$|This {{arbitration}} on {{the level}} of countermeasures, pursuant to Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) 22. 6, originates from findings against the United States with respect to a provision of the 1916 Anti-Dumping Act, which permits a private cause of action for treble damages against an <b>alleged</b> <b>dumping</b> importer or producer where the dumping meets certain criteria, notably including a predatory intention. An unusual feature of this case is that, apparently, the provision in question had not yet been used against the EC, the complainant. In any case, the provision in question was found to be in violation of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement, both because it would impose measures on dumping other than and in addition to anti-dumping duties, and because in so doing the procedural requirements of the Anti-Dumping Agreement would not be followed. ...|$|E
50|$|In 1980, {{shortly after}} the Kincora story {{appeared}} in the press, Wallace was arrested and subsequently convicted of the manslaughter of the husband {{of one of his}} colleagues. It was reported that Wallace had beaten antiques dealer Jonathan Lewis to death before attending a dinner party with the dead man's wife. Later that night, Wallace was <b>alleged</b> to have <b>dumped</b> the body in the River Arun. He served six years in gaol, from 1981 to 1987.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{is known as}} the Bast Theory. It states that the fire was burning long before the <b>alleged</b> trash <b>dump</b> fire. According to local legend, the Bast Colliery coal fire of 1932, set alight by an explosion, was never fully extinguished. In 1962, it reached the landfill area. Those who adhere to the Bast Theory believe that the dump fire is a separate fire unrelated to the Centralia mine fire. One man who disagrees is Frank Jurgill Sr., who claims he operated a bootleg mine with his brother {{in the vicinity of the}} landfill between 1960 and 1962. He says that if the Bast Colliery fire had never been put out, he and his brother would have been in it and killed by the gases. [...] Based on this and due to contrary evidence, few hold this position, and it is given little credibility.|$|R
40|$|U. S. {{antidumping}} laws exist so {{that domestic}} markets can protect themselves against foreign goods {{sold in the}} United States at less than fair market value. In an antidumping case, after the initial petition is filed, all costs of investigation and determination fall on the U. S. government. Those companies and markets <b>alleged</b> of <b>dumping,</b> however, must pay for their own defense, diverting money from industry development to defense of their actions. A majority of the antidumping cases filed result in a de minimis or zero antidumping margin, but the costs of achieving such a result weigh heavily on the accused market. This Note explores the application and results of U. S. antidumping laws on U. S. and foreign companies {{and the distribution of}} costs in their application. Using the Salmon Case from Chile as an example, it argues that in order to eliminate frivolous and protectionist antidumping actions, the petitioners should bear the costs of investigation and discovery instead of the government...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the investigation was to confirm the presence and determine {{the location of a}} cache of 30 to 60 buried 55 -gallon drums that were allegedly dumped along the course of the pre-existing, northsouth diversion ditch (NSDD) adjacent to permitted landfills at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Kentucky. The ditch had been rerouted and was being filled and re-graded {{at the time of the}} <b>alleged</b> <b>dumping.</b> Historic information and interviews with individuals associated with <b>alleged</b> <b>dumping</b> activities indicated that the drums were dumped prior to the addition of other fill materials. In addition, materials alleged to have been dumped in the ditch, such as buried roofing materials, roof flashing, metal pins, tar substances, fly ash, and concrete rubble complicated data interpretation. Some clean fill materials have been placed over the site and graded. This is an environment that is extremely complicated in terms of past waste dumping activities, construction practices and miscellaneous landfill operations. The combination of site knowledge gained from interviews and research of existing site maps, variable frequency EM data, classical total magnetic field data and optimized GPR lead to success where a simpler less focused approach by other investigators using EM- 31 and EM- 61 electromagnetic methods and unfocused ground penetrating radar (GPR) did not produce results and defined no real anomalies. A variable frequency electromagnetic conductivity unit was used to collect the EM data at 3, 030 Hz, 5, 070 Hz, 8, 430 Hz, and 14, 010 Hz. Both in-phase and quadrature components were recorded at each station point. These results provided depth estimates for targets and some information on the subsurface conditions. A standard magnetometer was used to conduct the magnetic survey that showed the locations and extent of buried metal, the approximate volume of ferrous metal present within a particular area, and allowed estimation of approximate target depths. The GPR survey used a 200 megahertz (MHz) antenna to provide the maximum depth penetration and subsurface detail yielding usable signals to a depth of about 6 to 10 feet in this environment and allowed discrimination of objects that were deeper, particularly useful in the southern area of the site where shallow depth metallic debris (primarily roof flashing) complicated interpretation of the EM and magnetic data. Several geophysical anomalies were defined on the contour plots that indicated the presence of buried metal. During the first phase of the project, nine anomalies or anomalous areas were detected. The sizes, shapes, and magnitudes of the anomalies varied considerably, but given the anticipated size of the primary target of the investigation, only the most prominent anomalies were considered as potential caches of 30 to 60 buried drums. After completion of a second phase investigation, only two of the anomalies were of sufficient magnitude, not identifiable with existing known metallic objects such as monitoring wells, and in positions that corresponded to the location of <b>alleged</b> <b>dumping</b> activities and were recommended for further, intrusive investigation. Other important findings, based on the variable frequency EM method and its combination with total field magnetic and GPR data, included the confirmation of the position of the old NSDD, the ability to differentiate between ferrous and non-ferrous anomalies, and the detection of what may be plumes emanating from the landfill cell...|$|E
40|$|On January 16, 2003, the WTO Appellate Body (AB) {{issued its}} {{report on the}} appeal by the United States (US) of the Panel {{decision}} in United States - Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000. The report concerns {{the consistency of the}} United States Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 (the "CDSOA,” or the so-called Byrd Amendment) with several WTO provisions. This legislation requests the federal state to distribute proceeds from antidumping and countervailing duties to all US economic operators that have supported a request previously submitted to the ratione materiae competent US authority to investigate <b>alleged</b> <b>dumping</b> or subsidization. The appeal was directed against the Panel's finding that the Byrd legislation was inconsistent with the US obligations under the WTO Antidumping Agreement (AD), and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM). A total of 11 complainants (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the European Community, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Thailand), and five additional third parties (Argentina, Costa Rica, Hong Kong (China), Israel, and Norway), evidence the interest among WTO Members in the issues at stake in the disput...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{critically}} analyses {{the use of}} anti-dumping {{regulation in}} the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) with specific reference to Botswana. Dumping takes place where products are introduced into the commerce of another country at less than its normal value, if the export price of the product exported {{from one country to}} another is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting country. Anti-dumping duties are an internationally-recognised exception to three core WTO principles namely, bound tariff commitments, most-favoured-nation MFN) and national treatment. The use of anti-dumping in SACU has always been in accordance with existing WTO rules. The new SACU Agreement has important implications for the anti-dumping regime within the customs union. It changed the way in which tariff decisions, including anti-dumping tariffs, are made and it also requires member states to develop legislation on contingency trade remedies such as anti-dumping for the region and to establish national bodies to administer these remedies within different countries. The SACU council has given mandate to the International Trade Administration Commission of South Africa (ITAC) to undertake all trade remedies investigations and imposition of the necessary duties. From the inception of ITAC till now ninety-five percent (95 %) of all anti-dumping applications filed at ITAC <b>alleging</b> <b>dumping</b> are instituted by South Africa industries. Thus, only five percent (5 %) of all anti-dumping applications are from Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (BLNS countries). The findings in this paper reveal that Botswana has never filed an application seeking protection of any of its industries. In terms of Article 14 of the SACU Agreement Botswana {{is in the process of}} establishing its national body like ITAC. The argument is that, since Botswana has never filed for any trade remedy how effective will this national body going to be? Therefore, critically analyzing the use of anti-dumping regulation is very crucial for Botswana as a SACU member. Such analysis will help assess the effectiveness of SACU institutions such as the tariff board and the Botswana national body to be established. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

50|$|The {{causes of}} the sudden decline are disputed. Among the many causes <b>alleged</b> have been: <b>dumping</b> of foreign imports below cost, high labor costs, poor management, {{unfavorable}} tax policies, and costs of environmental controls. One {{recent study found that}} hypotheses based on declining domestic production (such as foreign imports displacing domestic product) cannot explain the magnitude of the decline in employment, as shipments of domestic steel products in 2005 were similar {{to the level of the}} early 1960s, whereas employment in the domestic sector had plummeted by approximately 75% over the same time period. Instead, the majority of the losses could be accounted for by rising productivity, principally through technological efficiencies and the shift from traditional steel plants to mini mills.|$|R
40|$|Canada has {{the oldest}} {{antidumping}} (AD) {{regime in the}} world and has to this day been counted among the main users of AD measures. It is an important trade-remedy instrument that affects a relatively large proportion of Canadian imports, although its use and effects on trade could still be better understood. For example, in 2003 there were 92 measures in place affecting around C$ 1. 3 billion worth of Canadian imports. An important question is whether imposing AD duties actually protects the domestic industry from import competition. We analyze the trade effects of AD policy in the manufacturing industry in Canada. We also look at the effect of an AD action on the level of imports from countries not named in the analysis in order to examine the extent of trade diversion. It is possible that imports might be partly diverted away from the alleged source country and to non-alleged countries, rendering AD laws ineffective in terms of benefiting the domestic industry. We construct a database using AD data for the years 1990 - 2000, and import data disaggregated at the ten-digit Harmonized System (HS) level, and ultimately find that Canadian AD policy is an efficient tool for restricting imports from countries that are "named" in an investigation or <b>alleged</b> to be <b>dumping.</b> When adopting a relatively coarse classification of named cases into two groups - affirmative (affirmative AD decisions and price undertakings) and negative (negative AD decisions) - we also find some evidence of trade diversion and "harassment" effects of AD. ...|$|R
