In this paper, <b>a</b> formal <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> is proposed for defining metrics and other relevant concepts for a component-based system, in which, instead of component, assembly—a slightly modified and more general concept—is taken as a basic building block for design and development of software.

While also subject to change and new understanding, the basic premise of progressive revelation endures in Reform thought.|$|E

SDT addressed the changes in the patterns of sexual and reproductive behavior which occurred in North America and Western Europe in the period from about 1963, when the birth control pill and other cheap effective contraceptive methods such as the IUD were adopted by the general population, to the present. Combined with the sexual revolution and the increased role of women in society and the workforce the resulting changes have profoundly affected the demographics of industrialized countries resulting in a sub-replacement fertility level.|$|E
25|$|Culture in the Polish People's Republic, {{to varying}} degrees linked to the intelligentsia's {{opposition}} to the authoritarian system, developed to a sophisticated level under Gomułka and his successors. The creative process was often compromised by state censorship, but significant works were created in fields such as literature, theater, cinema and music, among others. Journalism of veiled understanding and varieties of native and western popular culture were well represented.

25|$|One of Castoriadis' many {{important}} contributions to social theory {{was the idea}} that social change involves radical discontinuities that cannot be understood in terms of any determinate causes or presented as a sequence of events. Change emerges through the social imaginary without strict determinations, but in order to be socially recognized it must be instituted as revolution. Any knowledge of society and social change can exist only by referring to (or by positing) social imaginary significations. Thus, Castoriadis developed <b>a</b> <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> where the sociological and philosophical category of the social imaginary has a central place and he offered an interpretation of modernity centered on the principal categories of social institutions and social imaginary significations; in his analysis, these categories are the product of the human faculties of the radical imagination and the social imaginary, the latter faculty being the collective dimension of the former. (According to Castoriadis, the sociological and philosophical category of the radical imaginary can be manifested only through the individual radical imagination and the social imaginary.) However, the social imaginary cannot be reduced or attributed to subjective imagination, since the individual is informed through an internalisation of social significations.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} human {{well-being}} has become popular in academic discourses. In {{the first part}} of the article it is argued that in view of the theological importance of human salvation and human flourishing, practical theology could contribute to these academic discourses. It is further argued that there is a need for <b>a</b> broad <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> regarding well-being that transcends narrow disciplinary approaches, but also allows for "thick descriptions" of well-being. The aim of the article is to explore a multidimensional model of human action as <b>a</b> possible <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> for interdisciplinary discourses on human well-being. Browning's multidimensional model of practical reason is briefly described. This is followed by an exploration of this multidimensional model with its visional, ethical, ecological, motivational, and practical dimensions as <b>a</b> broad <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> for interdisciplinary discourses on human well-being.
