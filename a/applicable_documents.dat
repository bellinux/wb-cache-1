40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} to refer to <b>applicable</b> <b>documents</b> in both programmatic and product-specification documents in contracted development. The practice permits inclusion of {{a vast amount of}} lessons-learned and best practices can be referenced without the need to include the information directly in the document, nor to maintain the referenced information. Product requirements documents often specify interfaces and interoperability characteristics by reference to interface control documents included in the list of <b>applicable</b> <b>documents.</b> Benefits accruing to the product from the use of <b>applicable</b> <b>documents</b> are reduced overall cost, better products and better interoperability.
