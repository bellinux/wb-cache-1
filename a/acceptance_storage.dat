40|$|Part 1 : Memory: Non-Volatile, Solid State Drives, Hybrid SystemsInternational audienceNAND {{flash memory}} has gained {{widespread}} <b>acceptance</b> in <b>storage</b> systems {{because of its}} superior write/read performance, shock-resistance and low-power consumption. I/O scheduling for Solid State Drives (SSDs) has received much attention in recent years {{for its ability to}} take advantage of the rich parallelism within SSDs. However, most state-of-the-art I/O scheduling algorithms are oblivious to the increasingly significant inter-block variation introduced by the advanced technology scaling. This paper proposes a variation-aware I/O scheduler by exploiting the speed variation among blocks to minimize the access conflict latency of I/O requests. The proposed VIOS schedules I/O requests into a hierarchical-batch structured queue to preferentially exploit channel-level parallelism, followed by chip-level parallelism. Moreover, conflict write requests are allocated to faster blocks to reduce access conflict of waiting requests. Experimental results shows that VIOS reduces write latency significantly compared to state-of-the-art I/O schedulers while attaining high read efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This {{revision}} of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan describes {{the objectives of the}} Civilian Radioactive Waste management Program (Program) as prescribed by legislative mandate, and the technical achievements, schedule, and costs planned to complete these objectives. The Plan provides Program participants and stakeholders with an updated description of Program activities and milestones for fiscal years (FY) 1998 to 2003. It describes the steps the Program will undertake to provide a viability assessment of the Yucca Mountain site in 1998; prepare the Secretary of Energy`s site recommendation to the President in 2001, if the site is found to be suitable for development as a repository; and submit a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002 for authorization to construct a repository. The Program`s ultimate challenge is to provide adequate assurance to society that an operating geologic repository at a specific site meets the required standards of safety. Chapter 1 describes the Program`s mission and vision, and summarizes the Program`s broad strategic objectives. Chapter 2 describes the Program`s approach to transform strategic objectives, strategies, and success measures to specific Program activities and milestones.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the use of the hurdle {{technology}} for preparing a sweet product (SPT) of tamarillo (Cyphomandra betacea) and assess its storage stability. SPT was prepared at the fruit natural pH (3. 72), lowering the water activity (aw) (0. 901) by adding sucrose and sodium benzoate (0. 1 %) as antimicrobial. SPT was stored under refrigeration (4 Â°C) conditions protected from light and it was analyzed every third day for 60 days. Physicochemical (color, aw, pH, and titratable acidity as citric acid), antioxidant (antioxidant capacity, total phenolics, and anthocyanins), and microbiological (aerobic mesophilic bacteria, molds, and yeasts), were determined. SPT was mixed with plain yogurt to evaluate the overall sensory <b>acceptance</b> during <b>storage.</b> The evaluation took place every seventh day during 49 days. The storage time had no effect neither on aw, pH or acidity of the SPT. It was observed an increase in the net change of color (0 to 4. 9) and a decrease in total phenolic compounds (1. 213 - 0. 816 mg gallic acid/g SPT), total monomeric anthocyanins (0. 910 - 0. 611 mg cyanidin- 3 -glucoside/g SPT g), and antioxidant capacity (5. 816 - 3. 576 Âµmole Trolox/g SPT).

40|$|Background: Hank's {{balanced}} {{salt solution}} (HBSS) and milk have gained wide <b>acceptance</b> as <b>storage</b> media for avulsed tooth. However, {{the effect of the}} media and storage time on the periodontal ligament (PDL) cells involvement in the development of root resorption is still unclear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate whether precultured PDL cells in HBSS, milk, or modified Eagle's medium alpha (Î±-MEM) would affect osteoclastogenesis. Materials and methods: PDL cells were precultured in HBSS, milk, or Î±-MEM for 1 h or 6 h before being co-cultured with RAW 264. 7 cells for an additional 3 days for mRNA analysis and 11 days for osteoclastogenesis assay. Results: Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) mRNA was detected immediately in PDL cells precultured in the three storage media. The expression was up-regulated markedly in all co-cultures when compared with RAW cells alone. As a result of the co-culture, interleukin- 1 Î² (IL- 1 Î²) expression was detectable in both PDL and RAW cells. TRAP+ multinucleated, osteoclast-like cells developed in all co-cultures; the number of TRAP+ cells was highest (P 0. 05). Conclusions: PDL cells kept in the three storage media led to TRAP+ multinucleated, osteoclast-like cells formation via RANKL-independent signaling. The ability to induce osteoclastogenesis may be considered as one of the factors to evaluate the ability of storage medium to maintain PDL viability after tooth avulsion.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} RF system in RHIC is to capture {{injected}} bunches, accelerate {{them to the}} top energy, and store bunches at the top energy for many hours. The accelerating RF system operates at harmonic number h= 360 of the particle revolution frequency f= 78. 196 kHz, which corresponds to 28. 15 MHz. The storage RF system accepts the shortened bunches at top energy and provides longitudinal focusing to keep these bunches short during the store time (collision mode). The storage system operates at harmonic number h= 7 x 360 = 2520, which corresponds to an RF frequency of 197. 05 MHz [1]. Recently, an upgrade of storage RF system with a superconducting 56 MHz cavity was proposed [2]. This upgrade will provide {{significant increase in the}} <b>acceptance</b> of <b>storage</b> RF bucket. Presently, the short bunch length for collisions is obtained via RF gymnastics with bunch rotation (called re-bucketing), because the length of 197 MHz bucket of 5 nsec is too short to accommodate long bunches otherwise. However, due to bucket non-linearity and hardware complications some increase in the longitudinal emittance occurs during re-bucketing. The 56 MHz cavity will produce sufficiently short bunches which would allow one to operate without re-bucketing procedure. This Note summarizes simulation of beam evolution due to Intra-beam scattering (IBS) for beam parameters expected with the 56 MHz SRF cavity upgrade. Expected luminosity improvement is shown both for Au ions at 100 GeV/nucleon and for protons at 250 GeV...|$|R

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} CO 2 {{would need to}} be {{injected}} underground to achieve a significant reduction of atmospheric emissions. The large areal extent expected for CO 2 plumes makes it likely that caprock imperfections will be encountered, such as fault zones or fractures, which may allow some CO 2 to escape from the primary storage reservoir. Leakage of CO 2 could also occur along wellbores. Concerns with escape of CO 2 from a primary geologic storage reservoir include (1) acidification of groundwater resources, (2) asphyxiation hazard when leaking CO 2 is discharged at the land surface, (3) increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO 2, and (4) damage from a high-energy, eruptive discharge (if such discharge is physically possible). In order to gain public <b>acceptance</b> for geologic <b>storage</b> as a viable technology for reducing atmospheric emissions of CO 2, it is necessary to address these issues and demonstrate that CO 2 can be injected and stored safely in geologic formations...|$|R

The global prevalence of diabetes is on the increase and may be addressed by controlling the total dietary carbohydrate and calorie intake. This study investigated the effects of low-methoxyl (LM) pectin on physiochemical and sensory properties of a reduced-calorie sorrel (Hibiscus sabdariffa) jam with sucralose. Sorrel calyces were treated with 0. 5 % pec-tolase to form puree. The puree was processed to jam at 90 ÂºC for 30 minutes, then at 100 ÂºC for 2 minutes upon the addi-tion of 8 % sucralose and three levels (1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5 %) of calcium added LM pectin for gelation. The addition of xanthan gum was at 2 % w/w. The effects of higher LM pectin increased (P< 0. 01) the moisture content and texture but reduced wa-ter activity and total titratable acidity. The additional varying levels of LM pectin resulted (P< 0. 05) in lighter, more chro-matic and less bluish-red colored jam. The texture became firmer (P< 0. 01) with higher levels of LM pectin. A sorrel jam with 1. 5 % LM pectin had total soluble solids of 16 ÂºBrix, 0. 96 % citric acid and pH 3. 3. This treatment was liked slightly to moderately in texture and overall <b>acceptance.</b> On <b>storage</b> the jam became less (P< 0. 01) bright and bluish-red on storage at 4 Âº C for 28 days.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of the color and phenolic compounds of strawberry jam on <b>acceptance</b> during <b>storage.</b> Jams were processed, stored for 120 days and evaluated monthly for chromatic characteristics, total phenolic compounds, total anthocyanins (ANT), total ellagic acid (TEA), flavonoids and free ellagic acid (FEA), and sensory acceptance as well. Data were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the means were compared by the Least Significant Difference (LSD). Cluster Analysis and Partial Least Square Regression (PLS) were performed to investigate the relationships between instrumental data and acceptance. Contents of ANT, TEA and redness decreased during storage. Other chemical characteristics and sensory acceptance showed a nonlinear behavior. Higher acceptance was observed after 60 days, suggesting a trend of quality improvement followed by decline to the initial levels. The same trend was observed for lightness, non-pigment flavonoids and FEA. According to PLS map, for consumers in cluster 2, acceptance was associated to jams at 60 days and to luminosity, FEA, and non-pigment flavonoids. For cluster 1, a positive association between flavor liking, jam at initial storage, and the contents of TEA and ANT was indicated. Jams at 120 days were positively associated to hue and negatively associated to color liking, for cluster 1. Color and texture were positively correlated to overall liking for cluster 2, whereas for cluster 1, overall acceptance seemed to be more associated to flavor liking. Changes in color and phenolic compounds slightly influenced the acceptance of strawberry jams, but in different ways for consumers clusters...|$|R
40|$|Policy-based storage {{management}} has been advertised as the silver bullet {{to overcome the}} complexity that limits the amount of storage that can be managed by system administrators. Key to this approach are: a mechanism to specify quality of service (QoS) goals; a canonical virtual model of storage devices and operations; and the mapping of the high level QoS goals to low level storage device actions. In spite of prior research and industrial standards the latter problem results in complex, manual, errorprone processes that burden system administrators and prevent the widespread <b>acceptance</b> of policy-based <b>storage</b> management. This paper proposes the Polus framework which specifically addresses this open problem. Polus removes the need for system administrators to write code that maps the QoS goals to low level system actions.

40|$|AbstractPoland {{has made}} {{concrete}} promises to the EU {{to reduce its}} CO 2 emissions within the next years by a considerable amount. CCS technology could provide a way to reduce CO 2 emissions significantly without slowing the country's economic growth. Social <b>acceptance</b> at potential <b>storage</b> sites for CO 2 {{has proven to be}} decisive for the development of CCS projects in other European countries. Therefore, it is important to gain insight into the perceptions that local stakeholders have with regard to the implementation of CCS in Poland. This paper presents results from risk communication activities which were conducted during the EU FP 7 SiteChar project at a prospective CO 2 storage site in Poland. These activities included a social site characterization as well as public engagement activities. The aim was to analyze the local public perception of CCS among citizens and stakeholders as well as to inform community representatives and the local public about CCS technology and to involve them in the planning process for the prospective CCS project. The research showed that in local contexts, it is necessary to include local stakeholders directly in planning processes in order to build trust, that a generally positive public climate towards CCS is not sufficient for local acceptance of CCS projects, and that a thorough social site characterization can provide starting points for future communication activities...|$|R

A further commercial-scale CO 2 storage project has recently begun at In Salah, Algeria, and the Snohvit field, Barents Sea, is to begin injecting CO 2 underground in late 2007 or early 2008. A monitored CO 2 -EOR project is underway at Weyburn, Canada and research scale injection projects have been undertaken at Nagaoka (Japan), Frio (USA) and K 12 -B (offshore Netherlands). This demonstrates that CO 2 can be successfully injected into underground storage reservoirs on a large scale. Natural analogues (natural fields of CO 2 and other buoyant fluids) demonstrate that under favourable conditions gases can be retained in the subsurface for millions of years. Although there is still very significant uncertainty in the actual figures, it appears that globally there is enough underground storage capacity for CO 2 storage technology to make {{a significant impact on}} global emissions to the atmosphere. Some other major issues that must be addressed if this technology is to spread to power stations, and thus make a significant impact on global CO 2 emissions, are the cost of CO 2 capture, further demonstrations of safe and secure <b>storage</b> and public <b>acceptance</b> that long-term <b>storage</b> will be successful...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the physicochemical characteristics and sensory profile of mango nectar sweetened with different high intensity sweeteners throughout storage time. The mango nectar samples were sweetened with: acesulfame-K/sucralose/neotame blend (100 : 50 : 1), sucrose, stevia with 97 % rebaudioside, neotame, sucralose and a thaumatin/sucralose blend (1 : 1). The physicochemical analyses carried out included color (L*, a*, b*), pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids (Â°Brix) and ratio (Brix/titratable acidity). The sensory profile was studied using the Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA). All analyses were carried out at Day zero, 60 days and 120 days of storage. The sensory descriptive and physicochemical data were correlated with an acceptance test by Partial least square (PLS) regression and External preference map (PREFMAP). Changes in sensory profile during storage time were also evaluated using Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) and agreement between configurations was evaluated by Rv coefficient. Sucralose was shown to be the best substitute for sucrose when compared with the other high intensity sweeteners at both zero time and after 120 days of storage. The sample sweetened with sucralose showed <b>acceptance</b> (mean at <b>storage</b> time 6. 4) and sensory profile equal to control (sucrose). In addition, the sweeteners stevia with 97 % rebaudioside did not show off-flavor and the thaumatin/sucralose blend (1 : 1) also presented similar acceptance (6. 16 at Day zero) and sensory profile in relation to control...|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} development and current economic incentives associated with energy storage using redox flow batteries (RFBs) are summarised. The analysis {{is focused on}} the all-vanadium system, which is the most studied and widely commercialised RFB. The recent expiry of key patents relating to the electrochemistry of this battery has contributed to significant levels of commercialisation in, for example, Austria, China and Thailand, as well as pilot-scale developments in many countries. The potential benefits of increasing battery-based energy storage for electricity grid load levelling and MW-scale wind/solar photovoltaic-based power generation are now being realised at an increasing level. Commercial systems are being applied to distributed systems utilising kW-scale renewable energy flows. Factors limiting the uptake of all-vanadium (and other) redox flow batteries include a comparatively high overall internal costs of $ 217 ?kW? 1 ?h? 1 and the high cost of stored electricity of ? $ 0. 10 ?kW? 1 ?h? 1. There is also a low-level utility scale <b>acceptance</b> of energy <b>storage</b> solutions and a general lack of battery-specific policy-led incentives, even though the environmental impact of RFBs coupled to renewable energy sources is favourable, especially in comparison to natural gas- and diesel-fuelled spinning reserves. Together with the technological and policy aspects associated with flow batteries, recent attempts to model redox flow batteries are considered. The issues that have been addressed using modelling together with the current and future requirements of modelling are outlined...|$|R
40|$|In early March 1994, eight {{highly enriched}} uranium (HEU) samples were {{collected}} from materials stored at the Ulba Metallurgical Plant in Oskamen (Ust Kamenogorsk), Kazakhstan. While at the plant site, portions of four samples were dissolved and analyzed by mass spectrograph at the Ulba analytical laboratory by Ulba analysts. Three of these mass spectrograph solutions and the eight HEU samples were subsequently delivered to the Y- 12 Plant for complete chemical and isotopic analyses. Chemical forms of the eight samples were uranium metal chips, U 0 {sub 2 } powder, uranium/beryllium oxide powder, and uranium/beryllium alloy rods. All were declared by the Ulba plant to have a uranium assay of {approximately} 90 wt % {sup 235 }U. The uranium/beryllium powder and alloy samples were also declared to range from about 8 to 28 wt % uranium. The chemical and uranium isotopic analyses done at the Y- 12 Plant confirm the Ulba plant declarations. All samples {{appear to have been}} enriched using some reprocessed uranium, probably from recovery of uranium from plutonium production reactors. As a result, all samples contain some {sup 236 }U and {sup 232 }U and have small but measurable quantities of plutonium. This plutonium could be the result of either contamination carried over from the enrichment process or cross-contamination from weapons material. It is not the result of direct reactor exposure. Neither the {sup 232 }U nor the plutonium concentrations are sufficiently high to provide a significant industrial health hazard. Both are well within established or proposed <b>acceptance</b> criteria for <b>storage</b> at Y- 12. The trace metal analyses showed that, with the exception of beryllium, there are no trace metals in any of these HEU samples that pose a significant health hazard...|$|R
