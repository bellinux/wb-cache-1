5|$|Pigs are {{not one of}} {{the main}} forms of {{livestock}} on Welsh farms though there are some specialised units. They used to be kept in small numbers on farms and by rural and urban cottagers. In the twentieth century, many miners in the South Wales valleys still kept a pig in <b>a</b> <b>backyard</b> sty, to be killed for production of fresh and salt pork, bacon, faggots and black pudding. In 2011 there were 25,600 pigs in Wales, less than half the number that were present a decade earlier.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit of}} Ficus aurea is edible {{and was used}} for food by the {{indigenous}} people and early settlers in Florida; it is still eaten occasionally as <b>a</b> <b>backyard</b> source of native fruit.

5|$|Brooks' first {{venture into}} wrestling was {{a stint in}} <b>a</b> <b>backyard</b> wrestling {{federation}} called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the ring name CM Punk when he was put into a tag team named The Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card. Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely {{wanted to be a}} wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun. When the promotion started taking off, doing shows out of a warehouse in Mokena, Illinois, Punk found out that his brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing them to become estranged. They have not spoken since.|$|E

5|$|Johnston took up cricket from {{an early}} age, playing with his elder brother Allan {{throughout}} the year on <b>a</b> <b>backyard</b> pitch on the family's dairy farm, owned by his father. Beeac's local team, which competed in the Colac District Association, occasionally had difficulty in assembling a full side. As a result, Johnston made his debut aged only twelve alongside his brother after an invitation from his schoolteacher. On debut, when a draw became a foregone conclusion, Johnston was allowed to bowl the final over, taking a wicket maiden. The following season, the brothers led Beeac's attack, continuing to do so after moving to Colac High School, where Bill became captain of the cricket and football teams and a prefect. Johnston left school at sixteen, working in Colac, before following Allan to Melbourne in 1939. He joined Richmond Cricket Club in the Third XI and took 6/16. After five games {{he was promoted to}} the Second XI, and made his first grade debut in the last game of the 1939–40 season. The following season, when nineteen, he was selected for Victoria's Sheffield Shield match against Queensland, but the Pearl Harbor attacks forced the cancellation of competitive cricket and the match did not go ahead. Johnston joined the Royal Australian Air Force along with his brother, serving for four years as a radar technician in northern Australia. It was at training camp that he first met Keith Miller. Johnston was not posted overseas, unlike his brother, who {{died in a plane crash}} in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the younger version of Clarkson sitting at {{the back seat of}} a station wagon. Singing the first verse, she {{witnesses}} a depressing scene of her brother quarreling with her sister who are scolded by their mother. She slowly clasps both her hands before the video shifts to the present day where Clarkson is seen arriving on the red carpet with her publicist for the world premiere of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. After posing for the photographers, she enters the cinema and watches the film. The next scene switches back to the younger Clarkson who is sitting and looking around her neighborhood at her house's rooftop as a plane is seen flying across the sky. The video switches back to the older Clarkson who is now watching the aforementioned film in her laptop inside the plane as it goes through a mild turbulence. Clarkson is also seen reminiscing about her past job as a worker in a movie theater, singing with her co-workers. The next scene shows Clarkson singing with her band in <b>a</b> <b>backyard</b> party which is shown alternately with scenes from the film, as well as a montage of her family and co-workers waving away from her. In the final scene, the younger Clarkson is shown praying by her bedside.|$|E
