In 1496 Henry VII ordered that reference copies of the yard, pound and gallon should be made of brass and distributed to specified towns and cities throughout the kingdom. Many weights and measures that had crept into use were banned: in 1527 Henry VIII banned the Tower pound (5400 <b>grains</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> 5760 <b>grains</b> of <b>the</b> apothecaries and troy pounds) and the mercantile pound (6750 <b>grains</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> 7000 <b>grains</b> of <b>the</b> pound avoirdupois) and in 1592 Elizabeth I ordered {{the use of the}} [...] "statute mile" [...] (5280 feet <b>against</b> <b>the</b> 5000 feet of the London or Old English mile).|$|R

When the media then delved further into the issue, stories started to emerge of common practice with a multitude of MPs not disclosing their financial benefactors, a practice which was not punishable under Finnish law. The media investigations focused on a group of entrepreneurs called Kehittyvien Maakuntien Suomi (Finland of Developing Provinces) who financed the electoral campaigns of numerous high-profile government and opposition candidates. Further investigations revealed that many recipients of their financial support did not register or even mention the amounts they received from the group. Then Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was {{at the core of the}} accusations after the investigations showed he had also been among the beneficiaries of the groups' financing; this was despite one of the members of the group who had planned to build the biggest shopping mall in the country received Vanhanen's support for the plans <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> of public opinion, thus eliciting accusations that he could have been influenced by the individual. Blame was also put on the Centre Party's secretary Jarmo Korhonen. This was said to have helped the True Finns.|$|E

Diatomaceous earth becomes more effective against insects if it possesses high amorphous silica content with uniform size distribution. Nanoparticles are more reactive than their bulk counterpart because of their increased surface to volume ratio. The objective of our study is to evaluate the effect of silica nanoparticles <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stored <b>grain</b> pest Corcyra cephalonica. Silica nanoparticles were synthesized by modified Stober’s sol-gel method. They were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope, X-ray Diffraction and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. Characterization studies showed silica nanoparticles of size range 70 - 80 nm were synthesized which are spherical in shape and amorphous in nature. The entomotoxic effect of silica nanoparticles were evaluated <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stored <b>grain</b> pest Corcyra cephalonica. Amorphous silica nanoparticles were found to be highly effective against this insect pest causing 100 % mortality, indicating the effectiveness of silica nanoparticles to control insect pests...|$|R

25|$|The body hair of {{surgical}} patients may be removed before surgery. In the past {{this may have}} been achieved by shaving, but that is now considered counter-productive, so clippers or chemical depilatories may be used instead.

25|$|The {{experience}} in northern Ireland gave Barkas {{the idea that}} every theatre of war is naturally patterned.

He developed a simple illustration of this point, by dropping a collar stud on a carpet. When it fell on a plain area, it was easy to see; when in a patterned area, it had to be searched for.|$|E
25|$|The grain {{direction}} {{can be determined}} {{by looking at the}} edge or side of the work piece. Wood fibers can be seen running out to the surface that is being planed. When the fibers meet the work surface it looks like the point of an arrow that indicates the direction. With some very figured and difficult woods, the grain runs in many directions and therefore working <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> is inevitable. In this case, a very sharp and finely-set blade is required.|$|E

40|$|High-velocity {{collisions}} between small, dense, neutral clouds {{or between}} a dense cloud and a dense shell {{can provide the}} energy source required to excite H 2 O maser emission. The radiative precursor {{from the surface of}} the collisional shock front rapidly diffuses through the cloud, heating <b>the</b> dust <b>grains</b> but leaving <b>the</b> H 2 molecules cool. Transient maser emission occurs as the conditions for the Goldreich and Kwan (1974) 'hot-dust cold-gas' maser pump scheme are realized locally within the cloud. In time, the local maser action quenches due to the heating of the H 2 molecules by collisions <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>grains.</b> Although this model cannot explain the very long-lived steady maser features, it is quite successful in explaining a number of the observed properties of the high-velocity features in such sources as Orion, W 51, and W 49. In particular, it provides a natural explanation for the rapid time variations, the narrow line widths, juxtaposition of high- and low-velocity features, and the short lifetimes which are frequently observed for the so-called high-velocity maser 'bullets' thought to be accelerated by strong stellar winds...|$|R

25|$|The Soviet reforms greatly {{affected}} {{the life of}} the Doukhobors both in their old villages in Georgia and in the new settlement areas in the Russian South and Ukraine. The state anti-religious campaigns resulted in the suppression of Doukhobor religious tradition, and the loss of books and archival records. A number of religious leaders were arrested or exiled; for example, 18 people were exiled from Gorelovka alone in 1930.
