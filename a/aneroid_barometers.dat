50|$|In aircraft, an <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer</b> {{measures}} the atmospheric pressure from a static port outside the aircraft. Air pressure decreases {{with an increase}} of altitude—approximately 100 hectopascals per 800 meters or one inch of mercury per 1000 feet near sea level.|$|R
2500|$|An <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer</b> is an {{instrument}} for measuring pressure as a method that does not involve liquid. Invented in 1844 by French scientist Lucien Vidi, the <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer</b> uses a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid cell (capsule), which is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule (or usually several capsules, stacked to add up their movements) is prevented from collapsing by a strong spring. Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. [...] This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed {{on the face of}} the <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometer.</b> [...] Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the current measurement so a change can be seen. [...] In addition, the mechanism is made deliberately [...] "stiff" [...] so that tapping the barometer reveals whether the pressure is rising or falling as the pointer moves. This type of barometer is common in homes and in recreational boats, as well as small aircraft. It is also used in meteorology, mostly in barographs and as a pressure instrument in radiosondes.|$|R

Careful laboratory tests showed {{it to be an}} exceptionally responsive and reliable instrument and that the correct reading at the position of the needle indicated by Mr. Olson {{at the center of the}} storm was 26.35 inches. This is the worlds lowest record of pressure at a land station.|$|E

5000|$|In gauges {{intended}} to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may {{be driven by}} an enclosed and sealed bellows chamber, called an aneroid, which means [...] "without liquid". (Early barometers used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal mercury suspended by a vacuum.) This bellows configuration is used in <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometers</b> (barometers with an indicating needle and dial card), altimeters, altitude recording barographs, and the altitude telemetry instruments used in weather balloon radiosondes. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as air speed indicators and rate of climb indicators (variometers) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external enclosing chamber.|$|E
50|$|Bourdon tubes measure gauge pressure, {{relative}} to ambient atmospheric pressure, {{as opposed to}} absolute pressure; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometers</b> use Bourdon tubes closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below). When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a reciprocating pump, an orifice restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the pointer and indicator card can be filled with an oil or glycerin. Tapping {{on the face of}} the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the gauge. The Bourdon tube is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of ±2% of span, and a special high-precision gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.|$|E
50|$|Strained {{political}} {{tensions between}} Russia and Britain prevented Gill from following his original planned route. Instead, he and Mesny agreed to travel via eastern Tibet to northern Burma (Myanmar). They {{set out on}} 10 July 1877 with their servants and 60 porters. They entered eastern Tibet via Tachienlu (Kangding). From there, Gill, Mesny and their party climbed to the Tibetan plateau, which is mostly more than 2 miles above sea level. Passing through Litang, they reached Batang in the valley of {{a tributary of the}} Jinsha River, then regarded by Europeans as the true upper Yangtze. Jinsha means “golden sand” and Gill named his book on the expedition The River of Golden Sand. Crossing the Jinsha, the party followed its valley or the ridge between it and the upper Mekong valley for 24 days to Dali City (Talifu), the western capital of Yunnan. Up to that point, Gill had surveyed the entire route and measured the altitude with <b>aneroid</b> <b>barometers</b> and a hypsometer. They were now in known territory, as Edward Colborne Baber had already surveyed the route from Dali to the Irrawaddy while investigating the murder of Gill’s schoolmate Augustus Margary. Gill and Mesny arrived at Bhamo in Burma on 1 November 1877, where they met Thomas Cooper, whose advice Gill had sought in London. Cooper was now the local British political agent; he was murdered five months later. From Bhamo, the party took a steamer down the Irrawaddy River to Rangoon and then travelled by sea to Calcutta, where they disbanded. William Gill’s scientific work, including the Chinese expeditions and the resulting 42 sheets of maps, was recognised on 26 May 1879, when the Royal Geographical Society awarded him their Patron's Gold Medal. The following year, the Geographical Society of Paris awarded Gill a gold medal.|$|E

Information is converted from some other physical form (such as sound, light, temperature, pressure, position) to an electrical signal by a transducer which converts one type of energy into another (e.g. a microphone).|$|R
