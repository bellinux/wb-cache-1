Martin left the act in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson carried on as a trio.|$|E

I regard this tax to be the most iniquitous of <b>all</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> poor man's standpoint. As the sovereignty and self-rule movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with this evil.|$|E
5|$|In the 1989 {{specifications}} {{issued to}} the Ecuadorian Military, the {{coat of arms}} has only eight colors that are used on the flag. The eight colors are yellow, blue, red (<b>all</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> national flag), sky blue, green, grey, silver and gold.

Robert Bishop was warden from 1926 to 1937, and was {{followed}} by his grandson, Billy, from 1937 to 1978. Billy's son, Bernard, who was appointed in 1978, is still managing the reserve.|$|E
5|$|The TSO {{board had}} not renewed the musicians' {{contracts}} {{hoping that it}} would receive more concert invitations from the United States.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{works of}} Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'yōshū poetry anthology, <b>all</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, {{the system of}} phonograms known as kana (Hiragana and Katakana) was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative. An account of Heian court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu {{is often described as}} the world's first novel.|$|E

5|$|The {{front side}} of the left wing shows the Agony in the Garden and the Flagellation of Christ. The front {{side of the}} central wing {{represents}} the Crucifixion of Jesus with Saint Catherine and Saint Ursula. These two female figures may have been painted last {{as they are in}} a more distinctly Proto-Renaissance style than the rest. The front side of the right wing represents the Crowning with thorns and the Bearing of the Cross, <b>all</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Passion of Jesus.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{original}} East Lancashire Division, the 2nd East Lancashire was organised in three infantry brigades of four battalions each. These were later numbered as the 197th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade, composed of the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/8th Lancashire Fusiliers; the 198th (East Lancashire) Brigade, composed of the 2/4th and 2/5th East Lancashire Regiment and the 2/9th and 2/10th Manchester Regiment; and the 199th (Manchester) Brigade, composed of the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/8th Manchester Regiment. The 197th Brigade drew its men from Bury and Salford, Greater Manchester; the 198th Brigade from Blackburn, Burnley Ashton-under-Lyne and Oldham and the 199th Brigade from Wigan, Manchester and Ardwick. The division also raised second-line Territorial artillery, Royal Army Medical Corps and Royal Engineer units, <b>all</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lancashire–Manchester recruiting area and had an attached squadron of the Bedfordshire Yeomanry.|$|E
5|$|Doping {{has played}} a {{significant}} part in the modern history of track and field. State-sponsored doping in East Germany with hormones and anabolic steroids marked the rise of women from the German Democratic Republic {{in track and field}} from the late 1960s to the 1980s. A number of these women, such as Marita Koch, broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions. Some athletes, who were following a doping plan from their teenage years, suffered significant health problems {{as a result of the}} regime. Ben Johnson ran a new world record in the 100metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later banned for using anabolic steroids. In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the BALCO Scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, among others, through their usage of banned substances. Doping problems have also been associated with sprinters such as Tyson Gay, Michael Rogers, and Justin Gatlin, <b>all</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States. Doping has also affected entire nations, such as Russia, which has been banned from competing at both the Indoor World Championships and the Olympics in 2016. This ban was imposed in 2016 after major allegations of doping and covering up were discovered in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the status}} of its builder, Doune {{reflected}} current ideas of what a royal castle building should be. It was planned as a courtyard with ranges of buildings on each side, although only the northern and north-western buildings were completed. These comprise a large tower house over the entrance, containing the rooms of the Lord and his family, and a separate tower containing the kitchen and guest rooms. The two are linked by the great hall. The stonework is almost <b>all</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> late 14th century, with only minor repairs carried out in the 1580s. The restoration of the 1880s replaced the timber roofs and internal floors, as well as interior fittings.|$|E
5|$|Menkauhor is attested {{by three}} hieroglyphic sources, <b>all</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> much later New Kingdom period. His name is given on the 31st entry of the Abydos King List, which was {{inscribed on the}} walls of a temple during the reign of Seti I (1290–1279 BC). He is also {{mentioned}} on the Saqqara Tablet (30th entry) and on the Turin canon (third column, 23rd row), both of which were written during the reign of Ramesses II (1279–1213 BC). The Turin canon credits Menkauhor with a reign of eight years. These sources indicate that Menkauhor succeeded Nyuserre Ini and preceded Djedkare Isesi on the throne, making him the seventh pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2016, Jones re-signed {{with the}} Cavaliers. On January 19, 2017, {{he started in}} place of an injured Kevin Love and scored 14 points in a 118–103 win over the Phoenix Suns. It was his first start since April 2, 2015. The Cavaliers won the Eastern Conference {{championship}} {{for the third year}} in a row, as Jones and teammate LeBron James joined Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, K. C. Jones, Sam Jones, Tom Heinsohn, and Frank Ramsey (<b>all</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Boston Celtics) as the only players in NBA history to reach seven consecutive NBA Finals. Facing the Golden State Warriors in the Finals for the third straight year, the Cavaliers lost the series in five games. Jones played in 48 games, starting 2, for the Cavaliers during the 2016–17 season while averaging 2.8 points, 0.8 rebounds and 7.9 minutes a game.|$|E

5|$|Several Phillies hold National League {{and major}} league records. Pitcher/outfielder John Coleman {{is the most}} {{decorated}} in this category, holding three major league records, <b>all</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> franchise's inaugural season. Coleman set records for losses, earned runs allowed, and hits allowed, all in 1883 when he also set three additional franchise pitching records. Shortstop Jimmy Rollins broke Willie Wilson's record for at-bats in a single season with 716 in 2007, and first baseman Ryan Howard also set the major league record for strikeouts in a single season that same year with 199, before it was broken by Mark Reynolds of the Arizona Diamondbacks the following year. The 1930 Phillies, who went 52–102, set two more National League records, allowing 1,993 hits and 1,193 runs in the regular season.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at <b>all</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E
