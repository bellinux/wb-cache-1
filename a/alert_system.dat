40|$|While todayâ€™s {{aircraft}} have integrated <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> for conditions {{inside the}} aircraft (ECAM, EICAS), {{there is no}} comparable fully integrated <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> for conditions outside of the aircraft. Current and near-future, separate <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> warn of conditions such as time-critical terrain, traffic, wind shear, clear air turbulence, wake vortices, each using different alerting and display philosophies to present information to the flight crew.

40|$|Cockpit <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> monitor {{potentially}} hazardous situations, {{both inside}} and outside the aircraft. When a hazard is projected to occur, the <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> displays <b>alerts</b> and/or command decisions to the pilot. However, pilots have been observed to not conform to <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> commands by delaying their response or by not following the automatic commands exactly. This non-conformance to the automatic <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> can reduce its benefit. Therefore, a need exists to understand the causes and effects of pilot non-conformance in order to develop automatic <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> whose commands the pilots are more likely to follow. These considerations were examined through flight simulator evaluations of the collision avoidance task during closely spaced parallel approaches. This task provided a useful case-study because the effects of non-conformance can be significant, given the time-critical nature of the task. A preliminary evaluation of <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> identified non-conformance in over 40 % of the cases and a corresponding drop in collision avoidance performance. A follow-on experiment found subjects' alerting and maneuver selection criteria were consistent with different strategies than those used by automatic systems, indicating the pilot may potentially disagree with the <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> if the pilot attempts to verify automatic alerts and commanded avoidance maneuvers. A final experiment found supporting automatic alerts with the explicit display of its underlying criteria resulted in more consistent subject reactions. In light of these experimental results, a general discussion of pilot non-conformance is provided. Contributing factors in pilot non-conformance include a lack of confidence in the automatic system and mismatches between the <b>alerting</b> <b>system's</b> commands and the pilots' own decisions based on the information available to them. The effects of non-conformance on system performance are discussed. Possible methods of reconciling mismatches are given, and design considerations for <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> which alleviate the problem of non-conformance are provided...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of an}} <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> is to {{make the}} system {{operator}} (e. g., pilot) aware of an impending hazard or unsafe state so the hazard can be avoided or managed successfully. A review of 46 commercial aviation accidents (between 1998 and 2014) revealed that, {{in the vast majority of}} events, either the hazard was not alerted or relevant hazard alerting occurred but failed to aid the flight crew sufficiently. For this set of events, <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> failures were placed in one of five phases: Detection, Understanding, Action Selection, Prioritization, and Execution. This study also reviewed the evolution of <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> schemes in commercial aviation, which revealed naive assumptions about pilot reliability in monitoring flight path parameters; specifically, pilot monitoring was assumed to be more effective than it actually is. Examples are provided of the types of <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> failures that have occurred, and recommendations are provided for <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> improvements...|$|R

40|$|<b>Alerting</b> <b>systems</b> {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of many complex technical systems, including aircraft cockpits. A simulator study examined the potential benefits of presenting system failure information to pilots using several levels of <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> knowledge and assertiveness. The results indicate that the subjects used the <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> more as an attention-directing signal than as a diagnostic tool. The results also indicated that increasing usefulness of information to the subjects seemed to stop at a limited amount of information, and that additional information provided beyond that point may actually slow the decision making process. An over-reliance test suggests that when an <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> gives erroneous information that conflicts with other cockpit indications, serious mistakes can be made and pilots may have trouble correctly resolving the conflicts...|$|R

5|$|Several {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were posted {{in anticipation of}} the storm. Upon the development of Ingrid into a {{tropical cyclone}} at 2100UTC on September12, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Coatzacoalcos to Nautla, Veracruz. At 1500UTC on September13, the tropical storm warning was extended northward to Cabo Rojo, Veracruz, with a tropical storm watch northward to La Pesca, Tamaulipas. Later, a hurricane warning was issued between Cabo Rojo to La Pesca, with a tropical storm watch to Bahia Algodones, Tamaulipas. Pemex, the oil company operated by the Mexican government, evacuated workers from three platforms in the Gulf of Mexico due to the storm. In Tamaulipas, classes were canceled in 27municipalities, and all classes were temporarily canceled throughout Veracruz. The threat of the storm caused events for Mexican Independence Day to be canceled.

5|$|Particularly {{prominent}} in the ocean waters surrounding Hilton Head Island, the stingray serves as a fascination and painful natural encounter for many beach goers. Small stingrays inhabit the quieter, shallow region of ocean floor just beyond the break of the surf, typically buried beneath {{a thin layer of}} sand. Stingrays are a type of demersal, cartilaginous fish common to the South Carolina coast as well as other areas on the Atlantic shoreline. Typically, stingrays avoid contact with humans unless they are accidentally stepped upon, a situation often ending in a stingray injury, where the stingray punctures the human with its poisonous barb. While these injuries are extremely painful, they are not usually life-threatening {{as long as they are}} properly attended to by a medical professional. One complaint shared by many Hilton Head Island tourists is that the lifeguards maintain a poor <b>alert</b> <b>system</b> for notifying swimmers when numerous stingrays have been sighted within a specific stretch of the shore. This lack of notification on days when multiple sightings are reported can sometimes end in a high number of stingray injuries that might have otherwise been avoided; in 2009, 121 people were treated for stingray injuries.|$|E

5|$|The Yawata raid {{revealed}} serious {{shortcomings in}} Japan's air defenses. While the 19th Air Brigade initially {{claimed to have}} shot down eight B-29s and damaged a further four, it was soon determined that {{only two of the}} bombers had been destroyed. This loss ratio was considered too low to defeat attacks on the home islands. The raid demonstrated that Japan had too few air bases and not enough aircraft were available for night operations. It was also found that the Toryu fighter was not well suited to intercepting B-29s as it was slower than the bombers, too lightly armed and most aircraft lacked radar. While the air raid <b>alert</b> <b>system</b> had proved successful in this instance, the radars which detected the American aircraft had been unable to determine their altitude and it was decided that there was a need to further expand radar coverage. The performance of the 131st Anti Aircraft Regiment during the raid was judged to be so poor that its commander was transferred to Manchuria. News reports of the Yawata raid and successful U.S. landing at Saipan on the same day also indicated to Japanese civilians that the war was not going well. In response to the raid Japanese Government ministers urged families living the country's four major cities to evacuate their children to rural areas.|$|E
