500|$|Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{commented that the}} compilation [...] "proves that no other teen pop singer of her era has a better track record than Christina and if the new songs <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> {{the title of this}} hits comp is no lie either." [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy noted the [...] "spunky attitude" [...] of the compilation and compared her recordings to those of Britney Spears: [...] "She may have started out with similar material to another Mickey Mouse Club alumnus, but Aguilera moved on to bigger and better things more quickly than Britney." [...] He further complimented Aguilera's songwriting skills.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Chris Willman from Entertainment Weekly {{responded to the}} new additions of the compilation saying, [...] "The singer has banished melisma and belting from these electronic confections, and her chops sound just as hot set on simmer." [...] Nick Butler from Sputnikmusic positively received the song and [...] "Dynamite" [...] saying [...] "Christina the pop singer is dead, long live Electro Christina". Nick Levine from Digital Spy called the song a [...] "welcome change" [...] from Aguilera's 2006 Back to Basics album, but stated that the song {{is not one of}} Aguilera's best singles. Fraser McAlpine from BBC wrote a mixed review for the song, recognizing Aguilera's maturity in the lyrics. However, he confessed that this could easily be a song by Pink, who might have made a better job of making it her own. Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the singer was instantly overshadowed by fellow singer Britney Spears, but [...] "Keeps Gettin' Better" [...] proves that no other teen pop singer of her era has a better track than Aguilera, concluding that if the new songs <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> the title of the hits compilation [...] is no lie either.|$|E
2500|$|Local media {{reported}} the popularity Chee had garnered during the election, stating that Chee's [...] "more moderate image" [...] and [...] "articulate speeches {{proved to be}} a big draw," [...] adding that [...] "If the buzz on social media and the queues of people that have formed after the Singapore Democratic Party’s (SDP) rallies to have their books signed <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> there is considerable interest in SDP chief Chee Soon Juan this General Election." [...] Observers attributed Chee's improved public image to a greater level of transparency and accessibility to information than in the past, as a result of technology like social media.|$|E
50|$|If {{the prologue}} <b>is</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication</b> of Alberto Contadors form, {{then he should}} be well-prepared for the 2010 Tour de France. The Spaniard won the 6.8 km time trial, beating the likes of Janez Brajkovic, Denis Menchov, and Edvald Boasson Hagen.|$|R

2500|$|The {{episode was}} met with high {{positive}} reviews. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 8/10 and remarked that [...] "Overall, it was a fun episode, hurt only by the uninteresting filler of Lisa dealing with blonde stereotypes. But even that delivered its share of memorable quotes. If the past few episodes <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> this season may {{go out on a}} very high note." [...] TVFanatic.com gave the episode 4/5 and stated [...] "The Homer's backyard sequences felt reminiscent of the prior prohibition episode, but were still plenty of funny moments. While the actual plot was nothing too unique, we liked the ending with Flanders realizing he was playing God and the whole camera-setup being set up as a reality show in England." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{historian}} George C. Browder, [...] "SD men represented no pathological or psychically susceptible group. Few were wild or extreme Nazi fanatics. In those respects {{they were}} 'ordinary men'. Yet {{in most other}} respects, they were an extraordinary mix of men, drawn together by a unique mix of missions." [...] Along {{with members of the}} Gestapo, SD personnel were [...] "regarded with a mixture of fear and foreboding," [...] and people wanted as little to do with them as possible. Belonging to the security apparatus of the Third Reich obviously had its advantages but it was also fraught with occupationally related social disadvantages as well, and if post-war descriptions of the SD by historians <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> membership therein implied being a part of a [...] "ubiquitous secret society" [...] which was [...] "sinister" [...] and a [...] "messenger of terror" [...] not just for the German population, but within the [...] "ranks of the Nazi Party itself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Cole {{shook his}} head doubtfully. [...] "Can't say for sure; but if sulks <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> should say the boy was down on his luck.

5000|$|On November 17, 2015, the Hallmark Channel {{released}} a trailer for A Christmas Melody.

60|$|All {{this appears}} to be very just. But if the resemblances between the body {{physiological}} and the body politic <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> not only of what the latter is, and how it has become what it is, but of what it ought to be, and what it is tending to become, I cannot but think that the real force of the analogy is totally opposed to the negative view of State function.|$|E
50|$|If the 2009 US {{stimulus}} package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 {{and proposed}} US budget <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> the 2008-9 crisis {{may see a}} return to the Keynesian state, at least for the United States.|$|E

50|$|The Versus {{is alone}} among the liturgical dramas of the Middle Ages in its choice of subject matter.

5000|$|... "Even by Dylan standards, {{this album}} {{has had a}} strange, {{difficult}} birth," [...] wrote Rolling Stone critic David Fricke. [...] "Its release was delayed {{for more than half}} a year, and the track listing was altered at least three times. If the musician credits <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> the songs that made the final cut come from half a dozen different recording sessions spread out over six years."
