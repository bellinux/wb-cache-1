25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood {{is the place to be}} yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> how to be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E

[...] Michael Aherne, who plays The Commitments' pianist Steven Clifford, was an employee for the Dublin Corporation and took a three-month leave of absence to make the film. Glen Hansard, the lead singer of The Frames, was cast as Outspan Foster, the band's guitarist.|$|E

[...] "I plan to continue school, [...] I’m looking into transferring somewhere in Boston,” {{she said in an interview}} with Inside Gymnastics magazine. “Brown is a great school and I loved it, but it was just not the best atmosphere for me; maybe a little too liberal. It was a great two years, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> a lot about myself and from the professors and coaches there. I’m looking at Boston University, Boston College and Harvard.

[...] She further elaborated, [...] "A lot of that [...] was based on my visual inspiration. I took Hype into my salon area in my home ... it's like my creative den. He took the ideas and then took other ideas and related to the ideas, and it just was really iconic imagery." [...] The video itself features a strong sexual theme with scenes of S and bondage, as well as scenes in a church and several prestigious-looking buildings. Aguilera wore several hairstyles and outfits, including many which were dominatrix-style.|$|E
500|$|In September 1941, Presley entered {{first grade}} at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his {{instructors}} regarded him as [...] "average". He {{was encouraged to}} enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of Red Foley's country song [...] "Old Shep" [...] during morning prayers. The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance. Ten-year-old Presley was dressed as a cowboy; he stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang [...] "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth. A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle. Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, [...] "I took the guitar, and I watched people, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> {{to play a little}} bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{its first}} run, Bringing Up Baby made $715,000 in the U.S. and $394,000 in foreign markets {{for a total}} of $1,109,000; its reissue in 1940 and 1941 made an {{additional}} $95,000 in the US and $55,000 in foreign markets. Following its second run, the film made a profit of $163,000. Due to its perceived failure, Hawks was released early from his two-film contract with RKO and Gunga Din was eventually directed by George Stevens. Hawks later said the film [...] "had a great fault <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I learned my lesson and don't intend ever again to make everybody crazy". The director went on to work with RKO on three films over the next decade. Long before Bringing Up Babys release, Hepburn had been branded [...] "box-office poison" [...] by Harry Brandt (president of the Independent Theatre Owners of America) and thus was allowed to buy out her RKO contract for $22,000. However, many critics marveled at her new skill at low comedy; Life magazine called her [...] "the surprise of the picture". Hepburn's former boyfriend Howard Hughes bought RKO in 1941, and sold it in 1959; when he sold the company, Hughes retained the copyright to six films (including Bringing Up Baby).|$|E

500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical {{content of the}} song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with {{the weight of the world}} that I held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as I look at the moon. Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] Jon Pareles for The New York Times wrote that Carey [...] "coos" [...] the lyrics [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon" [...] and [...] "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time." ...|$|E

When I was a kid, I used to watch him playing on TV and never dared to dream that I would be playing with Arvydas Sabonis. One day I woke up and Sabonis was my teammate. It was great.

In a 1995 interview, she explained her motivation for some explicit scenes in Embrace of the Vampire: [...] "I'm {{not going to say}} that I was manipulated into doing things that I didn't want to do. I did it because it was a woman director and I felt protected. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> a lot as far as knowing where the camera is and what coverage they need so that it's not all explicit." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the USA Today revelations, Tribune Media Services (TMS) {{terminated}} its syndication {{agreement with}} Williams.

[...] In response, Williams initially told E that he intended self-syndicate his column. E contacted 10 newspapers listed as clients on Williams's Web site to ask if they would continue to carry the column; the majority stated that they would not.

2500|$|Safina {{was born}} in Moscow, Russia to Tatar parents. Her mother, Rauza Islanova, was her trainer when she was younger; while her father is {{director}} of the Spartak tennis club in Moscow. Her brother Marat is a former world No. 1 on the ATP Tour. Speaking of growing up in such a successful tennis family, Safina stated: [...] "Being the little sister in such a big tennis family is not an easy situation. Maybe that's why it took me longer to develop. My father is very competitive, but my parents didn't put pressure on me. I wanted to find my identity. I wanted to be something by myself, like being a big player by myself. So at the beginning I was putting too much pressure on myself. But then gradually I found myself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> how to do better with that situation." [...] At age 8, Safina and her family moved to Valencia, Spain, and as a result Safina speaks fluent Spanish as well as Russian and English.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, while {{preparing}} a recital program for her master's degree, Blackwell auditioned for the Broadway revival of West Side Story. Impressed with her audition, Leonard Bernstein hand picked {{her for the}} role of Francisca (formerly named Consuela in the original 1957 production) and the understudy for Maria in the 1980 revival. As Francisca, Blackwell sang the song Somewhere from the orchestra pit during the final scene of the musical. For the next two-and-a-half years she toured with the show, gaining skills no operatic training could have provided. Blackwell said, [...] "I learned about characterization, how you went about becoming that person", she said. [...] "I learned stamina, how to do eight shows a week. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> to make the stage my home, where I felt 100 percent comfortable." [...] At the show's premiere, critics remarked how similar Blackwell sounded to opera singer Reri Grist who originated the role of Consuela. Coincidentally, Blackwell met and befriended Grist in 1985 when she coached Blackwell for her European debut as Oscar in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera with the Hamburg State Opera. She repeated that role the following year at the Lyric Opera of Chicago.|$|E
