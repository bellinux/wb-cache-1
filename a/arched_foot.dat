He got clear and saw three indistinct figures standing along in the fainter darkness under the <b>arched</b> <b>foot</b> of the mainsail, that rose above their heads like a convex wall of a high edifice. Donkin hissed:--"Go for them... it's dark!" [...] The crowd took a short run aft in a body--then there was a check. Donkin, agile and thin, flitted past with his right arm going like a windmill--and then stood still suddenly with his arm pointing rigidly above his head. The hurtling flight of some heavy object was heard; it passed between the heads of the two mates, bounded heavily along the deck, struck the after hatch with a ponderous and deadened blow. The bulky shape of Mr. Baker grew distinct. [...] "Come to your senses, men!" [...] he cried, advancing at the arrested crowd. [...] "Come back, Mr. Baker!" [...] called the master's quiet voice. He obeyed unwillingly. There was a minute of silence, then a deafening hubbub arose. Above it Archie was heard energetically:--"If ye do oot ageen I wull tell!" [...] There were shouts. [...] "Don't!" [...] "Drop it!"--"We ain't that kind!" [...] The black cluster of human forms reeled against the bulwark, back again towards the house. Ringbolts rang under stumbling feet.--"Drop it!" [...] "Let me!"--"No!"--"Curse you... hah!" [...] Then sounds as of some one's face being slapped; a piece of iron fell on the deck; a short scuffle, and some one's shadowy body scuttled rapidly across the main hatch before the shadow of a kick. A raging voice sobbed out a torrent of filthy language...--"Throwing things--good God!" [...] grunted Mr. Baker in dismay.--"That was meant for me," [...] said the master, quietly; [...] "I felt the wind of that thing; what was it--an iron belaying-pin?"--"By Jove!" [...] muttered Mr. Creighton. The confused voices of men talking amidships mingled with the wash of the sea, ascended between the silent and distended sails-seemed to flow away into the night, further than the horizon, higher than the sky. The stars burned steadily over the inclined mastheads. Trails of light lay on the water, broke before the advancing hull, and, after she had passed, trembled for a long time as if in awe of the murmuring sea.|$|E

40|$|This article {{approaches}} {{the methodology of}} designing customized footwear for high <b>arched</b> <b>foot.</b> The authors propose to reconsider the classical structure of footwear bottom components for people with high <b>arched</b> <b>foot</b> and recommend incorporating custom components, {{with the role of}} compensation or adjustment. This study continues the authors’ research, starting from a foot’s 3 D shape obtained by 3 D scanning, the anthropometrical and biomechanical parameters, shoe lasts’ 3 D modelling and continuing with 3 D footwear design. Including customized orthosis can help to stop the evolution of abnormalities, diminishes sensations of pain during walking and improves performance in various physical activities carried out during the day, walking, running, and standing. The prophylactic footwear has to meet four main requirements: to protect the foot and ankle during walking and static; to ensure the normal resistance systems (bones), muscle and joint of the foot; to prevent the installation of irreversible structural changes by reducing stress on the foot; to contribute to increased performance in conducting regular physical activity. It is presented the steps of modelling an orthosis, a virtual simulation of its cutting process, followed by the integration and development of the insole, filling and sole for a customized shoe.

40|$|Observed gait {{abnormalities}} {{are often}} {{related to a}} variety of foot deformities such as the cavus foot, also known as pes cavus, cavovarus, uncompensated varus, and the high <b>arched</b> <b>foot.</b> When gait abnormalities related to cavus foot deformities produce symptoms or contribute to dysfunctional movement of the lower extremity, foot orthotics are commonly used to accommodate the deformity and optimize the function of the lower extremity. In more severe cases, surgical intervention is common. Hypomobility of the many joints of the foot and ankle may be mistaken as an idiopathic cavus foot deformity. As for any other limb segment suspected of musculoskeletal dysfunction, it is suggested that joint mobility testing and mobilization, if indicated, be attempted on the foot and ankle joints before assuming the presence of a bony cavus deformity.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{correlation}} between the <b>foot</b> <b>arch</b> volume measured from static positions and the plantar pressure distribution during walking. Methods: A total of 27 children, two to six years of age, were included in this study. Measurements of static foot posture were obtained, including navicular height and <b>foot</b> <b>arch</b> volume in sitting and standing positions. Plantar pressure, force and contact areas under ten different regions of the foot were obtained during walking. Results: The <b>foot</b> <b>arch</b> index was correlated (r = 0. 32) with the pressure difference under the midfoot during the foot flat phase. The navicular heights and <b>foot</b> <b>arch</b> volumes in sitting and standing positions were correlated with the mean forces and pressures under the first (r= 20. 296, 20. 355) and second metatarsals (r= 20. 335, 20. 504) and midfoot (r= 2 0. 331, 20. 496) during the stance phase of walking. The contact areas under the foot were correlated with the <b>foot</b> <b>arch</b> parameters, except for the area under the midfoot. Conclusions: The <b>foot</b> <b>arch</b> index measured in a static position could be a functional index to predict the dynamic foot functions when walking. The <b>foot</b> <b>arch</b> is a factor which will influence the pressure distribution under the foot.
