50|$|For {{model year}} 1981, <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> front hubs were added for shift-on-the-move four-wheel drive models, and the NP208 {{transfer}} case replaced the NP205 in most models.|$|E
50|$|Because they do {{not operate}} as {{smoothly}} as standard differentials, <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> differentials are often responsible for increased tire wear. Some older <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> differentials are known for making a clicking or banging noise when locking and unlocking as the vehicle negotiates turns. This is annoying to many drivers. Also, <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> differentials will affect {{the ability of a}} vehicle to steer, particularly if a locker is located in the front axle. Aside from tire scuffing while turning any degree on high friction (low slip) surfaces, locked axles provoke understeer and, if used on the front axle, will increase steering forces required to turn the vehicle. Furthermore, automatically locking differentials can cause a loss of control on ice where an open differential would allow one wheel to spin and the other to hold, while not transferring power. An example of this would be a vehicle parked sideways on a slippery grade. When both wheels spin, the vehicle will break traction and slide down the grade.|$|E
5000|$|Four-wheel-drive {{improvements}} {{included the}} addition of <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> hubs for the F-150 in 1989. Models with the 5.0L V8 also had an option of a [...] "Touch Drive" [...] electronic transfer case.|$|E

50|$|Days {{after the}} riots on 28 June 1979, four black males were sought in {{connection}} with the robbery of the Great Lakes Naval Station branch of the Citizens Bank of Waukegan. Around $125,000 ($ today) was stolen. The bank manager was abducted from his home in Zion and was held captive along with several others until the <b>automatic</b> <b>lock</b> of the bank vault allowed it to be opened the next morning. No one was harmed in the robbery. Payday for the base was set for the following day.|$|R

'He {{lowered the}} glass lid, the <b>automatic</b> <b>lock</b> clicked sharply, and {{taking up the}} case in both hands he bore it religiously away to its place, passing out of the bright circle of the lamp into the ring of fainter light--into shapeless dusk at last. It had an odd effect--as if these few steps had carried him out of this {{concrete}} and perplexed world. His tall form, as though robbed of its substance, hovered noiselessly over invisible things with stooping and indefinite movements; his voice, heard in that remoteness where he could be glimpsed mysteriously busy with immaterial cares, was no longer incisive, seemed to roll voluminous and grave--mellowed by distance.|$|R
50|$|Selectable 4WD {{has both}} axles rigidly coupled together, which has some {{advantages}} in very poor off-road conditions. To gain the same advantage in a permanent AWD {{system with a}} differential, the differential can be locked manually with a differential lock. As this control is frequently misunderstood and mis-used, which can then cause damage due to wind-up, they {{have tended to be}} replaced by <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> through the viscous couplers.|$|E

40|$|Body powered {{prostheses}} {{have many}} advantages: They are reliable, lightweight and relatively cheap. The disadvantage {{is the need}} of a shoulder harness, which causes discomfort, pain and trouble donning and doffing the prosthesis. The goal of this thesis {{is to develop a}} body-powered prosthesis without the need for a shoulder harness. This is realized by making a design that uses passive wrist flexion of the prosthesis itself to operate the grasping mechanism. The force and displacement are converted to a grasping motion by using a hydraulic system. The grasping force is enhanced by a pressure intensifier and holding an object is achieved by including an <b>automatic</b> <b>lock.</b> BMDBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

5000|$|As noted above, only case 4 {{describes}} a cycle in the (regular) conflict graph which affects serializability. Cases 1-3 describe cycles of locking based global deadlocks (at least one lock blocking exists). All cycle types are equally {{resolved by the}} atomic commitment protocol. Case 1 is the common Distributed SS2PL, utilized since the 1980s. However, no research article, except the CO articles, is known to notice this <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> global deadlock resolution as of 2009. Such global deadlocks typically have been dealt with by dedicated mechanisms.|$|E
5000|$|In 1932, Ferdinand Porsche {{designed}} a Grand Prix racing {{car for the}} Auto Union company. The high power of the design caused one of the rear wheels to experience excessive wheel spin at any speed up to 100 mph. In 1935, Porsche commissioned the engineering firm ZF to design a limited-slip differential to improve performance. The ZF [...] "sliding pins and cams" [...] became available, and one example was the Type B-70 for early VWs, although technically this was an <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> differential, not a limited-slip.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{choosing}} the appropriate Hranularit ~ (size) of lockable objects is introduced and the tradeoff between concurrency and overhead is discusseS. A locking protocol which allows simultaneous locking at various granularities by different transactions is presented. It {{is based on}} the introduction of additional lock modes besides the conventional share mode an 5 exclusive mode. A proof is given of the equivalence of this protocol to a conventional one. Next the issue of consistency in a shared environment is analyze~. This discussion is motivated by the realization that some existing data base systems use <b>automatic</b> <b>lock</b> protocols which insure protection only from certain types of inconsistencies (for instance those arising from transaction backup), thereby automatically providing...|$|R

5000|$|Browder's {{device was}} similar to a modern {{recreational}} trampoline, which was developed later in 1936. Among its advantages were that the life net was always taut when open, never slackened, and had a setup time of only two to three seconds. It used hinges to fold for storage and an <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism when unfolded. Its opaque cover helped reduce panic and increase the confidence {{of people who had}} to jump into it. The device helped save many lives. [...] Some models had a red bullseye in the center.|$|E
50|$|The 4yg {{coaches were}} {{preferred}} for semi-fast services (Eilzugverkehr). Not until their later years were they cascaded to branch lines. The last coaches were retired {{in the early}} 1990s, because {{it was no longer}} worth while converting the doors to <b>automatic</b> <b>locking.</b> The last areas of operation for these coaches were the Lahn Valley Railway (Lahntalbahn), the Cologne area and the Eifel. The coaches experienced one final highlight during the Wende, the period after the Berlin Wall came down in 1989/90, when they were used in a large number of extra express trains.|$|E
50|$|A lunchbox locker, {{also known}} as a pocket locker, is a form of <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> {{differential}} that is installed by replacing some components of the differential carrier with the components provided by the lunchbox locker. The cost of the lunchbox locker is reduced because it reuses the existing carrier in the differential. It is easier to install because by reusing the carrier, {{there is no need to}} replace the shims and bearings, or to re-measure the preload on the ring and pinion. Often, the lunchbox locker can be installed without removing the carrier from the differential, depending on whether the carrier pin can slide past the ring gear.|$|E
