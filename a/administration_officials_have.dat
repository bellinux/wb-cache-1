Several people, including Senator Joe Lieberman and General Barry McCaffrey, have called the event a terrorist attack. The United States Department of Defense and federal law enforcement agencies had classified the shootings as an act of workplace violence. This was changed by the Fiscal Year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act which broadened the criteria for awarding the Purple Heart to include [...] "an attack by a foreign terrorist organization….if the attack was inspired or motivated by the foreign terrorist organization." [...] This allowed the Army to award the Purple Heart, and its civilian equivalent, The Defense of Freedom Medal, to victims of the attack.The U.S. government declined requests from survivors and family members of the slain to categorize the Fort Hood shooting as an act of terrorism, or motivated by militant Islamic religious convictions. In November 2011, a group of survivors and family members filed a lawsuit against the government for negligence in preventing the attack, and to force the government to classify the shootings as terrorism. The Pentagon argued that charging Hasan with terrorism was not possible within the military justice system and that such action could harm the military prosecutors' ability to sustain a guilty verdict against Hasan.|$|E

50|$|Among the {{disclosures}} in the book, {{which drew}} from numerous sources {{and more than}} 19,000 internal government documents, one was that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and the U.S. occupation of Iraq was planned from Bush's first U.S. National Security Council meeting in January 2001, soon after Bush took office.

5000|$|According to {{an article}} in The New Republic, Bolton was highly {{successful}} in pushing his agenda, but his bluntness has won him many enemies.

5000|$|Notably, the 2006 {{recipient}} of the Stewart Award was Robert Eatinger, chief of legal affairs for the CIA's Counterterrorism Center. In December 2007, the New York Times reported that Eatinger was consulted by Jose Rodriguez, then Director of the National Clandestine Service before he allegedly destroyed two 2002 CIA interrogation videotapes documenting the use of enhanced interrogation techniques on two detainees. According to the Times article, Eatinger and another CIA attorney, Steven Hermes, advised Rodriguez that he [...] "had the authority to destroy the tapes and that the destruction would violate no laws." [...] <b>Administration</b> <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> suggested that Eatinger and Hermes most likely offered their advice under the expectation that Rodriguez would subsequently pursue further approvals, as would normally be the practice.

50|$|Based on the Justice Department analyses, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld later {{approved}} in 2003 {{the use of}} 24 classified interrogation techniques for use on detainees at Guantanamo Bay, which after use on one prisoner were withdrawn. In court filings made public in January 2007, FBI agents reported that detainees at Guantanamo Bay were: chained in a fetal position to the floor for at least 18 hours, urinating and defecating on themselves; subjected to extremes of temperature; gagged with duct tape; held in stress positions while shackled; and subjected to loud music and flashing lights. Senior <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> repeatedly denied that torture is being conducted in the detention camps at Guantanamo Bay. However, the Bush administration explicitly endorsed the use of interrogation techniques such as waterboarding in memos to the CIA, and one Pentagon official has publicly admitted that torture was conducted at Guantanamo Bay.|$|E
5000|$|According to The American Lawyer's annual {{pro bono}} survey, Covington lawyers spent 3,022 hours on Guantánamo {{litigation}} in 2007, [...] "the firm's largest pro bono project that year".

Covington also co-authored one of three petitioners' briefs filed in Boumediene v. Bush, [...] "and was responsible for several detainee victories" [...] in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

40|$|Terrorists, policy-makers, and {{terrorism}} scholars have long {{assumed that the}} mere threat of terrorist strikes affects societies that have experienced actual acts of terrorism. For this reason, most definitions of terrorism include the threat of violent political acts against civilians. But so far research has neither validated this conventional wisdom nor demonstrated how actual and mass-mediated threat messages by terrorists and terror alerts and threat assessments by government officials affect the public in targeted states. This paper fills the gap providing evidence that who conveys such messages matters and that mass-mediated threat messages by al Qaeda leaders and announced alerts and threat assessments by U. S. <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> {{a significant impact on}} the American public’s threat perceptions in the post- 9 / 11 years...|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} of New Zealand had indicated its {{desire for a}} free trade agreement (FTA) between the United States and New Zealand. Such an agreement would presumably be pursued alongside, or together with, an FTA between the United States and Australia since New Zealand and Australia have had their own FTA for almost twenty years and their economies are now closely integrated. Fifty House members wrote to President Bush in January 2003 advocating the initiation of negotiations, as did 19 Senators in March 2003. However, <b>Administration</b> <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> enumerated several political and security impediments to a potential FTA, including New Zealand’s longstanding refusal to allow nuclear-powered ships into its harbors and its refusal to support the United States in the Iraq War.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{anonymous}} U.S. {{officials and}} specialists {{who follow the}} war have argued they believe that parts of the agreement may be circumvented and that other parts may be open to interpretation, including: the parts giving Iraqi legal jurisdiction over United States soldiers who commit crimes off base and off duty, the part requiring for US troops to obtain Iraqi permission for all military operations, and the part banning the United States from staging attacks on other countries from Iraq. For example, <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> argued that Iraqi prosecution of U.S. soldiers could take three years, by which time the U.S. will have withdrawn from Iraq {{under the terms of}} the agreement. In the interim, U.S. troops will remain under the jurisdiction of America's Uniform Code of Military Justice. Michael E.

2500|$|Even {{when the}} {{government}} has attempted to enforce its own laws, bribery has influenced the outcome.

On {{the same day as}} the re-opening, loggers that had previously been arrested were released.
