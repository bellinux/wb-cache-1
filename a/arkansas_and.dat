5|$|Hindman's edicts, however, {{raised the}} ire of the local citizenry, and his {{political}} enemies demanded that the Confederate leaders in Richmond replace him. By August 1862, the authorities in Richmond decided to replace him with the well-meaning but incompetent Theophilus H. Holmes. Hindman convinced Holmes {{to give him a}} field command in northern <b>Arkansas,</b> <b>and</b> he proceeded with a plan to drive out the invader. Hindman aggressively moved into northwest <b>Arkansas</b> <b>and</b> managed to intercept the Federal army while it was divided into two parts. At this moment, however, Hindman's normally aggressive style gave way to uncharacteristic doubt. Rather than attack the divided pieces of the Federal army, Hindman entrenched himself at Prairie Grove, Arkansas, allowing the Federal forces to recombine and assault him.|$|E

5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new <b>Arkansas</b> <b>and</b> Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in <b>Arkansas</b> <b>and</b> from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E

5|$|Fort Wright was {{the first}} Confederate Army {{fortification}} built at Randolph. On January 20, 1861, the Memphis Appeal published a pro-secessionist proposal to build a fort at Randolph to defend Memphis. In April 1861, Tennessee Governor Isham G. Harris ordered to establish a camp and complete the fortification at Randolph. About 5,000 troops from Tennessee, <b>Arkansas</b> <b>and</b> the Confederate Army were stationed at the location to accomplish the task.

5|$|It was a {{long time}} after the Brooks–Baxter War that people of Arkansas allowed another Republican to become governor.

On 1 December, Battleship Division 9 was detached from the Grand Fleet, after which Arkansas departed the Firth of Forth for the Isle of Portland. She then went to sea to meet the ocean liner , which was carrying President Wilson to Europe. <b>Arkansas</b> <b>and</b> the other American naval forces in Europe escorted the ship into Brest, France, on 13 December.
