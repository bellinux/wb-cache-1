5|$|An active {{predator}} of mobile, {{relatively large}} organisms, the Portuguese dogfish feeds mainly on cephalopods (including Mastigoteuthis spp.) and bony fishes (including slickheads, orange roughy, lantern fishes, and rattails).

5|$|During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a {{state of}} torpor and remain {{inactive}} for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (Bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> glucose.

40|$|AbstractAxon {{formation}} in multipolar neurons {{is believed to}} depend on the existence of precise sorting mechanisms for axonal membrane and membrane-associated proteins. Conclusive evidence in living neurons, however, is lacking. In the present study, we use light and video microscopy to address this issue directly.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to extracellular fluid, cytosol has <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> potassium ions {{and a low}} concentration of sodium ions. This difference in ion concentrations is critical for osmoregulation, since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by osmosis - since the levels of macromolecules inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions {{taken up by the}} Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative membrane potential. To balance this potential difference, negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{are able}} to dive {{for long periods of}} time. Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support deep diving. Other important reservoirs include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E

5|$|Frogs live on all {{the continents}} except Antarctica, {{but they are not}} present on certain islands, {{especially}} those far away from continental land masses. Many species are isolated in restricted ranges by changes of climate or inhospitable territory, such as stretches of sea, mountain ridges, deserts, forest clearance, road construction, or other man-made barriers. Usually, a greater diversity of frogs occurs in tropical areas than in temperate regions, such as Europe. Some frogs inhabit arid areas, such as deserts, and rely on specific adaptations to survive. Members of the Australian genus Cyclorana bury themselves underground where they create a water-impervious cocoon in which to aestivate during dry periods. Once it rains, they emerge, find a temporary pool, and breed. Egg and tadpole development is very fast in comparison to those of most other frogs, so breeding can be completed before the pond dries up. Some frog species are adapted to a cold environment. The wood frog (Rana sylvatica), whose habitat extends into the Arctic Circle, buries itself in the ground during winter. Although much of its body freezes during this time, it maintains <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> glucose in its vital organs, which protects them from damage.|$|E
