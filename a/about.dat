5|$|<b>About</b> 1 in 1000 adults {{per year}} has DVT, {{but as of}} 2011, {{available}} data are dominated by North American and European populations. VTE is rare in children, with an incidence of <b>about</b> 1 in 100,000 a year. From childhood to old age, incidence increases {{by a factor of}} <b>about</b> 1000, with almost 1% of the elderly experiencing VTE yearly. During pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs <b>about</b> once per 1000 deliveries. After surgery with preventative treatment, VTE develops in <b>about</b> 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and in <b>about</b> 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement. <b>About</b> 300,000–600,000 Americans develop VTE each year, with <b>about</b> 60,000–100,000 deaths attributable to PE. In England, an estimated 25,000 a year die from hospital-related VTE. For unclear reasons, people of Asian descent have a lower VTE risk than whites.|$|E
5|$|After Algeria became {{independent}} in 1962, <b>about</b> 800,000 Pieds-Noirs of French nationality were evacuated to mainland France while <b>about</b> 200,000 chose {{to remain in}} Algeria. Of the latter, there were still <b>about</b> 100,000 in 1965 and <b>about</b> 50,000 {{by the end of}} the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Before Donald Pattie's {{research}} {{during the}} late 1960s, when his team studied marsh shrews in captivity, little was known <b>about</b> their behavior. Before then, most information <b>about</b> the marsh shrew was from notes <b>about</b> the mammal's habitat and information <b>about</b> trapping it. Its descriptions in the literature were largely derived from the examination of museum specimens.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativism <b>about</b> a {{class of}} {{entities}} is the view that that class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist <b>about</b> the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist <b>about</b> phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist <b>about</b> the existence of luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism <b>about</b> propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism <b>about</b> qualia (subjective interpretations <b>about</b> particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, <b>about</b> 23 {{per cent}} of Yugoslav Jews (<b>about</b> 16,680 people) {{lived in the}} territories {{occupied}} by Hungary. These included around 15,405 in Bačka and Baranja, <b>about</b> 425 in Međimurje, and approximately 850 in Prekmurje.|$|E
5|$|In conclusion, {{the insistence}} of ahimsa {{is not so much}} <b>about</b> non-injury to others as it is <b>about</b> non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self. The {{ultimate}} rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally <b>about</b> karmic results of the hiṃsā on self rather than the concern <b>about</b> the well being of other beings for its own sake.|$|E
5|$|The {{median income}} for a {{household}} {{in the city}} during 2009–13 was <b>about</b> $25,000 compared to <b>about</b> $53,000 for {{the entire state of}} Pennsylvania. The per capita income for the city was <b>about</b> $19,000, and <b>about</b> 40percent of Lock Haven's residents lived below the poverty line.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} density in 2010 was 3,915people {{per square mile}} (1,506 per km2). The reported racial makeup {{of the city was}} <b>about</b> 93percent White and <b>about</b> 4percent African-American, with other categories totaling <b>about</b> 3percent. People of Hispanic or Latino origin accounted for <b>about</b> 2percent of the residents. Between 2009 and 2013, <b>about</b> 2percent of the city's residents were foreign-born, and <b>about</b> 5percent of the population over the age of 5 spoke a language other than English at home.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature in}} the non-dipolar part of the secular variation is a westward drift {{at a rate of}} <b>about</b> 0.2 degrees per year. This drift is not the same everywhere and has varied over time. The globally averaged drift has been westward since <b>about</b> 1400 AD but eastward between <b>about</b> 1000 AD and 1400 AD.|$|E

5|$|After {{the chicks}} hatch, the birds will desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after hatching. After <b>about</b> 10 days, the parents split the chicks up, with each parent taking care of <b>about</b> half of the brood. After this split, the chicks are {{independent}} in <b>about</b> 10 days, and fledge in <b>about</b> three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure <b>about</b> a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question <b>about</b> her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality <b>about</b> meetings with her king. It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation <b>about</b> the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions <b>about</b> the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E

5|$|Both McLuhan and Innis {{assume the}} {{centrality}} of communication technology; where they differ is in the principal kinds of effects they see deriving from this technology. Whereas Innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture, McLuhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought. McLuhan has much to say <b>about</b> perception and thought but little to say <b>about</b> institutions; Innis says much <b>about</b> institutions and little <b>about</b> perception and thought.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{apparent}} and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units: one whole number difference in magnitude {{is equal to}} a brightness variation of <b>about</b> 2.5 times (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is <b>about</b> 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and <b>about</b> 100 times brighter than a sixth magnitude star (+6.00). The faintest stars {{visible to the naked}} eye under good seeing conditions are <b>about</b> magnitude +6.|$|E
5|$|By <b>about</b> a {{week after}} the passage of the hurricane, President George W. Bush {{declared}} disaster areas for 36North Carolina counties, 77counties and independent cities in Virginia, the entire state of Maryland, all three counties in Delaware and six West Virginia counties. The disaster declaration allocated the use of federal funds for rebuilding and providing aid in the aftermath of hurricane Isabel. By <b>about</b> four months after the passage of the hurricane, disaster aid totaled <b>about</b> $516million (2003USD, $ USD), primarily in North Carolina and Virginia. Over 166,000 residents applied for individual assistance, with <b>about</b> $117million (2003USD, $ USD) approved for residents to assist with temporary housing and home repairs. <b>About</b> 50,000business owners applied for Small Business Administration loans, with <b>about</b> $178million (2003USD, $ USD) approved for the assistance loans. <b>About</b> 40,000people visited local disaster recovery centers, designed to provide additional information regarding the aftermath of the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Claudius {{annexed to}} the empire three regions that became {{important}} sources of auxiliary recruits: Britannia (43AD), {{and the former}} client kingdoms of Mauretania (44) and Thracia (46). The latter became as important as Illyria {{as a source of}} auxiliary recruits, especially cavalry and archers. Britain in mid-2nd century contained the largest number of auxiliary regiments in any single province: <b>about</b> 60 out of <b>about</b> 400 (15%). By the rule of Nero (54–68), auxiliary numbers may have reached, by one estimate, <b>about</b> 200,000 men, implying <b>about</b> 400 regiments.|$|E
5|$|Ferens' {{personal}} and religious convictions {{are evident in}} other of his parliamentary contributions. He tabled {{a number of questions}} concerning temperance, both at home and in the colonies. His first question in the Commons was <b>about</b> orphan schools. He later asked <b>about</b> railway accidents to children, and <b>about</b> trafficking of young girls in India.|$|E
5|$|Four super {{radiations}} {{of insects}} have occurred: beetles (evolved <b>about</b> 300 million years ago), flies (evolved <b>about</b> 250 million years ago), and moths and wasps (evolved <b>about</b> 150 million years ago). These four groups {{account for the}} majority of described species. The flies and moths along with the fleas evolved from the Mecoptera.|$|E
5|$|His {{frustration}} {{turned to}} depression, and in 1971 Drake was persuaded {{by his family}} to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed a course of antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed <b>about</b> taking them, and tried {{to hide the fact}} from his friends. He knew enough <b>about</b> drugs to worry <b>about</b> their side effects, and was concerned <b>about</b> how they would react with his regular cannabis use.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the city's {{population}} included <b>about</b> 16percent {{under the}} age of 18 and <b>about</b> 12percent who were 65 years of age or older. Females accounted for 54percent of the total. Students at the university comprised <b>about</b> a third of the city's population.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, the Channel 4 {{television}} {{comedy series}} Star Stories broadcast a satirical mockumentary of Mills's life story from her point of view. In 2009, after petitioning the Press Complaints Commission in the UK <b>about</b> being lied <b>about</b> in the press, five British tabloids (The Sun, The Daily Express, News of the World, Sunday Mirror and Daily Mirror) publicly apologised to Mills <b>about</b> printing false, hurtful or defamatory stories <b>about</b> her. Another tabloid (the Daily Mail), sent a private letter of apology. Mills has complained that over 4,400 abusive articles <b>about</b> her have been published.|$|E

5|$|In medieval England {{there was}} no clear {{separation}} between the king's household and the treasury. The main sources of royal income were the royal estates, feudal rights (such as feudal aids or feudal reliefs, which derived from the king's position as a feudal overlord), taxation, and fees and other profits from the judicial courts. In 1130, the records of revenues paid into the treasury show that <b>about</b> 40% came from royal estates, 16% from feudal rights, 14% from taxes, and 12% from the judicial courts. By 1194 revenue from the land came to <b>about</b> 37% of the total, <b>about</b> 25% came from feudal rights, taxation raised <b>about</b> 15%, and income from judicial sources <b>about</b> 11%.|$|E

5|$|It's <b>About</b> Games {{bought and}} sold used PC games, video games, and board games. Winmark spent roughly $6.8 million to acquire Video Game Exchange Inc. in 1997 and renamed it to It's <b>About</b> Games. It's <b>About</b> Games {{locations}} were largely in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Georgia and Maryland. It made money for Winmark until 1998. During its last year under Winmark management, It's <b>About</b> Games lost $3.4 million because of excessive inventory, a buggy computer system, poorly chosen products, and poorly trained employees. Winmark owned 60 of the 64 It's <b>About</b> Games stores in the franchise {{and would have been}} profitable without It's <b>About</b> Games. Winmark sold or closed all its It's <b>About</b> Games stores in 1999 to reduce losses. Winmark also aimed {{to cut down on the}} number of stores it owned because it wanted to focus on franchisee-owned stores.|$|E

5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} first {{interview}} were not very detailed, {{and many of the}} details provided did not match the evidence. Lyons gave incorrect information <b>about</b> the precise location of the killings and <b>about</b> the number of weapons used.

5|$|Most {{available}} berkelium toxicity data {{originate from}} research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only <b>about</b> 0.01% berkelium {{ends in the}} blood stream. From there, <b>about</b> 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for <b>about</b> 50years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life <b>about</b> 20years), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely. The balance of <b>about</b> 10% is excreted. In all these organs berkelium might promote cancer, and in the skeletal system its radiation can damage red blood cells. The maximum permissible amount of berkelium-249 in the human skeleton is 0.4nanograms.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{available}} einsteinium toxicity data originate from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only <b>about</b> 0.01% einsteinium ends in the blood stream. From there, <b>about</b> 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for <b>about</b> 50 years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life <b>about</b> 20 years, although this is rendered irrelevant by the short half-lives of einsteinium isotopes), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries – where einsteinium stays indefinitely. <b>About</b> 10% of the ingested amount is excreted.
