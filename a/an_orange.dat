5|$|The constellation's two {{brightest}} stars—Alpha and Epsilon Antliae—shine with {{a reddish}} tinge. Alpha is <b>an</b> <b>orange</b> giant of spectral type K4III {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. It is located 370 ± 20 light-years away from Earth. Estimated to be shining with around 480 to 555 times the luminosity of the Sun, it is most likely an ageing star that is brightening and {{on its way to}} becoming a Mira variable star, having converted all its core fuel into carbon. Located 710 ± 40 light-years from Earth, Epsilon Antliae is an evolved orange giant star of spectral type K3 IIIa, that has swollen to have a diameter about 69 times that of the Sun, and a luminosity of around 1279 Suns. It is slightly variable. At the other end of Antlia, Iota Antliae is likewise <b>an</b> <b>orange</b> giant of spectral type K1 III.|$|E

5|$|There are 37 stars {{brighter}} than apparent magnitude6.5 in the constellation; three are {{brighter than}} magnitude4.5. 46Leonis Minoris, <b>an</b> <b>orange</b> giant of magnitude3.8, is located some 95light-years from Earth. At magnitude4.4, Beta Leonis Minoris is the second-brightest star {{and the only}} one in the constellation with a Bayer designation. It is a binary star, the brighter component of which is <b>an</b> <b>orange</b> giant and the fainter a yellow-white main sequence star. The third-brightest star is 21Leonis Minoris, a rapidly rotating white main-sequence star of average magnitude4.5. The constellation also includes two stars with planetary systems, two pairs of interacting galaxies, and the unique deep-sky object Hanny's Voorwerp.|$|E

5|$|Antlia is a faint constellation; its {{brightest}} star is Alpha Antliae, <b>an</b> <b>orange</b> giant {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system, changing in brightness as one star passes {{in front of the}} other. Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, lie within Antlia, as do NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|At {{least four}} of the fifteen stars visible to the unaided eye are orange giants of {{spectral}} class K. The second brightest star in the constellation—at apparent magnitude 4.1—is Zeta Telescopii, <b>an</b> <b>orange</b> subgiant of spectral type K1III-IV. Around 1.53 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 512 times its luminosity. Located 127 light years away from Earth, it {{has been described as}} yellow or reddish in appearance. Epsilon Telescopii is a binary star system: the brighter component, Epsilon Telescopii A, is <b>an</b> <b>orange</b> giant of spectral type K0III with an apparent magnitude of +4.52, while the 13th magnitude companion, Epsilon Telescopii B, is 21 arcseconds away from the primary, and just visible with a 15cm aperture telescope on a dark night. The system is 417 light-years away. Iota Telescopii and HD 169405—magnitude 5 orange giants of spectral types K0III and K0.5III respectively—make up the quartet. They are around 370 and 497 light-years away from the Sun respectively. Another ageing star, Kappa Telescopii is a yellow giant with a spectral type G9III and apparent magnitude of 5.18. Around 1.87 billion years old, this star of around 1.6 solar masses has swollen to 11 times the Sun's diameter. It is approximately 293 light-years from Earth, and is another optical double.|$|E
