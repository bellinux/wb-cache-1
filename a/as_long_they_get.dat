But it's okay to discriminate across different types. So you could prioritize voice over video. And there is general agreement with Verizon and Google on that issue." [...] Echoing similar comments by Schmidt, Google's Chief Internet Evangelist and [...] "father of the Internet", Vint Cerf, says that [...] "it’s entirely possible that some applications needs far more latency, like games.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} {{an investigation into}} the stay or exit decision of vessel owners in Scottish fisheries subject to stock recovery measures. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 39 vessel owners during and following a vessel buy-back scheme. Empirical results show key factors affecting the decision to stay or exit, which include the owner's age, other sources of income, the existence of a successor to the business, impact on other involved family members, and expected future business performance, which in some cases was expected to be business failure. Owners did not use any formal financial methods or techniques for their decision-making. Advice sought from accountants was mostly on minimising tax liability. Owners expecting profitable operation considered how to use government grants to enable fresh investment in the fishery. For vessels with poor expected performance, owners' principle concern was 'will I clear my feet?' - would there be a positive net cash position on winding up the business? If <b>they</b> could not <b>get</b> clear of debt by winding up, skippers would continue in unprofitable or low profit boats, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could <b>get</b> a wage for their labour and repay the bank loan, because they saw no other option.

40|$|Abstract. Since {{the cost}} of {{communication}} (moving data) greatly exceeds {{the cost of}} doing arithmetic on current and future computing platforms, we are motivated to devise algorithms that communicate as little as possible, even if they do slightly more arithmetic, and <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> still <b>get</b> the right answer. This paper is about getting the right answer for such an algorithm. It discusses CALU, a communication avoiding LU factorization algorithm based on a new pivoting strategy, that we refer to as tournament pivoting. The reason to consider CALU is that it does an optimal amount of communication, and asymptotically less than Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP), and so will be much faster on platforms where communication is expensive, as shown in previous work. We show that the Schur complement obtained after each step of performing CALU on a matrix A {{is the same as the}} Schur complement obtained after performing GEPP on a larger matrix whose entries are the same as the entries of A (sometimes slightly perturbed) and zeros. More generally, the entire CALU process is equivalent to GEPP on a large, but very sparse matrix, formed by entries of A and zeros. Hence we expect that CALU will behave as GEPP and it will also be very stable in practice. In addition, extensive experiments on random matrices and a set of special matrices show that CALU is stable in practice. The upper bound on the growth factor of CALU is worse than that of GEPP. However, there are Wilkinson-like matrices for which GEPP has exponential growth factor, but not CALU, and vice-versa...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to give an {{increased}} knowledge of how students with dyslexia experience the counselling they received in regard to further studies and future work in connection to the transition from compulsory education to upper secondary school. As well as what is perceived as the most optimum process of counselling given from the needs of the student. Furthermore, there was an interest for a greater understanding of how student counselling work with dyslexic students and what knowledge the student counsellors have about this hidden disability. Qualitative interviews were done, both with students with dyslexia as well as student counsellors working for the years of compulsorily education. The interviews showed that students had not received what to them was an adequate and optimum guidance in regard to their needs. Much like the research found in connection to dyslexia the students note that their own self-esteem and self-worth in regard to the schoolwork lessens along the way. Something that is found to be reassuring is that the student counsellors interviewed say that there are no limitations for dyslexic students when it comes to choose of studies <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> proper support and adaptation after their needs.  Studiens syfte är att få en ökad kunskap om hur elever med dyslexi upplever den studie- och yrkesvägledning de fick i samband med övergången mellan grundskola och gymnasium.
