Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E
5|$|AT {{acquired}} TCI in 2000, inheriting its {{agreement with}} CSG. AT alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract's terms to provide favorable rates. A legal {{dispute between the}} two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund {{and that it had}} to reduce its prices. The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term. CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004 and in 2008. In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{work began}} on a {{complete}} redevelopment {{of the station}} building. It opened on 1 July 2001, and featured lifts and generally enhanced facilities. Local roads were enhanced to help speed passengers' journeys {{to and from the}} station, and a new multi-storey car park was built to replace the spaces lost to the Royal Mail facility. A dedicated bus interchange was opened in 2003. In 2006, construction started on a new platform face {{on the north side of}} platform 1, to ease congestion for trains toward Birmingham and London. The new platform, platform 4, was opened on 9 May 2007 by rail minister Tom Harris MP. As part of the reconstruction, the waiting room at the east end of platform 1 was demolished, and replaced with an extended waiting area <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> help desk. Platform 1 was subsequently redesignated platform 3. The work cost £3,000,000, and was funded by Network Rail, with First Great Western contributing £100,000 towards the new waiting room and help desk.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{different}} {{data collection}} mechanisms {{are used by}} different transport operators, depending {{on the nature of}} their business. The MTR equips its stations with local area networks that connect the components that deal with Octopus cards—turnstiles, Add Value Machines, value-checking machines <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> service terminals. Transactions from these stations are relayed to the MTR's Kowloon Bay headquarters through a frame relay wide area network, and hence onwards to the central clearing house system (CCHS) for clearing. Similar arrangements are in place for retailers such as 7-Eleven. Handheld devices are used to scan offline mobile readers, including those installed on minibuses. Buses either use handheld devices or a wireless system, depending on operator.|$|E
5|$|The Ontario provincial {{government}} has quarrelled with 407ETR over toll rates <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> service, but is largely tied {{down by the}} lease contract. On February 2, 2004, the government delivered notice to 407ETR that they {{are considered to be}} in default of their contract because of 407ETR's decision to raise toll rates without first obtaining provincial clearance. The court's initial decision sided with 407ETR: on July 10, 2004, an independent arbitrator affirmed that 407ETR has the ability to raise toll rates without first consulting the government. The government filed an appeal of this decision but was overruled by an Ontario Superior Court decision released on January 6, 2005; however, a subsequent ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 13, 2005 granted the government permission to appeal the decision.|$|E
