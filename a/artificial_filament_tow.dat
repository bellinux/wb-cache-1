The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the uniformity and penetration of surface modification into textile materials including fiber, yarn and fabric treated by atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ). Exposure to helium/oxygen plasma at atmospheric pressure made improvement in the wettability, dyeability, adhesion of single fiber, yarn and woven fabric.

It can treat the whole surfaces of a single fiber, yarn filament in the treated parallel <b>filament</b> <b>tow</b> uniformly. For porous fabrics, rapid and efficient treatment on both sides of the treated samples was found to be ensured.

Both dinoflagellates readily ingest prey and exhibit positive growth when feeding on monocultures of Fibrocapsa japonica. Maximum growth rates at food saturation were 0. 54 d- 1 and 0. 72 d- 1 for O. rotunda and O. marina, respectively. Both dinoflagellates are thus able to grow faster than their prey, for which a maximum growth rate of 0. 45 d- 1 has been reported.

40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} emissions {{targets are}} encouraging vehicle manufacturers to prioritise reduction of vehicle mass. The falling cost of carbon fibre is increasing {{the viability of}} lightweight carbon-based body panel systems across {{a broad range of}} production volumes. In the present work an automated process has been developed for the manufacture of random fibre preforms at medium volume production levels (30 - 50, 000 ppa). This thesis seeks to understand the influence of key microstructural parameters on the mechanical and physical properties of carbon fibre laminates produced by directed fibre preforming. The principal parameters studied are fibre length, <b>tow</b> <b>filament</b> count and laminate thickness. A statistical process simulation has been developed to predict preform density variation and the results are compared with experimental tensile properties. Experimental studies have shown that there is a notable reduction in areal density variation and consequently an increase in tensile properties with shorter fibres (115 mm to 6 mm) and thicker laminates (1. 5 mm to 4 mm for a constant volume fraction). Shorter lengths improved preform coverage and gave higher tensile strength, whilst thicker laminates reduced the presence of unreinforced areas which cause stress concentrations. Tow filamentisation has been induced by pneumatic means to reduce the mean filament count and maximise the mechanical performance when using inexpensive, 24 K bundles. By maximising the level of filamentisation both stiffness and strength can be increased by 20 % and 45 % respectively. An analytical stiffness model is presented to predict the effect of <b>tow</b> <b>filament</b> count on the in-plane elastic constants. Filament count and out-of-plane fibre orientation distributions are determined from optical microscopy and are incorporated into a multi-level Mori-Tanaka based model. Predictions are within 8 % of the experimental data for laminates containing large fibre bundles and 10 % for laminates with highly filamentised bundles. An expression for critical bundle length has been developed for more accurate strength prediction, {{based on the number of}} filaments within the bundle. Experimental results confirm that the critical tow length is proportional to the <b>tow</b> <b>filament</b> count. Directed fibre preforming has been benchmarked against other competing processes in respect of mechanical properties, weight saving potential and cost. A full-scale demonstrator component has been manufactured using a variety of carbon composite solutions, which can all provide 40 to 50 % weight saving for an equivalent bending stiffness to steel and greatly improved dent resistance. Directed fibre preforming has shown great promise for both semi-structural and structural components for medium volume applications, particularly when aligned fibres are introduced. The results from this work can be directly scaled for industrial application to provide a cost effective, lightweight alternative to steel.

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in using discontinuous carbon fibre composites for semi-structural applications within the automotive industry. The main advantages of discontinuous fibres are low material costs, low wastage and low touch labour compared with processes using carbon fibre textiles. Directed Carbon Fibre Preforming (DCFP) is an automated process for producing complex 3 D preforms for liquid moulding. DCFP offers the potential for producing highly optimised structures, with local control over tow size, fibre length and volume fraction within the component. The execution of this is challenging however, as confidence in the current library of material properties is low and existing structural optimisation packages only consider a very limited number of design variables, which are restricted to more conventional composite materials. This thesis aims to establish a structural design tool to exploit the design freedom offered by the DCFP process. A large number of parameters associated with the fibre architecture can be controlled to meet a range of design criterions such as performance, weight and cost. The optimisation tool is capable of generating locally varied fibre areal mass and thickness maps that are suitable for manufacture by the robot controlled process. The developed model adopts a multi-scaled finite element approach. Meso-scale simulations are performed to establish size effects in discontinuous fibre composites, to quantify the level of stochastic variability and to determine the representative volume element for a given fibre architecture. A DCFP material database is generated to facilitate macro-scale modelling at the component level. The macro-scale model iteratively redistributes material in order to minimise the total strain energy of the model under prescribed loading conditions. The optimised model is segmented into areas of uniform areal mass, where the zone geometries are tailored to achieve representative material properties according to the meso-scale results, whilst ensuring the design is fit for manufacture. An automotive spare wheel well has been chosen as a demonstrator component, enabling two DCFP architectures to be compared against a continuous glass/carbon fibre NCF design.

Small diameter PAN/CNT based carbon fibers have been processed using sheath-core and islands-in-a-sea (INS) fiber spinning technology.

A non-isothermal extent of cyclization (Mcyc) from the DSC kinetics study was developed in order to obtain an unbiased method for determining the optimal stabilization condition. The results of Mcyc were found to be in good agreement with the experimental FTIR and WAXD observations. The carbon fiber fracture surfaces have been examined using SEM. Various test parameters that affect the tensile properties of the precursor fiber (both PAN and PAN/CNT), as well as carbon fiber have been studied. In an attempt to validate single <b>filament</b> tests, fiber <b>tow</b> testing has also been done using standard test methods. Batch processed carbon fibers obtained via sheath-core geometry exhibited tensile strengths as high as 6. 5 GPa, while fibers processed by islands-in-a-sea geometry exhibited strength values as high as 7. 7 GPa.

40|$|N-body {{simulations}} {{are essential}} for understanding the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe. However, the discrete nature of these simulations affects their accuracy when modelling collisionless systems. We introduce {{a new approach to}} simulate the gravitational evolution of cold collisionless fluids by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations in terms of adaptively refineable "Lagrangian phase space elements". These geometrical elements are piecewise smooth maps between Lagrangian space and Eulerian phase space and approximate the continuum structure of the distribution function. They allow for dynamical adaptive splitting to accurately follow the evolution even in regions of very strong mixing. We discuss in detail various one-, two- and three-dimensional test problems to demonstrate the performance of our method. Its advantages compared to N-body algorithms are: i) explicit tracking of the fine-grained distribution function, ii) natural representation of caustics, iii) intrinsically smooth gravitational potential fields, thus iv) eliminating the need for any type of ad-hoc force softening. We show the potential of our method by simulating structure formation in a warm dark matter scenario. We discuss how spurious collisionality and large-scale discreteness noise of N-body methods are both strongly suppressed, which eliminates the <b>artificial</b> fragmentation of <b>filaments.</b> Therefore, we argue that our new approach improves on the N-body method when simulating self-gravitating cold and collisionless fluids, and is the first method that allows to explicitly follow the fine-grained evolution in six-dimensional phase space.
