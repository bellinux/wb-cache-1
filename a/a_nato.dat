5|$|NATO {{acquired}} 18 E-3As {{and support}} equipment for <b>a</b> <b>NATO</b> air defense force. Since all aircraft must be registered {{with a certain}} country, {{the decision was made}} to register the 18 NATO Sentries with Luxembourg, <b>a</b> <b>NATO</b> member that previously did not have any air force. The first NATO E-3 was delivered in January 1982. The eighteen E-3s were operated by Number 1, 2 and 3 Squadrons of NATO's E-3 Component, based at NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen. Presently, 16 NATO E-3As are in the inventory, since one E-3 was lost in a crash and one was retired from service in 2015 (see below).|$|E

Albania {{did not end}} its state of war with Greece, {{left over from the}} Second World War, until as late as 1987 – two years after Hoxha's death – due to suspicions about Greek territorial ambitions in southern Albania (known to Greeks as Northern Epirus) as well as Greece's status as <b>a</b> <b>NATO</b> member state.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1950s, {{fishermen}} in Iceland requested {{assistance from the}} government to remove Killer Whales from Icelandic waters as they damaged fishing equipment. With fisheries accounting for 20% of Iceland's employment at the time, the perceived economic impact was significant. The Icelandic government asked the United States for assistance. As <b>a</b> <b>NATO</b> ally with an air base in Iceland, the US Navy deployed Patrol Squadrons VP-18 and VP-7 to achieve this task. According to the US Navy, hundreds of animals were killed with machineguns, rockets and depth charges.|$|E
5|$|Since reunification, Germany {{has taken}} {{a more active role}} in the European Union. Together with its European {{partners}} Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan as part of <b>a</b> <b>NATO</b> effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban. These deployments were controversial since Germany is bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles.|$|E

5|$|The {{intervention}} in Sierra Leone {{was the fourth}} expeditionary operation and the second significant deployment undertaken by Her Majesty's Armed Forces under Tony Blair, who was elected as Prime Minister in 1997. The first two were relatively minor operations: a series of air strikes against Iraq in 1998 codenamed Operation Desert Fox, and a deployment of a company of Gurkhas and special forces on peacekeeping operations in East Timor in 1999. The third operation, the first major deployment under Blair, was in Kosovo in 1999, where British forces led <b>a</b> <b>NATO</b> {{intervention in}} the Kosovo War.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} commenced during <b>a</b> <b>NATO</b> {{bombing campaign}} against the VRS, codenamed Operation Deliberate Force, which targeted Bosnian Serb air defences, artillery and storage facilities initially {{in the area of}} Sarajevo, but also elsewhere in the country. Operation Sana, alongside concurrent HV and HVO offensives, sparked debate among military analysts as to whether the ground assaults or NATO's airstrikes were more responsible for ending the Bosnian War. Also in question was to what extent the advances of the ARBiH, HVO and HV were assisted by the airstrikes, and conversely, to what extent they hampered the VRS.|$|E

5|$|Vizzini’s {{support for}} the DC was not a secret. During the crucial 1948 {{elections}} that would decide on Italy’s post-war future, Vizzini and Genco Russo sat {{at the same table}} with leading DC politicians, attending an electoral lunch. In the course of the start of the Cold War, the 1948 elections were a triumph for the Christian Democrats, who would govern Italy with up and downs for the next 45 years in different coalitions. One of its main aims was to keep the Italian Communist Party – the biggest communist party in <b>a</b> <b>NATO</b> member state – away from power.|$|E
5|$|Austria and Switzerland {{are both}} {{members of the}} Partnership for Peace, and border NATO member states. Malta {{is also a member}} of the Partnership for Peace and the European Union.

According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj, integration with NATO is a priority for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Hoxhaj stated in 2014 that the country's goal is to be <b>a</b> <b>NATO</b> member by 2022. However, four NATO member states, Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia, do not recognize Kosovo's independence. United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership.|$|E
