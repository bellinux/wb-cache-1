5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} encoded {{directly}} by the genetic code {{can be divided into}} several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size, and functional groups. These properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried {{in the middle of the}} protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the <b>aqueous</b> <b>solvent.</b> (Note that in biochemistry, a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid.) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine. There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues.|$|E

50|$|Tryptophan is an {{important}} intrinsic fluorescent probe (amino acid), {{which can be used}} to estimate the nature of microenvironment of the tryptophan. When performing experiments with denaturants, surfactants or other amphiphilic molecules, the microenvironment of the tryptophan might change. For example, if a protein containing a single tryptophan in its 'hydrophobic' core is denatured with increasing temperature, a red-shifted emission spectrum will appear. This is due to the exposure of the tryptophan to an aqueous environment as opposed to a hydrophobic protein interior. In contrast, the addition of a surfactant to a protein which contains a tryptophan which is exposed to the <b>aqueous</b> <b>solvent</b> will cause a blue-shifted emission spectrum if the tryptophan is embedded in the surfactant vesicle or micelle.

5000|$|Iron(IV)-oxo {{compounds}} are intermediates in many oxidations catalysed by heme-containing enzymes. One of {{the most}} widely studied examples is cytochrome p450 enzymes, which use a heme cofactor that is capable of hydroxylation of saturated C-H bonds, epoxidation of olefins, and oxidation of aromatic groups. [...] Similarly, methane monooxygenase (MMO) oxidizes methane to methanol via oxygen atom transfer from an iron-oxo intermediate at its non-heme di-iron center. First, C-H bonds are quite resistant to oxidation and are generally unreactive at moderate temperatures (see C-H bond activation). Second, harsh oxidizing agents will generally oxidize an alcohol to a carboxylic acid, but these enzymes are able to oxidize an alkyl group to an alcohol without further oxidation to a carbonyl or carboxylic acid. The oxidant used in these enzymatic reactions is molecular oxygen in contrast with the harsh, toxic chemicals often found in conventional synthetic organic oxidations.

Kanazawa et al. recognized the possibility of changing the LCST parameter through the addition of different moieties. Kanazawa’s group investigated the reversible changes of PNIPAAm once modifying it with a carboxyl end. It was suggested that the modification leads to faster changes in conformation due to the restrictions introduced by the carboxyl group. They attached the carboxyl-terminated PNIPAAm chains to (aminopropyl)silica and used it as packing material for HPLC analysis of steroids. The separation took place under isocratic conditions using pure water as the mobile phase, and controlled the temperature using a water bath. They were able to shift the LCST from 32 °C to 20 °C by making the solution 1M in NaCl concentration. Of the 5 steroids and benzene, only testosterone could be resolved from the other peaks below the LCST (5 °C, LCST=20 °C in 1M NaCl). Above the LCST (25 °C, LCST=20 °C in 1M NaCl), all of the peaks are well resolved, and there is an increasing trend of retention time versus temperature up to 50 °C.|$|E
