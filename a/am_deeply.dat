25|$|I <b>am</b> <b>deeply</b> {{saddened by}} the death of my close friend and colleague, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, whose death today at his home deprives us all of a great artist and an even greater human being. Almost every tribute paid to Sir Alfred in the past by film critics and historians has {{emphasised}} his continuing influence in the world of film. It is that continuing influence, embodied in the magnificent series of films he has given the world, during the last half-century, that will preserve his great spirit, his humour and his wit, not only for us but for succeeding generations of film-goers.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s {{until her death}} in 2002, Howard {{returned}} to her lifelong fascination with light, night skies, the reflective surface of water. In these last paintings, there is a recurrence of circular elements, an abstraction of natural forms and a balancing of darkness and light. [...] Howard has stated: [...] "In my painting (as in all my work) I <b>am</b> <b>deeply</b> involved with light as the movement and inter-action of colours; the integrity of colour and form, hence with {{the integrity of the}} total work which has to do with spirit and abstract essence, not representation. I am preoccupied with life's ambiguities and dualities and in my later work I am reaching more and more from the dark toward light, freedom, and a transcending exuberance." ...|$|E

[...] Miller struck back in a live-television interview by taking a Wheat Thin, claiming it to be McEwen, and then taking a bite out of it.|$|E
