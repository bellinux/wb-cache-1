50|$|Its fixed {{undercarriage}} was conventional {{with a pair}} of mainwheels on an <b>axle</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{pairs of}} V-struts, the forward, vertical members were fixed to the wings and the rearward drag struts to the wing roots. A tailskid shock absorber was attached to an extension of the rudder post.|$|R
5000|$|Watt's linkage {{can also}} be used to prevent axle {{movement}} in the longitudinal direction of the car. This application involves two Watt's linkages on each side of the <b>axle,</b> <b>mounted</b> parallel to the driving direction, but just a single 4-bar linkage is more common in racing suspension systems ...|$|R
50|$|Antique penny knives have {{increased}} significantly in value and can sell {{for as much}} as $500(US). In modern production, the smallest models of the Opinel, an early 20th-century peasant's knife, continue to utilize this basic design, consisting of a folding blade pivoting on an <b>axle</b> <b>mounted</b> through a steel-bolstered wooden handle.|$|R

25|$|The Paalson Type 1, (Pålson), was a Swedish single-seat sport {{aircraft}} {{built around}} 1920. It was of conventional single-seat biplane layout but had some unusual {{features such as}} girder type interplane struts, a novel main undercarriage <b>axle</b> <b>mounting</b> and a mechanism allowing adjustment of the angle of incidence of the upper wing.|$|R
50|$|The Carmier had fixed, {{conventional}} landing gear, {{with its}} mainwheels {{on a single}} <b>axle</b> <b>mounted</b> via rubber shock absorbers {{to a pair of}} cross-braced tube steel V-struts from the lower fuselage. A long tailskid from the fuselage underside was fixed to a lower extension of the rudder hinge, protecting the otherwise-vulnerable rudder.|$|R

50|$|As the EP08 is tightly {{based on}} EU06 and EU07 {{locomotives}} {{it is important}} to compare those series while writing about technical features. EP08 is a Bo-Bo locomotive with four <b>axles</b> <b>mounted</b> on two bogies. Each axle is propelled separately by an EE541a traction motor. The cab has two identical crew compartments on both ends.|$|R
50|$|Its {{landing gear}} was fixed and conventional, with mainwheels on split, cranked <b>axles</b> <b>mounted</b> on a central {{inverted}} strut-pyramid {{from the lower}} fuselage longerons. There were rearward drag struts to the longerons as well as rubber cord shock absorbing struts. The undercarriage track was 1.30 m. The PM X had a short, castering tailskid.|$|R
5000|$|Fixed: A {{fixed pulley}} has an <b>axle</b> <b>mounted</b> in {{bearings}} {{attached to a}} supporting structure. A fixed pulley changes {{the direction of the}} force on a rope or belt that moves along its circumference. Mechanical advantage is gained by combining a fixed pulley with a movable pulley or another fixed pulley of a different diameter.|$|R
50|$|The Amiot had a {{conventional}} fixed undercarriage with its mainwheels on <b>axles</b> <b>mounted</b> at the vertices of V-struts, with the forward components hinged {{on the central}} fuselage underside and the rear drag struts on the lower fuselage longerons. Each axle had a long oleo strut mounted on the mid-side of the fuselage, just aft of the engine.|$|R
5000|$|A {{cylindrical}} joint is a two-degrees-of-freedom kinematic pair used in mechanisms. [...] Cylindrical joints provide single-axis sliding function {{as well as}} a single axis rotation, providing a way for two rigid bodies to translate and rotate freely. This can be pictured by an unsecured <b>axle</b> <b>mounted</b> on a chassis, as it may freely rotate and translate.|$|R
5000|$|In 1936 Chapelon {{began the}} rebuild of a PO 6000 class 2-10-0 as a 2-12-0 with two {{high-pressure}} cylinders between the 2nd and 3rd coupled <b>axles</b> <b>mounted</b> behind four low-pressure cylinders. There {{was also an}} additional level of [...] "superheat" [...] between the high- and low-pressure cylinders, allowing the loco to achieve a tractive effort of 83700 lb.|$|R
50|$|Its fixed, {{conventional}} undercarriage {{originally had}} mainwheels {{on a single}} <b>axle,</b> <b>mounted</b> on V-struts from the lower fuselage with wire cross-bracing. The rear components of the V-struts had rubber disc shock absorbers. By May 1928 the axle had gone and the landing gear made more robust with a transverse X-strut. A castoring steel tailskid had its own rubber shock absorber.|$|R
50|$|The Nissan Serena is a five-door minivan {{manufactured}} by Nissan Motor Company, joining the slightly larger Nissan Vanette. The car was engineered by Nissan's Aichi Manufacturing Division and launched in 1991 as compact passenger van, and it grew larger with each generation over the years. Earlier versions were front engine, rear-wheel drive layout {{with a live}} <b>axle</b> <b>mounted</b> on leaf springs.|$|R
50|$|The three-axle tenders had {{an unusual}} wheel {{arrangement}}, {{with the front}} <b>axle</b> <b>mounted</b> in a rigid frame {{and the other two}} axles in a bogie. A similar tender wheel arrangement had first been used in 1884 on the experimental 3rd Class 4-4-0 and 4th class 4-6-0TT locomotives of the Cape Government Railways (CGR). It was not used in South Africa again.|$|R
2500|$|The Type 1 had a smooth-skinned, tapering, round {{cross section}} {{fuselage}} with a 37kW (50hp) cowled Gnôme-type rotary engine driving a two-bladed tractor propeller {{in the nose}} and an open cockpit aft of the wing trailing edge. [...] The tail surfaces were rounded with separate elevators.
