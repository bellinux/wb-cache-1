While she {{was still}} a child in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) he often used to gaze up at the night sky and say, [...] "Makes you think – there are so many worlds up there, wouldn't really matter if we did blow ourselves up – plenty more where we came from." [...] Shikasta gave rise to a religious cult in America. Lessing {{said in an interview that}} its followers had written to her and asked, [...] "When <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> visited by the gods?", and she told them that the book is [...] "not a cosmology.

60|$|ASHER. It {{looks like}} more bad news,--the Germans have started {{another one of}} those offensives. I was afraid they were getting ready for it. West of Verdun this time.

But after we had satisfied our friends in as much as we could, suggestions of baths, clothes, and luncheon were made which were very welcome. So we settled down to what promised to be a long and weary waiting.|$|E

That is, I shall marry you unless you take to wearing pearl-gray derbies or white evening ties with black edging, or kill Mason in a duel, or do something equally disgraceful.

5000|$|I {{was sorry}} to see them go. But we {{certainly}} did fall out at the time. I thought they were crazy. They were just walking away from something so big and successful. We'd had great success {{around the world and}} I thought we were just breaking in a very, very big way. The collective dynamite of those four people, four people who could all write, who could all sing a hit song. In one band.(Yet) I think it becomes claustrophobic, in the fact that you're trying to perfect things and you're looking at each other and eventually you maybe say this relationship is a little too tight for me now, and I need to break away. And that's what in retrospect, I found out long after because I still speak to Godley and Creme who - Lol is my brother-in-law, so I've got to see him - but for quite a while we didn't talk. I just said you're out of your minds for leaving this band. We were on such a winning curve, Graham Gouldman and I had to decide, <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 5cc? Are we gonna scrap the name completely? Well, we thought we, no, we'd better carry on because we, this is 10cc, we are 10cc, this band. Two of our members are leaving us and that's not our problem, but we've got to carry it on.|$|E
40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) -based technology provides label-free localization {{of molecules}} in tissue samples. Drugs, proteins, lipids and metabolites {{can easily be}} monitored in their environment. Resolution can be achieved down to the cellular level (10 – 20 mm) for conventional matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging, or even to the subcellular level for more complex technologies such as secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS) imaging. One question remains: <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to investigate functional relationships between drugs and proteins and compare with localized phenomena?

In the last several months we have been bombarded by media reports of our health care in crisis. In the words of the editor of the British Columbia Medical Journal, Dr JA Wil-son, “Today the medical profession finds itself constantly fighting border skirmishes, but in reality there is a full scale health sector war going on in this country ” (1). Mary Jane England, in her presidential address to the American Psychi-atric Association in May 1996, pleaded “we can no longer fixate on what was.
