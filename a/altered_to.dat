5|$|Because {{observations}} of Titan were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for Voyager 1 was designed around the optimum Titan flyby, which took it below {{the south pole}} of Saturn {{and out of the}} plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission. Had Voyager 1 failed or been unable to observe Titan, Voyager 2s trajectory would have been <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> incorporate the Titan flyby, precluding any visit to Uranus and Neptune. The trajectory Voyager 1 was launched into would not have allowed it to continue on to Uranus and Neptune, but could have been <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> avoid a Titan flyby and travel from Saturn to Pluto, arriving in 1986.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the regimental {{title was}} <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> The North Staffordshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's).

5|$|Antony Gibbs & Sons {{may have}} {{intended}} to employ Great Britain only to exploit a temporary demand for passenger {{service to the}} Australian gold fields following the discovery of gold in Victoria in 1851, but she found long-term employment on this route. For her new role she was given a third refit. Her passenger accommodation was increased from 360 to 730, and her sail-plan <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> a traditional three-masted, square-rigged pattern. She was fitted with a removable propeller, which could be hauled up on deck by chains to reduce drag when under sail power alone.|$|E
5|$|As head of state, Hitler became supreme {{commander}} of the armed forces. The traditional loyalty oath of servicemen was <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> affirm loyalty to Hitler personally, by name, {{rather than to the}} office of supreme commander or the state. On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 88 percent of the electorate voting in a plebiscite.|$|E
5|$|At 8:10am Captain Brown {{ordered a}} course change to 060degrees and {{informed}} {{the men that}} the conn for the battleship would remain on the eighth-level bridge until they cleared the course. This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> 058 {{as a result of}} a strong ocean current that swung Missouri too far to the right during the course correction.|$|E

5|$|Classic {{genome-wide}} {{linkage analysis}} has identified nine loci on different chromosomes associated with psoriasis. They are called psoriasis susceptibility 1 through 9 (PSORS1 through PSORS9). Within those loci are genes on pathways {{that lead to}} inflammation. Certain variations (mutations) of those genes are commonly found in psoriasis. Genome-wide association scans have identified other genes that are <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> characteristic variants in psoriasis. Some of these genes express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved in psoriasis. Some of these genes are also involved in other autoimmune diseases.|$|E
5|$|Dating {{back to the}} {{original}} signposting of the state highway system, M-19 initially connected Detroit with Port Huron and Port Austin in 1919. In late 1926, the routing was <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> shorten it to Bad Axe on the north and Richmond on the south. Additional changes in the 1950s and 1960s updated the highway to finish paving the roadway and extend it southward to its present terminus.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{homogeneity}} of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular {{times and places}} sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After {{the invasion of the}} Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, Minoan-style frescoes were found in Avaris. The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> conform to Akhenaten's revolutionary religious ideas. This style, known as Amarna art, was quickly and thoroughly erased after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s {{plans were}} laid {{for a massive}} freeway system in Washington. Harland Bartholomew, who chaired the National Capital Planning Commission, thought that a rail transit system would never be {{self-sufficient}} because of low density land uses and general transit ridership decline. But the plan met fierce opposition, and was <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> include a Capital Beltway system plus rail line radials. The Beltway received full funding; funding for the ambitious Inner Loop Freeway system was partially reallocated toward construction of the Metro system.|$|E
5|$|Euston was {{constructed}} as two separate underground stations. Three {{of the four}} Northern line platforms date from the station's opening in 1907. The fourth Northern line platform and the two Victoria line platforms were constructed in the 1960s when the station was significantly <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the Victoria line. Plans for High Speed 2 and Crossrail 2 both include proposals to modify the station to provide interchanges with the new services.|$|E

5|$|In 1793 {{a further}} survey was {{conducted}} by John Rennie, and {{the route of the}} canal was <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> take a more southerly course through Great Bedwyn, Devizes, Trowbridge and Newbury. The proposed route was accepted by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of the Bruce Tunnel in the Savernake Forest. On 17April 1794 the Kennet and Avon Canal Act received the Royal Assent and construction began.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further <b>altered</b> <b>to</b> {{increase the amount}} of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Circle line {{services}} began serving the station.

Trains run in a spiral anti-clockwise from Edgware Road around the loop, back to Edgware Road {{and then on to}} the Hammersmith branch.|$|E
