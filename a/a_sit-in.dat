5|$|On 6 June, {{several weeks}} after President Suharto resigned, Sudarmo was ousted from his office after {{students}} conducted <b>a</b> <b>sit-in</b> at the Bantul Assembly House. He was soon convicted of corruption for his payment to the Dharmais Foundation, but the conviction was overturned by a higher court, after which Sudarmo retired. Wuryanto never served time for his disposal of Udin's blood.|$|E
5|$|According to Ming Pao, {{family members}} of the victims were {{dissatisfied}} with the official investigation and held <b>a</b> <b>sit-in</b> protest, calling for a fair judgement. Some locals blamed the official rescue work by comparing it with a large emergency response exercise on a 330-meter building several days before, and the successful firefighting for a blaze at Shanghai World Financial Center in 2007. Others blamed an ineffective firefighting system for the high death toll, and were dissatisfied that they were not given more details about the fire.|$|E
5|$|African-American {{protests in}} the South {{accelerated}} {{in the early}} 1960s, and the ACLU assisted at every step. After four African-American college students staged <b>a</b> <b>sit-in</b> in a segregated North Carolina department store, the sit-in movement gained momentum across the United States. During 1960-61, the ACLU defended black students arrested for demonstrating in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. The ACLU also provided legal help for the Freedom Rides in 1961, {{the integration of the}} University of Mississippi, the Birmingham campaign in 1963, and the 1964 Freedom Summer.|$|E

5|$|In Sanabis, {{security}} forces fled the location after protesters approached them, leaving {{one of their}} vehicles behind. Protesters attached the flag of Bahrain to the vehicle instead of damaging or burning it. In Sehla, hundreds held maghrib prayer in the streets after staging a march. In Bilad Al Qadeem, protesters held <b>a</b> <b>sit-in</b> at afternoon and started marching at evening, after which {{security forces}} intervened to disperse them. In Karzakan, protesters staged a march that was joined by another march starting in Dumistan and ended peacefully. In Duraz security forces fired tear gas on 100 protesters, breaking up their rally.|$|E
5|$|On June 22 {{and into}} June 23, 2016, C-SPAN took video {{footage of the}} House floor from {{individual}} House representatives via streaming services Periscope and Facebook Live during <b>a</b> <b>sit-in</b> by House Democrats asking for a vote on gun control measures after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. This {{needed to be done}} because—as the sit-in was done out of formal session and while the House was in official recess—the existing House cameras could not be utilized for coverage of the event by rule.|$|E
5|$|Some {{opposition}} parties supported the protests' plans, while {{others did not}} explicitly call for demonstration. However, they demanded deep reforms and changes similar to those by the youth. Before the start of protests, the government introduced a number {{of economic and political}} concessions. The protests started with <b>a</b> <b>sit-in</b> in solidarity with the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 {{in the vicinity of the}} Egyptian embassy in the capital, Manama ten days before the 'Day of Rage'. On the eve of 14 February, security forces dispersed hundreds of protesters south of Manama.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> virtual <b>sit-in</b> is <b>a</b> form of {{electronic}} civil disobedience deriving {{its name from}} the sit-ins popular during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The virtual sit-in attempts to recreate that same action digitally using a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDOS). During <b>a</b> virtual <b>sit-in,</b> hundreds of activists attempt to access a target website simultaneously and repetitively. If performed correctly, this will cause the target website to run slowly or even collapse entirely, preventing anyone from accessing it.|$|R

She meets Malcolm X and is struck by his good looks and magnetism. After hearing Martin Luther King Jr. speak, she and her friend, activist Godfrey Cambridge, are inspired to produce a successful fundraising event for King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) called Cabaret For Freedom. King names her coordinator of SCLC's office in New York. She performs in Jean Genet's play The Blacks, with Roscoe Lee Brown, James Earl Jones, and Cicely Tyson.|$|E
5|$|Another stock {{plot device}} in the 1970s was the gay {{character}} in a police drama. They served as victims of blackmail or anti-gay violence, but more often as criminals. Beginning in the late 1960s with N.Y.P.D., Police Story, and Police Woman, the use of homosexuals in stories became much more prevalent, according to Vito Russo, {{as a response to}} their higher profiles in gay activism. Lesbians were included as villains, motivated to murder by their desires, internalized homophobia, or fear of being exposed as homosexual. One episode of Police Woman earned protests by the National Gay Task Force before it aired for portraying a trio of murderous lesbians who killed retirement home patients for their money. NBC edited the episode because of the protests, but <b>a</b> <b>sit-in</b> was staged in the head of NBC's offices.|$|E
5|$|During {{his short}} time as chancellor, Corbally faced crises {{spurred on by}} civil unrest {{surrounding}} the Vietnam War and race relations. Tolley, his predecessor, was a proponent of military education on campus; this included {{the establishment of a}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program. By the time Tolley left office, the university faced major financial issues and there was uncertainty regarding the future of the ROTC program. Corbally advocated for keeping the program and its academic accreditation, an idea which was opposed by students hostile to a military presence on campus, some of whom participated in <b>a</b> <b>sit-in</b> of the ROTC building in February 1970. The matter was referred to the school senate, a democratic body composed of students, faculty, and administrators, which voted to keep the program open, a move which many students felt was forced by the chancellor.|$|E

5|$|From 1930 to 1934, Wu {{studied at}} the National Central University (later renamed Nanjing University and {{reinstated}} in Taiwan), first in mathematics, but later transferring to physics. She became involved in student politics. Relations between China and Japan were tense at this time, and students were urging the government to take a stronger line with Japan. Wu was elected {{as one of the}} student leaders by her colleagues because they felt that since {{she was one of the}} top students at the university, her involvement would be forgiven, or at least overlooked, by the authorities. That being the case, she was careful not to neglect her studies. She led protests that included <b>a</b> <b>sit-in</b> at the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, where the students were met by Chiang Kai-shek.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Black Lives Matter was {{selected}} by Pride Toronto as the honoured group in that year's Pride parade, during which they staged <b>a</b> <b>sit-in</b> to block the parade from moving forward for approximately half an hour. They issued a number of demands for Pride to adjust its relationship with LGBTQ people of colour, including stable funding and a suitable venue for the established Blockrama event, improved diversity in the organization's staff and volunteer base, and most famously that Toronto Police officers be banned from marching in the parade in uniform. Pride executive director Mathieu Chantelois signed BLM's statement of demand, but later asserted that he had signed it only to end the sit-in and get the parade moving, and had not agreed to honour the demands.|$|E
5|$|Justice Harlan is {{credited}} for the establishing that the First Amendment protects {{the freedom of}} association. In NAACP v. Alabama, Justice Harlan delivered {{the opinion of the}} court, invalidating an Alabama law that required the NAACP to disclose membership lists. However he did not believe that individuals were entitled to exercise their First Amendment rights wherever they pleased. He joined in Adderley v. Florida, which controversially upheld a trespassing conviction for protesters who demonstrated on government property. He dissented from Brown v. Louisiana, in which the Court held that protesters were entitled to engage in <b>a</b> <b>sit-in</b> at a public library. Likewise, he disagreed with Tinker v. Des Moines, in which the Supreme Court ruled that students had the right to wear armbands (as a form of protest) in public schools.|$|E

5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in major US cities, the 1960s was a turbulent decade for the city. Numerous {{civil rights and}} anti-war protests took place, including large protests led by Marie Hicks to desegregate Girard College. Students took over the Community College of Philadelphia in <b>a</b> <b>sit-in,</b> race riots broke out in Holmesburg Prison, and a 1964 riot along West Columbia Avenue killed two people, injured over 300 and caused around US$3 million in damages. Crime was also a serious problem. Primarily drug-related gang warfare plagued the city, and in 1970 crime was rated the city's number one problem in a City Planning Commission survey. The court system was overtaxed and the tactics {{of the police department}} under Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo were controversial. Frank Rizzo was credited with preventing the level of violence seen in other cities at the time and was elected mayor in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006 Queen Mary 2 {{embarked}} on a circumnavigation of South America. Upon departure from Fort Lauderdale, one of her propeller pods was damaged when it struck a channel wall, forcing the ship to sail at a reduced speed, which resulted in Commodore Warwick's decision to skip several calls on its voyage to Rio de Janeiro. Many of her passengers threatened to stage <b>a</b> <b>sit-in</b> protest because of the missed calls, before Cunard offered to refund the voyage costs. Queen Mary 2 continued to operate at a reduced service speed and several itinerary changes were necessary until repairs had been completed after the ship returned to Europe in June, where Queen Mary 2 {{paid a visit to}} dry dock and the damaged propeller pod was unseated. In November, Queen Mary 2 was drydocked once more at the Blohm + Voss yard in Hamburg (drydock Elbe 17) for the reinstallation of the repaired propeller pod. At the same time, sprinkler systems were installed in all of the vessel's balconies to comply with new safety regulations which had come into effect since the MS Star Princess fire. Additionally, both bridge wings were extended by two metres to improve visibility.|$|E
