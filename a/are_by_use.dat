A number of methods can be employed to recover heat. The most common <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>use</b> of recuperative air preheaters, regenerative air preheaters and economizers. Relative advantages and applicability of the three methods are discussed.

40|$|In all-optical label stripping, {{the optical}} packets <b>are,</b> <b>by</b> <b>use</b> of all-optical labels, {{directed}} through the optical network without passing them through electronics whenever a forwarding decision is necessary. Ideally {{this approach has}} the ability to route packets/bursts independently of bit rate, packet format and packet length. Still AOLS encounters new troubles. The lack of all-optical memory makes the AOLS nodes very complex and resource consuming. This is of great importance when providing the all-optical network with resilience. We focused on different protection/restoration schemes (real-time or in advance, local or end-to-end) {{that could be used in}} combination with all-optical packet-switching networks. We investigated how the presence of back-up facilities in the network affects the label length and number of labels needed throughout the network (i. e., the router's dimensions) ...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, strange {{phenomena}} {{occurred in}} the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa: a massive tide of sargassum, brown algae, washed ashore causing considerable damage to the local economy and environment. The sargassum mostly consists of Sargassum Natans and Sargassum Fluitans. Old studies concluded that the sargassum came from the Sargasso Sea, however the most recent massive tide of sargassum (named as golden tide) came from an area north of the Amazon river delta. Texas A&M University of Galveston and the University of Florida developed detection systems in cooperation with NASAs satellite images. With the detection system {{it is possible to}} track, trace and make forecasts of sargassum landings. Hereby it is possible to act {{a few days before the}} sargassum washes ashore, instead of reacting when it landed on the beach already. Most of the problems occur when the massive influxes of sargassum are washed ashore. Currently, the most used harvesting methods on the beach <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>use</b> of rakes and wheelbarrows or by using mechanical equipment like a cane loaders and front-end loaders. The beach cleaning methods causes beach erosion and endangers local wildlife. Therefore, harvesting methods at sea are under development. Sargassum is an organic material and can be an useful source for processing. The most used processing methods of sargassum are burying at the beach or using it as a fertiliser. One of the challenges in processing sargassum is working with the unpredictable appearing character of sargassum. The known detection methods have been critically analysed and the most favourable method is developed by Texas A&M University Galveston. This system is applicable on other areas as well and it makes forecasts of sargassum landings. The harvesting methods have also been critically analysed and it can be concluded that the most recommended harvesting method has to be done at sea in combination with a floating barrier. Most of the problems are avoided in this manner. For processing multiple opportunities have been pointed out. Biofuel and bioplastics are having large potential. For the mean time using sargassum as a fertiliser is a su cient solution. The uneven appearances can be solved by drying the sargassum. Finally, an implementation plan is developed for Quintana Roo to overcome the sargassum problems. It is a step-by-step approach which can be conducted by a party who is willing to take the lead. In this approach the detection system of Texas can be used and new harvesting methods have to be developed. For processing, dry facilities have to be built in order to solve the uneven appearances.
