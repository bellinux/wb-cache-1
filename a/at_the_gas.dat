5|$|For the {{flashback}} scene <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> station, {{the crew}} rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any {{sound from the}} vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E
5|$|Mengele {{and other}} SS doctors did not treat inmates, but {{supervised}} {{the activities of}} inmate doctors forced {{to work in the}} camp medical service. Mengele made weekly visits to the hospital barracks and sent to the gas chambers any prisoners who had not recovered after two weeks in bed. He was {{also a member of the}} team of doctors responsible for supervising the administration of Zyklon B, the cyanide-based pesticide that was used to kill people in the gas chambers at Birkenau. He served in this capacity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> chambers located in crematoria IV and V.|$|E
5|$|Sonderkommandos (special work crews {{forced to}} work <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> chambers) wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. If the gas chamber was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or bleeding from their ears. The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich.|$|E

The labs meanwhile were filmed in two separate locations, one of which was a microchip processing facility. The switch between two locations meant that the crew had to transport a lift set. The scenes in Dewer's Hollow, where the hound was sighted, was filmed near Castell Coch. The reveal scenes in the hollow took two nights to film. At some point filming the scenes were delayed due to rain. The scenes shot in Dartmoor took place in areas such as Haytor and Hound Tor, the latter of which was said to be where the original story was set.|$|E

Agostini was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. It was determined that he had sustained two bullet wounds to the head.

25|$|Ailsa Craig had two quite {{separate}} {{rail transport}} systems, one dated from 1886 and supplied coal, oil fuel and provisions to the lighthouse and gas works via the North Port {{and later the}} New Jetty and the other transported road stone from the quarries at Kennedy's Nags via the stone crusher to the Quarry Pier. The Northern Lighthouse Board's tramway had a section worked via a powered cable way that hauled wagons up from the North Port and later from the New jetty. This well-built tram line is largely intact and has a gauge of 3 feet with junction/points <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> works and a further set of points {{that led to a}} siding that ran down parallel to the gable end of the gas works to presumably collect the coal ash for disposal. The main line runs on down to the lighthouse and its ancillary buildings, taking a right-angled bend to run parallel to {{the southern end of the}} lighthouse buildings block. This section of the line was worked by hand and at least two wagons remain at the site together with a set of spare wheels <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> works.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} Leningrad State University {{where he}} studied physics and mathematics, but found the specialty programs were not to his interest. He reportedly left without graduating in April, 1929. From 1929-1930 he pursued rocket research <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gas</b> Dynamics Laboratory. A new research section was apparently {{set up for the}} study of liquid-propellant and electric engines.

25|$|Rocketry in the Soviet Union {{also began}} with amateur societies, {{foremost}} was the Group for the Study of Reactive Propulsion (GIRD) headed by Friedrich Zander and Sergei Korolev. From 1931 to 1937 in the Soviet Union, extensive scientific work on rocket engine design occurred <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gas</b> Dynamics Laboratory (GDL) in Leningrad, which was merged with GIRD in 1933 bringing rocketry fully under government control. The well-funded and -staffed laboratory built over 100 experimental engines {{under the direction}} of Valentin Glushko. The work included regenerative cooling, hypergolic propellant ignition, and fuel injector designs that included swirling and bi-propellant mixing injectors. However, Glushko's arrest during Stalinist purges in 1938 curtailed the development.|$|E

However, there have been few studies conducted on treatment solutions for natural gas with high carbon contents. In this paper, several commonly used methods for deacidification of natural gas were introduced.

25|$|In {{addition}} to having engineers and technicians along with facilities for R work on fluorescent lamps, General Electric controlled what it regarded as the key patents covering fluorescent lighting, including the patents originally issued to Hewitt, Moore, and Küch. More important than these was a patent covering an electrode that did not disintegrate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> pressures that ultimately were employed in fluorescent lamps. Albert W. Hull of GE’s Schenectady Research Laboratory filed for a patent on this invention in 1927, which was issued in 1931. General Electric used its control of the patents to prevent competition with its incandescent lights and probably delayed the introduction of fluorescent lighting by 20 years. Eventually, war production required 24-hour factories with economical lighting and fluorescent lights became available.|$|E

There, they meet a mechanic named Bo, who offers to sell them a fan belt after the funeral. While waiting for the services to end, Carly and Wade visit the 'House of Wax', a wax museum which itself is made of wax and is the central feature of the town. The gas station {{does not have the}} right size fan belt, so they follow Bo to his house. Inside, Wade is knocked out by Bo's twin brother, Vincent, who is wearing a wax mask to cover his disfigured face. Outside, Carly realizes Bo is the one who visited them the night before, after noticing his car's broken headlight. She runs to the church for help, but finds out that it is populated only by wax sculptures. Bo captures Carly and brings her to the cellar of the gas station, where she is restrained and her lips are glued. Meanwhile, Vincent strips Wade naked and straps him to a chair, where he is both injected and covered in molten wax.|$|E
