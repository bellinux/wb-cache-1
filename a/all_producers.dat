25|$|The first {{effective}} labor {{organization that}} was more than regional in membership and influence was the Knights of Labor, organized in 1869. The Knights believed in the unity of the interests of all producing groups and sought to enlist in their ranks not only all laborers but everyone who could be truly classified as a producer. The acceptance of <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> led to explosive growth after 1880. Under the leadership of Terence V. Powderly they championed a variety of causes, sometimes through political or cooperative ventures.|$|E

The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, within Egypt and to foreign markets, and retained the surplus. The practice proved very profitable for Egypt with the cultivation of long staple cotton, a new cash crop. To help improve production, he expanded the land used for agriculture and overhauled the irrigation system, largely completed by the corvée, or forced peasant labor. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.|$|E

25|$|Following the undoing of the National Recovery Administration by the Schechter decision, Congress {{attempted}} {{to salvage the}} coal industry code promulgated under the National Industrial Recovery Act in the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935. The act, closely following the criteria of the Schechter ruling, declared a public interest in coal production and found it so integrated into interstate commerce as to warrant federal regulation. The code subjected the coal industry to labor, price, and practice regulations, levying a 15 percent tax on <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> with a provision to refund {{a significant portion of}} the tax for those adhering to the legislation's dictates. James Carter, shareholder and president of the Carter Coal Co., filed suit against the board of directors when they voted to pay the tax.|$|E
25|$|There is {{dispute about}} the level of {{subsidies}} paid to the fossil fuel industry in Australia. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) argues that according to the definitions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), fossil fuel production and use is subsidised in Australia by means of direct payments, favourable tax treatment, and other actions. It is suggested these measures act as impediments to investment in renewable energy resources. Analysis by the ACF indicates that these provisions add up to a total annual subsidy of A$7.7billion, with the most significant component being the Fuel Tax Credits program that rebates diesel fuel excise to many business users. This analysis is disputed by the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) who argue that the ACF's definition of a subsidy differs from that of the OECD and that the fuel tax rebate schemes are in place to ensure that <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> are treated equally from a tax point of view. However, the IPA acknowledges that regardless of perceived issues with the ACF analysis, some level of fossil fuel subsidy is likely in existence.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, {{one of the}} {{patterns}} reported by the CCD Study Group at Pennsylvania State was that <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> in a preliminary survey noted a period of [...] "extraordinary stress" [...] affecting the colonies in question prior to their die-off, most commonly involving poor nutrition and/or drought. This was the only factor {{that all of the}} cases of CCD had in common in the report; accordingly, there appeared to be at least some significant possibility that the phenomenon was correlated to nutritional stress that may not manifest in healthy, well-nourished colonies. This was similar to the findings of another independent survey done in 2007 in which small-scale beekeeping operations (up to 500 colonies) in several states reported their belief that malnutrition and/or weak colonies was the factor responsible for their bees dying in over 50% of the cases, whether the losses were believed to be due to CCD or not.|$|E

2500|$|The Product Liability Directive 1985 was {{the first}} {{consumer}} protection measure. It creates strict enterprise liability for <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> and retailers for any harm to consumers from products, {{as a way to}} promote basic standards of health and safety. Any producer, or supplier if the ultimate producer is insolvent, of a product is strictly liable to compensate a consumer for any damage caused by a defective product. A [...] "defect" [...] is anything which falls below what a consumer is entitled to expect, and this essentially means that products should be safe for their purpose. A narrow defensive is available if a producer can show that a defect could not be known by any scientific method, thought this has never been successfully invoked, because it is generally thought a profit making enterprise should not be able to externalise the risks of its activities.|$|E
2500|$|The Laffer curve as {{presented}} is simplistic {{in that it}} assumes a single tax rate and a single labor supply. Actual systems of public finance are more complex, and there is serious doubt about the relevance of considering a single marginal tax rate. In addition, revenue {{may well be a}} multivalued function of tax rate; for instance, an increase in tax rate to a certain percentage may not result in the same revenue as a decrease in tax rate to the same percentage (a kind of hysteresis). Furthermore, the Laffer curve does not take explicitly into account the nature of the tax avoidance taking place. It is possible that if <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> are endowed with two survival factors in the market (ability to produce efficiently and ability to avoid tax), then the revenues raised under tax avoidance can be greater than without avoidance, and thus the Laffer curve maximum is found to be farther right than thought. The reason for this result is that if producers with low productive abilities (high production costs) [...] tend to have strong avoidance abilities as well, a uniform tax on producers actually becomes a tax that discriminates on the ability to pay.|$|E
60|$|As {{a general}} rule, then, things tend to {{exchange}} {{for one another}} at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit; in other words, such as will give to <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> the same rate of profit on their outlay. But in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay, that is, the cost of production, is equal, things must on the average exchange for {{one another in the}} ratio of their cost of production; things of which the cost of production is the same, must be of the same value.|$|E

60|$|We are supposing, of course, {{that things}} are left to themselves. Governments have not always left things to themselves. It was, until lately, the policy of all governments to interdict the {{exportation}} and the melting of money; while, by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things, they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in. By this course they gratified two prejudices: they drew, or thought that they drew, more money into the country, which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth; and they gave, or thought that they gave, to <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> and dealers, high prices, which, though no real advantage, people are always inclined to suppose to be one.|$|E
60|$|When {{examined}} more closely, {{the following}} are {{the details of the}} process: If gold is above its natural or cost value—the coin, as we have seen, conforming in its value to the bullion—money will be of high value, and the prices of all things, labor included, will be low. These low prices will lower the expenses of all producers; but, as their returns will also be lowered, no advantage will be obtained by any producer, except the producer of gold; whose returns from his mine, not depending on price, will be the same as before, and, his expenses being less, he will obtain extra profits, and will be stimulated to increase his production. E converso, if the metal is below its natural value; since this is as much as to say that prices are high, and the money expenses of <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> unusually great; for this, however, all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns; the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before, while his expenses will be greater: his profits, therefore, being diminished or annihilated, he will diminish his production, if not abandon his employment.|$|E
60|$|Everybody {{would bring}} a double demand as well as supply; {{everybody}} {{would be able to}} buy twice as much, because every one would have twice as much to offer in exchange. It is probable, indeed, that there would now be a superfluity of certain things. Although the community would willingly double its aggregate consumption, it may already have as much as it desires of some commodities, and it may prefer to do more than double its consumption of others, or to exercise its increased purchasing power on some new thing. If so, the supply will adapt itself accordingly, and the values of things will continue to conform to their cost of production. At any rate, it is a sheer absurdity that all things should fall in value, and that <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> should, in consequence, be insufficiently remunerated. If values remain the same, what becomes of prices is immaterial, since the remuneration of producers does not depend on how much money, but on how much of consumable articles, they obtain for their goods. Besides, money is a commodity; and, if all commodities are supposed to be doubled in quantity, we must suppose money to be doubled too, and then prices would no more fall than values would.|$|E

60|$|What {{is true of}} {{agriculture}} is said by Anarchists to be equally true of industry. They maintain that if the great economic organizations which are now managed by capitalists, without consideration for {{the lives of the}} wage-earners beyond what Trade Unions are able to exact, were turned gradually into self-governing communities, in which the producers could decide all questions of methods, conditions, hours of work, and so forth, there would be an almost boundless change for the better: grime and noise might be nearly eliminated, the hideousness of industrial regions might be turned into beauty, the interest in the scientific aspects of production might become diffused among <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> with any native intelligence, and something of the artist's joy in creation might inspire the whole of the work. All this, which is at present utterly remote from the reality, might be produced by economic self-government. We may concede that by such means a very large proportion of the necessary work of the world could ultimately be made sufficiently agreeable to be preferred before idleness even by men whose bare livelihood would be assured whether they worked or not. As to the residue let us admit that special rewards, whether in goods or honors or privileges, would have to be given to those who undertook it. But this need not cause any fundamental objection.|$|E
60|$|The {{argument}} against the possibility of general over-production is quite conclusive, {{so far as it}} applies to the doctrine that a country may accumulate capital too fast; that produce in general may, by increasing faster than the demand for it, reduce <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> to distress. This proposition, strange to say, was almost a received doctrine as lately as thirty years ago; and the merit of those who have exploded it is much greater than might be inferred from the extreme obviousness of its absurdity when it is stated in its native simplicity. It is true that if all the wants of all the inhabitants of a country were fully satisfied, no further capital could find useful employment; but, in that case, none would be accumulated. So long as there remain any persons not possessed, we do not say of subsistence, but of the most refined luxuries, and who would work to possess them, there is employment for capital; and if the commodities which these persons want are not produced and placed at their disposal, it can only be because capital does not exist, disposable for the purpose of employing, if not any other labourers, those very labourers themselves, in producing the articles for their own consumption. Nothing can be more chimerical than the fear that the accumulation of capital should produce poverty and not wealth, or that it will ever take place too fast for its own end. Nothing is more true than that it is produce which constitutes the market for produce, and that every increase of production, if distributed without miscalculation among all kinds of produce in the proportion which private interest would dictate, creates, or rather constitutes, its own demand.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Mill has here used cost of {{production}} almost exactly in the [...] sense of cost of labor, and as excluding profit (while in the next [...] chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis). It will [...] be well, {{for the sake of}} definiteness, to collect the phrases [...] above in which he describes cost {{of production}}: “Unless that value [...] is sufficient to repay the {{cost of production}}, and to afford, [...] besides, the ordinary expectation of profit, the commodity will [...] not continue to be produced”; “the cost of production, together [...] with the ordinary profit, may therefore be called the necessary [...] price, or value”; “it repays the cost of production, not only [...] with the customary, but with a higher rate of profit”; “the [...] cost of production with the ordinary profit—in other words, such [...] as will give to <b>all</b> <b>producers</b> the same rate of profit on their [...] outlay”; “that the profit may be equal where the outlay, that is, [...] the cost of production, is equal.” This is a view which [...] distinctly uses cost of production {{in the sense of the}} outlay to [...] the capitalist, or cost of labor. In no other way can profit vary [...] with “cost of production” than in the sense that it is what a [...] given article “costs to the capitalist”; but that is Mr. Mill’s [...] definition of cost of labor (p. 227). It is, however, very [...] puzzling when in the next section he speaks of “the natural value, [...] that is, the cost of production.” Above, value included cost of [...] production and profit also. Having thus pointed out what is Mr. [...] Mill’s conception of cost of production, it will remain for us in [...] the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more [...] satisfactory.|$|E
