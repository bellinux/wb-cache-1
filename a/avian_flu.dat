5|$|Soon after Hong Kong's {{transfer}} to China, the territory has suffered coincidentally an economic double-blow: Asian Financial Crisis and the H5N1 <b>avian</b> <b>flu</b> pandemic. The then-Financial Secretary, Sir Donald Tsang, adopted a radical measure {{to make use}} of British Hong Kong foreign currency reserves and restored Hong Kong's financial stability. In December 1997, officials had to destroy 1.4 million livestock in order to contain the H5 virus from spreading.|$|E
5|$|A {{second case}} occurs {{a few days}} later, another man killed by the beetles, but they find the beetles to be larger and more mature. From the second victim's movements, they {{identify}} the likely culprit as Dr. Armand Silva (Alon Abutbul), a former scientist. Dr. Silva {{was working on a}} cure for <b>avian</b> <b>flu</b> using the skelter beetle, but his research was terminated with the extinction of the sheep. Fauxlivia and Frank postulate Dr. Silva may be trying to breed the beetles in humans, who share similar biological features with sheep.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. <b>Avian</b> <b>flu</b> H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E

25|$|From January 1997 until being {{sworn in}} as the 21st Secretary of Defense in January 2001, Rumsfeld served as Chairman of Gilead Sciences, Inc.

As a result, Rumsfeld's holdings in the company grew significantly when <b>avian</b> <b>flu</b> became a subject of popular anxiety during his later term as Secretary of Defense. Following standard practice, Rumsfeld recused himself from any decisions involving Gilead, and he directed the Pentagon's General Counsel to issue instructions outlining what he could and could not be involved in if there were an <b>avian</b> <b>flu</b> pandemic and the Pentagon had to respond.|$|E

25|$|Because {{migratory birds}} {{are among the}} {{carriers}} of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, it is spreading to {{all parts of the}} world.

25|$|These H5N1 infections may {{be quite}} common; {{in a survey of}} 10 {{apparently}} healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in West Java, where <b>avian</b> <b>flu</b> had broken out, five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus.

50|$|Peramivir is a {{pharmaceutical}} drug {{used to treat}} viral infections. Like zanamivir and oseltamivir, peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. Experimental data indicate that peramivir may have useful activity against many viruses of interest, including H5N1 (<b>avian</b> bird <b>flu),</b> hepatitis B, polio, measles and smallpox. HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt announced on January 4, 2007 that the Department has awarded a $102.6 million, four-year contract to BioCryst Pharmaceuticals for advanced development of their influenza antiviral drug, peramivir.|$|R
25|$|On 8 March 2006, Dr. David Nabarro, senior UN {{coordinator}} for avian and human influenza, said {{that given the}} flight patterns of wild birds that have been spreading <b>avian</b> influenza (bird <b>flu)</b> from Asia to Europe and Africa, birds infected with the H5N1 virus could reach the Americas within the next six to 12 months.|$|R
25|$|A {{filtered}} and purified influenza A {{vaccine for}} humans has been developed, and many countries have stockpiled it {{to allow a}} quick administration to {{the population in the}} event of an avian influenza pandemic. Avian influenza is sometimes called <b>avian</b> <b>flu,</b> and colloquially, bird flu. In 2011, researchers reported the discovery of an antibody effective against all types of the influenza A virus.|$|E
25|$|The {{reported}} {{mortality rate}} of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza {{in a human}} is high; WHO data indicate 60% of cases classified as H5N1 resulted in death. However, {{there is some evidence}} the actual mortality rate of <b>avian</b> <b>flu</b> could be much lower, as there may be many people with milder symptoms who do not seek treatment and are not counted.|$|E
25|$|A vaccine {{probably}} would not {{be available in the}} initial stages of population infection. A vaccine cannot be developed to protect against a virus which does not exist yet. The <b>Avian</b> <b>Flu</b> virus H5N1 has the potential to mutate into a pandemic strain, but so do other types of flu virus. Once a potential virus is identified and a vaccine is approved, it normally takes five to six months before the vaccine becomes available.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{globalization}} has forced a deeper {{appreciation of the}} relationship between intellectual property (IP) law and global health. The threat of an emergent <b>avian</b> bird <b>flu</b> pandemic led to calls for Roche to relax patent restrictions on oseltamivir, a drug with potential efficacy against bird influenza [1, 2]. In the context of the fall 2001 anthrax attacks, the US government faced pressure to break Bayer’s patent on ciprofloxacin in order to increase availability of the drug [3]. Such situations have generated intense debate over the value of patent protection amidst health crises.

25|$|Due to {{influences}} from junta {{and those}} behind the scene, {{the policies and}} positions of several ministers in Surayud's Cabinet changed very frequently, sometimes on a daily basis. Notable flip-flops included Thailand's refusal to share <b>avian</b> <b>flu</b> samples with the WHO, capital controls against foreign investment, shareholding limits for foreign investors in telecommunications firms, the identity of bombers in the 2006 New Year's Eve bombings, {{and the role of}} the Malaysian government in mediating the South Thailand insurgency.|$|E
25|$|FAO {{established}} an Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases in 1994, {{focusing on the}} control of diseases like rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease and <b>avian</b> <b>flu</b> by helping governments coordinate their responses. One key element is the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme, which has advanced to a stage where large tracts of Asia and Africa have now been free of the cattle disease rinderpest {{for an extended period}} of time. Meanwhile, Locust Watch monitors the worldwide locust situation and keeps affected countries and donors informed of expected developments.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} various {{influenza}} strains to show species-selectivity is {{largely due to}} variation in the hemagglutinin genes. Genetic mutations in the hemagglutinin gene that cause single amino acid substitutions can significantly alter the ability of viral hemagglutinin proteins to bind to receptors on the surface of host cells. Such mutations in avian H5N1 viruses can change virus strains from being inefficient at infecting human cells to being as efficient in causing human infections as more common human influenza virus types. This doesn't mean that one amino acid substitution can cause a pandemic, but it does mean that one amino acid substitution can cause an <b>avian</b> <b>flu</b> virus that is not pathogenic in humans to become pathogenic in humans.|$|E

40|$|Gram-positive and nonpathogenic {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{are considered to be}} promising candidates for the development of new, safe systems of heterologous protein expression. Recombinant LAB has been shown to induce specific local and systemic immune response against selected pathogens, and could be a good alternative to classical attenuated carriers. The main goal of our study was to express the avian influenza haemagglutinin (H 5) and chicken interleukin 2 (chIL- 2) in Lactococcus lactis. Results of this study were anticipated to lead to construction of lactococcal strain(s) with potential vaccine properties against the avian influenza A (H 5 N 1) virus. Expression of the cloned H 5 gene, its His-tagged variant and chIL- 2 gene, {{under the control of the}} ptcB gene promoter was attested by RT-PCR on transcriptional level and Western or dot blot analysis on translational level, demonstrating that system can be an attractive solution for production of heterologous proteins.
