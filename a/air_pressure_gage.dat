40|$|An {{instrument}} {{has been}} designed to measure intracranial pressures in infants for the specific purpose of providing a clinical device to aid in the early detection of abnormal intracranial pressures. It is also useful in monitoring the intracranial pressure following surgery of the central nervous system. or. to determine whether shunting procedures are working adequately. The instrument provides a quick and reasonably accurate pressure measurement simply by placing a probe on the anterior fontanelle. Engineering design criteria and the operating principles of the instrument are fully discussed and alternative measuring devices and techniques are considered. Although clinical data is limited, a thorough analysis of the results to date is presented. A transducer, an <b>air</b> pump, a <b>pressure</b> <b>gage,</b> an automatic control system, and memory with visual read-out, are the basic parts of the system. The transducer is a closed-end, fluid filled device which operates on a true applanation principle. The air supply for the pneumatically operated transducer is provided by the pump which is in turn, under the control of an automated logic circuit, thus simplifying operating procedure. Basically, the instrument makes twenty separate determinations of the intracranial pressure; the meter read-out is scaled to indicate the mean of these values. Results obtained indicate that the intracranial pressure of infants with open fontanelles can be determined with an error of +-lO%, and the time required to evaluate the pressure is minimal thereby facilitating clinical use...|$|R

For detached houses, the design value of the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> difference across the building envelope for moisture convection analysis should be at least 10 Pa. In the most critical cases (airtight building envelope with unbalanced ventilation), the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> difference across the building envelope may rise up to 30 Pa. To control extremely high <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> differences in airtight houses, balancing ventilation systems are very important.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Air</b> <b>pressure</b> {{in coastal}} {{unsaturated}} aquifers fluctuates with sea tides, {{as does the}} groundwater level. Tide-induced <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuations in coastal subsurface systems, however, are not well addressed in literature. Significant diurnal <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuations are observed below the asphalt pavement in a coastal reclamation area of Hong Kong. A two-dimensional cross-sectional model is built to describe the air-water two-phase flow in the unsaturated zone of the area. TOUGH 2, a general-purpose numerical simulation program for multi-dimensional fluid and heat flows of multiphase, multicomponent fluid mixtures in porous and fracture media, is used to obtain the numerical solutions. The numerical simulation reveals that the significant <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuation results {{from a combination of}} various factors such as asphalt pavement of extremely low permeability, soil structures of the reclamation area, and rainfall intensity during spring tides. Numerical simulation also reveals that the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> is approximately proportional to the tidal rate. A great amplitude of the sea level fluctuation will not necessarily lead to high <b>air</b> <b>pressure,</b> if the sea level changes slowly. Coastal unsaturated zones inhale and exhale as the tidal level falls and rises.
