Living in Dallas, Texas at the time, Sisler and his son Dave followed Ichiro's progress throughout the season.

This duality produces equivalent operations in the two spaces, allowing most techniques used in ROC analysis to be readily reproduced in the cost space...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we explore}} {{the use of}} the supra-classier {{framework}} in the construction of <b>a</b> <b>classier</b> knowledge base. Previously, we introduced this framework within which labels produced by old classifiers are used to improve the generalization performance of <b>a</b> new <b>classier</b> for <b>a</b> different but related classification task (Bollacker & Ghosh, 1998). We showed empirically that a simple Hamming nearest neighbor is superior to other techniques (e. g. MLP, decision trees, Naive Bayes, Combiners) as a supra-classier. Here, we describe theoretically how the probability that the Hamming nearest neighbor supra-classier will predict the true target class approaches certainty at an exponential rate as more classifiers are reused. The scalability of the Hamming nearest neighbor with large numbers of previously created classifiers makes it a good choice as a supra-classier in the application of building a repository of domain knowledge organized as <b>a</b> <b>classier</b> knowledge base...|$|R
40|$|Principle of parsimony (Occams razor) {{is a key}} {{principle}} {{where the}} unnecessary complexity of <b>a</b> <b>classier</b> is regulated to improve the generalization performance in pattern classication. In decision tree construction, often the complexity is regu- lated by early stopping {{the growth of a}} tree at a node whenever the impurity at that node reaches below a threshold. In this paper, we generalize this heuristic and express this principle in terms of constraining the outcome of <b>a</b> <b>classier</b> instead of explicitly regularizing the model complexity in terms of the model parameters. We construct <b>a</b> <b>classier</b> using this heuristic namely, a least square kernel machine with box constraints (LSKMBC). In our approach, we consider uniform priors and obtain the loss functional for a given margin considered to be a model selection parameter. The framework not only di?ers from the existing least square kernel machines, but also it does not require Mercer condition satisability. We also discuss the relation- ship of the proposed kernel machine with several other existing kernel machines. Experimentally we validate the performance of the classier over real-life datasets, and observe that LSKMBC performs competitively, and is able to produce certain results even better than SVM. 1...|$|R

25|$|India's 2015 World Cup {{campaign}} {{began with}} a highly anticipated match against Pakistan at Adelaide. Batting first, India lost Rohit (15 from 20 balls, 2 fours) early, but a century from Kohli (107 from 126 balls, 8 fours) along with half-centuries from Raina (74 from 56 balls, 5 fours and 3 sixes) and Dhawan (73 from 76 balls, 7 fours and 1 six) looked to steer India to a big total. However, excellent death bowling by the Pakistani bowlers, with fast bowler Sohail Khan (5-55) taking a 5-wicket haul, restricted India to exactly 300/7, with India losing 5 wickets for just 27 runs. Pakistan's reply, however, had little effect. Barring captain Misbah-ul-Haq, who scored 76, the Pakistani batting crumbled against the Indian pace attack, with Shami taking 4/35, and crashed to 224 all out. India won the match by 76 runs, their biggest win against Pakistan in the World Cup by margin of runs, and as a result, once again maintained their all-win record over their arch-rivals in the World Cup. India next played South Africa at Melbourne, which was another highly anticipated match, {{in front of a}} packed crowd comprising mostly Indian supporters. Once again India batted first. Though India lost Rohit early for a duck, they recovered from the early setback thanks to a brilliant century from Dhawan (137 from 146 balls, 16 fours and 2 sixes) and <b>a</b> <b>classy</b> half-century from Rahane (79 from 60 balls, 7 fours and 3 sixes). However, the lower middle-order then crumbled due to good death bowling from the South African pace attack, with India losing 5 wickets for just 31 runs to finish their innings at 307/7. In the chase, despite losing the openers Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock early, South Africa were going steady at 108/3, with Faf du Plessis scoring a half-century. But the Indian bowlers led by Ashwin (3/41) then struck back as the Proteas lost their last 7 wickets for 69 runs to be bowled all out for 177, India winning by 130 runs. It {{was the first time that}} India defeated South Africa in the World Cup, having lost to them in 3 previous Cup encounters in 1992, 1999 and 2011 and was the heaviest defeat for South Africa in the Cricket World Cup.|$|E

40|$|Full-combination {{multi-band}} {{approach has}} been proposed in the literature and performs well for band-limited noise. But the approach fails to deliver in case of wide-band noise. To overcome this, multi-stream approaches are proposed in literature with varying degree of success.

In this paper, we propose a new entropy based combination strategy for fullcombination multi-stream approach. In this entropy based approach, a particular stream is weighted inversely proportional to the output entropy of its specic <b>classier.</b> <b>A</b> few variations of this basic approach are also suggested. It is observed that the word-error-rate (WER) achieved by the proposed combination methods is better for dierent types of noises and for their dierent signal-to-noiseratios (SNRs).
