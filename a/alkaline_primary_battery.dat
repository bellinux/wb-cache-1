40|$|Three {{mathematical}} models, two of <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> cathode discharge, {{and one of}} <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> discharge, are developed, presented, solved and {{investigated in}} this thesis. The primary aim of this work is to improve {{our understanding of the}} complex, interrelated and nonlinear processes that occur within <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> during discharge. We use perturbation techniques and Laplace transforms to analyse and simplify an existing model of <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> cathode under galvanostatic discharge. The process highlights key phenomena, and removes those phenomena that have very little effect on discharge from the model. We find that electrolyte variation within Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide (EMD) particles is negligible, but proton diffusion within EMD crystals is important. The simplification process results in a significant {{reduction in the number of}} model equations, and greatly decreases the computational overhead of the numerical simulation software. In addition, the model results based on this simplified framework compare well with available experimental data. The second model of the <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> cathode discharge simulates step potential electrochemical spectroscopy discharges, and is used to improve our understanding of the multi-reaction nature of the reduction of EMD. We find that a single-reaction framework is able to simulate multi-reaction behaviour through the use of a nonlinear ion-ion interaction term. The third model simulates the full <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> system, and accounts for the precipitation of zinc oxide within the separator (and other regions), and subsequent internal short circuit through this phase. It was found that an internal short circuit is created at the beginning of discharge, and this self-discharge may be exacerbated by discharging the cell intermittently. We find that using a thicker separator paper is a very effective way of minimising self-discharge behaviour. The equations describing the three models are solved numerically in MATLABR, using three pieces of numerical simulation software. They provide a flexible and powerful set of <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> discharge prediction tools, that leverage the simplified model framework, allowing them to be easily run on a desktop PC...|$|R

50|$|The Edison-Lalande cell was {{a type of}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>primary</b> <b>battery</b> {{developed}} by Thomas Edison from an earlier design by Felix Lalande and Georges Chaperon. It consisted of plates of copper oxide and zinc in a solution of potassium hydroxide. The cell voltage was low (about 0.75 volts) but the internal resistance was also low so these cells were capable of delivering large currents.|$|E
50|$|A battery may {{be modeled}} as a voltage source {{in series with}} a resistance. In practice, the {{internal}} resistance of a battery is dependent on its size, chemical properties, age, temperature, and the discharge current. It has an electronic component due to the resistivity of the component materials and an ionic component due to electrochemical factors such as electrolyte conductivity, ion mobility, and electrode surface area. Measurement of the internal resistance of a battery is a guide to its condition, but may not apply at other than the test conditions. Measurement with an alternating current, typically at a frequency of , may underestimate the resistance, as the frequency may be too high {{to take into account}} slower electrochemical processes. Internal resistance depends on temperature; for example, a fresh Energizer E91 AA <b>alkaline</b> <b>primary</b> <b>battery</b> drops from about 0.9 Ω at -40 °C, when the low temperature reduces ion mobility, to about 0.15 Ω at room temperature and about 0.1 Ω at 40 °C.|$|E
40|$|A {{novel model}} for the potentiostatic {{discharge}} of <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> cathodes is presented. The model is used to simulate discharges resulting from the stepped potential electrochemical spectroscopy (SPECS) of <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> cathodes cathodes, {{and the results are}} validated with experimental data. We show that a model based on a single (or mean) reaction framework can be used to simulate multi-reaction discharge behaviour and we develop a consistent functional modification to the kinetic equation of the model that allows for this to occur. The model is used to investigate the effects that the initial exchange current density, i 00, and the diffusion coefficient for protons in electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD), DH+, have on SPECS discharge. The behaviour observed is consistent with the idea that individual reduction reactions, within the multi-reaction, reduction behaviour of EMD, have distinct i 00 and DH+ values...|$|R
40|$|The two- to {{threefold}} {{reduction in}} over-al l theoretical reactant weight (and usually also volume) which results from replacing Zn by A 1 in <b>alkaline</b> <b>primary</b> <b>batteries</b> could best be preserved in practice with a 3 M KOH "self-regenerating " electrolyte in large (> 1 kw) Al-air (or [...] O,) power sources, whereas mall Al-air (or [...] O ~ or [...] AGO) reserve cells should function best with a consumable 10 M KOH solution. Special attention {{is given to}} the use of A 1 in Al-air cells with porous C or, preferably, porous Ni air cathodes. Anode polarization and current efficiency data are presented for both the self-regen-erating and the consumable lectrolytes with and without several effective corrosion inhibitors consisting of alkyldimethylbenzylammonium salts and/or Hg with or without ZnO. It is concluded that optimum battery performance would result from the use of some of these inhibitors, as well as from el imina-tion of sulfides and other corrosion accelerators, use of highly pure A 1 or specially resistant A 1 -Mg, A 1 -Zn, or A 1 -Hg alloys, effective heat removal, opera-tion at high current densities (preferably [...] ~ 10 ma/cm'), and anode-electrolyte separation during periods of inaction. In spite of the highly attract ive anode charac-teristics of A 1, all previous attempts (1 - 8) to uti l ize it in practical batter ies fai led (9 - 11) either be-cause of the format ion of passivating, resistive ox-ide layers in those electrolytes in which A 1 oxides are not readi ly soluble (1 - 6, 12) or because of high rates of corrosion in those electrolytes in which the oxide layers are dissolved, e. g., in concentrated alkal i solutions (7, 8). Nevertheless, the author was interested in the possibi l ity of using A 1 anodes under conditions where in the corrosive alkal ine electrolyte would be in contact with the metal dur-ing current drain only.

40|$|The Grace DAKASEP {{separator}} {{was originally}} {{developed as a}} wicking layer for nickel-zinc alkaline batteries. The DAKASEP is a filled non-woven separator which is flexible and heat sealable. Through modification of formulation and processing variables, products {{with a variety of}} properties can be produced. Variations of DAKASEP were tested in Ni-H 2, Ni-Zn, Ni-Cd, and <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> with good results. The properties of DAKASEP which are optimized for Hg-Zn <b>primary</b> <b>batteries</b> are shown in tabular form. This separator has high tensile strength, 12 micron average pore size, relatively low porosity at 46 - 48 percent, and consequently moderately high resistivity. Versions were produced with greater than 70 percent porosity and resistivities in 33 wt percent KOH as low as 3 ohm cm. Performance data for Hg-Zn E- 1 size cells containing DAKASEP with the properties shown in tabular form, are more reproducible than data obtained with a competitive polypropylene non-woven separator.

5000|$|Disposable, <b>primary</b> {{flexible}} <b>primary</b> <b>batteries</b> {{which are}} the equivalent of AA and AAA batteries are also of great interest with applicability in smart cards, medical patches, greeting cards, toys, and disposable devices. Advantages of <b>primary</b> <b>batteries</b> with aqueous electrolyte over lithium ion batteries include their eco friendliness and the ease of fabrication. A flexible zinc-carbon battery using single-walled carbon nanotubes as current was reported by Hiraral in 2010; later in 2013 one with conductive polymer and cheaper multiwalled carbon nanotubes was published by Mitra. Et. al. Binders were used to maintain the flexibility and integrity of electrodes, and the carbon nanotubes dramatically reduced electrode resistance. The <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> is more durable than conventional zinc-carbon under heavy load. An alkaline battery uses MnO2 as the active material along with zinc anode and KOH is used as an electrolyte here. A flexible alkaline cell offers several challenges because compared to zinc-carbon cells using weak acidic or neutral electrolytes, KOH is more basic and corrosive. Gaikwad first proposed an alkaline battery using nylon mesh [...] and more recently Wang and Mitra [...] reported an alkaline cell using. A rechargeable flexible alkaline battery has also been reported by the same group.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} galvanostatic discharge and recovery of porous, electrolytic manganese dioxide cathodes, {{similar to those found}} within <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> is presented. The phenomena associated with discharge are modeled over three distinct size scales, a cathodic (or macroscopic) scale, a porous manganese oxide particle (or microscopic) scale, and a manganese oxide crystal (or submicroscopic) scale. The physical and chemical coupling between these size scales is included in the model. In addition, the model explicitly accounts for the graphite phase within the cathode. The effects that manganese oxide particle size and proton diffusion have on cathodic discharge and the effects of intraparticle voids and microporous electrode structure are predicted using the model...|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} model, to {{that produced}} previously by the authors, for the galvanostatic discharge of <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> cathodes is presented. Laplace transform and perturbation methods are employed {{to obtain the}} leading order spatial and temporal behaviour of the porous cathode over two distinct size scales. It is shown that {{for a wide range}} of industrially relevant discharge conditions the time taken for KOH electrolyte to diffuse into a porous electrolytic manganese dioxide particle is fast compared with the cathodic discharge time and that ohmic losses within the graphite phase of the cathode can be considered to be negligible. Numerical solution of the simplified model equations is discussed and the results are validated against relevant experimental dat...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} galvanostatic discharge of a porous manganese oxide particle, {{similar to those found}} within <b>primary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> cathodes, is presented. Asymptotic techniques are employed to obtain the leading order spatial and temporal behavior of the particle. It is found that there is an initial rapid transient adjustment within the crystals forming the particle followed by a prolonged relatively uniform discharge regime which leads finally to a faster, particle-based, nonuniform discharge behavior. Analytical solutions of the model are obtained which describe the majority of the particle behaviors under a wide range of industrially relevant discharge conditions. These solutions are supplemented by simple numerical solutions where required. A comparison of the results with those obtained by a previous, more complete and accurate model is presented. The analysis shows that the particle radius, the applied discharge current, and the solid phase conductivity are the critical parameters that dictate the utilization of active material across a wide range of discharge conditions. The effect of these parameters on particle utilization is also presented. © 2005 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved...|$|R
