5|$|In 1869 reformers again left Baith Israel, and, joining with dissenters from Kahal Kodesh Beth Elohim of Williamsburg, founded Temple Israel. Though many reformers {{had left}} the congregation, several reforms in the service were {{nonetheless}} introduced: the congregation abolished most piyyutim and the Priestly Blessing, and, in 1873, introduced a confirmation ceremony for girls, led by the Reverend Dr. Tinter. The confirmation ceremonies, which had initially been held during the holiday of Sukkot, were eventually moved to the holiday of Shavuot (the holiday during which the Reform movement held these ceremonies), and continued for both boys <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> (<b>in</b> place of Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations) until the 1940s.|$|E

5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays {{in health care}} access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{different}} approaches to co-educational Scouting. Countries such as the United States have maintained separate Scouting organizations for boys <b>and</b> <b>girls.</b> <b>In</b> other countries, especially within Europe, Scouting and Guiding have merged, {{and there is a}} single organization for boys and girls, which is a member of both the WOSM and the WAGGGS. In others, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, the national Scout association has opted to admit both boys and girls, but is only a member of the WOSM, while the national Guide association has remained as a separate movement and member of the WAGGGS. In some countries like Greece, Slovenia and Spain there are separate associations of Scouts (members of WOSM) and guides (members of WAGGGS), both admitting boys and girls.|$|E
5|$|Women {{experience}} many unique {{health issues}} related to reproduction and sexuality and these are responsible for {{a third of all}} health problems experienced by women during their reproductive years (aged 15–44), of which unsafe sex is a major risk factor, especially in developing countries. Reproductive health includes {{a wide range of issues}} including the health and function of structures and systems involved in reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth and child rearing, including antenatal and perinatal care. Global women's health has a much larger focus on reproductive health than that of developed countries alone, but also infectious diseases such as malaria in pregnancy and non-communicable diseases (NCD). Many of the issues that face women <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> resource poor regions are relatively unknown in developed countries, such as female genital cutting, and further lack access to the appropriate diagnostic and clinical resources.|$|E
