25|$|Critical and {{transformative}} perspective. Citizenship {{is defined}} by being a member with rights and responsibilities. Therefore, GCED must encourage active involvement. GCED can be taught from a critical and transformative perspective, whereby students <b>are</b> <b>thinking,</b> feeling, and doing. In this approach, GCED requires students to be politically critical and personally transformative. Teachers provide social issues in a neutral and grade-appropriate way for students to understand, grapple with, and do something about.|$|E

25|$|Arriving at Oxford {{just after}} the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American {{students}} who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I {{want to be around}} Americans – people who I know <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> about our country as much as I am.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral {{disorders}} {{are difficult to}} study in animal models because {{it is difficult to}} know what animals <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> and because animal models used to assess psychopathologies are experimental preparations developed to study a condition. Can a monkey effectively communicate that he is sad or that he feels overwhelmed? Lacking the ability to use language to study behavioral disorders like depression and stress questions the validity of those studies conducted. It can be difficult to attribute human afflictions to non-human animals.|$|E
25|$|Muffy is {{a member}} of Alana's (and, later on, Bianca's) posse. Her role in the posse is to record {{important}} events (like an organizer) and tends to explain what Alana (and, later on, Bianca) say which is usually brief. She took over as Raven's foremost enemy after Bianca left. There is some speculation that she might be psychic because she knows everything that Alana and Bianca <b>are</b> <b>thinking.</b> She also has a younger sister, Buffy, who is Sydney's age, and enemy.|$|E

25|$|Violence against girls discourages {{them from}} {{attending}} school. Sexual or physical {{violence on the}} way to and from school or at home reduces girls' ability to concentrate in class. Instead of attending to the lesson, they <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> about the violence they have experienced or worrying about future violence to come. Abuse reduces girls' participation in class even further than normal and reduces their ability to complete homework. Abused girls {{are more likely to have}} low attainment, more grade repetition and a higher drop-out rate than non-abused girls.|$|E
25|$|When I had {{a meeting}} with the Council a day before the concert, they were {{absolutely}} petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not going to destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future.

25|$|Use of the fMRI {{has been}} left out of legal debates {{throughout}} its history. Use of this technology has not been allowed due to holes in the evidence supporting fMRI. First, most evidence supporting fMRIs accuracy was done in a lab under controlled circumstances with solid facts. This type of testing does not pertain to real life. Real-life scenarios can be much more complicated with many other affecting factors. It has been shown that many other factors affect BOLD other than a typical lie. There have been tests done showing that drug use alters blood flow in the brain, which drastically affects the outcome of BOLD testing. Furthermore, individuals with diseases or disorders such as schizophrenia or compulsive lying can lead to abnormal results as well. Lastly, there is an ethical question relating to fMRI scanning. This testing of BOLD has led to controversy over if fMRIs are an invasion of privacy. Being able to scan and interpret what people <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> may be thought of as immoral and the controversy still continues.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, several {{parties have}} {{expressed}} concern that Doomsday presents negativity in England's latent view of Scotland based on their history. Angus MacNeil, member of the Scottish National Party, said of the film's impact: [...] "The complimentary part is that people <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> about Scotland as we are moving more and more towards independence. But the film depicts {{a country that is}} still the plaything of London. It is decisions made in London that has led to it becoming a quarantine zone." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon joining George Washington, feature {{profiles}} on Watanabe {{were published}} by several popular newspapers, such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. The {{fact that he}} was an Asian player assuming an important role greatly increased his popularity. Half-Chinese player, Zach Chu, who competed with the Richmond Spiders men's basketball team, said, [...] "To see someone of Asian descent, and play as well as he does, it's cool for college basketball, really cool for the Asian community." [...] The George Washington athletics website received the second-most views from Japan in terms of pageviews by country, behind only the United States. On many occasions, he was congratulated on the school's campus itself. Watanabe spoke about his fame and legacy, [...] "Japanese <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> Americans are bigger and taller and more athletic. They <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> it's more difficult for Japanese to play in NCAA, but I'm playing right now, so I want to make other people come to the United States." [...] Although Asian players such as Matsui, Jeremy Lin, and Yuki Togashi had been the subject of racist comments in the past, Watanabe was yet to receive racial remarks in his first few years in the United States. Nevertheless, he stated, [...] "If they said something racist, I don't care." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite Jack Dorsey's own open {{contention}} that {{a message on}} Twitter is [...] "a short burst of inconsequential information", social networking researcher danah boyd responded to the Pear Analytics survey by arguing that what the Pear researchers labelled [...] "pointless babble" [...] is better characterized as [...] "social grooming" [...] and/or [...] "peripheral awareness" [...] (which she justifies as persons [...] "want {{to know what the}} people around them <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> and doing and feeling, even when co-presence isn't viable"). Similarly, a survey of Twitter users found that a more specific social role of passing along messages that include a hyperlink is an expectation of reciprocal linking by followers.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{written as}} a {{potential}} series finale, the episode has received highly positive reception from television critics who often cited it as the best episode of the season. It has been particularly praised for its humor and for its emotional scenes, such as one where Bart and Lisa sit in their old treehouse {{and talk about how}} difficult parenting is. During the original broadcast, [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] was watched by about 6.43 million people. Since then, it has garnered attention in the media for a segment taking place thirty years in the future in which it is implied that the city of Dearborn, Michigan is [...] "still under sharia law". Commentators have had mixed opinions on what the segment is mocking, whether it is the increasing Islamic influence in the US, specifically in [...] Dearborn, or rather those who <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> that Dearborn is under sharia law in December 2011, the time that the episode aired.|$|E

500|$|In July 2008, Jason Statham {{expressed}} interest in appearing as Daredevil in the future. Statham requested [...] "just give me the chance, I {{would love to be}} Daredevil." [...] Frank Miller commented in agreement [...] "I think he should be Daredevil too." [...] In October 2008, 20th Century Fox executive Tom Rothman said [...] "a Daredevil reboot is something we <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> very seriously about." [...] Rothman added that [...] "what it really needs is, it needs a visionary at the level that Chris Nolan was. It needs someone, it needs a director, honestly, who has a genuine vision." [...] By February 2010, 20th Century Fox and New Regency were looking to develop the reboot with News Corp., with Peter Chernin producing and David Scarpa writing the script. On March 15, 2011, it was announced that filmmaker David Slade would be directing the reboot, [...] but he later had to drop out due to other obligations. Fringe writer and producer Brad Caleb Kane was hired to pen the Slade-directed film. On September 3, 2012, Duncan died, precluding him from reprising his role as Kingpin.|$|E
500|$|The Protoss are humanoids, [...] {{with two}} {{luminous}} eyes, typically gold, green, or blue. With two fingers {{flanked by two}} opposable thumbs on each hand, two large toes on each foot (four small toes in earlier games), digitigrade legs, broad chests and shoulders with narrow waists, Protoss are very agile and physically strong. A bony crest extends back from the crown of the head, with long neural strands sprouting {{from the back of}} the head. These strands facilitate the basic psychic communal link all Protoss naturally share. Each Protoss has a different skin shade that corresponds to the tribe from which they are descended. The Protoss do not possess any visible ears (but they can hear, as when Terrans speak to them or hear what they <b>are</b> <b>thinking),</b> mouths or noses, but are able to communicate telepathically and possess strong olfactory sensitivities. Protoss do not need to eat or drink, but are shown in The Dark Templar Saga to instead absorb energy from a form of photosynthesis. The average life expectancy for a Protoss is about one thousand years. Little is known of the internal anatomy of the Protoss.|$|E
500|$|Groupon and Travelzoo offered {{discounted}} {{tickets for}} the shows in London, Manchester and Birmingham. Rene Freling from Travelzoo explained that [...] "promoters <b>are</b> <b>thinking,</b> instead of shows being 90% sold out, they'd rather have it full and promote it to a wider audience." [...] 238 tickets were sold through Groupon within minutes of the offer, and 5,000 tickets were sold for the UK shows {{by the time the}} offer expired. The move divided opinions in the music industry of the United Kingdom: festival organizer Melvin Benn said that discounted tickets work [...] "particularly well for an awful lot of concerts. It's definitely emerging. In tough economic times people will look at varying ways of pricing their tickets." [...] Independent promoter John Rostrum called it [...] "very short-term" [...] and [...] "incredibly damaging for shows because in the future when a show goes on sale people will sit back and go, 'I won't buy until the week before'". The October 30, 2011 concert in Birmingham was her first in the English Midlands since The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004. A week before the show, the venue's box office told the Leicester Mercury that the concert was [...] "probably about half-full. There's good availability".|$|E
