5|$|After {{discarding}} two drafts, Bell approached producer Frank Spotnitz for help. Spotnitz {{suggested that}} the dog could escape from a ship and go on <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> spree. In addition, Spotnitz also {{came up with the}} idea for Mulder and Berquist to develop a quasi-romance before the latter is killed at the end of the episode. Bell began to write the script on January 2, 1999, a mere three weeks before pre-production was scheduled to begin. The episode ended up being re-written right up to the start of shooting on February 2.|$|E
5|$|As it was {{the middle}} of the Chinese New Year, most of the Chinese Volunteers Corps were on leave, leaving Singapore almost defenceless against the mutiny. The British {{government}} was caught unprepared, and other mutineers went on <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> spree at Keppel Harbour and Pasir Panjang, killing 18 European and local civilians. Martial law was imposed and every available man from HMS Cadmus went ashore to join with British, Malay and Chinese Volunteer units and the small number of British regular troops forming part of the garrison. British Vice-Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram sent a radio message requesting help from any allied warships nearby.|$|E
5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between August and November 1996, Venom: The Hunger {{introduces the}} Venom symbiote's reliance on phenethylamine for survival (which requires it to eat human brains after depleting Brock's {{supply of the}} chemical) and reveals that chocolate {{is a source of}} the chemical. Brock refuses to eat human brains; the symbiote abandons him, and he is locked in an asylum under the care of the deranged Dr. Paine. Brock escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has gone on <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative source of the chemical), but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. Brock frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E

5|$|Coleman Reese, an {{accountant}} at Wayne Enterprises, deduces that Bruce is Batman {{and tries to}} go public with the information. After observing the unpredictability of the Joker, Maroni informs Commissioner Gordon of the Joker's location. The Joker sets fire to the mob's money, burning Lau alive in the process, and kills the Chechen. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills Reese. Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals in Gotham and goes to secure Reese. The Joker finds Dent in Gotham General and manipulates him into seeking revenge for Rachel's death on Gotham's corrupt systems. The Joker then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> spree based on a coin flip and targets people he holds responsible for Rachel's death, killing Wuertz and Maroni while sparing Ramirez.|$|E
5|$|Edgefield {{was known}} as a violent place, even by the {{standards}} of antebellum South Carolina, where matters of personal honor might be addressed with <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> or duel. Before Tillman Sr.'s death from typhoid fever in 1849, he had killed a man and been convicted of rioting by an Edgefield jury. One of his sons died in a duel; another was killed in a domestic dispute. A third died in the Mexican-American War; a fourth of disease aged 15. Of Benjamin Jr.'s two surviving brothers, one died of Civil War wounds after returning home, and the other, George, killed a man who accused him of cheating at gambling. Convicted of manslaughter, George continued to practice law from his jail cell during his two-year sentence, and was elected to the state senate while still incarcerated. He later served several terms in Congress.|$|E
5|$|Greb (Alex Diakun) {{shares his}} tale, of a {{television}} censor called Waylon Figgleif. Figgleif's overzealous approach to censorship leads Greb to try pushing his limits. Greb assumed {{the form of a}} small demonic baby and reveals himself to Figgleif, who breaks down and starts attempting to censor everyday life. Greb repeats this trick, and encourages Figgleif to go on <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> spree—Figgleif takes a gun, bursts onto the taping of a science-fiction show about alien abduction, and kills several actors. Greb's methods and effectiveness are dismissed until he reveals the story's epigram. Figgleif's spree was caught on camera, and broadcast by another network as a found footage special. However, Greb also notes that he too was spotted by Black during this.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Hershey won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Special for {{her role}} as Candy Morrison in <b>A</b> <b>Killing</b> in a Small Town, which was based on Candy Montgomery's {{acquittal}} for the death of Betty Gore. Montgomery had killed Gore on Friday, June 13, 1980, in Gore's Wylie, Texas, home, by hitting her 41 times with an ax. The jury determined that she did so in self-defense. In preparation for the part, Hershey had a phone conversation with Montgomery. Many of the names of the real-life principals in the case were changed for the movie. The film's alternative title was Evidence of Love, the name of a 1984 book about the case.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, {{which had been}} designed as a mortuary with morgues {{in the basement and}} ground-level incinerators, was converted into <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures.|$|E
5|$|Peter Neal, an American {{writer of}} violent horror novels, is in Italy {{to promote his}} latest work, Tenebrae. He is {{accompanied}} by his literary agent, Bullmer and his assistant, Anne. Neal is unaware that {{he has also been}} followed to Rome by his embittered ex-wife, Jane. Just before Neal arrived in Rome, Elsa, a young female shoplifter, was murdered with a razor by an unseen assailant. The murderer sends Neal a letter informing him that his books have inspired him to go on <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> spree. Neal is soon contacted by the police in the form of Detective Giermani and his female partner, Inspector Altieri.|$|E

5|$|Players are {{penalized for}} using certain vampiric {{abilities}} {{in front of}} witnesses; exposing their existence loses masquerade points, although additional masquerade points can be earned with quests and other actions. Violating the masquerade five times draws the ire of vampire hunters and loses the game. The player has humanity points, representing the vampire's humanity. Some actions cost humanity points; a low humanity score alters available dialog options to become more aggressive, and increases the chance of entering a frenzied state and embarking on <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> spree, when the vampire's blood is low. This frenzy can also be triggered by {{a large amount of}} damage. Like masquerade points, losing all humanity points ends the game, with the vampire becoming a mindless beast. Some areas, known as Elysium, prevent the use of Disciplines or weapons. Players can recruit a female ghoul, Heather, as a customizable servant who gives them blood, gifts, and money.|$|E
5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags of fake blood {{strapped}} to the performers' bodies. Animal blood gathered from slaughterhouses was poured onto the floor to simulate puddles of human blood. Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to be safer alternatives to metal weapons, they could still be dangerous: {{in one of the}} fights, Bergman sparred with an extra who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E
5|$|Appearing {{as some of}} {{the more}} notable hostages are Ken Leung as Wing, who was distracted in the bank before the heist by the bosomy woman (played by Samantha Ivers) {{standing}} behind him and talking loudly on her phone; Gerry Vichi as Howard Kurtz, an elderly hostage suffering chest pains who is quickly released by the robbers; Waris Ahluwalia as Vikram Walia, a Sikh bank clerk whose turban is removed by the cops, which is a religious sacrilege for a Sikh male; Peter Frechette as Peter Hammond, a bank employee whose attempt to hide his cell phone from Russell results in his getting beat; Amir Ali Said as Brian Robinson, an 8-year-old boy who speaks with both Russell and Frazier and who plays <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> video game; Ed Onipede Blunt as Ray Robinson, Brian's father; and Marcia Jean Kurtz, who plays an older woman who initially refuses to strip and is forced to do so by Stevie. Kurtz's character is named Miriam Douglas; Kurtz played a hostage named Miriam in Dog Day Afternoon, a bank robbery film, which unlike Inside Man, contained significant violence. Lionel Pina, who also appeared in Dog Day Afternoon as a pizza delivery man, appears in Inside Man as a policeman who delivers pizzas at the bank's front doors.|$|E

5|$|Elephants {{typically}} coexist peacefully {{with other}} herbivores, which will usually {{stay out of}} their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group. At Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> spree that {{claimed the lives of}} 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller ones like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); the latter they react less fearfully and more aggressively to. Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.|$|E
5|$|The French {{position}} {{was such that}} they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (a word that shares derivation with abattoir, or slaughterhouse) rapidly became <b>a</b> <b>killing</b> field. By about 2 pm, it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed. Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met. Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill (and thus well away from the action), was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle, and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle. It is uncertain why, after the first wave of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks. Writing in his own defense, he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk's assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.|$|E
