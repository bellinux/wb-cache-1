Wet FGDs represent a physicochemically extreme environment due to the high operating temperatures and total dissolved solids of fluids {{in the interior of}} the FGD units. Despite the potential importance of microbial activities in the performance and operation of FGD systems, the microbial communities associated with them have not been evaluated. Microbial communities associated with distinct process points of FGD systems at several coal fired electricity generation facilities were evaluated using culture-dependent and –independent approaches. Due to the high solute concentrations and temperatures in the FGD <b>absorber</b> <b>units,</b> culturable halothermophilic/tolerant bacteria were more abundant in samples collected from within the <b>absorber</b> <b>units</b> than in samples collected from the makeup waters that are used to replenish fluids inside the <b>absorber</b> <b>units.</b> Evaluation of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes recovered from scale deposits on the walls of <b>absorber</b> <b>units</b> revealed that the microbial communities associated with these deposits are primarily composed of thermophilic bacterial lineages. These findings suggest that unique microbial communities develop in FGD systems in response to physicochemical characteristics of the different process points within the systems.

50|$|The final {{development}} of the Velocette KTT, the Mk VIII KTT was introduced in 1938 at that year's Earls Court Show, {{and was the first}} motorcycle to use the now-conventional swinging-arm rear fork with a shock <b>absorber</b> <b>unit</b> (in this case, an oleo-pneumatic unit built by the Oleo Strut Co. of England). The rear suspension system was designed by Veloce development engineer Harold Willis, and was inspired by the Oleo strut landing gear on the DeHavilland Hornet he borrowed at the Midland Aero Club, while his beloved DeHavilland 'Moth' was undergoing repair. Contact with the Oleo company led to several pairs of air shocks built for Veloce in 1936, for which the factory's racing rigid-frame racers (similar to the Mark VII KTT) were adapted with a swinging-fork rear end and bolt-on subframe for the seat. The experimental first swinging-arms used an adapted steering head lug turned sideways, with the cup-and-cone bearings retained. Production Mark VIII KTTs used a more conventional bronze bush and trunnion shaft pivot for the one-piece rear fork. The first experimental swing-arm machines were raced by the factory in the 1937 season, and introduced as the Mark VIII KTT the next year, for sale to the public.|$|E

The selectivity of the amine solution decreased with the increasing number of trays and caused a substantial amount of CO 2 to be absorbed. As a result, the flow rate of the wet purified gas dropped accordingly, causing a drop in the revenue of the apparatus and the acid gas quality in the regenerator unit.

40|$|A {{recursive}} {{scheme for}} the design of scatterers acting simultaneously as emitters and absorbers, such as lasers and coherent perfect absorbers in optics, at multiple prescribed frequencies is proposed. The approach is based on the assembly of non-Hermitian emitter and <b>absorber</b> <b>units</b> into self-dual emitter-absorber trimers at different composition levels, exploiting the simple structure of the corresponding transfer matrices. In particular, lifting the restriction to parity-time-symmetric setups enables the realization of emitter and absorber action at distinct frequencies and provides flexibility in the choice of realistic parameters. We further show how the same assembled scatterers can be rearranged to produce unidirectional and bidirectional transparency at the selected frequencies. With the design procedure being generically applicable to wave scattering in single-channel settings, we demonstrate it with concrete examples of photonic multilayer setups.
