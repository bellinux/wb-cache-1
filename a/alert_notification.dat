25|$|Operations and {{maintenance}} at Kadena {{began with the}} receipt of <b>alert</b> <b>notification.</b> Both a primary aircraft and pilot and a back-up aircraft and pilot were selected. The aircraft were given thorough inspection and servicing, all systems were checked, and the cameras equipped. Pilots received a detailed route briefing {{in the early evening}} prior to the day of flight. On the morning of the flight a final briefing occurred, at which time the condition of the aircraft and its systems was reported, last-minute weather forecasts reviewed, and other relevant intelligence communicated, together with any amendments or changes in the flight plan. Two hours prior to take-off the primary pilot had a medical examination, got into his suit, and was taken to the aircraft. If any malfunctions developed on the primary aircraft, the back-up could execute the mission one hour later.|$|E

Some conclusions of interest were: (i) Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway have contributed the majority of <b>alert</b> <b>notifications</b> as notifying countries, (ii) France and Serbia have been cited more often in <b>alert</b> <b>notifications</b> as countries of origin, (iii) Italy and Spain have submitted the majority of border rejection notifications, (iv) Third Countries implicated more frequently in border rejection notifications for norovirus in bivalve molluscs were Vietnam and Tunisia, whereas in fruits and vegetables were China and Serbia, (v) “risk dispersion” from norovirus-contaminated food was narrow since, in just over half of all <b>alert</b> <b>notifications</b> and all of the border rejection notifications, only up to three countries were involved, and (vi) both raw (oysters and berries) and cooked (mussels) food products can present a health risk to consumers. The information retrieved from the RASFF database on norovirus-contaminated food could prove helpful in the planning of future norovirus risk analysis endeavors...|$|R

40|$|Since {{it is not}} {{possible}} to be at home and workplace at a single time but it is important to monitor our families and most valuable possessions at home which can be made possible with pervasive technologies.

A model is proposed in which sensor learns the activity of all persons entering in home and generates <b>alert</b> <b>notifications</b> on administrator’s mobile when a person deviates from its normal activity. If an anonymous person comes, he is tracked every time and notifications are generated when he tries to affect any device or lock. The model has the capability to categorize persons on the basis of criteria and decide the functionalities and access available to them in the smart home. It has the facility of monitoring the devices used and generates alerts when any device starts works improperly...|$|R
