Since the Wright brothers' first flight in 1903 in Kitty Hawk North Carolina, {{there has always been a}} question of how to communicate with pilots in the air.

Next came the advent of portable radios small enough to be placed in planes, which for the first time offered pilots the ability to communicate back to the ground.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has been}} mainly focused on reconfigurable mm-waveintegrated circuits for next generation wireless communication systems(namely, 5 G). One {{of the major}} approaches to making 5 G a reality isthe use of high-frequency signals in the millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequency band to facilitate access to more bandwidth. This can deliverfaster and more reliable data to more users. This dissertation contributesto making wideband, bidirectional, and scalable RFICs for high datarate point-to-point communications over large distances in mm-wavebands, particularly the E-band (71 - 76 GHz, 81 - 86 GHz). The E-bandis a licensed band in the US, with 10 GHz of bandwidth allocated tolow-cost, high-capacity, and point-to-point communication. For backhaulbase-stations or <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>communication,</b> a scalable and large-elementphased array is desired to acquire the appropriate isotropic radiatedpower and signal to noise ratio. Additionally, bidirectional operationsupporting transmit (TX) and receive (RX) in a single aperture isdesirable to minimize the area and save power. This dissertation hasfocused on new architectures for scalable, bidirectional, and widebandphased arrays using IBM' s fastest SiGe technology, 90 nm. In this dissertation, the first E-band scalable phased-array transceiveris proposed based on coupled oscillator architecture. Coupled oscillatorphased arrays {{have the advantage of}} low power and low complexity,resulting in an architecture that easily scales to the number of elementsas multiple die can be aggregated to form a larger array through localoscillator (LO) power distribution and intermediate frequency (IF) power combining. However, silicon processes introduce undesirableparasitics and manufacturing tolerances to the transistor and passivedevices. When multiple oscillators are present in a single die, theoscillators couple through the substrate. The substrate coupling introducesadditional parasitic coupling paths between oscillators; this causespulling and, consequently, amplitude and phase variation between theoscillators. In addition, the parasitics from the injection node tothe substrate deviate the ILO performance from its ideal behavior. Conventional analysis of the amplitude and phase noise typically ignoresthe effect of the silicon substrate parasitic effects. This dissertation investigated the nonlinear dynamics of an injection-lockedoscillator (ILO), where the effective circuit parameters of ILO performancewere observed. More specifically, new amplitude and phase equationsare derived that took into account the transistor' sdevice parasitics and silicon substrate' s parasiticcoupling effects, including the transistor injection node parasiticcapacitance (C_P), substrate parasitic conductive (R_sub) and dielectric (C_j) features. The derived models are comparedwith both the simulation and measurement results. The proposed 2 x 2 transceiver phased array block diagram describedin this dissertation employs 4 injection-locked oscillators (ILOs) operating at a lower frequency range (in this case, 1 / 4 of the desiredLO frequency), followed by a frequency quadrupler, to form a beamin transmit and receive modes. The bidirectional front-end is designedto operate at E-band within 3 -dB bandwidth. Since the ILO-based phaseshifting is technically challenging at millimeter-wave bands due tothe parasitics of the injection circuitry and the oscillator phasenoise trade-offs, the high-frequency limitations of the ILO phaseshifter is considered and wide locking range and a less parasiticsensitive solution for current injection using folded-cascode architectureis proposed. The proposed ILO-based phase array architecture resultin low phase noise and low channel to channel isolation supporting 6 Gb/s data rate at 256 QAM modulation. The conventional architectures of the E-band transceiver require awide tuning range, around 10 GHz, for the LO signal and wide-bandwidthIF blocks. The wide-bandwidth requirement of LO and IF frequency formm-waves increases the power consumption and complexity of the system. This dissertation proposes a novel architecture, named the “ Image-selection”E-band phased array. This new architecture makes the upper-band (81 - 86 GHz) and the lower-band (71 - 76 GHz) of the E-band spectrum imagesof each other in comparison to the LO signal, which is located atthe center frequency (78. 5 GHz). Therefore, an image rejection architectureis desired to select the wanted band while rejecting the other. Thesignificant advantage of this architecture is that it only requiresan LO with the quadrature phases within a tuning range lower than 1 GHz. This will relax the system design trade-offs to the circuitimpairments. For bidirectional operation purpose and preventing useof quadrature generation circuitry at direct intermediate frequency(IF) or radio frequency (RF) signal paths, sliding-IF weaver architecturemixers are employed with the phase inverter in the divider path toselect the upper or lower band. This architecture leads in to a flatconversion gain over the bandwidth and low amplitude and phase imbalance.

40|$|Perhaps future historians {{will only}} {{refer to this}} era as the {{information}} age, and will recognize it as a paramount milestone in mankind progress. One of the main pillars of this age {{is the ability to}} transmit and communicate information effectively and reliably, where wireless radio technology {{became one of the most}} vital enablers for such communication. A growth in radio communication demand is notably accelerating in a never-resting pace, pausing a great challenge not only on service providers but also on researches and innovators to explore out-of-the-box technologies. These challenges are mainly related to providing faster data communication over seamless, reliable and cost efficient wireless network, given the limited availability of physical radio resources, and taking into consideration the environmental impact caused by the increasing energy consumption. Traditional wireless communication is usually deployed in a cellular manner, where fixed base stations coordinate radio resources and play the role of an intermediate data handler. The concept of cellular networks and hotspots is widely adopted as the current stable scheme of wireless communication. However in many situations this fixed infrastructure could be impaired with severe damages caused by natural disasters, or could suffer congestions and traffic blockage. In addition to the fact that in the current networks any mobile-to-mobile data sessions should pass through the serving base station that might cause unnecessary energy consumption. In order to enhance the performance and reliability of future wireless networks and to reduce its environmental footprint, we explore two complementary concepts: the first is node cooperation and the second is aerial networks. With the ability of wireless nodes to cooperate lays two main possible opportunities; one is the ability of the direct delivery of information between the communicating nodes without relaying traffic through the serving base station, thus reducing energy consumption and alleviating traffic congestion. A second opportunity would be that one of the nodes helps a farther one by relaying its traffic towards the base station, thus extending network coverage and reliability. Both schemes can introduce significant energy saving and can enhance the overall availability of wireless networks in case of natural disasters. In addition to node cooperation, a complementary technology to explore is the aerial networks where base stations are airborne on aerial platforms such as airships, UAVs or blimps. Aerial networks can provide a rapidly deployable coverage for remote areas or regions afflicted by natural disasters or even to patch surge traffic demand in public events. Where node cooperation can be implemented to complement both regular terrestrial coverage and to complement aerial networks. In this research, we explore these two complementary technologies, from both an experimental approach and from an analytic approach. From the experimental perspective we shed the light on the radio channel properties that is hosting terrestrial node cooperation and <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>communication,</b> namely we utilize both simulation results and practical measurements to formulate radio propagation models for device-to-device communication and for air-to-ground links. Furthermore we investigate radio spectrum availability for node cooperation in different urban environment, by conductive extensive mobile measurement survey. Within the experimental approach, we also investigate a novel concept of temporary cognitive femtocell network as an applied solution for public safety communication networks during the aftermath of a natural disaster. While from the analytical perspective, we utilize mathematical tools from stochastic geometry to formulate novel analytical methodologies, explaining some of the most important theoretical boundaries of the achievable enhancements in network performance promised by node cooperation. We start by determining the estimated coverage and rate received by mobile users from convectional cellular networks and from aerial platforms. After that we optimize this coverage and rate ensuring that relay nodes and users can fully exploit their coverage efficiently. We continue by analytically quantifying the cellular network performance during massive infrastructure failure, where some nodes play the role of low-power relays forming multi-hop communication links to assist farther nodes outside the reach of the healthy network coverage. In addition, we lay a mathematical framework for estimating the energy saving of a mediating relay assisting a pair of wireless devices, where we derive closed-form expressions for describing the geometrical zone where relaying is energy efficient. Furthermore, we introduce a novel analytic approach in analyzing the energy consumption of aerial-backhauled wireless nodes on ground fields through the assistance of an aerial base station, the novel mathematical framework is based on Mat&# 039;ern hard-core point process. Then we shed the light on the points interacting of these point processes quantifying their main properties. Throughout this thesis we relay on verifying the analytic results and formulas against computer simulations using Monte-Carlo analysis. We also present practical numerical examples to reflect the usefulness of the presented methodologies and results in real life scenarios. Most of the work presented in this dissertation was published in-part or as a whole in highly ranked peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, book chapters, or otherwise currently undergoing a review process. These publications are highlighted and identified in the course of this thesis. Finally, we wish the reader to enjoy exploring the journey of this thesis, and hope it will add more understanding to the promising new technologies of aerial networks and node cooperation...|$|E
