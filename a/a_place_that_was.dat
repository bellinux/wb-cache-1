5|$|A {{new era of}} castle {{construction}} {{began when}} the daimyo Nobunaga built Azuchi Castle from 1576 to 1579. Earlier fortifications of the Kamakura and Muromachi periods were crude large scale structures; Azuchi, however, with rich ornamentation and a keep rising seven stories high, became the prototype for castle construction of the period. The style of Azuchi Castle marked {{a shift in the}} function of the castles from <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> merely a fortress and military garrison to a political, cultural and economic center. The newer style castles functioned as home to the daimyo, his family, and his most loyal retainers. Because of the expense of building such a lavish structure, castles in the style of Azuchi, functioned also to highlight the power and prestige of the daimyo. These new castles were built of wood and plaster on a stone foundation. Generally the main keep or tenshu was positioned at the highest point, surrounded by a series of interlocking baileys with walls, small towers and pathways. Residential buildings were located in one of the outer circles. The daimyo conducted his business in the citadel.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} {{the area around the}} circle was mostly rural, with the circle being named after Somerville because it was the nearest largest town. In its early days, the area {{included}} the Raritan Valley Inn, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> frequented by Irving Berlin. The home of New Jersey Senator Joseph Sherman Frelinghuysen, Sr. was also located by the circle. Frelinghuysen had supported the construction of the circle, but moved away years later because of noise from the traffic.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} ancient Malaka is unknown, but its {{location}} {{on a hill}} {{at the foot of}} Mount Gibralfaro suggests it was a more dense and irregular urban cluster than neighbouring Cerro del Villar, that is, Mainake. Traces of ancient landings there, as of a port, correspond with the description in the Periplous. The ruins mentioned by Strabo were still visible in the 1st century BC, and could only belong to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> already vacated in the Roman period, as occurred in Cerro del Villar but not in Malaka. The Phoenician city at Cerro del Villar lay in ruins {{at the beginning of the}} 6th century BC, when it was apparently resettled by the Phocaean Greeks.|$|E
40|$|Editorial for JournalA {{peculiar}} {{and persistent}} feeling of enervation accompanies and describes a certain, rapidly predominating place; <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> end; the very end; {{the end of}} hope; the termination of difference; the triumph of fear; the automatic capitulation of one’s own and others’ being; but most depressingly of all, it is <b>a</b> dreadful <b>place,</b> {{because it is an}} end without end. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> almost featureless; <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> almost empty, and yet claustrophobic; <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> reductive, isolated, and inescapable; <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> determined to forge everything fated to be caught within its limiting space, into its own precisely narrow identity of sparse functionalism. This place is what education, particularly state education, since state schooling led the way, has become. And unsurprisingly, perhaps even predictably, with little or no resistance, this is what educational research has developed into; predominantly, as the state’s supporting mechanism. But worse: for some time, and quite desperate not to see its own shame, this has become, overwhelmingly, the uncritical, blind concern, the stark, empty, dismal future, of educational research...|$|R

25|$|Ainsworth's {{father died}} on 20 June 1824 and Ainsworth became {{a senior in}} the law firm and {{began to focus on}} his legal studies. To this end he left for London at the end of 1824 to study under Jacob Phillips, a {{barrister}} at King's Bench Walk. Ainsworth lived at Devereux Court, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> favoured by Augustine writers. During his stay, he visited Lamb, but felt let down by the real Lamb. Ainsworth attended Lamb's circle, and met many individuals including Henry Crabb Robinson and Mary Shelley. During the summer of 1825, Ainsworth returned on a trip to Manchester in order to meet Crossley before travelling to the Isle of Man. He continued to write, and a collection of his poems called The Works of Cheviot Tichburn, with the types of John Leigh was published. He also had two works published in The Literary Souvenir, a magazine published by John Ebers.|$|E

[...] When the war began, the area was part of the frontier between the British province of New York and the French province of Canada, and the British had stopped French advances further south in the 1755 Battle of Lake George. [...] However, the fort was constructed in a difficult location: in order to build on rock, the French had sited it relatively far from the lake, while it was still below nearby hilltops.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the loss}} limited Monk as a performer, he {{recorded}} several albums of original music and received much {{attention from the}} press, which led Colomby to argue to the SLA that he was [...] "a drug-free, law-abiding citizen, whose productivity and growing popularity as a recording artist demonstrates his standing as a responsible working musician". In May 1957, the SLA said Monk needed to get a club owner to hire him first, so Colomby considered the Five Spot Café: [...] "I wanted to find <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> small. I once drove past this place in the Village {{and there was a}} bar and I heard music ... A place where poets hung out." [...] Joe Termini, who co-owned the venue with his brother Iggy, testified at Monk's police hearing, which resulted in his card being reinstated.|$|E
500|$|There is a sharp {{contrast}} between Fink's living quarters and the polished, pristine environs of Hollywood, especially the home of Jack Lipnick. The spooky, inexplicably empty feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the Coens' conception of the movie. [...] "We wanted an art deco stylization", Joel explained in a 1991 interview, [...] "and <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> falling into ruin after having seen better days". Barton's room is sparsely furnished with two large windows facing another building. The Coens later described the hotel as a [...] "ghost ship floating adrift, where you notice signs {{of the presence of}} other passengers, without ever laying eyes on any". In the movie, residents' shoes are an indication of this unseen presence; another rare sign of other inhabitants is the sound from adjacent rooms. Joel said: [...] "You can imagine it peopled by failed commercial travelers, with pathetic sex lives, who cry alone in their rooms".|$|E
500|$|However, as {{the start}} of the 20th century came, industry's {{pervasive}} reach, increased railroad soot, and an encroaching vice district, caused the area to become less desirable, and the social elite vacated the region for quieter neighborhoods such as Kenwood, the Gold Coast and more commonly the suburban North Shore. [...] The Chicago Tribune highlighted 1898 Prairie Avenue as <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> undesirable to those for whom it was affordable, and unaffordable to those for whom it was desirable. [...] Light industry and vacant lots overtook Prairie Avenue {{during the second half of}} the 20th century. The elegant mansions were mostly torn down or fell into extreme disrepair. [...] By the 1970s, most of the residential buildings had been replaced by factories and parking lots. [...] Starting in the late 1990s, the downtown housing market flourished in Chicago and the resulting boom that has transformed many neighborhoods revived Prairie Avenue, causing most of the factories to be demolished or converted to loft condominiums. [...] The factories have been replaced by condominium projects and most of the remaining mansions have been renovated.|$|E

2500|$|Under the Ottomans Urfa {{was part}} (Sanjak) of the Aleppo Vilayet. The area became a centre of trade in cotton, leather, and jewellery. There {{was a small}} but ancient Jewish {{community}} in Urfa, {{with a population of}} about 1,000 by the 19th century. Most of the Jews emigrated in 1896, fleeing the Hamidian massacres, and settling mainly in Aleppo, Tiberias and Jerusalem. There were three Christian communities: Syriac, Armenian, and Latin. According to Lord Kinross, 8,000 Armenians were massacred in Urfa in 1895.

The Gemara asked then what the word [...] "fruit" [...] meant in the context of the murder victim, for if one interpreted it to mean [...] "children," [...] then according to that argument, the ceremony would not apply if the murder victim had been old or castrated.
