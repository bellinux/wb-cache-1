5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} {{are very well}} suited to <b>agriculture</b> and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and <b>agriculture</b> comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most <b>agriculture</b> is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant <b>agriculture</b> for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E

5|$|Having {{between a}} fifth or sixth of the arable or good {{pastoral}} land and {{roughly the same}} amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral <b>agriculture</b> and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in <b>agriculture.</b> Most farms were based around a family unit and used an infield and outfield system. Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and <b>agriculture</b> entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.|$|E
