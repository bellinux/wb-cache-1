2500|$|In April 2003, Case {{was voted}} the [...] "Sexiest Babe of Indie Rock" [...] in a Playboy.com {{internet}} poll, receiving 32% of the vote. Playboy {{asked her to}} pose nude for the magazine, but she declined their offer. She told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I didn't {{want to be the}} girl who posed in Playboy and then—by the way—made some music. I would be really fucking irritated if after a show somebody came up to me <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> some naked picture of myself and wanted me to sign it instead of my CD." [...] In later interviews, she declined to discuss the survey at all.|$|E

60|$|She came {{straight}} towards me, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> {{a piece of}} paper; then, without another word, slid {{back to the door}} and slipped out.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you would}} marry, would you?" [...] she said, {{as one who}} speaks to herself; then thought awhile, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> back the sword.|$|E
60|$|Buck {{reaches in}} his pocket <b>and</b> <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> a key. I knew what he meant before he spoke. Confounded old buccaneer--I knew what he meant. They don't make them any better than Buck.|$|R

If the wind keeps as it is, we shall be back {{at the mouth of the}} York in three or four hours. You may as well open that basket again <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> that cold chicken and a piece of bread; cut the meat off the bones and put it on the bread, for I have only one <b>hand</b> disengaged, <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> that bottle of cold tea.

6000|$|... "Mr. Manners's man, sir," [...] {{he added}} significantly, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a little note. I seized it, and, {{to hide my}} emotion, told him to give the man his beer.|$|E

60|$|A {{hospital}} nurse {{laid a hand}} that was not particularly soft upon my brow that {{was not at all}} fevered. A young doctor came along, grinned, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a morning newspaper.|$|E
60|$|Thereupon {{the officer}} bade me sit down, {{and began to}} help me, and join in the meal. ‘I fill your ladyship’s glass,’ said he, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a tumbler of neat rum.|$|E

60|$|The {{time soon}} came,--the morning of Waterloo. But why {{describe}} that momentous battle, {{on which the}} fate of the entire world was hanging?
