25|$|Initial roads, {{such as the}} Great South Road southwards from Auckland, {{were often}} built by the British Army to move troops, and were {{constructed}} to a comparatively high standard. Early sheep farming required few high-standard roads, but the strong increase in dairy farming in the late 19th century created a strong demand for better links on which the more perishable goods could be transported to market or towards ports for export. In many cases, later roads for motor vehicles follow paths used by bullock carts which followed tracks made for humans. These in turn in some cases became highways – with attendant problems <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>New</b> Zealand (but especially in the more mountainous regions), as the geography and contours of a slow-speed road {{laid out in the}} first half of the 20th century usually do not conform to safety and comfort criteria of modern motor vehicles.|$|E
500|$|Military {{tensions}} {{began to}} rise in the British colonies of North America in 1774 when a series of legislative acts by the British Parliament known as the Intolerable Acts began to be implemented in the colonies. [...] The colonies, in solidarity with the Province of Massachusetts Bay, which had been singled out for punishment by those acts {{in the wake of}} the Boston Tea Party, had organized a Congress to meet in September 1774. [...] During the meeting of the First Continental Congress word arrived of a militia uprising in Massachusetts that became known as the Powder Alarm. [...] In early September, General Thomas Gage, the royal governor of Massachusetts, had removed gunpowder from a powder magazine in Charlestown (in a location now in Somerville), and militia from <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>New</b> England had flocked to the area in response to false rumors that violence had been involved. [...] One consequence of this action was that the Congress called for the colonies to organize militia companies for their defense. [...] Another was that Lord Dartmouth, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, advised the colonial governors to secure their military supplies, and prohibited importation of further supplies of powder.|$|E
