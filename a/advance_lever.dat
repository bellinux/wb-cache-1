2500|$|The {{ignition}} system {{was similar to}} that of the Model T,with a flywheel-mounted low-tension magneto and trembler coils. The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the spark <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> mounted near the steering column, which rotated the timer. The cooling was by thermosiphon. (In later decades, a high-tension magneto and a water pump would be added.) The transmission was a three-speed spur gear (the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 to 6mph). A worm drive reduction set and a differential made up the rear. The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service. Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons, as high-ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only, from the worm element to the gear element, because of the high power loss through friction. To stop the tractor, the driver depressed the clutch.|$|E

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2014, the Heising-Simons and McKnight Foundations {{provided}} support for a National Research Summit on the Early Care and Education of Dual Language Learners (DLLs) in Washington, DC. The goal of the two day summit was to engage and extend the established knowledge base accrued by the Center for Early Care and Educational Research Dual Language Learners (CECER-DLL), while simultaneously informing the future potential efforts by the Heising-Simons and McKnight Foundations specific to the early care and education of dual language learners. Day two centered on the presentation of five McKnight-commissioned papers, the topics of which included: Research Based Models and Best Practices for DLLs across PreK - 3 rd grade Perspectives on Assessment of DLLs Development & Learning, PreK - 3 Human Resource Development and Support for Those Serving DLLs The Critical Role of Leaderships in Programs Designed for DLLs, PreK - 3 Policy <b>Advances</b> & <b>Levers</b> Related to DLLs in PreK - 3 rd grade The report attempts to provide a short summary and synthesis of the topics covered in these papers and the discussion generated at the National Summit on Early Care and Education of Dual Language Learners. In addition, a set of recommendations are presented for each topic {{with regard to the}} implications drawn from these synthesis and of particular relevance to the supporting foundations' future investment considerations related to DLLs...|$|R

2500|$|The {{crew were}} trying to manage the {{situation}} they were facing. The Captain then asked the First Officer {{if one of the}} ground crews had tampered with the panel near the plane's rear door, and subsequently stated that [...] "the guy" [...] had problems and was pissed at them. The flight continued to Lagos and the crew continued to discuss the problem they were facing. They noticed that there were differences on the EPR value on the engines. The crew also noticed that there was no response from the left engine when they <b>advanced</b> the throttle <b>lever,</b> thus concluded that the left engine was inoperative. The crew decided to start their descent towards Lagos. As a failure on the left engine occurred, the crew should have looked at their Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and followed procedures accordingly, but failed to do so.|$|R
5000|$|Afterwards, {{the pilot}} of UA001 radioed the tower saying [...] "Air Canada flew {{directly}} over us" [...] and the air traffic controller responded [...] "Yeah, I saw that guys." [...] During the first approach, AC759 flew for 1/4 mi over Taxiway C, descended to an altitude as low as 81 ft and approached as close as 29 ft laterally to the four planes waiting on Taxiway C before being ordered to abort the landing. According to the flight data recorder, the pilots <b>advanced</b> the thrust <b>levers</b> when AC759 was 85 ft above {{the ground and the}} minimum altitude was 59 ft, approximately 2.5 seconds after the thrust <b>levers</b> had been <b>advanced.</b> Following a reconstruction of events, one pilot not involved in the incident noted that had AC759 waited five more seconds before pulling up, it would have collided with the third plane (UAL 863) on the taxiway.|$|R

50|$|The Tenax was {{modified}} in 1953 with a fixed viewfinder integrated {{in a higher}} top plate with the exposure counter inside it, and a revised <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> Soon after it was renamed Taxona, because the East German company had lost the rights to use the traditional Zeiss Ikon names, property of the Western Zeiss Ikon company. At the same time, the Novar name became Novonar. The tip of the <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> became black in 1954. Production ended in 1959.|$|E

40|$|Introduction A. General The {{heart of}} many {{commercial}} catalytic processes involves chemistry on transition metal particles and surfaces. The success in designing active surface ensembles, promoters, and selective poisons is inevitably tied {{to our knowledge}} of the fundamental principles which control transition metal surface chemistry. One extreme would be the rigorous description and energetic predictions for each elementary reaction step of an entire catalytic cycle from first-principle theoretical methods. While desirable, this has to date been an unattainable goal due to the limitations in both raw computer (CPU) requirements and the accuracy of the available computational methods. Recent advances in both quantum-chemical methods and computational resources, however, are driving this goal closer to reality. Theoretical treatments of adsorbate-surface interactions have rapidly advanced to the stage where detailed understandings of the governing structural and electronic features are readily available. In many cases, reliable quantitative predictions of the structure and energetics can also be made. While an exhaustive review of all theoretical treatments of adsorbate surface interactions and catalytic reactivity would be of great value, the tremendous volume published in this area makes this a difficult goal. Instead, we highlight a set of essential theoretical concepts which govern important aspects of surface reactivity and describe how they dictate both activity and selectivity. We specifically target the catalytic chemist and reaction engineer, with the hope that these concepts will lead to a more <b>advanced</b> set of <b>levers</b> to aid and facilitate the design of new and improved catalyst formulations and optimal operating conditions...|$|R
5000|$|On January 7, 1994, United Express Flight 6291 was a BAe Jetstream 41 being {{operated}} by Atlantic Coast Airlines; {{it was on}} approach to runway 28L when it entered into a stall at 430 ft above runway level. The aircraft collided with a stand of trees and came to rest inside a commercial building 1.2 mi short of the runway and burst into flames. The accident killed two of three crewmembers and five of nine passengers. The probable cause was attributed to [...] "(1) An aerodynamic stall that occurred when the flight crew allowed the airspeed to decay to stall speed following a very poorly planned and executed approach characterized by an absence of procedural discipline; (2) Improper pilot response to the stall warning, including failure to <b>advance</b> the power <b>levers</b> to maximum, and inappropriately raising the flaps; (3) Flight crew experience in 'glass cockpit' automated aircraft, aircraft type and in seat position, a situation exacerbated by a side letter of agreement between {{the company and its}} pilots; and (4) the company's failure to provide adequate stabilized approach criteria, and the FAA's failure to require such criteria.Member Vogt concluded that the last factor was contributory but not causal to the accident. Additionally, for the following two factors, Chairman Hall and Member Lauber concluded that they were causal to the accident, while Members Vogt and Hammerschmidt concluded they were contributory to the accident:(5) The company's failure to provide adequate crew resource management training, and the FAA's failure to require such training; and (6) the unavailability of suitable training simulators that precluded fully effective flight crew training." ...|$|R
5000|$|FED 2e is a FED 3b {{with the}} FED 2d shutter {{that does not}} have the slow speeds. Similar to the 3b, it does not have strap lugs but has a film <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> Production ended around 1970.|$|E
5000|$|The Neoca 2S is a 35mm {{rangefinder}} camera made in Japan in 1955 and 1956. It has a dual-stroke <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> and {{a central}} shutter; neither feature is typical {{for this kind}} of camera. The lens is a Neokor anastigmat f=45mm/3.5.|$|E
50|$|The Exakta 66 {{is based}} on the Pentacon Six but was made in West Germany by Exakta GmbH, Nuremberg. The body is rubber coated, the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> moves through a shorter angle, and it has a TTL-metered prism coupled to new Schneider lenses.|$|E
50|$|The OM-1n {{is similar}} to the OM-1MD, with a {{redesigned}} film <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> a flash ready/sufficient flash LED in the viewfinder, and automatic flash synchronization (X-sync), regardless of the position of the FP/X switch when used with a T-series flash unit mounted on Flash Shoe 4.|$|E
50|$|The Nikon F-301 {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first Nikon SLR sold that lacked a film <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> As a result the {{selector}} knob, also used to lock the shutter button, has a continuous option {{in addition to the}} single shot. It was also the first Nikon SLR to feature DX film decoding.|$|E
5000|$|The camera {{offers the}} {{convenience}} of image composition with wide open aperture. The aperture is stopped down to the selected value after the shutter is released. After exposure the mirror stays up until the bottom-mounted single-stroke film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> is again wound. Focusing is via a ground glass screen with a central split-image rangefinder.|$|E
5000|$|This {{redesign}} {{made a new}} {{camera case}} design necessary, leaving additional space for the frame counter, and the frame reset slider. The Retina Reflex cases were already something special before since the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> (Reflex) and aperture/shutter setting wheel (Reflex S) are located on the bottom. The photo shows just how complex the Retina case had become.|$|E
50|$|It has {{the typical}} big finder of the Optima series, {{but on this}} special model it is {{combined}} with a superimposed coupled rangefinder. Shutter speed is controlled electronically by a CdS meter, with speeds from 15 sec. to 1/1000 sec. A special feature of the series is the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> which can be switched to also rewind the film at its end.|$|E
5000|$|The camera's {{top plate}} has the {{manually}} set frame counter, the shutter release, the {{film rewind knob}} with film reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the film (advance) release button, the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the tripod socket, the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> the back release latch, and the film rewind release button.|$|E
50|$|The Zorki 4, 1956, was a Zorki 3S with {{self-timer}} added. The Zorki 4K {{was identical}} but used an <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> {{instead of the}} old-style wind knob. With over 2 million units produced, the Zorki 4 was the most successful Zorki and {{has a reputation as}} one of the best Russian cameras, although the self-timer and slow shutter speeds were unreliable. The Zorki Mir of 1959 was a lower-cost Zorki 4 with fewer shutter speeds.|$|E
50|$|Leica IIIf and its {{predecessors}} {{had used a}} knob to advance the film. For fear of tearing the film, early M3s had a double stroke <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> like the Neoca 2s would. Later models (from model no 915 251) had single-stroke levers, which quickened up operation of the camera. Another type of variation is in the film pressure plate used. Early models used a glass plate to keep the film flat; later models used a metal plate.|$|E

Construction of the body is all-metal, including the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> at the bottom. The lens mounting plate is rectangular ...|$|E
50|$|A {{characteristic}} {{model was}} the Diax Ia for interchangeable lenses, with 3 different viewfinders in the top, each {{in a different}} color: blue for 35mm lenses, yellow for 85 or 90mm lenses and neutral for 45 or 50 mm lenses. The Diax II, Diax IIa and Diaxette models were rangefinder cameras. The b models were like the a models, but with a rapid film <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> The Diax system also included 10 lens types covering 6 focal lengths with a common filter thread size of 40.5mm.|$|E
5000|$|The M2 was {{considered}} to be a more affordable, simplified version of the 1954 Leica M3. Notably, the frame counter of the M2 was composed of a disk plate beneath the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> that had to be manually reset to zero after reloading. This system was close to that of the Leica III series, and unlike that of the M3, which is an independent frame counter, visible through a window in the top plate, that automatically resets to zero when the film take-up spool is removed.|$|E
50|$|The Leica MP is Leica's {{latest film}} {{rangefinder}} camera. Unlike the preceding Leica M7, the camera has adopted many retro design features {{from the earlier}} M3. These include a M3 type metal film <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> knob film rewind design and M3 type frameline adjust lever. The basic classic design remains unchanged and the design for loading film from the bottom has been retained. The camera comes in various camera finishes including black chrome, black paint and silver chrome and can be further customised with Leica AG's à la carte program.|$|E
50|$|The Leicaflex SL Mot was {{a variant}} of the Leicaflex SL that could take a motor drive, and lacked the {{self-timer}} and the meter switch in the <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> The SL Mot was mostly produced in black enamel and later black chrome, but chrome examples do exist. The motor drive was as large as the camera body itself, marked LEICAFLEX MOTOR, and was probably only made in black. 980 serial numbers were allotted to the Leicaflex SL Mot. It seems that some were used by the NASA and have NASA engravings.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, the FTb {{design was}} revised slightly. The camera {{was given a}} plastic tipped film <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> The stop down lever was changed to the same style as that found on the F-1. The PC sync socket was given a {{spring-loaded}} plastic cover. The ring around {{the outer edge of}} the shutter speed dial was changed from a scalloped design to a diamond textured design. Finally, a shutter speed display was added in the lower left hand corner of the viewfinder. This model was unofficially known as FTb-N or FTbn.|$|E
50|$|Much work {{went into}} human factors {{engineering}} {{to create an}} ergonomic user interface for the camera. The form of previous cameras was largely dictated by the required locations of mechanical controls on the body, such as the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> rewind crank, shutter speed dial, shutter release, etc. On the T90, the film transport control is no longer required, while the others are no longer mechanically linked. This gave the designers more freedom to shape the camera {{to make it easier}} to control and hold, and to place controls in a way that suited the user rather than a mechanical design.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Leicaflex {{is readily}} identifiable from its CdS meter window and battery cover {{on the front}} of the prism housing just above the lens. It was offered in chrome and black enamel finishes, the latter being rare. The first series had a fan-shaped exposure counter window and a tripod socket attached by three screws, whereas the second series had a round exposure counter window, a tripod socket integrated in the bottom plate and a meter switch built in the <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> In use, the two series are virtually identical. 32,500 serial numbers were allotted to the original Leicaflex.|$|E
