50|$|DXA is {{currently}} the most widely used, but quantitative ultrasound (QUS) {{has been described as}} a more cost-effective approach to measure bone density. The DXA test works by measuring a specific bone or bones, usually the spine, hip, and wrist.

The resulting comparison is used to determine risk for fractures and the stage of osteoporosis (if any) in an individual.|$|E

These changes in index and dispersion can sometimes be enough to affect the lens focus location and imaging performance in highly corrected systems.|$|E
