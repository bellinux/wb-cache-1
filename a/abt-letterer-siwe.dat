40|$|The proliferating {{skin cells}} {{in a case}} of acute disseminated histiocytosis-X (<b>Abt-Letterer-Siwe</b> disease) {{confirmed}} by electron microscopy, were characterized by a panel of monoclonal antibodies using an immunoperoxidase technique. The "histiocytes" were found to stain with OKT- 6 (anti-T 6) and anti-HLA-DR antibodies. Unexpectedly, slight staining was also observed with Leu 3 a (anti-T 4) and OKM- 1. A proliferative process of T 4, T 6, HLA-DR, OKM- 1 positive Langerhans' cells has not yet been described and may be specific for histiocytosis-...|$|E
30|$|Langerhans-cell {{histiocytosis}} is a {{rare disease}} involving clonal proliferation of Langerhans cells [1, 2]. It {{is part of a}} group of clinical syndromes called histiocytoses, which are characterized by an abnormal proliferation of histiocytes (an archaic term for activated dendritic cells and macrophages). These diseases are related to other forms of abnormal proliferation of white blood cells, such as leukemias and lymphomas. The disease, previously known as histiocytosis X, was renamed in 1985 by the Histiocyte Society as Langerhans-cell histiocytosis because of the proliferation of Langerhans-cells. The spectrum includes localized-to-bone eosinophilic granuloma, and the rare multisystem syndromes Hand–Schüller–Christian disease and <b>Abt–Letterer–Siwe</b> disease; the manifestations range from isolated bone lesions to multisystem disease [1, 2].|$|E
30|$|Eosinophilic {{granuloma}} (EG) is {{a benign}} disease related {{to any of}} the three forms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). Depending upon the number of lesions and lesion distribution, LCH comprises the following groups: unifocal LCH (also called EG), multifocal unisystem and multifocal multisystem. The combination of diabetes insipidus, lytic bone lesions and exophtalmus is known as Hand-Schüller-Christian triad, whereas the multifocal multisystem LCH is also called <b>Abt-Letterer-Siwe</b> disease (with typical abdominal involvement and poor prognosis) [19]. LCH is caused by clonal proliferation of activated dendritic cells and macrophages [20]. Any bone can be affected, such as the skull, mandible, ribs and long bones, as well as any organ system (lung, skin, spleen, lymph nodes, central nervous system). Therefore, cross-sectional whole-body imaging is essential for the initial work-up of patients with active disease and for post-therapeutic follow-up purposes.|$|E
