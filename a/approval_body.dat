Using unusual approaches to drug discovery can fast-track the production of new antimicrobials, {{as is the case}} with drug repurposing. There is a strong need for antimicrobial agents that bacteria can’t develop resistance to and the best way to address this is by developing drugs that do not create a strong selection for resistance. Antivirulence drugs are ideal in this respect as they do not target essential biological processes. It is naïve, however, to assume that bacteria will never develop resistance to any of the antibiotics they are presented with. Careful control over the use of antibiotics should be employed to prevent the development and spread of resistance if we are to avoid the upcoming antibiotic apocalypse...|$|R

These biomaterials may {{be classified as}} medical devices, and as such must undergo rigorous testing before they are implanted in humans. A large part of this testing involves in vitro trials and biomechanical testing. However, in order {{to bridge the gap}} between the lab and the clinic, in vivo preclinical trials are required, and usually demanded by regulatory <b>approval</b> <b>bodies.</b> This review examines the in vivo models in current use for cartilage defect repair testing and the relevance of each in the context of generated results and applicability to bringing the device to clinical practice. Some of the preclinical models currently used include murine, leporine, ovine, caprine, porcine, canine, and equine models. Each of these has advantages and disadvantages in terms of animal husbandry, cartilage thickness, joint biomechanics and ethical and licencing issues. This review will examine the strengths and weaknesses of the various animal models currently in use in preclinical studies of cartilage repair.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to improve understanding of Porcupine caribou herd distribution, movements, and habitat preferences {{to assist with}} developing a regional land use plan for the North Yukon Planning Region, Yukon Territory. Three different methods were used to identify current and historical patterns of caribou distribution and habitat preferences within the region to prioritize conservation areas. Two of the approaches focused on incorporating information on caribou distribution and migrations from scientific and local knowledge, while the third focused on identifying and mapping habitats suitable for supporting caribou. Local knowledge {{dating back to the}} 1930 s and two decades of satellite telemetry data confirmed that most of the planning region is used by the Porcupine caribou herd and highlighted areas of concentrated use.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{vulnerabilities}} occur because pro-tocol implementations failed to anticipate illegal pack-ets. rfcs typically define what constitute “right ” pack-ets relevant to the protocol and they specify what the response should be for such packets. They are often ambiguous and remain silent on what the protocol im-plementation should do for packets which deviate from the specification. Implementers must and, by and large, do faithfully implement an rfc. However, implementers usually take any silence in a specification as “design freedom”. Even though the protocol implementers are network specialists, they often are not knowledgeable in net-work security and cryptography issues, past exploits and common attack techniques that can impact the se-curity of a protocol module, and consequently, the whole system. This paper systematically discusses vulnerabilities that {{can be attributed to}} protocol designs, inadequacies of rfcs, and omissions of the protocol implementers. Using specific examples, we point out how ambiguities in protocol rfcs have lead to security vulnerabilities. We correlate various types of security vulnerabilities with the way the rfcs are written. We make a case for such exploit-robust and attack-aware rfcs, and recom-mend the features for a better rfc, called erfc (En-hanced rfc). We offer advice to rfc writers, imple-menters and rfc <b>approval</b> <b>bodies.</b> The most effective solution to reducing network security incidents is to fix the rfcs {{in such a way that}} the implementers are forced to write an exploit-robust implementation, irrespective of their security knowledge and expertise. ...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the failure}} of PROWESS-SHOCK to {{demonstrate}} efficacy, Eli Lilly and Company withdrew drotrecogin alfa (activated) from the worldwide market. Drotrecogin was initially approved after the original trial, PROWESS, was stopped early for overwhelming efficacy. These events prompt consideration of both the initial approval decision and the later decision to withdraw. It is regrettable that the initial decision was made largely on a single trial that was stopped early. However, the decision to approve was {{within the bounds of}} normal regulatory practice and was made by many <b>approval</b> <b>bodies</b> around the world. Furthermore, the overall withdrawal rate of approved drugs remains very low. The decision to withdraw was a voluntary decision by Eli Lilly and Company and likely reflected key business considerations. Drotrecogin does have important biologic effects, and it is probable that {{we do not know how}} best to select patients who would benefit. Overall, there may still be a small advantage to drotrecogin alfa, even used non-selectively, but the costs of determining such an effect with adequate certainty are likely prohibitive, and the point is now moot. In the future, we should consider ways to make clinical trials easier and quicker so that more information can be available in a timely manner when considering regulatory approval.

Data on palliative care provided by care homes is reported to the Care Quality Commission, but {{the quality of care}} is often locally determined. There is ongoing research in this area aimed at collecting representative, internationally comparable data, such as the PACE study. Aims: To discuss the challenges encountered in engaging and recruiting care homes across England in the PACE study, a retrospective, cross sectional survey of deaths over three months. The study collected questionnaire data from care home staff, general practitioners and relatives of care home residents on their experiences of palliative care. It aimed to include 200 deceased residents in fifty care homes over a one-year period. Methods: The research team reviewed the barriers and challenges encountered throughout the research process, including developing a representative sampling framework, obtaining ethical approvals, advertising the study and recruiting care homes. Results: There is a lack of clarity regarding where care homes are located within the scope of ethical <b>approval</b> <b>bodies.</b> Recruitment through random sampling was found to be less effective compared to recruitment through ENRICH networks. Barriers to care home participation included concerns regarding sharing information, fear of opening up to potential criticism, lack of resources and misunderstandings regarding confidentiality.
