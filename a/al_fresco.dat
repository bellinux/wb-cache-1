5|$|The house {{seems to}} have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it. About the year 1730, Mr. Jonathan Tyers became the {{occupier}} of it, and, there being a large garden belonging to it, planted with a great number of stately trees, and laid out in shady walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being converted into a tavern, or place of entertainment, was much frequented by the votaries of pleasure. Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement of a Ridotto <b>al</b> <b>Fresco,</b> a term which {{the people of this country}} had till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated in the course of the summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them. This encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver tickets at one guinea each for admission, and receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ in the orchestra, and, in a conspicuous part of the garden, erected a fine statue of Mr. Handel.|$|E

30|$|In an OpenFlow controller, many user {{applications}} or modules are {{executed in}} parallel, and a malicious application can disrupt network operation. Porras et al. [16] proposed FortNOX, an extension to the NOX controller that controls which commands are allowed for each application, {{based on a}} role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism. To allow users {{to create their own}} security modules and policies, Shin et <b>al.</b> [17] proposed <b>FRESCO,</b> an extension of FortNOX. FRESCO is a framework for development and execution of user-defined security modules. The main difference between FortNOX/FRESCO and FlowVisor is that the former acts inside a single controller and FlowVisor concerns isolation among multiple controllers. Inside a controller, many applications may want to access the same resource, thus justifying the use of the RBAC mechanism. FlowVisor provides network virtualization by providing every controller a slice, and no controller should be able to access another controller’s slice. Thus, by extending FlowVisor’s flowspace, the proposed Action Slicing mechanism can be deployed easily and with minimum overhead.|$|R

25|$|The cathedral {{was built}} by Cortés to double as a fortress, with cannons mounted above the buttresses. Over time, this church {{underwent}} a number of transformations, updating its interior. This was undone in the mid-20th century, when restoration work removed all the Neoclassical altars and images. These now are stored in the cathedral's pinacotheca and not available to the public. Restoration work uncovered <b>al</b> <b>fresco</b> murals on the lateral walls, relating to the martyrdom of Philip of Jesus, the first Mexican canonized as a saint.

25|$|Some of the {{reported}} cases may be myths, or wandering stories. The 1326 Hennegau case, for example, deviates from the others in that the Jew was not a thief, but was suspected (even {{though he was a}} convert to Christianity) of having struck an <b>al</b> <b>fresco</b> painting of Virgin Mary, so that blood had begun to seep down the wall from the painting. Even under all degrees of judicial torture, the Jew denied performing this sacrilegious act, and was therefore exonerated. Then a brawny smith demanded from him a trial by combat, because, supposedly, in a dream the Virgin herself had besought the smith to do so. The court accepted the smith's challenge, he easily won the combat against the Jew, who was duly hanged up by the feet between two dogs. To add to the injury, one let him be slowly roasted as well as hanged. This is a very similar story to one told in France, in which a young Jew threw a lance {{at the head of a}} statue of the Virgin, so that blood spurted out of it. There was inadequate evidence for a normal trial, but a frail old man asked for trial by combat, and bested the young Jew. The Jew confessed his crime, and was hanged by his feet between two mastiffs.|$|E
25|$|The main {{church has}} a plain facade {{with the only}} element with ornate {{decoration}} is the bell tower with also contains a clock. Just inside the main portal, there is a bronze statue of Jesus carrying a cross, a lamb and a book. Just beyond {{this is a very}} large stone baptismal font. Inside, the decoration is stark and mostly modern, especially in the main altar area. An equilateral cross with an image of Christ is suspended over the altar area and there are small modern crosses and other elements on the side walls. However, the most important decorative element is an 18th-century narrative mural. This mural was uncovered during the renovation work in the mid 20th century. The mural covers 400 m² of both side walls of the main nave of the church and {{tells the story of the}} arrival and martyrdom of Philip of Jesus and other missionaries in Japan. The mural was probably painted in the middle of the 17th century after the Franciscan missionaries were beatified in 1627. The mural was painted <b>al</b> <b>fresco</b> in a primitive style. Little is known about who painted it or the socio-political context behind its creation. One scholar by the name of Luis Islas Garcia, believes that the artist was a native of Asia who resided in the monastery, assisted by local indigenous people. However, Father Diego Yuki of a museum dedicated to the martyrs in Nagasaki believes that the mural as a purely local work. Phillip of Jesus was beatified in 1627, and canonized in 1629. As the first Mexican saint, as well as a Franciscan, his story would have importance at this establishment. He would have relevance through the colonial period as a symbol of Criollo identity in Mexico. However, this mural was covered over in the 19th century and its existence was forgotten. The work was rediscovered in the 20th century by architect Ricardo Robina when the cathedral was remodeled.|$|E

2500|$|On 14 November 1953 {{a larger}} chapel was blessed and opened by Archbishop Liston. This was built {{mainly on the}} {{initiative}} of the Chaplain of the School, Father Reginald Delargey. Funds were raised by the Old Boys, Men's and Ladies' Committees and the pupils. The chapel cost £3,300. £3,000 was raised by an appeal (£1,400 from parents, friends and Old Boys, and £750 from the pupils including £200 {{as a result of}} [...] "self-denial" [...] days). [...] "The opening of the chapel was all the more satisfying because of the involvement of the pupils." [...] This chapel was located between the Brothers' House and the main school building (now called the [...] "Br O'Driscoll Building"). The chapel was rectangular. It had two aisles between which there were approximately ten pews which could accommodate a class or two for Mass or Benediction. On the other side of each aisle were the Brothers' chairs and prie-dieus at which they recited their office each day, heard Mass and kept their own devotional books. The chapel was dominated by a crucifix and a large altar fixed against the south end wall in those pre-Vatican II days. A free-standing altar later replaced this so that Mass could be said facing the congregation. On the left was also a shrine to Our Lady of Perpetual Succour, a devotion much encouraged by the Christian Brothers. On the South side of this icon was the door to a small sacristy which also served as a confessional for the school, where the school chaplain was available regularly. This sacristy issued onto a small cloister which connected the Brother's House with the school building. On the North side of the icon a door led from the chapel to the Brother's Common room and library in the Brothers' House. This also served as the general staff room for the college which was most useful to the lay teachers. There were folding doors along the northern or entrance end of the chapel. These doors could be opened so that extra congregants could be accommodated outside. From time to time Masses were celebrated <b>al</b> <b>fresco</b> there. Other events were also held there such as school prizegivings. At the 1955 prizegiving, Archbishop Liston [...] "presided on a decorated balcony" [...] in front of the chapel. [...] "The chapel became a focal point and the good habit of a visit to the Blessed Sacrament before and after school [...] maintained over 60 years". This chapel was demolished to free up access to the Brother L. H. Wilkes Technology Block which was opened in 2001.|$|E
