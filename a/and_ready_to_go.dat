Monica later watches the video alone which features her and her father, Jack, dancing. The video then shows Monica and Ross's parents in bed, which disgusts her.|$|E

25|$|All US {{productions}} (including Broadway and its revival) were visually {{identical in}} scale and design {{but the third}} national tour was notable for its portability without sacrificing the Broadway-caliber experience. Thanks to innovative touring techniques borrowed from the pop/rock concert industry, the 4.5million dollar production was adaptable to smaller and larger venues and traveled complete in all of 8 semi tractor trailers. It was set up <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in less than 24 hours and broken down and packed up in about 16 hours. This allowed it to reach many cities and venues in its acclaimed, original Broadway form.|$|E
500|$|In February 2012, Anthony and Tyler get {{involved}} with criminal Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Of this storyline Lapinksas said, [...] "I loved the challenge. Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was trying his best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice that we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E

500|$|In Willow's dream {{she struggles}} {{to find her}} place in the school theater {{production}} of Death of a Salesman, while her friends and classmates are apparently fully costumed, prepared, <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on stage. Her confusion represents her lack of self-confidence, her fear that she still does not fit in or have a place in the world, unlike those around her, who are competent and know what is going on. She wears ordinary clothes, but the others repeatedly comment on the excellence of her [...] "costume", a reference to her fear that her friends do not see what she has grown into, but rather what she was when younger: nerdy and awkward. This fear is confirmed when Buffy strips off her shirt and jeans, revealing the same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of the series, four years earlier, before her demon-fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence. Willow stands anxiously {{at the front of the}} class, trying to read a paper, while her classmates express their boredom with listening to her and Oz whispers into Tara's ear, until she is attacked by the First Slayer and her breath is sucked out of her body.|$|E
500|$|Pallas {{returned}} on 12 May with [...] and a 16-gun ship-sloop, [...] Allemande despatched {{two large}} frigates and three corvettes; facing unfavourable winds, the British withdrew. Two days later, Pallas and Kingfisher {{came back and}} Allemande again ordered Minerve, Lynx, Sylphe, and Palinure to chase Cochrane off. As a precaution, he also had two other large frigates, [...] and , cleared for action <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> Collett ordered his ships to set all sail {{in the hope of}} catching Pallas before she could escape, but Cochrane was in no hurry to leave and even attempted to draw the French on by backing his topsails and slowing down. Once in range, Pallas opened fire, bringing down the topsail yard of one of the smaller vessels and then retreating into nearby shoals with Minerve in pursuit. By 13:00 Minerve had come up on the leeward side of Pallas, whereupon Pallas fired into her and closed with the intention of boarding. Just at that moment, Minerve hit a sandbank and Pallas crashed into her. The force of the collision, great enough to jolt Pallass guns from their positions, did not prevent her from unleashing a devastating broadside. Both ships were damaged but Pallass shallower draught prevented her grounding. Her crew were able to disengage and get back under way, having seen the two 40-gun French frigates, Armide and Infatigable, drawing near. The crew of Kingfisher sailed in to take Pallas in tow; the latter had lost her fore topmast, jib-boom, spritsail, stunsail, and main topsail yards. Minerve was only lightly damaged; she was re-floated and taken to Rochefort for repair. The engagement cost the lives of seven seamen aboard Minerve, with a further fourteen injured. There were a further one dead and five wounded aboard Pallas.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is known}} that the two had {{conducted}} friendly correspondence over several years and that Strepponi had offered various pieces of advice to the composer. As is known, Verdi and Emanuele Muzio had arrived in Paris on 2 June 1847 en route to London for I masnadieri, and the composer had sent Muzio on to London {{to make sure that}} Jenny Lind, about whom rumours of her reluctance to come to England abounded, was already present <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to work.

2500|$|Jackson's {{idea for}} [...] "Black Cat" [...] {{was based on}} a warning to a rebel {{involved}} in substance abuse, in addition to the consequences of drug addiction. Its composition compares the theme to the folklore superstitions of cats having nine lives and black cats foreshadowing a negative omen or misfortune. She also related its title to the bold nature of a panther, saying [...] "I have always felt some kind of connection between myself and a panther. They're not afraid of anything, they're willing to take on anything–that's the way I feel about my work." [...] Regarding its development, she said, [...] "I was getting dressed <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the studio. The television was on - some commercials and other stuff. I just started humming a melody. I don't know why and it kept sticking in my head. So I put it down on tape."

2500|$|At the {{designated}} start time, a pre-race invocation is given, {{followed by the}} singing of the national anthem.

With the engines running, the cars sit on pit road for approximately three minutes before heading on the track for some warm-up laps before the pace car. The average number of pace laps is three, but there can {{be more or less}} depending {{on a wide variety of}} circumstances and conditions, including but not limited to track length, track drying efforts after rain, or if a car has a problem and stops on the track during those pace laps.
