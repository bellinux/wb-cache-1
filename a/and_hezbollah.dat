25|$|In September 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{pushed to}} revive the stalled peace process by getting the parties involved to agree to direct talks {{for the first time}} in about two years. While U.S. President Barack Obama was the orchestrator of the movement, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went through months of cajoling just to get the parties to the table, and helped convince the reluctant Palestinians by getting support for direct talks from Egypt and Jordan. The aim of the talks was to forge the framework of a final agreement within one year, although general expectations of a success were fairly low. The talks aimed to put the Israeli–Palestinian conflict to an official end by forming a two-state solution for the Jewish and Palestinian peoples, promoting the idea of everlasting peace and putting an official halt to any further land claims, as well as accepting the rejection of any forceful retribution if violence should reoccur. Hamas <b>and</b> <b>Hezbollah,</b> however threatened violence, especially if either side seemed likely to compromise in order to reach an agreement. As a result, the Israeli government publicly stated that peace couldn't exist even if both sides signed the agreement, due to the stance taken by Hamas <b>and</b> <b>Hezbollah.</b> The US was therefore compelled to re-focus on eliminating the threat posed by the stance of Hamas <b>and</b> <b>Hezbollah</b> as part of the direct talk progress. Israel for its part, was skeptical that a final agreement was reached that the situation would change, as Hamas <b>and</b> <b>Hezbollah</b> would still get support to fuel new violence. In addition, the Israeli government rejected any possible agreement with Palestine as long as it refuses to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.|$|E
