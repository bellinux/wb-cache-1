50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> (C. ranivorus) is a {{distinct}} non-migratory species that has not usually been included as a subspecies of C. aeruginosus. It inhabits southern and eastern Africa.|$|E
5000|$|<b>African</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> are {{reported}} to be common at many wetland sites in both eastern and southern Africa, especially in Uganda, Botswana and Zambia. In South Africa, an estimated 3,000-6,000 pairs remain, but some populations are declining and the species is regarded as regionally endangered. Outside South Africa there are still large areas of suitable habitat, e.g. the Okavango Delta in Botswana and over much of Zambia, and the species is still locally common [...] The population is preliminarily estimated to number between 10,000-100,000 individuals.|$|R
50|$|It has {{a varied}} diet which {{includes}} small mammals (70% of items) and adult birds, fledglings, lizards, frogs and large insects. Birds {{up to the}} size of Red-billed teal and speckled pigeon. A favoured prey in some areas are doves, especially laughing dove. <b>African</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> are not found in areas with less than 300mm annual rainfall as wetlands are sparse in regions with less rainfall, its main prey in southern Africa, the striped mouse Rhabdomys pumilio , is also restricted to this isohyet. It will also feed on larger animals such as flamingoes carrion left by, for example, African fish eagle. Most prey is caught on the ground but birds and insects often caught on the wing.|$|R
40|$|There {{is often}} a {{reciprocal}} relationship between predators and their dominant prey. This results in continuous co-evolution, where the prey selects more efficient ways to avoid predation and the predator selects more efficient ways of catching prey. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if aerial predators (raptors) influence diurnal activity patterns of their prey (mice). Sampling of both raptors and mice was done simultaneously during autumn, winter and spring at two different study sites in three different habitats on South Africa's arid west coast. Sixty PVC mouse traps were checked every half hour throughout all daylight hours and raptors were observed using scan sampling every two minutes. A total of 1228 rodents were trapped consisting mainly of the diurnal mouse, Rhabodmys pumilio and a total of 197 hours was spent observing hunting behaviour of four raptor species: Black and <b>African</b> <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harriers</b> (Circus maurus and C. ranivorus), Black-shouldered Kite (Elanus caeruleus) and Rock Kestrel (Falco rupicolus). All birds hunt rodents on a regular basis and all were beginning to breed towards the end of my study. Results showed significantly higher small mammal activity during winter and in habitats with dense vegetation. Diurnal small mammal activity peaks appeared to shift randomly between sites, habitats and seasons, thereby avoiding predation through unpredictability of activity. Small mammal activity patterns deliberately avoided peak foraging times of raptors during winter at the Pelican site; however this relationship was not linked to any climatic variables to explain how mice avoid high predation periods. Raptors selected peak foraging times dming periods of high small mammal activity at the Dune site during winter; however wind speed and cloud cover were correlated with both raptor foraging and small mammal activity, thereby influencing the relationship between the predator and the prey. In conclusion, no reoccurring diurnal peaks in small mammal activity were seen across the three seasons and this may have been an anti-predation strategy, because predators would find it more difficult to predict high prey activity. However the raptors it seemed were selecting periods of high mice activity at one site when weather conditions allowed...|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> (Circus ranivorus) is a {{bird of prey}} {{belonging}} to the harrier genus Circus. It is largely resident in wetland habitats in southern, central and eastern Africa from South Africa north to South Sudan.|$|E

Other animals include spiders, molluscs and butterflies.|$|E
50|$|Until {{recently}} {{two species}} were generally recognized: the marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and the <b>African</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> (C. ranivorus). The marsh harrier is now usually split into several species, sometimes {{as many as}} six. These are the western marsh harrier (C. aeruginosus), eastern marsh harrier (C. spilonotus), Papuan harrier (C. spilonotus spilothorax or C. spilothorax), swamp harrier (C. approximans), Réunion harrier (C. maillardi maillardi or C. maillardi) and Madagascar marsh harrier (C. maillardi macrosceles or C. macrosceles).|$|E

50|$|Outside of the Bubo genus, other owls in Africa {{are much}} smaller than Verreaux's eagle-owls {{and are more likely}} to be viewed as prey than competition. Among the small-to-mid-sized owls that have fallen prey to this species {{including}} the barn owl (Tyto alba) and the African grass owl (Tyto capensis), both of which average around 419 g in body mass in Africa, the 334 g marsh owl (Asio capensis) and the 216 g southern white-faced owl (Ptilopsis granti). The only verified interactions with other typical eagle-owls have been predatory, as the 645 g spotted eagle-owl has been recorded among their prey in a few cases. There are several owls was broadly similar habitat preferences from African scops owls (Otus senegalensis) to African wood owls (Strix woodfordii) that have not been reported as food but are almost certainly occasionally threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owls. As is commonly the case with eagle-owls, the Verreaux's eagle-owl is perhaps the most serious predatory threat to diurnal raptors in its range, most often ambushing raptors on their prominent nests upon nightfall and freely killing birds of prey of any age from nestlings to adults. Such prey is not quantitatively significant as a food source but since raptors as a rule are sparsely distributed the habitual visitation of a single or pair of Verreaux's eagle-owl can potentially be devastating to a local population. Among the species known to be attacked have included, among small-to-medium-sized raptors, include the 638 g African harrier-hawk (Polyboroides typus), the 675 g pale chanting goshawk (Melierax canorus), the 507 g <b>African</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> (Circus ranivorus), the 110 g scissor-tailed kite (Chelictinia riocourii), the 291.5 g African goshawk (Accipiter tachiro) the 875 g common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and the 640 g Wahlberg's eagle (Hieraaetus wahlbergi).|$|E
40|$|MSc., Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 A {{selection}} of southern African bird species were modelled {{in terms of}} the probability of these species colliding with or being electrocuted on overhead power lines in South Africa, based on morphological and behavioral factors. Species were included in the model on the basis of internationally recognized vulnerability to these interactions at the family level. The collision model performed poorly when tested against the actual reported mortalities for species contained in the Eskom-EWT Strategic Partnership Central Incident Register CIR) (chi-square of goodness of fit) at the individual species, family and within family levels. The electrocution model performed slightly better at the family, and within family level. Both collision and electrocution models performed better for the physically larger species (and families) and for those species with higher modelled probability of collision or electrocution. As the product of random carcass detection and reporting, the CIR data are biased in various ways. Testing the models against the CIR is therefore equally important for highlighting inadequacies in the CIR, as in the model. A number of new species have emerged as being of high collision (including most importantly African Pygmy Goose, Southern Ground Hornbill, Black-bellied Bustard, Yellow-throated Sandgrouse, Caspian Tern, Hooded Vulture, Bateleur, <b>African</b> <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier,</b> Black Harrier, Pink-backed Pelican and Yellow-billed Stork) or electrocution (Southern Bald Ibis) probability in theoretical terms, and will require further investigation to determine their actual probability of interaction. By mapping the combined distributions of those species with high probabilities of collision and/or electrocution mortality, a number of priority high risk geographic areas emerge around the country...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> Circus aeruginosus {{population}} has expanded rapidly {{during the last}} decades in northern Finland. We studied the diet of <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> during the breeding seasons 2002 – 2009 on the isle of Hailuoto in the Gulf of Bothnia in Finland. We com-pared these results {{to those of other}} raptors in the region, and attempted to relate potential differences in the diet composition to population trends. Birds accounted for 73 – 93 % of prey numbers in the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> during the breeding season. Passerine birds were the most numerous during the nestling (63 %) and fledging periods (21 %), while ducks and gulls/terns had the highest biomass (29 % and 12 %, respectively). Muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) was the most important prey among mammals by number and weight (15 % and 18 %, respectively). Compositional analysis showed that the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> depredated water and shore birds opportunistically. Based on multidimensional scaling, the food niche of the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> was distinctive from those of five other raptor species. Analy-sis of diet breadth and annual change in population size suggested that <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> diet breadth was wider and its annual population increase among the fastest, compared to other raptor species. Annual population change of raptors was positive among species that were rare in the beginning of monitoring, i. e., in the early 1970 s, but was negative among species that were common at that time. No significant relationships were observed between diet breadth and population growth among the studied species. 1...|$|R

40|$|As the {{evolutionary}} responses to environmental change depend on selection acting on individual differences, disentangling within- and between-individual variation becomes imperative. In animal migration research, multiyear tracks are thus needed {{to estimate the}} individual consistency of phenotypic traits. Avian telemetry studies have recently provided the first evidence of individuality across space and time in animal migration. Here, we compare repeatability patterns of routes and timing between two migratory birds, the <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier,</b> Circus aeruginosus, and the osprey, Pandion haliaetus, as recorded by satellite tracking. We found interspecific contrasts with low repeatability in timing and duration and a high repeatability in routes for ospreys, but the reverse pattern for <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers.</b> This was mainly caused by (1) larger between-individual variation in routes for ospreys (broad-front migration) than for <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> (corridor migration) and {{a higher degree of}} repeated use of the same stopover sites among ospreys, and (2) higher within-individual consistency of timing and duration among <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers,</b> while individual ospreys were more flexible.
