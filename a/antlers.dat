5|$|Male elk {{retain their}} <b>antlers</b> {{for more than}} half the year and are less likely to group with other males when they have <b>antlers.</b> <b>Antlers</b> provide a means of defense, as does a strong front-leg kick, which is {{performed}} by either sex if provoked. Once the <b>antlers</b> have been shed, bulls tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to work cooperatively at fending off predators. Herds tend to employ one or more scouts while the remaining members eat and rest.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antlers</b> {{are also}} used in artwork, {{furniture}} and other novelty items. All Asian subspecies, along with other deer, have been raised for their <b>antlers</b> {{in central and eastern}} Asia by Han Chinese, Turkic peoples, Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Koreans. Elk farms are relatively common in North America and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Megaloceros or Irish Elk is {{a species}} from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in Eurasia. Hawkins built a family unit of male, female and fawn; the adult male bore <b>antlers</b> made from actual fossil <b>antlers,</b> long since replaced. Moved {{from the third}} island, they had fallen into {{disrepair}} {{as they were in}} a place easily accessible by vandals. With their original but fragile <b>antlers,</b> the Irish Elks were the most accurate of the models; since they are of recent geological age (dying out 11,000 years ago), Hawkins was able to model them on living deer.|$|E

5|$|Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in the Twin Mountains Formation of {{northern}} Texas, the <b>Antlers</b> Formation of southern Oklahoma, and the Cloverly Formation of north-central Wyoming and possibly even the Arundel Formation in Maryland and in Florida. These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically, but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age. Based on changes in ammonite taxa, the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas, which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains Formation. This indicates that the Twin Mountains Formation lies entirely within the Aptian stage, which lasted from 125 to 112million years ago. The <b>Antlers</b> Formation contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus, two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation, which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages, suggesting a similar age for the <b>Antlers.</b> Therefore, Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Elk {{range in}} forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark. Male elk have large <b>antlers</b> which are shed each year. Males also engage in ritualized mating {{behaviors}} during the rut, including posturing, antler wrestling (sparring), and bugling, a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{experienced}} a prolonged drought {{at the onset}} of the Early Archaic era that lasted until the Middle Archaic period. Although the population decreased overall on the peninsula, the use of tools increased significantly during this time. Artifacts demonstrate that these people used drills, knives, choppers, atlatls, and awls made from stone, <b>antlers,</b> and bone.|$|E
5|$|Geological {{evidence}} suggests that Deinonychus inhabited a floodplain or swamplike habitat. The paleoenvironment of both the upper Cloverly Formation and the <b>Antlers</b> Formation, in which remains of Deinonychus have been found, consisted of tropical or sub-tropical forests, deltas and lagoons, not unlike today's Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|It {{was long}} {{believed}} to be a subspecies of the European red deer (Cervus elaphus), but evidence from a number of mitochondrial DNA genetic studies beginning in 1998 show that the two are distinct species. Key morphological differences that distinguish C. canadensis from C. elaphus are the former's wider rump patch and paler-hued <b>antlers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{cultures}} revere the elk as {{a spiritual}} force. In parts of Asia, <b>antlers</b> and their velvet are used in traditional medicines. Elk are hunted as a game species. The meat is leaner and higher in protein than beef or chicken.|$|E
5|$|Fossilized {{remains of}} Deinonychus have been {{recovered}} from the Cloverly Formation of Montana and Wyoming and in the roughly contemporary <b>Antlers</b> Formation of Oklahoma, in North America. The Cloverly formation has been dated to the late Aptian through early Albian stages of the early Cretaceous, about 115 to 108 Ma. Additionally, teeth found in the Arundel Clay Facies (mid-Aptian), of the Potomac Formation on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of Maryland may be assigned to the genus.|$|E

5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} differs greatly from the nilgai in colour, {{is much smaller}} and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the {{four-horned antelope}}. Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and the hog deer, can be confused with this antelope. The four-horned antelope, however, lacks their <b>antlers.</b> The chinkara, a gazelle, can be told apart by its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns.|$|E
5|$|The jackalope can {{imitate the}} human voice, {{according}} to legend. During {{the days of}} the Old West, when cowboys gathered by the campfires singing at night, jackalopes could be heard mimicking their voices or singing along, usually as a tenor. It is said that jackalopes, the rare Lepus antilocapra, only breed during lightning flashes and that their <b>antlers</b> make the act difficult despite the hare's reputation for fertility.|$|E

5|$|The spherical spores measure 3–5μm, {{including}} an outer covering (an epispore) of about 0.5μm. Their surface texture ranges from smooth to faintly warted. They have an oil droplet, and a translucent pedicel (a small stalk) up to 2.5μm long. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 10–12.5μm long by 5–7.5μm wide. The capillitium comprises short, highly branched (resembling <b>antlers)</b> and entangled threads measuring 5–10μm wide with walls up to 2.5μm thick. Capillitial threads {{do not have}} septa.|$|E
5|$|A {{special case}} of natural {{selection}} is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome <b>antlers,</b> mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E
5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000– 70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer than today's, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} what is now Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated a site near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and <b>antlers,</b> probably with a very low density of population.|$|E

50|$|The ram-horned serpent is a well-attested cult {{image of}} north-west Europe {{before and during}} the Roman period. It appears three times on the Gundestrup cauldron, and in Romano-Celtic Gaul was closely {{associated}} with the horned or <b>antlered</b> god Cernunnos, in whose company it is regularly depicted. This pairing is found as early as the fourth century BC in Northern Italy, where a huge <b>antlered</b> figure with torcs and a serpent was carved on the rocks in Val Camonica.|$|R
