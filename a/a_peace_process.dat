25|$|The Kashmir Valley is {{dominated}} by ethnic Kashmiris, who have largely driven the campaign for secession from India. Non-Kashmiri Muslim ethnic groups (Paharis, Gujjars and Bakarwalas), who dominate areas along the Line of Control, have remained indifferent to the separatist campaign.

Parts of the region were hit by militants, but violence has ebbed there, along with the Valley, after India and Pakistan started <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Though the Kargil {{conflict}} {{had brought}} the Kashmir dispute into international focus, {{which was one of}} Pakistan's aims, it had done so in negative circumstances that eroded its credibility, since the infiltration came just after <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> between the two countries was underway. The sanctity of the LOC too received international recognition. President Clinton's move to ask Islamabad to withdraw hundreds of armed militants from Indian-administered Kashmir was viewed by many in Pakistan as indicative of a clear shift in US policy against Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|On January 12, 1512, viceroy Colón {{addressed}} the Catholic Church {{and noted that}} the ongoing war at Borikén/San Juan had obstructed the Spanish strategies {{due to lack of}} volunteers. In this letter, the author also noted that some of the belligerent caciques had become more open to <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process.</b> The Taíno offensive frustrated the monarchy, who ordered Cerón and Díaz to rebuild a destroyed settlement at Añasco, from which they would carry out the mining of gold and resources from the Otoao.

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1991 Gulf War, the coalition's victory in the Gulf War opened a new opportunity to advance the peace process. The U.S launched a diplomatic initiative in cooperation with Russia which resulted in the October 1991 Madrid peace conference. The conference was hosted by the government of Spain and co-sponsored by the USA and the USSR. The Madrid peace conference was an early attempt by the international community to start <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> through negotiations involving Israel and the Palestinians, as well as Arab countries including Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. The Palestinian team due to Israeli objections, was initially formally a part of a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation and consisted of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza without open PLO associations.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} the 11 {{soldiers}} turned public opinion against {{the peace process and}} boosted the popularity of its main opponent, Álvaro Uribe. In an Ipsos poll, Santos' approval fell from 40% to 29% compared to November 2014, pessimism in the peace process increased 16 points to 69% during the same period and former President Uribe's favourable image increased from 41% to 57%. Nevertheless, only 27% of respondents in the poll wanted to break off dialogues and launch a military offensive. For a skeptical public, the FARC's attack was sign that their ceasefire had been deceitful and only heightened frustration with <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> which had recorded no formal agreement since May 2014. However, according to the Conflict analysis resource centre (Cerac), the attack on the soldiers was the only severe violation of the ceasefire, given that the FARC had generally complied with their ceasefire up to that point, resulting in the lowest levels of violence in the conflict since 1984.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, India {{carried out}} the Pokhran-II nuclear tests which was {{followed}} by Pakistan's Chagai-I tests. Following the Lahore Declaration in February 1999, relations briefly improved. A few months later, however, Pakistani paramilitary forces and Pakistan Army, infiltrated in large numbers into the Kargil district of Indian Kashmir. This initiated the Kargil War after India moved in thousands of troops to successfully flush out the infiltrators. Although the conflict {{did not result in}} a full-scale war between India and Pakistan, relations between the two reached all-time low which worsened even further following the involvement of Pakistan-based terrorists in the hijacking of the Indian Airlines Flight 814 in December 1999. Attempts to normalise relations, such as the Agra summit held in July 2001, failed. An attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, which was blamed on Pakistan, which had condemned the attack caused a military standoff between the two countries which lasted for nearly a year raising fears of a nuclear warfare. However, <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process,</b> initiated in 2003, led to improved relations in the following years.|$|E
