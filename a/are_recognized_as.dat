5|$|In May 2010, a new {{taxonomy}} of the Bivalvia {{was published in}} the journal Malacologia. In compiling this, the authors used a variety of phylogenetic information including molecular analysis, anatomical analysis, shell morphology and shell microstructure as well as bio-geographic, paleobiogeographic and stratigraphic information. In this classification 324 families <b>are</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> valid, 214 of which are known exclusively from fossils and 110 of which occur in the recent past, with or without a fossil record. This classification has since been adopted by WoRMS.|$|E

5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or <b>are</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E
5|$|Investigating the conspiracy, Rorschach and Dreiberg {{discover}} that Veidt is behind everything. Rorschach records his suspicions in his journal, which he drops {{off at the}} publication office of the New Frontiersman, a right-wing tabloid. Rorschach and Dreiberg confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt admits to being responsible for Blake's murder, Manhattan's exile, Rorschach's framing, and his own assassination attempt, which he staged to divert suspicion. He explains that his plan is to unify the United States and the Soviet Union by destroying the world's main cities with exploding energy reactors infused with energy from Manhattan. Rorschach and Dreiberg attempt to stop him, but Veidt subdues them both and reveals that his plan has already been set into motion: the reactors have been detonated, and the energy signatures <b>are</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> Manhattan's.|$|E
5|$|The Ten Commandments are {{a series}} of {{religious}} and moral imperatives that <b>are</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> a moral foundation in several of the Abrahamic religions, including Catholicism. As described in the Old Testament books Exodus and Deuteronomy, the Commandments form part of a covenant offered by God to the Israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church—the official exposition of the Catholic Church's Christian beliefs—the Commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth, and {{serve as the basis for}} Catholic social justice. A review of the Commandments is one of the most common types of examination of conscience used by Catholics before receiving the sacrament of Penance.|$|E

5|$|This bipedal ornithopod {{is known}} from several partial skeletons and skulls that {{indicate}} it grew to between 2.5 and 4.0meters (8.2 to 13.1ft) in length on average. It had sturdy hind limbs, small wide hands, {{and a head}} with an elongate pointed snout. The form of the teeth and jaws suggest a primarily herbivorous animal. This genus of dinosaur {{is regarded as a}} specialized basal ornithopod, traditionally described as a hypsilophodont, but more recently recognized as distinct from Hypsilophodon. Several species have been suggested for this genus. Three currently <b>are</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> valid: the type species T. neglectus, T. garbanii and T. assiniboiensis.|$|E
5|$|Today, Nahuan {{languages}} are spoken in scattered communities, mostly {{in rural areas}} throughout central Mexico and along the coastline. There are considerable differences among varieties, and some are mutually unintelligible. Huasteca Nahuatl, with over onemillion speakers, is the most-spoken variety. They all {{have been subject to}} varying degrees of influence from Spanish. No modern Nahuan {{languages are}} identical to Classical Nahuatl, but those spoken in and around the Valley of Mexico are generally more closely related to it than those on the periphery. Under Mexico's General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples promulgated in 2003, Nahuatl and the other 63 indigenous languages of Mexico <b>are</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> lenguas nacionales ("national languages") in the regions where they are spoken, enjoying the same status as Spanish within their region.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether female emergency physicians {{are less likely}} than male emergency physicians to <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> by patients <b>as</b> physicians. A convenience sample of adult patients seen while a trained observer was on duty in an academic Emergency Department constituted the study population. After the first physician contact, the observer asked the patient if a physician had seen the patient yet. The observer recorded the physician's sex, the patient’s response, sex, age, and race. The frequencies that male and female physicians <b>were</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> physicians <b>were</b> compared. For the 184 physician-patient contacts evaluated, 98 / 105 (93. 3 %) of males <b>were</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> physicians and 62 / 79 (78. 5 %) of females <b>were</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> physicians. Females <b>were</b> significantly less likely than males to <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> physicians (chi-square, p = 0. 003).

5|$|Today, eight stallions <b>are</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> the {{foundation}} bloodstock of the breed, all foaled the late 18th and early 19th centuries. All modern Lipizzans trace their bloodlines to these eight stallions, and all breeding stallions have included in their name {{the name of}} {{the foundation}} sire of their bloodline. There are also classic mare lines, with up to 35 recognized by various breed registries. The majority of horses are registered through the member organizations of the Lipizzan International Federation, which covers almost 11,000 horses in 19 countries and at 9 state studs in Europe. The majority of Lipizzans reside in Europe, with smaller numbers in the Americas, Africa and Australia. Generally gray in color, the Lipizzan is a muscular breed that matures slowly and is long-lived.|$|E
5|$|Formal end-of-year {{examinations}} commence {{starting in}} Year 4 to dictate class streaming {{arrangements for the}} following year. Students are examined in English, Maltese, mathematics, religion and social studies. Despite the fact that eleven-plus examinations highlight inequality and failures, and <b>are</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> ineffective educational tools by experts, Malta still implements such exams. In Year 6, when most pupils have turned eleven years of age, an eleven-plus exam is given to students to determine which students attend which secondary schools. Students are tested in English language, Maltese language, mathematics, social studies and religion; the latter is optional for those not adhering to the faith taught in schools. While 73 per cent of eleven-year-old students sat the eleven-plus exam in 2001, only about 54 percent pass it each year. Students achieving success in the eleven-plus exam go on to attend prestigious 'junior lyceums' during their secondary years, whilst {{those who do not}} attend 'area secondary schools'. This is similar to the operation of the Tripartite System in the United Kingdom following World War II.|$|E
5|$|These {{non-human}} antibodies <b>are</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> foreign by {{the human}} immune system and may be rapidly cleared from the body, provoke an allergic reaction, or both. To avoid this, parts of the antibody can be replaced with human amino acid sequences, or pure human antibodies can be engineered. If the constant region is replaced with the human form, the antibody is termed chimeric and the substem used was -xi-. Part of the variable regions may also be substituted, in which case it is called humanized and -zu- was used; typically, everything is replaced except the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), the three loops of amino acid sequences at the outside of each variable region that bind to the target structure, although some other residues may have to remain non-human {{in order to achieve}} good binding. Partly chimeric and partly humanized antibodies used -xizu-. These three substems did not indicate the foreign species used for production. Thus, the human/mouse chimeric antibody basiliximab ends in -ximab just as does the human/macaque antibody gomiliximab. Purely human antibodies used -u-.|$|E
