5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>other</b> arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety {{line to the}} surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E

5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision. The main eyes, in the front-and-center position, are large, and {{are more}} acute than those of a cat and about 10 times as acute as a dragonfly's. The remaining three pairs of eyes are {{along the sides of}} the head, and work as motion detectors. The eyes are used for hunting, for avoiding threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>other</b> arthropods.|$|E

5|$|On {{completion}} of the Grand Junction Railway, Locke moved on to design part of the London and Southampton Railway and encouraged Brassey to submit a tender, which was accepted. Brassey undertook work on {{the section of the}} railway between Basingstoke and Winchester, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>other</b> parts of the line. The following year Brassey won contracts to build the Chester and Crewe Railway with Robert Stephenson as engineer and, with Locke as the engineer, the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway and the Sheffield and Manchester Railway.|$|E
5|$|P. imperialis {{crossed the}} waters between Australia and New Zealand some time between 1960 and 1972, and {{seedlings}} {{of the previously}} infertile trees of F. rubiginosa began appearing in brick and stone walls, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>other</b> trees, particularly in parks and gardens around Auckland. They have been recorded {{as far south as}} Napier. P. imperialis has been transported to Hawaii, California and Israel, where it has been observed to pollinate its host.|$|E
5|$|There was {{considerable}} {{damage in the}} Lesser Antilles. On Saint Vincent, rains destroyed roads {{and a number of}} houses. Many sugar cane fields were also ruined. Several vessels were lost there <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>other</b> islands, including Barbados, Dominica, and Martinique. On Saint Croix in the present-day U.S. Virgin Islands, at least one vessel was destroyed by the heavy gales. There were also strong gales reported in Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic.|$|E

5|$|While {{almost all}} jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>other</b> arthropods, Phaeacius {{does not use}} the usual hunting tactics. Most jumping spiders walk {{throughout}} the day, so that they maximise their chances of a catch, and jump on their prey and then bite it. Unlike most jumping spiders, Phaeacius and other spartaeines do not leap on prey, but lunge from about half the predator's body length away.|$|E
5|$|A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was {{described}} in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>other</b> spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards. It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year. Spiders use {{a wide range of}} strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones. Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have.|$|E
5|$|The album {{also served}} as the {{introduction}} of the supergroup Boot Camp Clik. The collective was a prominent underground rap group in the 1990s – also producing the acclaimed Smif-n-Wessun's Dah Shinin', Heltah Skeltah's Nocturnal, and O.G.C.'s Da Storm. Enta da Stage heralded the debut of Da Beatminerz. After producing here, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>other</b> Boot Camp albums Dah Shinin, Nocturnal and Da Storm, Mr. Walt and Evil Dee went on to expand their sounds, and produce for popular artists like Afu-Ra, Big Daddy Kane, Craig G, De La Soul, Dilated Peoples, Eminem, Flipmode Squad, Jean Grae, KRS-One, M.O.P., Naughty by Nature, O.C. and Black Star. The album is extensively broken down track-by-track by Buckshot, DJ Evil Dee, and Mr. Walt of Da Beatminerz in Brian Coleman's book Check the Technique (2007).|$|E
