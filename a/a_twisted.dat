Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is no cure, only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became <b>a</b> <b>twisted,</b> sadistic leader. He sentences Sinclair and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon. During the duel, {{the rest of the}} group escapes, retrieves their equipment and rescue Sinclair.|$|E
5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} and transmission electron microscopy has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the funicular cord are arranged in <b>a</b> <b>twisted</b> form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a high tensile strength, is made of thicker hyphae {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched hyphae, known as skeletal hyphae. It has been proposed that these skeletal hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E

5|$|The Pros {{started their}} season in week three with {{a game against}} the Rock Island Independents. The Independents already played two games and were undefeated. There were no scores by either team in the first or third quarters, but the Independents scored 13 points in the second and fourth. Running backs Fred Chicken, Ray Kuehl, and Gerald Mansfield {{accounting}} for four touchdowns throughout the game. Quarterback Pudge Wyman throw two touchdowns—a 35-yard one to Kuehl and a 20-yard one to Mansfield. Hammond started to purposely injure their opponents during the game because they realized the Independents were a much greater team. As a result, Rube Ursella suffered <b>a</b> <b>twisted</b> knee. Duey Lyle was kicked in the face and required seven stitches. Lastly, Ed Healey was kicked in the face needed five stitches in the cheek.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use {{in liquid}} crystal displays, which {{rely on the}} optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is <b>a</b> <b>twisted</b> one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City {{spent the}} week {{preceding}} the final at a {{training camp in}} Eastbourne. Two days before the final Bert Trautmann, who had originally arrived in England as a prisoner of war, was named Footballer of the Year. Eight players who had played in the previous year's final were selected in the starting line-up. Press speculation {{in the run-up to}} the match pondered which of Don Revie and Bobby Johnstone would be selected, as Johnstone had been suffering from a calf problem. Bill Leivers was also an injury doubt due to <b>a</b> <b>twisted</b> ankle, and Billy Spurdle had a boil on his left arm lanced on the eve of the final. Consequently, the Manchester City line-up was not named until the morning of the match. Leivers was passed fit after having two pain-killing injections, but contrary to press expectations Spurdle missed out. This meant both Revie and Johnstone appeared in the line-up, Johnstone switching to outside right.|$|E

5|$|The 1951–52 season saw {{the club}} nearly win the Double, but {{ultimately}} end up empty-handed; {{a series of}} injuries and a fixture pile-up {{at the end of}} the season saw Arsenal lose their last two matches, including the title decider against eventual champions Manchester United at Old Trafford on the last day of the season; after losing 6–1, the Gunners finished third, equal on points with Tottenham. A week later, Arsenal played Newcastle United in the 1952 FA Cup Final, with several recovering players rushed back into the first team; Walley Barnes was taken off injured with <b>a</b> <b>twisted</b> knee after 35 minutes (no substitutes were allowed then), and ten-man Arsenal suffered further injuries to Holton, Roper and Daniel, so that by the end of the match they had only seven fit players on the pitch; with the numerical advantage in their favour, Newcastle won 1–0 with a goal from George Robledo.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the Bengals' game, Dickinson was slated to start against the Miami Dolphins on October 24. In the game, he {{completed}} all four passes he attempted for 51yards, and led a 71-yard touchdown drive. However, he suffered <b>a</b> <b>twisted</b> foot and ankle during the game, and was sidelined for what was then an indefinite amount of time. Dickinson returned two weeks later, failing to complete a pass {{in a game against}} the Denver Broncos, and allowing another interception that was returned by John Rowser for a touchdown. Dickinson had his most productive outing the following week, completing 7 of 13 passes for 103yards in a loss to the New York Jets. His last game of the season was against the Cleveland Browns. He completed two of three passes for 29yards in the fourth quarter. After completing the first two passes, he was intercepted by Terry Brown and was hit late after throwing the pass. The result was torn ligaments in his left knee, which ended his season. Despite the season-ending injury, there was still optimism about Dickinson being the Buccaneers' quarterback of the future due to his scrambling ability.|$|E
5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, Brainstorm, Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil <b>a</b> <b>twisted</b> plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} destruction caused to {{the city}} by the tornado was to the town's business district, a three-block stretch of Main Street between First and Fourth Street lined with stores, offices and tenements built of brick and stone. Because of the direction the storm had approached the city from and the angle at which it entered the city, the tornado virtually swallowed the entire business district. It was here that {{a large majority of}} the fatalities occurred, as many of those who thought they would be safe {{within the confines of the}} reinforced structures were killed by cascades of falling debris as the buildings on Main Street were swept away. A 1.5-ton safe from the city bank was thrown a full block away. Probably one of the greatest demonstrations of the tornado's strength was seen at the Nicollet Hotel, a newly constructed three-story brick building located adjacent to the Willow River. The tornado swept the building clean down to the foundation, killing at least five people. Almost simultaneously, the town's Methodist Church was completely obliterated, the only remnant being the 1.1-ton cast iron bell, which was found nearly 200 feet from the church foundation. As the tornado cleared Main Street, it tore the iron-frame bridge spanning the Willow River from its fitting and onto the adjacent riverbank in <b>a</b> <b>twisted</b> heap. The City Hall was completely flattened, the adjacent water tower sent toppling to the northeast and dumping its contents into First Street and transforming it into a muddy deluge. The tornado then moved into the east side of New Richmond, where many of the city's working class residents lived. As many as forty homes in this neighborhood were completely obliterated, leaving the neighborhood virtually unrecognizable. Within a period of roughly seven to ten minutes, over half of New Richmond was laid to ruins.|$|E
5|$|The winning {{goal for}} Luton in a 2–1 victory over Cardiff City in October was scored by Holmes from close range, which brought {{an end to}} the opposition' eight match unbeaten run. He {{suffered}} from <b>a</b> <b>twisted</b> knee during a match against Derby County on 26 December 2005, eventually returning to action from a hamstring injury in February 2006 by playing in a reserve match against Southend United. His competitive return was in a 3–3 draw against Cardiff, where he came on as a substitute for Dean Morgan on 82 minutes. He completed 2005–06 with 25 appearances and scored two goals, when Luton finished 10th in the Championship. Following the conclusion of the season, he signed a new one-year contract in June 2006. He joined League One club Chesterfield on a one-month loan on 12 January 2007, making his debut the following day in a 1–0 away victory over Rotherham United, in which he forced goalkeeper Neil Cutler into making a good save. Chesterfield were given the lead by Holmes in a match away to Huddersfield Town with a header from a Kyle Critchell cross, which eventually finished a 1–1 draw. The loan was extended for a second month on 8 February 2007, and Holmes said he would consider signing for the club permanently when the loan expired. He eventually finished his spell at Chesterfield with 10 appearances and scored one goal. He joined Lincoln City of League Two on loan until the end of 2006–07 on 22 March 2007. His debut came in a 3–2 home defeat to Swindon Town and he completed the loan spell with five appearances.|$|E
