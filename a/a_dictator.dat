5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by <b>a</b> <b>dictator.</b> PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} last four decades of PedroII's reign were marked by {{continuous}} internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither PedroII nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable. Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders saw no reason to defend the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by <b>a</b> <b>dictator,</b> forming the First Brazilian Republic.|$|E

40|$|This article {{advances}} {{a theory}} of why some dictators weaken the elite through expropriation whereas others do not. When the organization that launches <b>a</b> new <b>dictator</b> into power is uncertain about whether he will remain loyal to them, <b>a</b> <b>dictator’s</b> decision to expropriate the preexisting elite may contrib-ute to political stability by signaling his exclusive reliance on this group. The authors corroborate this claim empirically. Using new data compiled on land, resource, and bank expropriations in Latin America from 1950 to 2002, the authors show that large-scale expropriation helps dictators survive in power. Furthermore, expropriation tends to occur early in <b>a</b> <b>dictator’s</b> tenure, {{and its effect on}} leader survival decays over time, providing additional evidence for its signaling value. The history of autocracy in Mexico between 1911 and 2000 further illustrates the importance of expropriation in promoting autocratic survival as well as how the codification of new property rights can transform <b>a</b> <b>dictator’s</b> launching organization into a new economic elite...|$|R

5|$|In June 1947, Castro {{learned of}} a planned {{expedition}} to overthrow the right-wing military junta of Rafael Trujillo, a U.S. ally, in the Dominican Republic. Widely seen as <b>a</b> <b>dictator,</b> Trujillo utilized a violent secret police which routinely murdered and tortured opponents. Becoming president of the University Committee for Democracy in the Dominican Republic, Castro decided to join the expedition, led by Dominican exile General Juan Rodríguez. Launched from Cuba, the mission began on July 29, 1947; it consisted of around 1,200 men, {{most of whom were}} exiled Dominicans or Cubans. However, the Dominican and U.S. governments were prepared, and soon quashed the rebellion. Grau’s government arrested many of those involved before they set sail, but Castro escaped arrest by jumping off of his naval frigate and swimming to shore at night.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending on internal improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow senators to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision that the president could suspend the right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of <b>a</b> <b>dictator.</b> He also opposed the appropriation of federal money to fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{because he did not}} believe Congress was given the authority to make such an allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Since the tribunes were {{considered}} to be the embodiment of the plebeians, they were sacrosanct. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge, taken by the plebeians, to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. All of the powers of the tribune derived from their sacrosanctity. One consequence was that it was considered a capital offense to harm a tribune, to disregard his veto, or to interfere with a tribune. In times of military emergency, <b>a</b> <b>dictator</b> would be appointed for a term of six months. Constitutional government would be dissolved, and the dictator would be the absolute master of the state. When the dictator's term ended, constitutional government would be restored.|$|E
40|$|In an {{infinite}} horizon stochastic model, a coup not only disciplines <b>a</b> <b>dictator’s</b> policy towards <b>a</b> group of “kingmakers ” but also enables a king-maker to become dictator. Greater {{competition for the}} <b>dictator’s</b> position, <b>a</b> lower impact of the dictator’s policy on the kingmakers, or lower risks of staging a coup raises {{the benefit of a}} coup relative to its opportunity cost and so raises the probability of a coup. Since periodic shocks affect the efficacy of the <b>dictator’s</b> policy, <b>a</b> bad enough shock makes it too costly for even talented <b>dictators</b> to avert <b>a</b> coup. More talented dictators are able to survive more negative shocks, so the worst shock in <b>a</b> <b>dictator’s</b> reign is informative about the probability of a coup. Conditional on the worst shock, the probability of a coup is independent of <b>a</b> <b>dictator’s</b> duration in office. The unconditional probability declines with duration...|$|R

Cagney {{played a}} series of patriots, and his gangster in Angels with Dirty Faces (1937) purposefully acts like a coward when he is {{executed}} so children who had looked up to him would cease any such admiration. Breen in essence neutered Groucho Marx, removing most of his jokes which directly referenced sex, although some sexual references slipped through unnoticed in the Marx Brothers post-Code pictures. In the political realm, films such Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) in which James Stewart tries to change the American system from within while reaffirming its core values, stand {{in stark contrast to}} Gabriel Over the White House where <b>a</b> <b>dictator</b> is needed to cure America's woes.|$|E
5|$|By 287 BC, the {{economic}} {{condition of the}} average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to address their situation. The result was the final plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, <b>a</b> <b>dictator</b> was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. This {{was not the first}} law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC. The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. The result was that control over the state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Bonaparte became {{increasingly}} influential in French politics. He founded two newspapers: {{one for the}} troops in his army and another for circulation in France. The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he might become <b>a</b> <b>dictator.</b> All told, Napoleon's forces extracted an estimated $45 million in funds from Italy during their campaign there, another $12 million in precious metals and jewels; atop that, his forces confiscated more than three-hundred priceless paintings and sculptures. Bonaparte sent General Pierre Augereau to Paris to lead a coup d'état and purge the royalists on 4 September—Coup of 18 Fructidor. This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent on Bonaparte, who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria. These negotiations resulted in the Treaty of Campo Formio, and Bonaparte returned to Paris in December as a hero. He met Talleyrand, France's new Foreign Minister—who served in the same capacity for Emperor Napoleon—and they began to prepare for an invasion of Britain.|$|E

5|$|Demands for Hitler to {{constrain}} the SA strengthened. Conservatives in the army, industry, and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure {{to reduce the}} influence of the SA and to move against Röhm. While Röhm's homosexuality did not endear him to conservatives, they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler for his part remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted to do when he left for Venice to meet Benito Mussolini on June 15. Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary Otto Meißner, Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath ordered the German Ambassador to Italy Ulrich von Hassell— without Hitler's knowledge— to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was blackening Germany's good name. Neurath's manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well). During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism, and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler's good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the murder of Giacomo Matteotti {{as an example of the}} kind of trouble unruly followers could cause <b>a</b> <b>dictator.</b> While Mussolini's criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{minister}} Bernardo Monteagudo {{was removed}} from office by a Peruvian rebellion, during San Martín's absence. San Martín resigned as Protector of Peru {{a few days later}} and returned to Valparaíso, Chile. Several reasons influenced him to resign. The military discipline of the Army of the Andes was compromised, but San Martín was reluctant to take drastic action against his officers. The authority of San Martín and Bolívar, and the local rivalry of their respective countries Peru and Colombia, limited their options for joint work: Colombians would not have liked Bolívar to give many of his forces to San Martín, whilst Peruvians would not have liked their Protector to be second in command to Bolívar, and a joint command would complicate the maintenance of military discipline. Unlike Bolívar, backed up by the Colombian government, San Martín did not have more resources than those he already had: Buenos Aires denied him any support, the other Argentine governors (such as Juan Bautista Bustos) supported him but did not have resources to provide, O'Higgins was about to be deposed in Chile, and Cochrane took the navy and left him without naval power. Finally, he felt that only a very strong authority would be able to prevent balkanization, but refused to rule as <b>a</b> <b>dictator</b> himself.|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>dictator</b> novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical {{examination of the}} power held by the dictator, the caudillo, and some general reflection {{on the nature of}} authoritarianism. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes I, the Supreme (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and The Feast of the Goat (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Leónidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator to achieve the same narrative end, as in Reasons of State (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential {{in the development of a}} Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as paternalistic dispensers of wisdom, like that of the caudillo whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.|$|E

He runs to the laboratory to shift to the previous world line with a D-mail, but is stopped by Kurisu and Suzuha: Kurisu witnessed Okabe killing the agents, and Suzuha has in this world line traveled back in time to stop Okabe from becoming <b>a</b> <b>dictator,</b> leader of the Rounders, {{and a member of the}} Committee of 300. Kurisu calls the police, but Moeka helps Okabe escape. They visit Mayuri, who is hospitalized, and Okabe learns that they were childhood friends but got separated after the Year 2000 problem occurred, which led to a catastrophy and the death of Mayuri and Okabe's families. Learning that Mayuri has cancer and is not expected to live for much longer, Okabe leaves to clear his head. Moeka questions Luka about Okabe's D-mail, and concludes that the Year 2000 problem likely was caused by SERN. Moeka assures Okabe that they do not have to worry about Kurisu's report, as the Rounders are pressuring the police. She says that they are like family in this world line, since Okabe saved her when she tried to commit suicide, and that she wants to help him even though he is different from the Okabe she knows. They receive their next mission – to take the time machine and its creators to SERN – but they decide to betray SERN, forcefully entering the laboratory prior to the scheduled mission; the other Rounders appear and shoot Okabe, but Moeka manages to send a D-mail that causes a world line shift, away from the gamma attractor field.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat at}} Lake Trasimene put the Romans in an immense state of panic, fearing {{for the very}} {{existence}} of their city. The Senate decided to resort to the traditional emergency measure of appointing <b>a</b> <b>dictator,</b> a temporary commander-in-chief who would unite military authority, which was normally divided between the two consuls, for six months. The usual procedure required the presence of a consul to appoint the dictator. Since one consul (Flaminius) was dead and the other (Servilius) away with the only army left in Italy, the Senate resolved to elect <b>a</b> <b>dictator</b> itself. As this was unconstitutional, the person appointed, Quintus Fabius Maximus, was given the title of prodictator (acting dictator) although he held the same powers as <b>a</b> <b>dictator.</b> The Senate also appointed his magister equitum ("master of cavalry", who acted as his second-in-command) instead of allowing the dictator to choose one himself as was the normal rule: M.
