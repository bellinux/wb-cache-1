The gatefold sleeve reveals a tiger cub at Jackson's leg, which Zimmerman reported the singer mostly kept away from his face fearing he would be scratched. <b>Another</b> <b>picture</b> from the shoot, with Jackson embracing the cub, {{was used for the}} 2001 special edition of Thriller.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} verse, pink {{elephants}} float over the girl's bed and an animated fairy version of Madonna {{emerges from the}} picture and winks. She takes the little girl through <b>another</b> <b>picture,</b> displaying mythological and fairytale beings such as dragons, princes and unicorns {{as well as a}} castle where Madonna dances with the moon. An underwater scene with mermaids and fish follows, then a parade of all the girl's toys around her room. As the song wraps, the fairy taps on the girl and causes her to yawn. She falls asleep again and her toys go back to being as they were. The violins and the instruments gradually fade inside the radio and the song ends.|$|E

25|$|Loos and Emerson {{turned down}} <b>another</b> <b>picture</b> with Davies, preferring {{to write for}} their old friend Constance Talmadge, whose {{brother-in-law}} Joseph Schenck (husband of Norma Talmadge) was an independent producer. Both A Temperamental Wife (1919) and A Virtuous Vamp (1919) were great hits for Talmadge. The Schenck studios filmed in a New York warehouse, and Loos and Emerson occupied suites at the Algonquin. Individually Anita liked {{many members of the}} Algonquin Round Table, but as a group she found them overwhelming. In the spring of 1919, the couple joined the Talmadges and the Schencks at the Ambassador Hotel on Park Avenue, with Constance, filling the void left by the loss of her sister many years before. When Anita and Constance weren't working, they went shopping. The Talmadge-Schencks convinced Anita to summer with them in Paris without Emerson. Much of this adventure would end up as fodder for Loos's book Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.|$|E

500|$|City Lights {{had been}} a success, but Chaplin was unsure if he could make <b>another</b> <b>picture</b> without dialogue. He {{remained}} convinced that sound would not work in his films, but was also [...] "obsessed by a depressing fear of being old-fashioned." [...] In this state of uncertainty, early in 1931, the comedian {{decided to take a}} holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months. In his autobiography, Chaplin recalled that on his return to Los Angeles, [...] "I was confused and without plan, restless and conscious of an extreme loneliness". He briefly considered retiring and moving to China.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the release, Gaga {{unveiled}} three cover artworks, {{which were}} photographed by Steven Klein. The first one shows Gaga naked with a scorpion balanced {{on her head}} inspired by performance artist Marina Abramović. In the second image, the singer stands naked with a kebab in her mouth, while the third shows a dead bat laying flat on its back. A writer for Rap-Up called the artworks [...] "striking", while Metro commented that the covers were only more [...] "photo of Lady Gaga doing something weird." [...] John Walker from MTV News {{found it difficult to}} understand the meaning behind the artworks, but nevertheless found them compelling. When the song debuted on YouTube, yet <b>another</b> <b>picture</b> was used to accompany the audio showing Gaga in metallic paint with a scorpion attached to her head.|$|E
500|$|Rossen {{was already}} ill {{when he started}} on his final film, Lilith (1964), and it was poorly {{received}} in the United States. After it Rossen lost interest in directing, reportedly because of conflicts with the film's star, Warren Beatty. The filmmaker said, [...] "It isn't worth that kind of grief. I won't take it any more. I {{have nothing to say}} on the screen right now. Even if I never make <b>another</b> <b>picture,</b> I've got The Hustler on my record. I'm content to let that one stand for me." [...] However, {{at the time of his}} death Rossen was planning Cocoa Beach, a script he conceived in 1962, showing the hopes and struggles of transients in a local community and contrasting this with nearby Cape Canaveral, which Neve described as a [...] "symbol of America's imperial reach".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] is an {{evisceration}} of a no-good adolescent male, and {{is directed}} towards an ex-boyfriend. About the song's theme, Sean Dooley of About.com commented, [...] "Swift takes no prisoners in her quest {{to make a}} former flame feel her wrath for doing her wrong." [...] In the first verse, Swift introduces relationship by stating she acknowledged {{the fact that her}} former boyfriend was more in love with himself than with her. The second verse has Swift plotting retaliation: [...] "There's no time for tears / I'm just sitting here planning my revenge / There's nothing stopping me / From goin' out with all of your best friends." [...] For the refrains, she speaks of igniting fire on photographs of her ex-boyfriend, concluding them with a musical punch line, [...] "As far as I'm concerned / You're just <b>another</b> <b>picture</b> to burn". Critics have found the song to a symbol of feminism.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{already been}} linked to his sister Adele on stage, Astaire was {{initially}} very reluctant {{to become part of}} another dance team. He wrote his agent, [...] "I don't mind making <b>another</b> <b>picture</b> with her, but as for this 'team' idea, it's 'out!' I've just managed to live down one partnership and I don't want to be bothered with any more." [...] However, he was persuaded by the obvious public appeal of the Astaire-Rogers pairing. The partnership, and the choreography of Astaire and Hermes Pan, helped make dancing an important element of the Hollywood film musical.|$|E
2500|$|The cover artwork was {{designed}} by Polish artist Rosław Szaybo. The album's front cover photo, shot by Kate Simon, was taken in the alleyway directly opposite {{the front door of}} the band's 'Rehearsal Rehearsals' building in Camden Market. Drummer Terry Chimes, though a full member of the Clash at the time, did not appear in the picture as he had already decided to leave the group. <b>Another</b> <b>picture</b> from the same Kate Simon photoshoot appears on the UK Special Edition DVD of Rude Boy, released in 2003. The picture of the charging police officers on the rear, shot by Rocco Macauly, was taken during the 1976 riot at the Notting Hill Carnival—the inspiration for the track [...] "White Riot".|$|E

2500|$|No sequels {{had been}} {{contemplated}} {{at the time}} of the production of Planet of the Apes; it was only during that film's success that a sequel was discussed. Neither Charlton Heston nor Kim Hunter wanted to do another Apes film; Roddy McDowall pleaded another commitment; and Harrison herself was ambivalent. She was engaged to her mentor, Richard Zanuck and [...] "no longer totally concerned with being an actress. I don't even want to do <b>another</b> <b>picture.</b> But since this is a sequel to the one I did last year, I felt [...] obligated. [...] "Ted Post was a wonderful television director," [...] Harrison said, [...] "fabulous to work with, an actor's dream. I could get away with murder with him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} Gran Casino sidelined Buñuel, {{and it was}} over two years before he {{had the chance to}} direct <b>another</b> <b>picture.</b> [...] According to Buñuel, he spent this time [...] "scratching my nose, {{watching}} flies and living off my mother's money", but he was actually somewhat more industrious than that may sound. [...] With the husband/wife team of Janet and Luis Alcoriza, he wrote the scenario for Si usted no puede, yo sí, which was filmed in 1950 by Julián Soler. He also continued developing the idea for a surrealistic film called Ilegible, hijo de flauta, with the poet Juan Larrea. Dancigers pointed out to him that there was currently a vogue for films about street urchins, so Buñuel scoured the back streets and slums of Mexico City in search of material, interviewing social workers about street gang warfare and murdered children.|$|E
2500|$|... "Director Lewis Milestone {{is quoted}} {{in an article}} in the Los Angeles Sun Mirror on 8 December 1946 as having said that he would never make <b>another</b> <b>picture</b> with {{producer}} Hal Wallis because Wallis wanted to reshoot scenes in this film for more close-ups of Lizabeth Scott; Milestone reportedly told Wallis to shoot them himself—which he did." [...] Wallis ended up adding extra footage of Scott at the expense of Stanwyck's screen time, which later led to a contretemps between Stanwyck and Wallis. Concerning her first film noir, Scott recalled how strange it was to be in a film with Stanwyck and only have one brief scene together. The screenplay by Robert Rossen depicts two separate story lines running in parallel—one dominated by Martha Ivers (Stanwyck) and the other by Antonia [...] "Toni" [...] Marachek (Scott). The Heflin character, Sam, is the connection between the story lines, which only overlap in the one scene where femme fatale Martha and Toni meet.|$|E
