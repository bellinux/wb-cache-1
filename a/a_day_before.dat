5|$|Despite strong southerly shear {{exposing the}} LLCC, Bonnie {{intensified}} slightly {{to reach its}} initial peak intensity with winds of 45mph (75km/h) as it turned towards the north.

Bonnie weakened back to tropical depression strength {{about half an hour}} prior to its landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina.
