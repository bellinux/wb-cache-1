5|$|The Irish overprinted stamps came, <b>as</b> <b>supplied</b> {{from the}} {{printers}} in London, with a watermark of the Royal Cypher of George V. The first Irish watermark was a stylised {{design of the}} two overlapping letters 's' and 'e' making an 'se' watermark representing {{the name of the}} country Saorstát Éireann. This watermark was discontinued around 1940 when the country's name changed to Éire (Ireland); it was replaced with e watermark paper to represent Éire. Stamps of the period may have the watermark in any of several states of inversion and rotation attributable to the way the paper was fed into the printing machines.|$|E

500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Brettingham ever formally studied architecture or travelled abroad. Reports of him making two trips to Continental Europe, are the result of confusion with his son, Matthew Brettingham the Younger. That he enjoyed success in his own lifetime is beyond doubt—Robert Adam calculated that when Brettingham sent his son, Matthew, on the Grand Tour (1747), he went with a sum of money in his pocket of around £15,000 (£ in [...] ), an enormous amount at the time. However, part of this sum was probably used to acquire the statuary in Italy (documented <b>as</b> <b>supplied</b> by Matthew Brettingham the Younger) for the nearly completed Holkham Hall. Matthew Brettingham the Younger wrote that his father [...] "considered the building of Holkham as the great work of his life". While the design of that great monumental house, which still stands, cannot truly be accredited to him, it is the building for which Brettingham is best remembered.|$|E

"In another {{building}} I {{was shown}} his manufactory of shoes, which, like the other, {{is full of}} ingenuity, and, in regard to subdivision of labour, brings this fabric on a level with the oft-admired manufactory of pins.

All the details are performed by the ingenious application of the mechanic powers; and all the parts are characterised by precision, uniformity, and accuracy. As each man performs but one step in the process, which implies no knowledge of what is done by those who go before or follow him, so the persons employed are not shoemakers, but wounded soldiers, {{who are able to}} learn their respective duties in a few hours.
