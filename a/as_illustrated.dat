5|$|All the motifs {{can vary}} {{considerably}} in appearance {{according to the}} weaver. Colours, sizes and shapes can all be chosen according to taste and the tradition in a given village or tribe; further, motifs are often combined, <b>as</b> <b>illustrated</b> in the photographs above. To give some idea of this variability, a few alternative forms are shown in the table.|$|E

5|$|Satan preaches from {{a raised}} earth mound and {{is dressed in}} {{clerical}} clothing {{that may be a}} soutane. He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, <b>as</b> <b>illustrated</b> by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E

5|$|Thallium(III) {{compounds}} {{resemble the}} corresponding aluminium(III) compounds. They are moderately strong oxidizing agents {{and are usually}} unstable, <b>as</b> <b>illustrated</b> by the positive reduction potential for the Tl3+/Tl couple. Some mixed-valence compounds are also known, such as Tl4O3 and TlCl2, which contain both thallium(I) and thallium(III). Thallium(III) oxide, Tl2O3, is a black solid which decomposes above 800°C, forming the thallium(I) oxide and oxygen.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>illustrated</b> by {{the table}} of matches above, little is known of {{organised}} cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E
5|$|De Materia Medica was {{circulated}} <b>as</b> <b>illustrated</b> manuscripts, copied by hand, in Greek, Latin and Arabic {{throughout the}} mediaeval period. From {{the sixteenth century}} on, Dioscorides' text was translated into Italian, German, Spanish, and French, and in 1655 into English. It {{formed the basis for}} herbals in these languages by men such as Leonhart Fuchs, Valerius Cordus, Lobelius, Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius, John Gerard and William Turner. Gradually such herbals included more and more direct observations, supplementing and eventually supplanting the classical text.|$|E
5|$|Going into 2015, the Football League {{made public}} their {{concerns}} over Yeung's attempts to impose {{his choice of}} directors on the BIHL board despite his conviction disqualifying him from exerting influence over a club. Relationships became increasingly factional, <b>as</b> <b>illustrated</b> {{by the failure of}} three directors, including the club's de facto chief executive Panos Pavlakis, to gain re-election, followed the next day by their reinstatement. On 17 February, the board voluntarily appointed receivers from accountants Ernst & Young to take over management of the company. Their statement stressed that no winding-up petition had been issued and the company was not in liquidation.|$|E

5|$|In very {{elementary}} terms, anti-de Sitter {{space is}} {{a mathematical model}} of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points (the metric) {{is different from the}} notion of distance in ordinary Euclidean geometry. It is closely related to hyperbolic space, which {{can be viewed as a}} disk <b>as</b> <b>illustrated</b> on the right. This image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{involved}} in numerous biological processes. It {{is the most important}} transition metal in all living organisms. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms: archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans. For example, the color of blood is due to hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. <b>As</b> <b>illustrated</b> by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, such as hemes, which are non-protein compounds, often involving metal ions, that are required for a protein's biological activity to happen. The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. The main roles of iron-containing proteins are the transport and storage of oxygen, as well as the transfer of electrons.|$|E
5|$|Rotary fan, {{manual and}} water-powered: For {{purposes}} of air conditioning, the Han Dynasty craftsman and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3m (10ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied hydraulic power to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary fan {{became even more}} common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, <b>as</b> <b>illustrated</b> by German mineralogist and metallurgist Georg Agricola (1494–1555).|$|E

5|$|Selenium, {{especially}} in the II oxidation state, forms stable bonds to carbon, which are structurally analogous to the corresponding organosulfur compounds. Especially common are selenides (R2Se, analogues of thioethers), diselenides (R2Se2, analogues of disulfides), and selenols (RSeH, analogues of thiols). Representatives of selenides, diselenides, and selenols include respectively selenomethionine, diphenyldiselenide, and benzeneselenol. The sulfoxide in sulfur chemistry is represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides (formula RSe(O)R), which are intermediates in organic synthesis, <b>as</b> <b>illustrated</b> by the selenoxide elimination reaction. Consistent with trends indicated by the double bond rule, selenoketones, R(C=Se)R, and selenaldehydes, R(C=Se)H, are rarely observed.|$|E
