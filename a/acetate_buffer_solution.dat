The acetate media were of pH 3, pH 5 and pH 7. All solutions were maintained at 37 °C without agitation. Solutions were changed weekly and retained for fluoride analysis and specimens were weighed each week. After periods of 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks, some specimens were subjected to shear punch testing and SEM examination. Results: All specimens except those in pH 3 medium gained weight for the first 2 - 5 weeks after which weight was lost until all specimens weighed less than at the commencement of the study. The specimens in pH 3 medium lost considerable weight from weeks 1 and 2. SEM examination showed disintegration of the surface of all specimens examined. Fluoride release peaked at 1 week in all specimens except those in pH 3 medium. Fluoride release was highest in pH 3 media (approximately 46 ppm) after 1 week and remained high for 7 weeks, after which it was reduced to about 50 % of the initial release. Specimens stored in ROW and pH 5 media released approximately 5 ppm after 1 week, and this was reduced to approximately 1 ppm (pH 7) and 2 ppm (ROW) by week 6...|$|R
40|$|The {{corrosion}} behaviour of tin is {{studied in}} <b>acetate</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>solutions</b> (pH 4. 5). The potentiodynamic {{anodic polarization curve}} in 0. 1 M acetate solution exhibits two anodic peaks A 1 and A 2 prior to the passive layer formation region which is followed by pitting corrosion. A 1 and A 2 are attributed to stannous and stannic species formation. The effect of scan rate on the potentiodynamic behaviour of tin in this solution was studied. It showed that the corrosion process in the potential range of peaks A 1 and A 2 is mass transport controlled. Pitting corrosion is confirmed by light microscope images. The negative going scans of the cyclic voltammograms show three cathodic peaks C 1, C 2 and C 3. The potentiostatic current time transients, at different electrolyte concentrations and applied potentials (around the pitting potential) involve three stages. The first stage, in which current decreases rapidly with time till reaching a minimum value im at the incubation time ti. The second and third stages, where current increases again linearly with time at two different slopes, are correlated to the pit nucleation and growth respectively. The nucleation rate (ti- 1) was found to increase with increasing the electrolyte concentration and the anodic applied potential. The impedance spectra, at potentials of passive layer and pitting formations, exhibit a high frequency conductive semicircle and a low frequency inductive loop. The results showed {{a decrease in the}} electrode impedance as the applied potential approached the pitting potential...|$|R
