5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 {{science fiction}} novel by German author Alfred Döblin. Stylistically and {{structurally}} experimental, the novel follows {{the development of}} human society into the 27th century and depicts global-scale conflicts between future polities, technologies, and natural forces, culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland's ice cap. Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has {{the reputation of being}} a difficult and polarizing novel, <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> received nearly as much attention as Döblin's following novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929).|$|E

40|$|This essay explores Hemingway’s {{depiction}} {{of women in}} the novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Not.</b> In To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Not,</b> the novel explored in this essay, traits of Hemingway’s renowned sexist {{depiction of}} women <b>have</b> been investigated, <b>and</b> the purpose of the essay was to illuminate that the women of To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Not</b> are reduced to roles which resembles Simone de Beauvoir’s observations, namely the perception of women as the Other, assuming subordinate roles. In order to achieve this task, a close reading has been done on Hemingway’s novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Not,</b> <b>and</b> his portrayal of five female characters in the novel has been analyzed. Simone de Beauvoir’s theory has been applied for an understanding of these female characters in order to see if these women were portrayed in a manner resembling de Beauvoir notions, that is, marked by patriarchal perspectives. The conclusion drawn in this essay is that all the women in the novel are portrayed as "absolute sex", subordinated to men. Thus, the depictions {{of the women in the}} novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Not</b> were found to correspond to patriarchal gender roles as described by Simone de Beauvoir...|$|R

5|$|None of Monteverdi's {{music for}} Andromeda has survived. The {{libretto}} was also {{thought to have}} been lost, until its rediscovery in 1984. As was customary in Monteverdi's time, the manuscript makes no mention of the composer's name—librettos were often the subject of numerous settings by different composers. The libretto's frontispiece confirms that Andromeda was performed during Mantua's Carnival, 1–3 March 1620. An analysis of its contents reveals some influence from Rinuccini's libretto for Arianna, such as use of identical metre and length in the prologues of each work, and several common characters in the respective cast lists. The document remains in private hands <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been published.|$|E
