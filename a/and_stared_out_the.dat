60|$|Virginia {{turned her}} head away <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> over <b>the</b> fields.|$|R
60|$|Maud {{rested her}} chin on her hand, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> into <b>the</b> velvet darkness.|$|R
60|$|Trafford {{stuck his}} hands in his pockets <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> dingy factory window.|$|R
60|$|Silas Croft looked troubled, {{but made}} no answer, and Frank Muller rose <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window.|$|R
60|$|Gregory crossed {{slowly to}} <b>the</b> window, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> {{trees of the}} park which autumn was fast stripping.|$|R
60|$|The King turned also, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> into <b>the</b> dark, {{where the}} great lamps that commemorated the battle were already flaming.|$|R
6000|$|Logan {{looked very}} grave. He rose <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> {{window into the}} mist. Then he came back, and stood beside Merton's chair. He spoke in a low voice: ...|$|R
50|$|Back at Susan's, {{she asks}} Felicia {{to try a}} fresh batch of brownies that they both made (with Felicia {{poisoning}} the batter) and Felicia hesitantly eats a full brownie, and promptly vomits in her handbag. Later when Susan was feeding Paul, she tells him that her and Mike were ready to move back into their house, causing Paul {{to believe that she}} didn't actually care about him, and that she just wanted her house back. He then throws her <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window angrily. He then collapses on the floor.|$|R
60|$|Her laugh, as she retreated, {{was worse}} than her cry; worse than the burst of {{imbecile}} lamentation in which it ended; worse than the doting air with which she sat down in her old seat, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> darkness.|$|R
60|$|Edward Cossey did not reject this {{suggestion}} with the contempt {{that might have}} been expected; on the contrary he appeared to be turning the matter over in his mind, for he drummed a little tune with his knuckles <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window.|$|R
60|$|Neighbours in London! The Ramboats did {{not know}} the names of the people on either side of them. As I waited for Marion before we started off upon our honeymoon flight, Mr. Ramboat, I remember, came and stood beside me <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window.|$|R
60|$|She paused, {{looking at}} me even more strangely than before, till I turned my eyes, indeed, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> sea, wishing that I were in it, or {{anywhere}} away from this lovely and imperious woman whom I was sworn to obey in all things.|$|R
60|$|The slatternly general servant re{{appeared}} {{with the}} chops and tinned salmon {{he had asked}} Madam Gadow to prepare for them. He went <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window, heard the door close behind the girl, and turned at a sound as Ethel appeared shyly through the folding-doors.|$|R
60|$|Often {{during the}} weeks that {{followed}} he dwelt in her mind as she sat at her desk <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> across <b>the</b> river, <b>and</b> several times that summer she started to walk to Silliston. But always she turned back. Perhaps she feared to break the charm of that memory....|$|R
60|$|He {{turned his}} back upon it <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window over the trees and greenery. The balcony was {{decorated}} with white and pink geraniums in pots painted black and gold, and the railings of the balcony were black and gold with crimson shape like squares wildly out of drawing.|$|R
60|$|Winston rose, and she {{saw that}} one hand was closed as he looked down upon her. Then he turned <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> prairie, but there was {{something}} very significant in the rigidity of his attitude, and his face seemed to have grown suddenly careworn when he glanced back at her.|$|R
60|$|Virginia {{sank back}} on the stuffy {{cushions}} of the rattle-trap, and then sat upright again <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window at the dismal scene. They were splashing through a sea of mud. Ever since they had left St. Louis, Captain Lige had done his best to cheer her, {{and he did not}} intend to desist now.|$|R
40|$|Two women {{stand on}} plinths <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> into <b>the</b> crowd. One {{is dressed in}} white, one in black. Projected {{on the wall behind}} the women is a {{changing}} series of words. These words; abusive, vulgar, shocking, angry, suggest the rage the women cannot discuss in ordinary situations. As the words progress through the projected alphabet of cussing, so does their anger...|$|R
6000|$|I {{could think}} of nothing else. I could not study, I could only sit <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window with tears running down my cheeks, until at last, the teacher observing my distress, inquired, [...] "What is the matter?" [...] And I, not knowing how to enter upon so terrible a tale, whined out, [...] "I'm sick, I want to go home." ...|$|R
60|$|William Wetherell {{dropped his}} pen {{with a start}} of surprise, as it was late for a visitor in Coniston. He glanced at Jethro, who did not move, {{and then he went}} to the door and shot back the great forged bolt of it, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out.</b> On <b>the</b> edge of the porch stood a tallish man in a {{double-breasted}} frock coat.|$|R
5000|$|Bailey {{was born}} in Ponteland, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and was brought up there. She later wrote of her {{experience}} at Ponteland High School: [...] "Whilst at school I used to sit <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window, dreaming of anything but lessons, then go home and write pages and pages in my diary of who did what to whom and (usually) why wasn’t I part of it." ...|$|R
60|$|The dawn came slowly. It {{was rather}} cold. Olive wrapped herself in rugs {{and went to}} sleep again. Helena shivered, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window. There {{appeared}} a wanness in the night, and Helena felt inexpressibly dreary. A rosiness spread out far away. It was like a flock of flamingoes hovering over a dark lake. The world vibrated as the sun came up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] he said concisely, as she {{put them}} down, and turned his {{shoulder}} upon her <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window again. It was altogether too discouraging. Evidently he was sensitive {{on the topic of}} operations and bandages. She did not [...] "make so bold as to say," [...] however, after all. But his snubbing way had irritated her, and Millie had a hot time of it that afternoon.|$|R
5000|$|The two meet, but Sheryl {{seems to}} have come to an {{understanding}} regarding her situation. She decides {{that she wants to}} put the baby up for adoption. She also suggests that her situation is too complicated for a young woman such as herself to realistically see through a life with Rick, a baby, and no money or viable career opportunities for either of them. Rick is upset, and hands her an engagement ring that he planned to propose with, suggesting that she could pawn it. Alice then talks to Sheryl, asking her what happened to her earlier views regarding how nothing could stop true love. Sheryl tells her that she is simply too young to understand. As Alice suggests the three of them running away together, Sheryl tells Alice that she mustn't leave her loved ones. As Alice is put on a bus back to Long Island <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window at Rick, Sheryl comes <b>out,</b> and <b>the</b> two embrace.|$|R
5|$|Portrait of a Young Girl {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} by the Early Netherlandish painter Petrus Christus. It was completed {{towards the end of}} his life, between 1465 and 1470, and is held in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. It marks a major stylistic advance in contemporary portraiture; the girl is set in an airy, three-dimensional, realistic setting, <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> viewer with a complicated expression that is reserved, yet intelligent and alert.|$|R
60|$|He {{signed for}} silence, <b>and</b> Breckenridge <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> through <b>the</b> glasses, for he feared his face would betray him, and fancied he {{understood}} the burden that was upon the man who, because it seemed the lesser evil, was risking eight men's lives.|$|R
6000|$|Very {{cautiously}} I lifted {{myself a}} little <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> into <b>the</b> moonlight. There, seated about five paces {{from the open}} end of the hut were the [...] "spooks" [...] sure enough, two white-robed figures squatting silent and immovable on the ground. At first I was frightened. Then I bethought me of thieves and felt for my Colt pistol under the rug that served me as a pillow. As I got hold of the handle, however, a deep voice said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder how}} they get such things," [...] said the Vicar. Then he went <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window. [...] "I suppose {{everything}} is wonderful, even the rising and setting of the sun. I suppose there is no adamantine ground for any belief. But one gets into a regular way of taking things. This disturbs it. I seem to be {{waking up to the}} Invisible. It is the strangest of uncertainties. I have not felt so stirred and unsettled since my adolescence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Tuan. By-and-by see." [...] The old Malay, {{in a blue}} {{dungaree}} suit, {{planted on}} his bony dark feet under the bridge awning, put {{his hands behind his}} back <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> ahead <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> innumerable wrinkles at the corners of his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Somerset dropped <b>the</b> paper, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window. Fortunately for his emotions, {{the horse}} and {{carriage}} were at this moment brought to the door, so that nothing hindered Somerset in driving off to the spot at which he would be soonest likely to learn what truth or otherwise there was in the newspaper report. From the first he doubted it: and yet how should it have got there? Such strange rumours, like paradoxical maxims, generally include a portion of truth. Five days had elapsed since he last spoke to Paula.|$|R
50|$|They go to {{the races}} as planned and Trevor is {{given a chance to}} drive, as promised. Trevor seems to enjoy the experience, but gets into an accident, after which his car will not restart. Trevor is unable to {{complete}} the race. On the drive back to the assessment centre, Peter informs Trevor that he was up against professional racers, did well. He also tells him that he could join a racing team if he wished, and need not go around stealing cars any longer. Trevor makes no reply, <b>and</b> blankly <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window.|$|R
60|$|Peter Blood {{stood in}} the {{pillared}} portico of Government House, and with unseeing eyes that were laden with pain <b>and</b> anger, <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> across <b>the</b> great harbour of Port Royal to the green hills rising from the farther shore and the ridge of the Blue Mountains beyond, showing hazily through the quivering heat.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} been holding it as a signal," [...] said I. [...] "Let us {{see if there is}} any answer." [...] I held it as he had done, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> into <b>the</b> {{darkness}} of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the clouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pin-point of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the window.|$|R
5000|$|..... we {{seized on}} one incident, in Chapter 7 of 'Mary Poppins Comes Back', the second book -- the bird woman. And we {{realized}} that was the metaphor for why Mary came, to teach the children -- and Mr. Banks -- the value of charity. So we wrote the song and took it up to Walt's office and played it and sang it for him. He {{leaned back in his}} chair, looking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window, and he said: 'That's it, isn't it? That's what this is all about. This is the metaphor for the whole film.' And that was the turning point in our lives ... We were full-time staff, so we had an office at the studio, and every so often Walt would call us up to his office on a Friday afternoon. We knew what he wanted. When we got there, he would say, 'I just wanted to know what you boys were up to these days.' Then he would turn around in his chair <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window, like the first time we played it for him, and he would say, 'Play it.' And we would ... And you could just see Walt thinking, 'That's what it's all about, everything we do at Disney.'" ...|$|R
60|$|He stopped <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> at me. I {{felt all}} that foolish {{incapacity}} an Englishman feels on such occasions. I met {{his eyes for}} a moment, <b>and</b> then <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window. For a long space we kept silence. When at last I looked at him he was sitting back in his corner, his arms folded and his teeth gnawing at his knuckles.|$|R
6000|$|He {{talked for}} a little while about house agents and solicitors and people of that sort, in the unjust, {{unreasonable}} way that so many people do somehow get to talk of these business calculi ("Of all the cranky things in this cranky world, it is the most cranky to my mind of all, that while we expect honour, courage, efficiency, from a doctor or a soldier as a matter of course, a solicitor or a house agent is not only permitted but expected to display nothing but a sort of greedy, greasy, obstructive, over-reaching imbecility--" [...] etc.)--and then, greatly relieved, he went to <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> Sloane Street traffic.|$|R
