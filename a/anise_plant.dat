40|$|The phenylpropene t-anethole imparts the {{characteristic}} sweet aroma of anise (Pimpinella anisum, family Apiaceae) seeds and leaves. Here {{we report that}} the aerial parts of the <b>anise</b> <b>plant</b> accumulate t-anethole as the plant matures, with {{the highest levels of}} t-anethole found in fruits. Although the <b>anise</b> <b>plant</b> is covered with trichomes, t-anethole accumulates inside the leaves and not in the trichomes or the epidermal cell layer. We have obtained anise cDNA encoding t-anol/isoeugenol synthase 1 (AIS 1), an NADPH-dependent enzyme that can biosynthesize t-anol and isoeugenol (the latter not found in anise) from coumaryl acetate and coniferyl acetate, respectively. In addition, we have obtained a cDNA encoding S-[methyl- 14 C]adenosyl-l-methionine:t-anol/isoeugenol O-methyltransferase 1 (AIMT 1), an enzyme that can convert t-anol or isoeugenol to t-anethole or methylisoeugenol, respectively, via methylation of the para-OH group. The genes encoding AIS 1 and AIMT 1 were expressed throughout the plant and their transcript levels were highest in developing fruits. The AIS 1 protein is 59 % identical to petunia (Petunia hybrida) isoeugenol synthase 1 and displays apparent Km values of 145 μm for coumaryl acetate and 230 μm for coniferyl acetate. AIMT 1 prefers isoeugenol to t-anol by a factor of 2, with Km values of 19. 3 μm for isoeugenol and 54. 5 μm for S-[methyl- 14 C]adenosyl-l-methionine. The AIMT 1 protein sequence is approximately 40 % identical to basil (Ocimum basilicum) and Clarkia breweri phenylpropene O-methyltransferases, but unlike these enzymes, which do not show large discrimination between substrates with isomeric propenyl side chains, AIMT 1 shows a 10 -fold preference for t-anol over chavicol and for isoeugenol over eugenol...|$|E
50|$|<b>Anise</b> <b>plants</b> grow best in light, fertile, well-drained soil. The seeds {{should be}} planted {{as soon as}} the ground warms up in spring. Because the plants have a taproot, they do not {{transplant}} well after being established, so they should either be started in their final location or be transplanted while the seedlings are still small.|$|R
40|$|Shikimic acid (SA) is an {{intermediate}} of the SA pathway that {{is present in}} bacteria and plants. SA has gained great interest {{because it is a}} precursor in the synthesis of the drug oseltamivir phosphate (OSF), an efficient inhibitor of the neuraminidase enzyme of diverse seasonal influenza viruses, the avian influenza virus H 5 N 1, and the human influenza virus H 1 N 1. For the purposes of OSF production, SA is extracted from the pods of Chinese star <b>anise</b> <b>plants</b> (Illicium spp.), yielding up to 17 % of SA (dry basis content). The high demand for OSF necessary to manage a major influenza outbreak is not adequately met by industrial production using SA from plants sources. As the SA pathway is present in the model bacteria Escherichia coli, several intuitive metabolically engineered strains have been applied for its successful overproduction by biotechnological processes, resulting in strains producing up to 71 g/L of SA, with high conversion yields of up to 0. 42 (mol SA/mol Glc), in both batch and fed-batch cultures using complex fermentation broths, including glucose as a carbon source and yeast extract. Global transcriptomic analyses have been performed in SA producing strains, resulting in the identification of possible key target genes for the design of a rational strain improvement strategy. Because possible target genes are involved in the transport, catabolism and interconversion of different carbon sources and metabolic intermediates outside the central carbon metabolism and SA pathways, as genes involved in diverse cellular stress responses, the development of rational cellular strain improvement strategies based on omics data constitutes a challenging task to improve SA production in currently overproducing engineered strains. In this review, we discuss the main metabolic engineering strategies that have been applied for the development of efficient SA producing strains, as the perspective of omics analysis has focused on further strain improvement for the production of this valuable aromatic intermediate...|$|R
40|$|Dry plant {{leaves of}} thyme, sage, banana, mint, <b>anise</b> and oleander <b>plants</b> {{have been used}} for {{removing}} lead, cadmium, cooper and zinc ions for aqueous solutions. The most efficient types of plant leaves for the removal process {{have been found to be}} oleander leaves for removing lead and copper and sage leaves for removing dmium and zinc. The maximum efficiency of removal of the studied metal ions by plant leaves was equal to that obtained by activated carbon. The concentration of metal ion in solution has been found to have only slight effect on the efficiency of the removal process. Oven-dried leaves have a little higher efficiency removal of metal ions than naturally dried leaves...|$|R
5|$|They soon {{learn that}} the king of Pedda and Roget's {{childhood}} friend, Inath, has been driven mad and is launching Operation Psi {{with the aim of}} taking over the world. Roget and Yerchael journey to the other nations in order to help stop the Peddan army. They join forces with the rulers and warriors of several countries, including the defeated Amazons of Laurent, the rebels of Nevarla, which has allied itself with Pedda, and the warriors of Valsena and Altena. As they fight the Peddan army, they discover that Inath is installing Black Mirrors in the conquered kingdoms, which are corrupting those around them. Roget and Yurchael are joined in their quest by the elemental spirits, which are concerned about the mirrors. After confronting Roget's twin brother, the Mirage Bishop, they discover that Inath and the Mirage Bishop have been corrupted by the ancient witch <b>Anise,</b> who is <b>planting</b> the mirrors in order to summon a dark energy for her own power.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} into plant tissues {{have indicated that}} the free form of the natural polyphenolic antioxidant, ellagic acid (EA), is much more plentiful than first envisaged; consequently a re-assessment of solvent systems for the extraction of this water-insoluble form is needed. As EA solubility and its UV-Vis spectrum, commonly used for detection and quantification, are both governed by pH, an understanding of this dependence is vital if accurate EA measurements are to be achieved. After evaluating the pH effects on the solubility and UV-Vis spectra of commercial EA, an extraction protocol was devised that promoted similar pH conditions for both standard solutions and plant tissue extracts. The extraction so devised followed by HPLC with photodiode-array detection (DAD) provided a simple, sensitive and validated methodology that determined free EA {{in a variety of}} plant extracts. The use of 100 % methanol or a triethanolamine-based mixture as the standard dissolving solvents were the best choices, while these higher pH-generating solvents were more efficient in extracting EA from the plants tested with the final choice allied to the plants’ natural acidity. Two of the native Australian <b>plants</b> <b>anise</b> myrtle (Syzygium anisatum) and Kakadu plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana) exhibited high concentrations of free EA. Furthermore, the dual approach to measuring EA UV-Vis spectra made possible an assessment of the effect of acidified eluent on EA spectra when the DAD was employed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} a mixed herbal <b>plants</b> (<b>Anise,</b> Cinnamon, Peppermint) and Dandelion {{were added to}} the basal diet during the {{experimental}} period of 6 weeks. The study aimed to find out the effect of these treatments on productive and physiological traits of 200 broilers unsexed Hubbard chicks at the age of one day. These chicks were randomly divided into five groups equally (40 chicks each). Each group was subdivided into two equal subgroup, and fed with the following treatments. The first group (T 1) was fed the basal diet and kept as a control, the second group (T 2) was fed the same diet with adding 0. 25 % of mix herbal plants, where as the third group (T 3) was fed the basal diet with adding 0. 25 % of Dandilion, while the fourth group (T 4) was fed the basal diet with adding 0. 50 % from the mixed herbal plants and the fifth group (T 5) was fed the same basal diet with adding 0. 50 % of Dandilion. The feeding period for all groups lasted for 42 days. The results appeared that there is an improvement in performance traits for all treated groups compared with the control group. However, the chicks fed with 0. 25 % Mix herbal plants performed better than those fed with 0. 50 % concerning weekly body weight gain, live body weight and mortality rate. However chicks fed with Dandelion (0. 50 %) were better in body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, live body weight and mortality rate than those fed with 0. 25 %. No significant effect was noticed on the addition of Mix herbal plants or Dandilion to the diet on blood traits and stress coefficient as compared with the control group. There was no significant effect on dressing percentage or edible giblet organs...|$|R
