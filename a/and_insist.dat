5|$|Syria {{missed a}} 15 March {{deadline}} for destroying its 12 chemical weapons production facilities. Syria has proposed to instead render the facilities inoperable by sealing their entrances; the U.S. {{and its allies}} oppose this proposal <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> on destruction.|$|E
5|$|Molly Haskell {{has argued}} that nevertheless, women are mostly {{uncritical}} of the scene, and that by and large it is consistent with what women have in mind if they fantasize about being raped. Their fantasies revolve around love and romance rather than forced sex; they will assume that Scarlett was not an unwilling sexual partner and wanted Rhett {{to take the initiative}} <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> on having sexual intercourse.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> upon therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E

5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{attempted}} {{to build up}} a base of political support for Matilda in both England and Normandy, demanding that his court take oaths first in 1127, and then again in 1128 and 1131, to recognise Matilda as his immediate successor and recognise her descendants as the rightful rulers after her. Stephen was amongst those who took this oath in 1127. Nonetheless, relations between Henry, Matilda, and Geoffrey became increasingly strained {{towards the end of the}} King's life. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England, and proposed to Henry in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> on the Norman nobility swearing immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death. Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy somewhat earlier than intended. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels. In the middle of this confrontation, Henry unexpectedly fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt.|$|E
25|$|On 22 January 2015, {{a lesbian}} couple applied to marry at the Civil Registry in Tijuana and were denied. The couple vowed {{to fight the}} denial <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> that as federal law trumps local law, an {{injunction}} is unnecessary since the Supreme Court has declared Baja California's Code unconstitutional.|$|E

25|$|Fry {{encounters}} and consoles {{his beautiful}} would-be grandmother Mildred. She seduces him, and Fry rationalizes {{that since he}} still exists, Mildred must not have been his grandmother, and he has sex with her. The {{rest of the group}} finds him, <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> that Mildred is indeed Fry's grandmother. Fry realizes to his horror that he is now his own grandfather.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, the Data Protection Acts {{and later}} the Freedom of Information Act 2000 gave {{patients}} or their representatives {{the right to a}} copy of their record, except where information breaches confidentiality (e.g., information from another family member or where a patient has asked for information not to be disclosed to third parties) or would be harmful to the patient's wellbeing (e.g., some psychiatric assessments). Also, the legislation gives patients the right to check for any errors in their record <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> that amendments be made if required.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 22 June, Haarmann was {{observed}} by the two undercover officers prowling Hanover's central station. He was soon observed arguing with a 15-year-old boy named Karl Fromm, then to approach police <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> they arrest the youth on the charge of travelling upon forged documents. Upon his arrest, Fromm informed police he had been living with Haarmann for four days, {{and that he had}} been repeatedly raped by his accuser, sometimes as a knife had been held to his throat. Haarmann was arrested the following morning and charged with sexual assault.|$|E
25|$|Tsar Alexander {{appointed}} Czartoryski {{curator of}} the Vilna Academy (3 April 1803) {{so that he might}} give full play to his advanced ideas. Czartoryski was, however, unable to devote much attention to education, for from the beginning of 1804, as foreign-affairs adjunct, he had exercised practical control of Russian diplomacy. His first act had been to protest energetically against Napoleon's murder of a Bourbon royal prince the Duke of Enghien (20 March 1804) <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> on an immediate rupture with the government of the French Revolution, then under First Consul Napoléon Bonaparte, whom the tsar considered a regicide.|$|E
25|$|While present-day philologists and classicists {{agree on}} the story's fictional character, there is still debate on what served as its inspiration. The fact that Plato {{borrowed}} some of his other allegories and metaphors—most notably the story of Gyges—from older traditions has caused a number of scholars to investigate possible inspiration of Atlantis from Egyptian records of the Thera eruption, the Sea Peoples invasion, or the Trojan War. Others have rejected this chain of tradition as implausible <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> that Plato created an entirely fictional nation as his example, drawing loose inspiration from contemporary {{events such as the}} failed Athenian invasion of Sicily in 415–413 BC or the destruction of Helike in 373 BC.|$|E

25|$|Doc and Marty {{return to}} 1986 where all is normal. In this timeline, {{there was no}} estate sale because Doc {{had been able to}} {{reconcile}} with his father, thus giving him and his family reason to stay part-time in Hill Valley. They find that Edna and Kid had fallen in love while in jail, and afterwards married and both became much happier and friendlier since. Doc reveals his previous absence to Marty, that he had been traveling in time to compile a history of the McFly family to present to Marty as a graduation gift. Suddenly, three separate DeLoreans appear, each with a different future version of Marty driving them. They approach Marty and Doc <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> they come to help assure that their respective futures occur as they are supposed to. Doc and his Marty leave the Marties arguing with each other, saying the future can wait until after they have enjoyed the present for a while; they then depart to an unknown time.|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{that a lot of}} the characters and indeed the town are based on Pemberton's home town of Chorley, with Royston Vasey based on Adlington, a village within Chorley Borough. The character of Herr Lipp is believed to be based on a hospital chaplain Steve Pemberton encountered after suffering a heart attack in Germany and Pauline is primarily based on a restart officer of Reece Shearsmith's. Similarly, Ollie Plimsolls is based on a community theatre actor that Shearsmith had worked with. In the DVD commentary on the second series, Pemberton and Shearsmith state that Papa Lazarou's speech patterns are based on their former landlord, who would phone their flat <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> on speaking only to Steve. Gatiss has said in interview that the local shop was inspired by a shop in the village of Rottingdean and that he was influenced growing up around the former Winterton Hospital asylum near Sedgefield.|$|E
25|$|The family {{moves to}} Chatham, after Ben is ordered {{back with his}} detachment. Arabella opens up a {{successful}} shop and circulating library below her house, enlisting {{the help of her}} mother and sister, Amelia. Percival becomes well known in town from his mischievous pranks on officers and other strangers, often encouraged by his aunt Amelia. However, Percival's mother and grandmother are less fond of his disregard for manners, <b>and</b> <b>insist</b> on sending him to school after an episode in which he bites his grandmother. Percival reports to the school house of Mr. O'Gallagher, a poor Irish scholar, who rules his class with a system of severe corporal punishment. Mr. O'Gallagher routinely bullies Percival by stealing his lunch, leading Percival to seek revenge by poisoning his sandwiches with calomel. On Guy Fawkes Day the schoolteacher confiscates all the schoolboys' fireworks, for which Percival retaliates by setting off the collected fireworks while the teacher sits above them, leading to the total destruction of the schoolhouse and near death of the schoolmaster.|$|E
