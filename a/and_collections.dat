40|$|Effective billing <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> {{systems are}} a {{critical}} component for ensuring the viability of a service provider. Improving billing <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> activities has an immediate impact on {{the revenue streams of}} a service provider that can, in turn, help the service provider in improving services. However, while effective billing <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> practices depend on many internal factors (including customer databases, the extent of metered and unmetered service provision, tariff and billing structures, delivery of bills, and facilities for customer payments), the institutional arrangements under which service providers operate and provide services determine whether such practices will remain sustainable in the long term. Efficient billing <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> practices can set incentives for the provider to effectively charge and collect water bills while also fulfilling a commercial orientation to services. This note draws on national and international cases to explore what it takes to implement an effective billing <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> system that encourages commercial and operational efficiencies for aiding the expansion and delivery of improved, reliable, and sustainable services. The note starts with an explanation of how poor billing <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> hurt the service provider, followed by the key principles of an effective billing <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> strategy, illustrated through national and international billing <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> practices.
