5|$|The {{composition}} originated {{during a}} period marked by Harrison's devotion to a Hindu-aligned ascetic life and {{the height of his}} public association with the Hare Krishna movement, which included his donation of Bhaktivedanta Manor for use as an ISKCON temple. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of the falsehood of striving for wealth or power in the material world and <b>advocates</b> <b>a</b> direct relationship with one's deity as a genuine life goal. In doing so, he belittles the role of political leaders, as well as his own status as a celebrated rock musician. The song's Krishna Conscious message was also reflected in Harrison's choice of artwork for the Material World album, specifically the reproduction of a painting from a Prabhupada-published edition of the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

5000|$|Chinese {{political}} philosophy {{dates back to}} the Spring and Autumn period, specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese {{political philosophy}} was developed {{as a response to the}} social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period. The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism <b>advocated</b> <b>a</b> hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism <b>advocated</b> <b>a</b> highly authoritarian government based on [...] punishments and laws. Mohism <b>advocated</b> <b>a</b> communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism. The Agrarians <b>advocated</b> <b>a</b> peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism <b>advocated</b> <b>a</b> proto-anarchism. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty, but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty. Prior to China's adoption of communism, State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.|$|R
