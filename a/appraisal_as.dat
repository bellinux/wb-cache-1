[...] Because of {{criticism}} of the 1939 edition, McNair almost immediately began work on an update, with Marshall, now the Army's Chief of Staff, directing that it be published no later than January 1, 1941. [...] The work on the 1941 edition was still in progress when McNair was again reassigned; when it was published it became the primary doctrinal document for the Army's World War II activities. [...] His efficiency reports continued to reflect his superior performance; for the first appraisal he received while commandant, Craig rated McNair second of the 41 brigadier generals he knew. [...] In an evaluation of his performance in his additional duty as commander of the Fort Leavenworth post, Major General Percy Poe Bishop, commander of the VII Corps Area, ranked McNair fifth of the 31 brigadier generals he knew. By {{the time of his}} second <b>appraisal</b> <b>as</b> commandant, the War Department had waived the requirement for written evaluations of officers supervised directly by the Army Chief of Staff, but in his second role as commander of Fort Leavenworth, Bishop rated McNair as superior in all areas, recommended him for a high level command in combat, and ranked him first of the more than 30 brigadier generals Bishop knew.|$|E

They advise that although multi-rater feedback can be effectively used for appraisal, care needs to be taken in its implementation or results will be compromised. This research suggests that 360-degree feedback and performance appraisals get at different outcomes. Therefore, traditional performance <b>appraisals</b> <b>as</b> well as 360-degree feedback should be used in evaluating overall performance.|$|R
30|$|The Transactional Model of Stress has {{attempted}} {{to address this question}} (Lazarus and Folkman 1984). The model outlines two processes involved in the stress response: stress appraisal (how an individual perceives a stressor), and coping (how the individual will respond to the stressor; Folkman and Lazarus 1980). Stress appraisal involves an evaluation of both the stressor, known <b>as</b> primary <b>appraisal,</b> and the individual’s perceived available resources for coping with the stressor, known <b>as</b> secondary <b>appraisal</b> (Folkman et al. 1986). Some researchers describe challenge and threat <b>appraisals</b> <b>as</b> a ratio of resources required to cope and resources available to cope, representing an individual’s belief in their own ability to cope with the stressor (e.g., Gallagher 1990; Lyons and Schneider 2005). Others, describe these two <b>appraisals</b> <b>as</b> an evaluation of gains and losses where challenge appraisal evaluates opportunities for success, learning and personal growth and threat appraisal evaluates potential danger to one’s wellbeing or self-esteem (e.g., Blascovich and Mendes 2000; Skinner and Brewer 2002). The present study adopted the latter perspective of gains and losses, as the focus was on the way in which a stressor is perceived.|$|R

5000|$|One study {{completed}} by Folkman et al. (1986) {{focuses on the}} relationship between appraisal and coping processes that are used across stressful events, and indicators of long-term adaptation. They define primary <b>appraisal</b> <b>as</b> [...] "the stakes a person has in a stressful encounter," [...] and secondary <b>appraisal</b> <b>as</b> [...] "options for coping." [...] Eighty-five California married couples with at least one child were the participants of the study, and they were interviewed in their homes once a month for 6 months. In each interview the subject was asked what their most stressful event was in the previous week, and then interviewer asked them structured questions about how they dealt with that stressor. There was a significant gender difference in primary appraisal. They also concluded that coping strategies were dependent upon psychological and somatic problems as well (Folkman, Lazarus, Gruen & DeLongis, 1986).|$|E

50|$|Some people {{experience}} the powerful conversations demanded by private leadership (e.g. performance <b>appraisals)</b> <b>as</b> uncomfortable. Consequently, leaders may avoid {{some of the}} private leadership behaviors (Scouller, 2011), which reduces their leadership effectiveness. Scouller argued that the intimacy of private leadership leads to avoidance behavior either {{because of a lack}} of skill or because of negative self-image beliefs that give rise to powerful fears of what may happen in such encounters. This is why personal leadership is so important in improving a leader's one-to-one skill and reducing his or her interpersonal fears.|$|R

In some countries there already exists a more sophisticated notion of MaaS, but many countries do not yet consider MaaS in national/regional and/or local mobility planning strategies. As a step in easing the way forward, this paper presents international stakeholders’ perspectives on and expectations for MaaS. In the context of the international MaaSiFiE (Mobility as a Service for Linking Europe) project, a state-of-the-art survey has been conducted, including a stakeholder questionnaire gathering different views of MaaS as input for developing a roadmap for MaaS deployment.

From the component processing perspective, emotion experience is said to require {{that all of these}} processes become coordinated and synchronized {{for a short period of}} time, driven by appraisal processes. Although the inclusion of cognitive <b>appraisal</b> <b>as</b> one of the elements is slightly controversial, since some theorists make the assumption that emotion and cognition are separate but interacting systems, the component processing model provides a sequence of events that effectively describes the coordination involved during an emotional episode.|$|E

This paper discriminates between in-house and outside <b>appraisals</b> <b>as</b> sources of smoothing bias in appraisal-based returns. There is reason to expect that in-house appraisal-based returns of open-end real estate funds are smoothed. For a large open-end real estate fund listed at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, an unusually detailed set of data is available, including observations of both in-house and outside appraisals. The empirical findings suggest that in-house appraisal-based returns are smoothed, whereas those based on independent outside appraisals are not. ...|$|R

50|$|The term {{appraisal}} rebound effects {{refers to}} the stronger activation of an <b>appraisal</b> <b>as</b> a result of trying to suppress it. At times appraisal rebounds effects can continue psychopathological symptoms. An example {{of this can be}} when patients with stress try to remove negative thoughts from their mind but fail to do so and observe the disorder symptoms appearing on the same scale or even greater at times.Wegner hypothesizes that suppressing appraisals involve two mechanisms. The first is the conscious suppression of the appraisal and seeking distractors to avoid appraisal. The second mechanism is the unconscious process of searching for the appraisal, and when finding one, it alerts the conscious mechanism to find more distractors. This process requires too much cognitive resources, and so the distractors often fail, and the appraisal can become hyperaccessible, perpetuating the appraisal.Chronic appraisals are related to the chronic emotions of individuals since the way they chronically perceive situations affect their emotions. When individuals who tend to appraise situations in negative ways try to suppress the appraisal, they {{will be more likely to}} appraise another event negatively as well, and perpetuate their negative emotions.|$|E

40|$|Stress {{has long}} been {{conceptualized}} as consisting of two factors, eustress, or good stress, and distress, or bad stress (Selye, 1956). The occupational stress literature identifies challenge stressors as those associated with favorable outcomes, and hindrance stressors as those associated with negative outcomes (Cavanaugh, Boswell, Roehling, 2 ̆ 6 Boudreau, 2000). The current study had three objectives: 1) to investigate occupational level stressor appraisal by K- 12 teachers, 2) to explore how {{the perception of the}} availability of resources influences individual level stressor appraisal, and 3) to test differential outcomes of challenge and hindrance stress. Results indicate that K- 12 teachers appraise workload as a hindrance stressor more than as a challenge stressor, which is contrary to existing management literature categorizing workload as challenge stressor. Perceived resources also accounted for significant variance in individual <b>appraisal</b> of stressors <b>as</b> a hindrance. Results pinpoint precise personal and organizational resources that contribute to stressor <b>appraisals</b> <b>as</b> a hindrance. Finally, hindrance stress significantly detracted from engagement while challenge stress did not affect work engagement...|$|R
