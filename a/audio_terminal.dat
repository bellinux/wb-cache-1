40|$|The {{selection}} of the audio multiplex control configuration for the Space Shuttle Orbiter audio subsystem is discussed and special attention {{is given to the}} evaluation criteria of cost, weight and complexity. The specifications and design of the subsystem are described and detail is given to configurations of the <b>audio</b> <b>terminal</b> and audio central control unit (ATU, ACCU). The audio input from the ACCU, at a signal level of - 12. 2 to 14. 8 dBV, nominal range, at 1 kHz, was found to have balanced source impedance and a balanced local impedance of 6000 + or - 600 ohms at 1 kHz, dc isolated. The Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) electroacoustic test laboratory, an audio engineering facility consisting of a collection of acoustic test chambers, analyzed problems of speaker and headset performance, multiplexed control data coupled with audio channels, and the Orbiter cabin acoustic effects on the operational performance of voice communications. This system allows technical management and project engineering to address key constraining issues, such as identifying design deficiencies of the headset interface unit and the assessment of the Orbiter cabin performance of voice communications, which affect the subsystem development...|$|E
40|$|Throughout this summer, {{a number}} of {{different}} projects were supported relating to various NASA programs, including the International Space Station (ISS) and Orion. The primary project that was worked on was designing and testing an acoustic diverter which could be used on the ISS to increase sound pressure levels in Node 1, a module that does not have any <b>Audio</b> <b>Terminal</b> Units (ATUs) inside it. This acoustic diverter is not intended to be a permanent solution to providing audio to Node 1; it is simply intended to improve conditions while more permanent solutions are under development. One of the most exciting aspects of this project is that the acoustic diverter is designed to be 3 D printed on the ISS, using the 3 D printer that was set up earlier this year. Because of this, no new hardware needs to be sent up to the station, and no extensive hardware testing needs to be performed on the ground before sending it to the station. Instead, the 3 D part file can simply be uploaded to the station's 3 D printer, where the diverter will be made...|$|E
40|$|To {{communicate}} with each other or ground support, crew members on board the International Space Station (ISS) currently use the <b>Audio</b> <b>Terminal</b> Units (ATU), which are located in each ISS module. However, to use the ATU, crew members must stop their current activity, travel to a panel, and speak into a wall-mounted microphone, or use either a handheld microphone or a Crew Communication Headset that is connected to a panel. These actions unnecessarily may increase task times, lower productivity, create cable management issues, and thus increase crew frustration. Therefore, the Habitability and Human Factors and Human Interface Branches at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) are currently investigating a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless communication system, Vocera(C), as a near-term solution for ISS communication. The objectives of the acoustics and intelligibility testing of this system were to answer the following questions: 1. How intelligibly can a human hear the transmitted message from a Vocera(c) badge in three different noise environments (Baseline = 20 dB, US Lab Module = 58 dB, Russian Module = 70. 6 dB) ? 2. How accurate is the Vocera(C) badge at recognizing voice commands in three different noise environments? 3. What body location (chest, upper arm, or shoulder) is optimal for speech intelligibility and voice recognition accuracy of the Vocera(C) badge on a human in three different noise environments...|$|E

30|$|In this context, {{acoustic}} echo cancellation (AEC) provides {{one of the}} best solutions to the control of {{acoustic echo}}es generated by hands-free <b>audio</b> <b>terminals.</b> The basic issue in AEC is then to estimate the impulse response between the loudspeaker and the microphone of the device. The most reliable solution to this problem is the use of an adaptive filter that generates at its output a replica of the echo, which is further subtracted from the microphone signal [1 – 9]. In other words, the adaptive filter has to model an unknown system (i.e., the acoustic echo path between the loudspeaker and the microphone), like in a “system identification” problem [10 – 12].|$|R
30|$|Hands-free <b>audio</b> <b>terminals</b> are {{required}} in many popular applications, such as mobile telephony and teleconferencing systems. An important {{issue that has}} to be addressed when dealing with such devices is the acoustic coupling between the loudspeaker and the microphone. Due to this coupling, the microphone of the device captures a signal coming from its own loudspeaker, known as the acoustic echo. This phenomenon is influenced by the environment’s characteristics, and it can be very disturbing for the users. For example, in a telephone conversation, the user could hear a replica of her/his own voice. Consequently, in order to enhance the overall quality of the communication, {{there is a need to}} cancel the unwanted acoustic echo.|$|R
40|$|NASA {{has been}} {{interested}} in wireless communications for many years, especially when the crew size of the International Space Station (ISS) was reduced to two members. NASA began a study {{to find ways to}} improve crew efficiency to make sure the ISS could be maintained with limited crew capacity and still be a valuable research testbed in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). Currently the ISS audio system requires astronauts to be tethered to the audio system, specifically a device called the <b>Audio</b> <b>Terminal</b> Unit (ATU). Wireless communications would remove the tether and allow astronauts to freely float from experiment to experiment without having to worry about moving and reconnecting the associated cabling or finding the space equivalent of an extension cord. A wireless communication system would also improve safety and reduce system susceptibility to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). Safety would be improved because a crewmember could quickly escape a fire while maintaining communications with the ground and other crewmembers at any location. In addition, it would allow the crew to overcome the volume limitations of the ISS ATU. This is especially important to the Portable Breathing Apparatus (PBA). The next generation of space vehicles and habitats also demand wireless attention. Orion will carry up to six crewmembers in a relatively small cabin. Yet, wireless could become a driving factor to reduce launch weight and increase habitable volume. Six crewmembers, each tethered to a panel, could result in a wiring mess even in nominal operations. In addition to Orion, research is being conducted to determine if Bluetooth is appropriate for Lunar Habitat applications...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Group <b>Audio</b> <b>Terminals</b> (GATs) are {{terminals}} {{which have}} been specifically designed {{to be used by}} several users. GATs cover a wide range of products ranging from the hands-free telephone when it is used by several users, to the sophisticated teleconference studio. The CCITT recommends that GATs satisfy the specifications in this Recommendation. GATs must also comply with Recommendation P. 34 as far as loudness is concerned, when they are connected to the telephone network. If they use voice-activated circuits, Recommendation P. 34 may also be applied. Such terminals are sensitive to the acoustics of the location where they are utilized and they may resort to sophisticated acoustical echo processing devices. The first generation of GATs will operate mainly on 4 -wire digital networks and will make use of the wideband (WB) speech coding algorithm specified in Recommendation G. 722. Such terminals urgently need specifications that can be based on the present Recommendation...|$|R
