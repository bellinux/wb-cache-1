5|$|Clock Tower was commercially successful, selling {{close to}} half a million copies.

The game's horror atmosphere and storyline were praised, although most other aspects {{were found to be}} mediocre. Most of the negative critique was directed towards the game's slow pace, which was compared unfavorably to other PlayStation games of the era, particularly the more action-oriented and fast-paced Resident Evil. These factors influenced some critics to recommend Clock Tower purely for point-and-click adventure fans.|$|E

5|$|Although a British frigate {{squadron}} under Josias Rowley {{was under}} orders {{to eliminate the}} French raiders, Rowley was distracted by the planned invasion of Île Bonaparte, which began the following week.

The attack on Île Bonaparte was however part of a wider British strategy to seize and capture French raiding bases, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of the operation severely limited future French operations as Hamelin's squadron was required for the defence of Île de France.

In Europe, the series did not become established prior to the release of Persona 3 and 4, both of which were highly successful in the region. According to Atlus CEO Naoto Hiraoka, the main turning point for the franchise was the release of Persona 3, which was a commercial success and brought the series {{to the attention of the}} mainstream gaming community. Persona 4 received an even better reception. The Persona series' success has allowed Atlus to build a strong player base in the West, contributing to the success of other titles such as Catherine.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{alternative}} rock's mainstream prominence declined due to {{a number}} of events that caused grunge and Britpop to fade and led to the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival.

Emo attracted attention in the larger alternative rock world, and the term was applied to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts. During the late 1990s and 2000s, other alternative rock bands emerged, including The White Stripes, The Strokes and Arcade Fire.|$|E
5|$|Cage {{dedicated}} Sonatas and Interludes to Maro Ajemian, {{a pianist}} and friend. Ajemian performed the work many times since 1949, {{including one of}} the first performances of the complete cycle on January 12, 1949, in Carnegie Hall. On many other occasions in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Cage performed it himself. Critical reaction was uneven, but mostly positive, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of Sonatas and Interludes led to a grant from the Guggenheim Foundation, which Cage received in 1949, allowing him to make a six-month trip to Europe. There he met Olivier Messiaen, who helped organize a performance of the work for his students in Paris on June 7, 1949; and he befriended Pierre Boulez, who became an early admirer of the work and wrote a lecture about it for the June 17, 1949 performance at the salon of Suzanne Tézenas in Paris. While still living in Paris, Cage began writing String Quartet in Four Parts, yet another work influenced by Indian philosophy.|$|E
