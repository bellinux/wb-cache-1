Front discs with {{anti-lock}} braking (<b>ABS)</b> <b>and</b> electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) are standard across the range. In common with many other mid- or rear-engined vehicles its fifteen-inch wheels have uneven-sized tires, 145/65 on the fronts and wider 175/55 on the rears, in an effort to minimise the chances of oversteer caused by the rear-biased weight distribution.|$|E

25|$|January 1, 2000 (the {{first day}} of the new millennium) saw a {{significantly}} revamped version of the logo. In this version, the outlined black box that enclosed the three rings and the vertical line (that maintained their 1996 design) was replaced by a grey square (a crystal plane when rendered in 3D) and the <b>ABS</b> <b>and</b> CBN names joined together to form ABS-CBN's name, now situated below the symbol. The ABS-CBN letters were also given a completely revamped look.|$|E
25|$|The logo of pre-merger Alto Broadcasting System had {{a symbol}} {{composed}} of a transmitter with a circle denoting its signals, a precursor of sorts to ABS-CBN's current logos. The logo of pre-merger Chronicle Broadcasting Network, on the other hand, had three blocks and the CBN letters in them. In 1961, the ABS-CBN brand was introduced and its first logo had a big letter B, unifying the names <b>ABS</b> <b>and</b> CBN, in a box placed between their channel numbers 3 (ABS' DZAQ-TV) and 9 (CBN's DZXL-TV).|$|E
25|$|Another {{addition}} is the Media Nav system, already introduced {{earlier in}} the same year on the Lodgy, consisting of a 7-inch touchscreen display with multimedia functions and a navigation software included. Other new features are speed limiter, cruise control, rear parking sensors, and front and side airbags, as well as <b>ABS</b> <b>and</b> ESP, as standard. The interior has been significantly revised, with new chromed elements added, and the hood is now supported with a strut. A new Eco button, placed on the dashboard, limits the engine revs to 4,000 rpm.|$|E

25|$|Standard {{equipment}} was significantly improved with remote central locking, heated & electrically adjustable mirrors, 2 front- and 2 sideairbags, power brakes with <b>ABS</b> <b>and</b> power windows being standard on every car. Trim levels varied for each market as did equipment {{levels of the}} most basic trims. In the United States, the badging denoted the engine variant and to some extent the equipment level, whereas in Europe engines and options could be chosen individually. In all markets more powerful versions received better or upgraded standard equipment. The T5 and R were the series high-performance models.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{features}} on the ES 350 included dual front airbags, knee airbags, side-torso and curtain airbags, along with traction control, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), anti-lock brakes (<b>ABS),</b> <b>and</b> electronic brake-force distribution (EBD). A pre-collision system (PCS), which incorporates a grille-mounted sensor and retracts seatbelts and triggers full braking power, was optional, and came with the distance-aware Dynamic Radar Cruise Control system. The front passenger airbag used a twin-chamber design for reduced occupant discomfort upon deployment. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test results in 2007 rated the ES 350 the maximum five stars in the Frontal Driver, Frontal Passenger, and Side Driver categories, and four stars in the Side Rear Passenger and Rollover categories.|$|E
25|$|McLennan {{spent almost}} all {{his career at}} the ABS. Initially, he worked on {{sampling}} and methodology, then was promoted to Assistant Statistician in 1973. He left the ABS in 1979 to become Victorian Deputy Commonwealth Statistician in Melbourne but shortly afterwards, {{he was promoted to}} First Assistant Statistician and returned to the ABS as the head of Coordination and Management Division, where he led a review of the Census and Statistics Act in the early 1980s. He oversaw the establishment of the corporate planning system and the production of the ABS's first Corporate Plan in 1987. He championed the adoption of PC and Internet technologies to reduce the cost structure in the <b>ABS</b> <b>and</b> improved the readability of statistical output.

25|$|A {{modified}} version of ABS' symbol was launched in 1963, composed of a triangle denoting a transmitter tower and four circles denoting its signals (in the same vein as the 1953 logo), enclosed in a rounded box and with the ABS-CBN text above, {{in a form that}} would evolve over the years. The logo soon after took on its current iteration—a vertical line, denoting a transmitter tower, with three concentric circles signifying Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, enclosed in a square frame, in 1967. At that time, it was rendered in black and white because color TV (despite {{the fact that it was}} ABS-CBN that introduced it the previous year) wasn't common yet and the logo style at that time separated <b>ABS</b> <b>and</b> CBN's names, putting ABS' name on top and CBN's on the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Greater issues {{arose in}} the 1990’s, when supermodel Kate Moss popularized the stick-thin figure instead. The fashion {{industry}} pushed her image further with the ‘heroin-chic’ look, which dominated the catwalks during that time. This was communicated through waifish appearances, bony structures, thin limbs, and an androgynous figure. Although this extreme period was only short-lived, the 2000’s saw {{the rise of the}} Victoria’s Secret models, who altered beauty norms to include slim but healthy figures, with large breasts and bottoms, flat and visible <b>abs,</b> <b>and</b> prominent thigh gaps. Hence, women started pursuing cosmetic surgery practices; on top of diets and exercise regimes, to attain the perfect appearance. Nevertheless, curves are back in season and positive measures are now being taken to promote a better body image. The emergence of fitness trends, plus-size models, and other better role models in the fashion and media industries are other factors at work too. Contrariwise, the advancement of technologies, and the pressures from the media, has unfortunately triggered an even greater societal importance on the way we look as an indication of our personal value.|$|E
25|$|Multisocket {{adaptors}} {{allow the}} connection {{of two or more}} plugs to a simple socket. They are manufactured in various configurations, depending on the country and the region in which they are used, with various ratings. In Europe for example, they are called double or triple adaptors, and transform a one socket into a multiple socket. This has the advantage of connecting more than one electrical consumer item to one single socket and is mainly used for low power devices (TV sets, table lamps, computers, etc.). They are usually rated at 6A 250V, 10A 250V, or 16A 250V, however this is the general rating of the adaptor (for example, if we have an adaptor for four sockets and it is marked 16A 250V, this means that the adaptor should not be loaded more than 16A, whether one, two, three or all sockets are used. Some people overload them, thus leading to accidents). In some countries these adaptors are banned and are not available in shops, as they may lead to fires due to overloading them. In the past, these adaptors were made from ceramic, Bakelite or other fire resistant plastics, but nowadays they are made from various available plastics that can be safely used in electrical devices (such as PA6, PVC, PP). Some low quality adaptors are made from plastics not approved for electrical use (such as PS or non fire resistant <b>ABS),</b> <b>and</b> these may cause fires in the case of overheating due to overloading or bad contacts.|$|E

500|$|Tammareddy Bharadwaja said [...] "Ever since Arundhati and Magadheera {{did well}} at the box office, {{the rest of the}} {{industry}} started following their footsteps. Also, since there is an irrational craze to make high budget films right now, producers are turning towards mythological films. It is the only genre where you can boast of spending crores for creating the sets and the look of the film. But what they don't realize is that if these films flop, the blow to the producer will be severe." [...] Films like Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011) and Shakti (2011) were commercial failures and Badrinath (2012) was an average grosser; all being fantasy films in which the protagonist is a warrior. The promos of Badrinath looked similar to Magadheera and the former's director V. V. Vinayak along with its male lead Allu Arjun kept insisting that Badrinath is dissimilar to Magadheera. Producer Natti Kumar said [...] "If a hero delivers a hit, producers run after him for five years and burn their fingers only after six or eight flops. It's the same story with movies. Since Magadheera became a hit, every other hero and director wants to do period film where there is scope to spend crores. They don't work on the script, story or relevance. It is a pure display of graphics, heroes' <b>abs</b> <b>and</b> grandeur. The plot is lost. Magadheera worked because it was a novel genre then, but why will people want to see the same things again?".|$|E
