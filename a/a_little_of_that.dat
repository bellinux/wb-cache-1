2500|$|As {{with both}} the {{original}} Dark Fall and the sequel, , Jonathan Boakes worked primarily alone on Lost Souls, writing, designing and programming the game, as well as voicing several characters, designing the sound effects (with Matt Clark), and composing the music (with Ben Gammons). Boakes has said he prefers working on the Dark Fall games without a development team as [...] "the worlds of Dowerton and Fetch Rock are created from an informed imagination, using textures and sounds from the world around me. I think <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> personality would be lost if tackled by a small team." [...] Of Lost Souls, he felt working alone helped him establish the game's atmosphere of isolation; [...] "working alone {{in the dim light}} of the Darkling Room is the best way to approach this game [...] It's an eerie, isolating experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sam Jordison of The Guardian wrote, [...] "It is near impossible, I would say, not to {{root for}} Tom Ripley. Not to like him. Not, on some level, to want him to win. Patricia Highsmith does a fine job of {{ensuring}} he wheedles his way into our sympathies." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert made a similar appraisal of the character in his review of Purple Noon, Rene Clement's 1960 film adaptation of The Talented Mr. Ripley: [...] "Ripley is a criminal of intelligence and cunning who gets away with murder. He's charming and literate, and a monster. It's insidious, the way Highsmith seduces us into identifying with him and sharing his selfishness; Ripley believes that getting his own way is worth whatever price anyone else might have to pay. We all have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> in us." [...] Novelist Sarah Waters esteemed The Talented Mr. Ripley as the [...] "one book I wish I'd written." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alex Pappademas of Grantland {{called the}} film [...] "the first truly joyous popcorn action {{movie of the}} season" [...] and praised Edwards' {{restrained}} direction, stating, [...] "I admired Edwards’s restraint, a quality I’m not accustomed to admiring in $160 million summer action movies." [...] Richard Roeper stated, [...] "Edwards and his team produce consistently stunning visuals", but admitted that he [...] "would have liked {{to see more of}} Godzilla" [...] but stated that the film is [...] "leaps and bounds ahead of the 1998 bomb" [...] and awarded the film a B+ rating. Tom Russo of the Boston Globe felt the film [...] "is an uneven spectacle that can’t sustain its solid first-half character moments" [...] but did state the film [...] "can also flash a surprising, often clever sense of legacy, and is intermittently capable of thrilling us" [...] and praised the film's special effects, stating, [...] "Crafted with motion-capture technology and an aesthetic eye toward tradition, Godzilla is convincingly rendered here, making for some genuinely electrifying moments" [...] but did feel that the third act's battle was [...] "overkill" [...] and that the principal characters were lackluster, stating the film [...] "needs performances that ground it — and they’re just not coming from Taylor-Johnson, Watanabe, {{and the rest of the}} thespian soldiers and flabbergasted biologists who dominate the second hour" [...] and concluded by stating, [...] "Godzilla, Watanabe breathlessly hypothesizes, 'is here to restore balance.'

2500|$|Clarice {{is one of}} the escaped {{inmates and}} was {{originally}} intended to be an homage to Chop Top Sawyer, a character from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, but was later developed into her own character. Seth M. Sherwood stated that [...] "When you see her, you can see <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> DNA in there", describing Chop Top as his favourite Sawyer. A revisionist take on Chop Top was added due to the diminished role of the family in earlier drafts of the script, but was removed when the filmmakers began to feel that she was more of a [...] "rip-off" [...] than a genuine tribute. The version of Clarice that appears in the final film emerged when Sherwood imagined [...] "an image of this little girl in pigtails burning down her house with her parents inside". Out of all the performances in Leatherface, Sherwood called Jessica Madsen's the most accurate of what he envisioned while writing. Deciding that Clarice is [...] "much more than just a pyromaniac", Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo removed scenes detailing her backstory, such as her weaponising fire for the first time, her addiction for [...] "watching the flames dancing", and exposition on her family's disappearance. As the film begins, it remains ambiguous as to which inmate is actually Jedidiah Sawyer, the eventual Leatherface. Maury and Bustillo even considered leading the audience to believe that Clarice could become the titular character, [...] "It wasn’t a so crazy idea to have regarding the passion Leatherface had for dresses and makeup in the previous movies." ...|$|E
