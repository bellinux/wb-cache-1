BUHK is chosen to research location because based on observations begin result, a lot of activities in each sub-division potentially create vital archives. This situation is not supported by good human resources and infrastructure. Method of this research is case study with qualitative approach. Data collection techniques that used in this research are documentation, interview and observation. Data validity is done by triangulation technique. Informants of this research are 6 sub-division chiefs, 10 stafs, service & information coordinator of Archives Unit, and Unnes archivist. The results of this research showed that BUHK UNNES has not identified vital archives yet. Based on law analysis and risk analysis, there are 38 types of archives included in the vital category, they are consisted of: 11 % of administrative archives, 21 % law archives, 8 % employment archives, 18 % household archives, 34 % archives of goods goverment own <b>archieves,</b> and 8 % leader activity <b>archieves.</b> Vital archives preservation is done by several staff whose duties are related with vital archives.

The paper is divided into two volumes. The first one, together with the consultation of the <b>archieves,</b> delves into the following: 1. His poetical works: subject matters, critisism he received, prerequisites of poetry, metaphors and symbols, irony, structure patterns - orality, repeated verse, syntactic patterns of the complete structure, narrative poem, haiku - intertextuality. 2. His prose: featurew as developed in the five elements: space, time, myth, characters, narrative patterns. 3. His critical work as depicted in his reviews, his essay on poetry and poetics and the "anthology" of the second postwar generation. The second volume consists of the poets <b>archieves</b> (AAE), his bibliography, the time log and the appendix with the seven unpublished or hard to find texts. Evagelou mantainss the tradition established by Anagnostakis and Christianopoulos in Thessaloniki and he is the last representative of experiential, confessional writing produced there around 1960. In addition, he functions as a link between the poets of his generation, a role verified with his "anthology". ...|$|R
