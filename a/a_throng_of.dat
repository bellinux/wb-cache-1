25|$|The most {{dramatic}} {{moments of the}} 1974 Carnation Revolution occurred near the DGS headquarters at António Maria Cardoso Street in Lisbon. Unidentified agents - desperate after being surrounded by rebellious troops and <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> civilians - opened fire {{from the top of}} the building, killing four demonstrators. In turn, a DGS agent was also killed by the rebellious troops when trying to escape. These five people were the only victims of the coup d'état which brought down the dictatorship.|$|E

25|$|Prince Faisal, who was {{captured}} directly after the attack, {{was at first}} officially declared insane, but following the trial a panel of Saudi medical experts decided that he was sane when he shot the king. The nation's high religious court convicted him of regicide and sentenced him to execution. He was beheaded {{in the public square}} in Riyadh. The public execution took place on 18June 1975 at 4:30pmthree hours before sundownbefore <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> thousands at the AlHukm Palace (Palace of Justice).|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, Paisley {{gathered}} <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> Orangemen {{and tried}} to push through the police lines, but was arrested. Loyalists threw missiles at the police {{and tried to}} break through the blockade; police responded with plastic bullets. In support of the Orangeman, loyalists blocked roads across Northern Ireland, and there were attacks on Catholics and the police. The march was eventually allowed to continue through the Catholic area. As the march ended, Paisley and David Trimble held hands in the air {{in what appeared to be}} a gesture of triumph, causing considerable ill-feeling among the Catholic residents.|$|E
25|$|Blue overhears Blondie {{relaying}} Babydoll's plan to Gorski, confirming {{his suspicions}} {{that something is}} amiss. He has Sweet Pea locked in a utility closet and confronts the other girls backstage. He shoots Amber and Blondie and attempts to rape Babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his master key. Babydoll frees Sweet Pea and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while they look for an exit. They escape into the courtyard, where they find <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> men blocking their way. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact her own sacrifice. She concludes that this is actually Sweet Pea's story. Despite Sweet Pea's protests, she insists on revealing herself to the visitors, thus distracting them long enough to allow her friend to slip away unnoticed.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of June, the ship proceeded to its next assignment—as visit ship at Annapolis, Maryland during the Naval Academy's June Week. She returned to Little Creek on 8 June and resumed local duty {{until the end of}} the month. On the 30 June, the ship headed up Chesapeake Bay once again, this time ascending the Potomac River to Washington, D. C. That weekend the ship moored at the Washington Navy Yard, where she hosted <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> visitors ship during the Independence Day holiday. After returning to Little Creek on 5 July, Barnstable County embarked Marine Corps reservists later in the week for a training exercise at Onslow Beach on the North Carolina coast. The exercise began on 11 July and continued through 19 July. She carried out two more reserve training landings at Little Creek's Anzio Beach during the last week of July and the first week in August. On 10 August, she headed for the West Indies once more to serve as a launch platform for target drone missiles. Barnstable County made a three-day port visit at Nassau in the Bahamas before picking up the drones at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. After the exercise, she spent several days in St. Thomas, and then steamed back to Little Creek.|$|E
25|$|On {{the trip}} back to Lisbon he stopped in England, {{arriving}} on December 30, 1827. He was met by the Duke of Clarence, the Admiral of the English Navy, and by other upper members of the English Court who had gathered at the dock to meet him. Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, then leading an unpopular Tory government, hoped that they could mold Miguel into accepting the constitutional framework that Peter IV had devised, and used this visit to facilitate the transition. After lunching at the Hospital Governor's home, he traveled to London with his entourage in regal carriages and, escorted by cavalry officers, to the Palace of Westminster where he was met by <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> people. While in London he stayed at the palace of Lord Dudley, on Arlington Street where he entertained his new friends; he was received by the ministers, ambassadors and municipal officials of King George IV, and was generally feted by English nobility, attending concerts and pheasant hunts, and visiting public works (such as the Tamisa tunnel which was then under construction and, ironically, collapsed after his visit). On New Year's Eve he visited the King at Windsor Castle and was honored with a magnificent banquet. Later at Rutland House, Miguel received members of the Portuguese diaspora living in England, who presented him with a commemorative medallion. Throughout his visit he was generally well received.|$|E

In 1995, U.S. President Bill Clinton quoted it in his welcoming remarks to John Paul II, starting the papal visit to address the United Nations in New York City. Nancy Pelosi quoted the prayer when she became Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2007, as did her successor John Boehner when he resigned in 2015.|$|E

500|$|The {{account that}} follows {{is one of}} the most {{extensive}} and exciting episodes of the Catalogue to survive from antiquity. Atalanta wished to avoid marriage, but <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> suitors gathered because of her beauty. Her father Schoeneus promised her hand to the one who could beat his swift daughter in a footrace, with one further condition: any who accepted the challenge and lost would be put to death. Aphrodite had given one of the contestants, Hippomenes, three golden apples with which to temp the girl off course; these he threw as he ran and begged Atalanta to have pity upon him. The toss of the third apple finally accomplished its aim, but the couple did not live happily after: through the will of Zeus Atalanta was transformed into lion because she had seen [...] "what it is not lawful to see," [...] which presumably means that she had unlawfully entered a holy precinct. This is where the evidence for Atalanta leaves off, and it remains unknown just where and how the passage fit in the Catalogue.|$|E
500|$|The {{girl from}} the {{previous}} animation is now an adult, wearing a bunny costume. She fights off a multitude of sci-fi monsters and mobile suits then jumps into <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> Metron Seijin and tosses them aside. She is then in a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader, with Stormtroopers sitting {{in the background and}} the Death Star enshrined in one corner. From atop a cliff, a xenomorph with artificial legs, wielding the Discovery One, knocks the girl down with an energy burst and the Dynaman robot (Dyna Robo) attempts to crush her. The girl lifts Dyna Robo off her with superhuman strength and smashes it against a cliff. The Stormbringer suddenly appears in the sky, and the girl jumps on it, riding it like a surfboard. A few scenes unconnected to the main plot are shown, such as Yoda as Yū Ida given a Japanese comedy routine with various characters in the audience. The girl is still riding the Stormbringer when she runs into a formation of Ultrahawk 1's. Then the Yamato, the Arcadia attached to the transformed SDF-1 Macross appear, along with an exploding VF-1 Valkyrie variable fighter from Macross armed with a Gundam-style beam saber. An air battle unfolds in an otaku coffee shop. The girl is then seen in a world filled with American comic superheroes. A host of machines and characters (from The Lord of the Rings, Conan, Narnia, Pern, and others) fly past her into space, including a Klingon battle cruiser, the moon ship from H. G. Wells' First Men in the Moon, the Millennium Falcon, Lord Jaxom and the Thunderbirds. Once back on land, the girl jumps off the Stormbringer and it splits into seven parts, which fly though the sky spewing smoke in seven colors. A sequence of famous spaceships crashing into each other is shown. Then, suddenly, [...] "what could only be described as an atomic bomb" [...] explodes over an unpopulated city, leaving behind a flurry of sakura petals. Successive upheavals of the Earth give birth to new worlds. As a beam launched by the Daicon traverses the sky, lush greenery sprouts and grows. The camera then pans over a massive crowd of fictional characters, the sun rises, the camera zooms out to the solar system, and the film ends with an image of the Daicon logo.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{formative}} events in Gorrell's life occurred {{near the end of}} his [...] "yearling" [...] year. At about ten o'clock on the morning of May 29, 1910, Cadet Corporal Gorrell joined <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> cadets trying to catch a glimpse of a historical event in the making. Pioneer aviator Glenn Curtiss was attempting to complete the first true cross-country flight in the United States, between Albany and New York City. An hour earlier a member of the academy staff had telephoned Curtiss during a refueling stop near Poughkeepsie urging him to land on the parade ground so that the cadets could inspect the craft but was turned down. The Corps had then assembled at Trophy Point.|$|E
2500|$|One {{week after}} the event, The Wall Street Journal wrote that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia {{delivered}} a second rebuke in one week to Chávez from a king, when he reminded Chávez that oil {{should not be used}} as a tool for conflict.

In a followup at the OPEC summit, Reuters wrote that [...] "Spain's king cannot shut Chavez up but bladder can", and that Chávez said to <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> reporters at the OPEC summit, [...] "For a while now, I have needed {{to go to the bathroom}} and I am going to pee ...

As she rode through Manhattan to her hotel, she was able {{get a sense of}} the publicity that would hallmark her US tour. An electric sign in Times Square announced to all that [...] "Gertrude Stein Has Arrived". Her six-month tour of the country encompassed 191 days of travel, criss-crossing 23 states and visiting 37 cities. Stein prepared her lectures for each stop-over in a formally structured way, and the audience was limited to five hundred attendees for each venue. She spoke, reading from notes, and provided for an audience question and answer period at the end of her presentation.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1912 Jack Joyce's Wild West Show was {{appearing}} at Coliseum in London. Later, in May of that year, {{it was the}} big attraction at the New Hippodrome Palast in Berlin. The popular American cowboy had with him about a half dozen boys from Texas and a troupe of fake Indians. The [...] "demand for a wild west show {{is so great that}} the Germans don't worry about the genuineness of the red skin--all they want is the excitement connected with the show." [...] Joyce had a pretty strong feeling for cowgirls. Although they were not easily found in Berlin, he did not worry. He made a selection among <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> Berlin maidens and trained them to be cowgirls. In 1916 Jack Joyce was doing well with his circus and wild west show touring Sweden.

2500|$|The four {{band members}} {{descended from the}} {{aircraft}} dressed in happi coats bearing the JAL logo. Their attire was a publicity coup for the airline, who, recognising the value of being associated with the Beatles' financial success, had instructed one of its First Class flight attendants {{to ensure that the}} band emerged wearing these traditional Japanese coats. Faced with a wall of glaring lights, the four musicians believed they were waving to <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> fans, as was usual when they arrived in a new country. In fact, they were surrounded by security personnel, and only twenty members of the public were present to witness their arrival. Supervised by a large police presence, the band's fans were instead organised in groups along the road into the city. In a 2016 feature article on the Beatles' Tokyo concerts, The Japan Times said that the photograph of the group dressed in JAL happi coats and descending from the plane had become [...] "an iconic image of the Beatles' visit".|$|E

Symbolically, the moment was pregnant with promise for the republic, this birth of a new national institution whose future power, admittedly, still existed only in the eyes and minds of just a few visionary Americans. Impressively bewigged and swathed in their robes of office, Chief Justice John Jay and three associate justices — William Cushing of Massachusetts, James Wilson of Pennsylvania, and John Blair of Virginia — sat augustly before <b>a</b> <b>throng</b> <b>of</b> spectators and waited for something to happen.
