25|$|Epinephrine, {{also known}} as <b>adrenalin</b> or adrenaline, is a {{medication}} and hormone. As a medication, {{it is used to}} treat a number of conditions, including anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, and superficial bleeding. Inhaled epinephrine may be used to improve the symptoms of croup. It may also be used for asthma when other treatments are not effective. It is given intravenously, by injection into a muscle, by inhalation, or by injection just under the skin.|$|E
25|$|Epinephrine, {{also known}} as <b>adrenalin</b> or adrenaline, is a hormone, neurotransmitter, and medication. Epinephrine is {{normally}} produced by both the adrenal glands and certain neurons. It {{plays an important role}} in the fight-or-flight response by increasing blood flow to muscles, output of the heart, pupil dilation, and blood sugar. It does this by binding to alpha and beta receptors. It is found in many animals and some single cell organisms. Napoleon Cybulski first isolated epinephrine in 1895.|$|E
25|$|A {{new chapter}} was opened when Max Lewandowsky in 1899 in Berlin {{observed}} that adrenal extracts acted {{on the smooth}} muscle of the eye and orbit of cats – as the iris dilator muscle and nictitating membrane – {{in the same way}} as sympathetic nerve stimulation. The correspondence was extended by John Newport Langley and, under his supervision, Thomas Renton Elliott in Cambridge. In four papers in volume 31, 1904, of the Journal of Physiology Elliott described the similarities organ by organ. His visionary hypothesis stands in the abstract of a presentation to the Physiological Society of May 21, 1904, a little over ten years after Oliver and Schäfer’s presentation: ″Adrenalin does not excite sympathetic ganglia when applied to them directly, as does nicotine. Its effective action is localised at the periphery. … I find that even after … complete denervation, whether of three days’ or ten months’ duration, the plain muscle of the dilatator pupillae will respond to <b>adrenalin,</b> and that with greater rapidity and longer persistence than does the iris whose nervous relations are uninjured. Therefore, it cannot be than <b>adrenalin</b> excites any structure derived from, and dependent for its persistence on, the peripheral neurone. … The point at which the stimulus of the chemical excitant is received, and transformed into what may cause the change of tension of the muscle fibre, is perhaps a mechanism developed out of the muscle cell in response to its union with the synapsing sympathetic fibre, the function of which is to receive and transform the nervous impulse. <b>Adrenalin</b> might then be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when the impulse arrives at the periphery.″ The abstract is the ″birth certificate″ of chemical neurotransmission. Elliott was never so explicit again. It seems he was discouraged by the lack of a favourable response from his seniors, Langley in particular, and a few years later he left physiological research.|$|E

500|$|Among the {{earliest}} hardcore bands, regarded as having {{made the first}} recordings in the style, were Southern California's Middle Class and Black Flag. Bad Brains—all of whom were black, a rarity in punk of any era—launched the D.C. scene with their rapid-paced single 'Pay to Cum" [...] in 1980. Austin, Texas's Big Boys, San Francisco's Dead Kennedys, and Vancouver's D.O.A. were among the other initial hardcore groups. They were soon joined by bands such as the Minutemen, Descendents, Circle Jerks, Adolescents, and T.S.O.L. in Southern California; D.C.'s Teen Idles, Minor Threat, and State of Alert; and Austin's MDC and the Dicks. By 1981, hardcore was the dominant punk rock style not only in California, {{but much of the}} rest of North America as well. A New York hardcore scene grew, including the relocated Bad Brains, New Jersey's Misfits and <b>Adrenalin</b> O.D., and local acts such as the Mob, Reagan Youth, and Agnostic Front. Beastie Boys, who would become famous as a hip-hop group, debuted that year as a hardcore band. They were followed by the Cro-Mags, Murphy's Law, and Leeway. By 1983, St. Paul's Hüsker Dü, Willful Neglect, Chicago's Naked Raygun, Indianapolis's Zero Boys, and D.C.'s the Faith were taking the hardcore sound in experimental and ultimately more melodic directions. Hardcore would constitute the American punk rock standard throughout the decade. The lyrical content of hardcore songs is often critical of commercial culture and middle-class values, as in Dead Kennedys' celebrated [...] "Holiday in Cambodia" [...] (1980).|$|E

The report stated: [...] "This 26-year-old male reportedly collapsed during a group meeting described as a self-improvement seminar. A complete autopsy determined no anatomic cause of death. ... Available history indicates that Mr. Slee collapsed in a situation in which high emotional stress could be expected. Such emotional stress may have neural and hormonal effects that are deleterious to cardiac rhythm." [...] The New Haven Register reported that Chief Medical Examiner Catherine Galvin said that [...] "arrhythmia, an electrical malfunction of the heart, {{is believed to have been}} the cause of Slee's death, but it couldn't be verified". [...] Galvin said that stressful situations can cause such an arrhythmia: [...] "In a stress situation you've got <b>adrenalin</b> pumping into the circulation. That can trigger it." [...] According to the Boston Phoenix, the pathologist that had examined Slee's body stated: [...] "I don’t like the word 'fright', but there are recognized entities of sudden death", though it may not be possible to determine the cause, [...] "where emotions come into play" [...] such as an instance where an individual believes that a curse will harm them. On November 19, 1983, the New Haven Register reported that police were [...] "no longer actively investigating the case", and went on to note that therefore [...] "any connection between Slee's death and his experiences at the seminar" [...] were not likely to be confirmed.|$|E

Thus, in 1899, with 50 local porters and Zurbriggen, the Workmans began to explore the Biafo Glacier in the Karakoram, but dangerous crevasses and poor weather forced them instead to shift to the Skoro La Glacier and the unclimbed peaks around it. They reached Siegfriedhorn, an 18,600-foot (5,700 m) summit that she named after her son, giving Fanny an altitude record for women at the time. They next camped at [...] and climbed a higher peak of , naming it Mount Bullock Workman. Admiring the view of a far-off mountain, they commented on the grand view: they were looking at K2, the second-highest mountain in the world.

It was very challenging: they had to hire new porters, establish a new base camp, and remain overnight at around [...] In the morning, they climbed a wall that measured , and were buffeted by winds. During the summit push, Fanny's fingers were so numb that she could no longer hold her ice ax and one of the porters abandoned them. Pauly writes, [...] "propelled to the summit by <b>adrenalin</b> and desperation, the foursome lingered only long enough for their instruments to assess that the temperature was ten degrees Fahrenheit [...] and their elevation was 21,000 feet." [...] Fanny was a [...] "slow, relentless, and intrepid" [...] climber; [...] "bearlike, she solidly planted one foot and then groped for another secure grip with the other". Climbing {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, she did not have specialized equipment like pitons or carabiners. She was able to climb to such heights, Pauly argues, because of [...] "her dauntless persistence and her immunity to altitude sickness".|$|E

2500|$|By the 1890s, the {{profound}} effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, {{setting off a}} search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations {{for the development of}} new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897, John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. [...] Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name <b>Adrenalin.</b> Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.|$|E
