40|$|We {{present results}} {{concerning}} the nitriding eects on phase transformations in Fe { 40 at. % Mn and Fe { 50 at. % Mn alloys. These alloys were studied {{by means of}} X-ray diraction and Mössbauer-eect spectroscopy methods at room tempera-ture. Results indicate that, after nitriding, in the absorption spectra of these alloys appears lines with hyperne eld H 330 kOe which corresponds to the eld on the 57 Fe nuclei in the -Fe. Annealing of the alloys at 650 C temperature (nitriding temperature) in argon atmosphere do not change {{the form of the}} Mössbauer absorp-tion spectra.

40|$|Using Cassini plasma and {{magnetic}} field observations from the dawn meridian of Saturn s outer magnetosphere to Saturn s magnetotail region, we investigate {{the applicability of}} the centrifugal instability model by Sittler et al. [2006] for Saturn s auroral response to the solar wind, versus the reconnection model of Saturn s aurora by Cowley et al. [2005]. We use Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS) and Electron Plasma Spectrometer (ELS) observations to characterize the plasma environment. ELS and magnetometer observations are used to map out the morphology of the outer magnetosphere from dawn to midnight local time. IMS observations are used to measure plasma flow velocities from which one can infer rotation versus convective flows. IMS composition measurements are used to trace the source of plasma from the inner magnetosphere (protons, H 2 and water group ions) versus an external solar wind source (protons <b>and</b> <b>Heff</b> ions). A critical parameter for both models is the strength of the convection electric field with respect to the rotational electric field for the large scale magnetosphere. Is there a significant return flow from the magnetotail? Pitch angle distributions also play an important role as a discriminator. If the magnetosphere tends to conserve angular momentum as suggested by Sittler et al. [2006], then we expect to see an anti-correlation between rotational flow component and radial flow velocities. All will be investigated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{perpendicular}} {{magnetic material}} was {{obtained in the}} annealed Co/native oxide/Pd multilayer films. Upon thermal annealing in a vacuum, a sharp transition of magnetic anisotropy from in-plane to out-of-plane is observed for the Co/native oxide/Pd multilayers with 20 Å Co layers. These annealed Co/native oxide/Pd multilayers possess extremely large effect perpendicular anisotropy field (<b>Heff)</b> <b>and</b> perpendicular anisotropy energy (Ku), with the maximum Heff of 17 kOe and Ku of 5. 1 × 10 6 erg/cm 3 obtained in the annealed Co(20 Å) /native oxide/Pd(10 Å) multilayers. Moreover, the large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy sustains with annealing temperature varying from 200 ˚C to 400 ˚C, indicative of high thermal stability. The present results open {{the way to a}} third alternative for the realization of thermally stable perpendicular magnetic electrodes of tunnel junctions...|$|R

As xx is decreased from unity, the single unique value observed in Pd 2 MnSbPd 2 MnSb is replaced by a distriBution in Heff(SB), with an average value which decreases in a regular manner with the number of Pd vacancies. In Pd 2 MnSb 0. 9 Sn 0. 1 Pd 2 MnSb 0. 9 Sn 0. 1, Heff(Sn) is found to be similar in magnitude to Heff(Sn) in Pd 2 MnSnPd 2 MnSn.

40|$|In Part I of this thesis, Mossbauer effect {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} used to measure the temperature dependence of the (2 ̆ 757) Fe effective magnetic hyperfine field, <b>H(,eff),</b> <b>and</b> isomer shift, (delta), across the entire Fe(, 3) Al(,x) Si(, 1 -x) system (0 (LESSTHEQ) x (LESSTHEQ) 1) from 77 K to the Curie temperature, the latter also being determined from these measurements. The observed dependence of <b>H(,eff)</b> <b>and</b> (delta) on Al concentration can be qualitatively understood in terms of the calculated band structure of Fe(, 3) Si.;(2 ̆ 757) Fe Mossbauer spectra have been obtained at both liquid nitrogen and room temperatures for a series of metallic glasses Fe(, 82) B(, 18 -x) Be(,x) with 0 (LESSTHEQ) x (LESSTHEQ) 6 in Part II. The width of the probability distribution function of the effective magnetic hyperfine field remains approximately constant at a value of 80 kOe for all samples. However, the most probable value of the effective magnetic hyperfine field at liquid nitrogen temperature initially increases with Be content, but starts to decrease as x exceeds four. The isomer shift has a value of - 0. 032 mm/sec for samples with x (LESSTHEQ) 4 but changes to - 0. 050 mm/sec for samples with x 3 ̆e 4. The crystallization products obtained upon annealing the samples were identified.;In the last part of this thesis, Mossbauer spectroscopy coupled with electrochemical measurements {{has been used}} to study in situ the effects of chloride ions on a passivated iron surface in boric acid-sodium borate buffer solution at a pH of 8. 4. The Mossbauer spectrum of the oxide film formed after breakdown of the passive film by aggressive chloride ions consists of a doublet with line-width of 0. 51 (+OR-) 0. 03 mm/sec, isomer shift of 0. 35 (+OR-) 0. 02 mm/sec relative to the metallic iron, and quadrupole splitting of 0. 79 (+OR-) 0. 01 mm/sec. The quadrupole splitting differs from that of the passive film which has line-widths of 0. 55 (+OR-) 0. 08 mm/sec, an isomer shift of 0. 36 (+OR-) 0. 01 mm/sec, and a quadrupole splitting of 0. 94 (+OR-) 0. 06 mm/sec. However, the parameters are essentially the same as those of the dried passive film and correlate well with those of superparamagnetic (gamma) -Fe(, 2) O(, 3). The introduction of chloride ions appear to stabilize the formation of (gamma) -Fe(, 2) O(, 3) and to exclude the incorporation of water and the formation of di-oxy or di-hydroxy bridging bonds...|$|R

Microneedle arrays have been shown to increase the drug permeability in skin by several orders of magnitude by bypassing the stratum corneum. This 15 can potentially allow the transdermal delivery of many medicaments including large macromolecules that typically cannot diffuse through the skin. This paper addresses the use of microneedles coated with a drug solution film. In particular, we identify how the geometries of various microneedles affect the drug permeability in skin. Effective skin permeability is calculated for a range of microneedle shapes and dimensions in order to identify the most 20 efficient geometry. To calculate effective permeability (Peff), the effective skin thickness (Heff) is calculated. These are then plotted for insulin as a model drug to see how various microneedle parameters affect the profiles of both <b>Heff</b> <b>and</b> Peff. It is found that the depth of penetration from the microneedle array is {{the most important factor in}} determining Peff, followed by the microneedle spacings. Other parameters such as microneedle diameter and 25 coating depth are less significant...|$|R
40|$|The human gastric {{pathogen}} Helicobacter pylori modifies host cholesterol via glycosylation and {{incorporates the}} glycosylated cholesterol into its membrane; however, {{the benefits of}} cholesterol to H. pylori are largely unknown. We speculated that cholesterol in the H. pylori membrane might alter the susceptibility of these organisms to membrane-disrupting antibacterial compounds. To test this hypothesis, H. pylori strains were cultured in Ham’s F- 12 chemically defined medium in {{the presence or absence}} of cholesterol. The two cultures were subjected to overnight incubations with serial 2 -fold dilutions of 10 bile salts and four ceragenins, which are novel bile salt derivatives that mimic membrane-disrupting activity of antimicrobial peptides. H. pylori cultured with cholesterol was substantially more resistant to seven of the bile salts and three ceragenins than H. pylori cultured without cholesterol. In most cases, these cholesterol-dependent differences ranged from 2 to 7 orders of magnitude; this magnitude depended on concentration of the agent. Cholesterol is modified by glycosylation using Cgt, a cholesteryl glycosyltransferase. Surprisingly, a cgt knockout strain still maintained cholesterol-dependent resistance to bile salts and ceragenins, indicating that cholesterol modification was not involved in resistance. We then tested whether three putative, paralogous inner membrane efflux pumps, HefC, HefF, or HefI, played a role. While <b>HefF</b> <b>and</b> HefI appeared unimportant, HefC was shown to play a critical role in the resistance to bile salts and ceragenins by multiple methods in multiple strain backgrounds.

5000|$|In 1897, an {{amendment}} to the Indian Appropriations Act banned the sale of alcohol to Indians. Citizenship of the parties involved was never clarified. In the Supreme Court case Matter of Heff, , the decision clarified that a Native American granted citizenship through the Dawes Act is immediately a citizen of the U.S. and his state. The 1897 amendment banning alcohol was considered a police statute, where power lies with the state and not Congress, and therefore would not apply to such a citizen. Representative of South Dakota, Charles H. Burke, saw the need to correct the situation in order to protect Native Americans from the sale of liquor. He amended the Dawes Act so that citizenship was only granted to a Native with an allotment after the trust period ran out (usually 25 years [...] ). This amendment was meant to allow Congress to continue to safeguard Indians’ personal welfare. However, those who received allotments before the amendment was signed into law on May 8, 1906 were still considered state citizens and not subject to federal authority except when concerning their land. The amendment only put the alcohol ban into effect for Natives receiving allotments after May 8, 1906. When Fred Nice was indicted for selling alcohol to a Native American who received an allotment before 1906, he was acquitted in a lower court using the Heff decision as his defense, but the U.S. appealed, represented by Assistant Attorney General Warren. Warren argued that the Pelican Case, [...] proved federal authority <b>and</b> overruled the <b>Heff</b> decision.|$|R
40|$|In the {{presence}} of velocity anisotropy, the pre-stack depth imaging process needs to take the anisotropy into account in order to accurately position the seismic events in space. A reliable estimation of the anisotropic parameter {{is crucial to the}} success of depth imaging. Because the anisotropic parameter and velocity are connected, the estimation process is not trivial and is often unstable. Martinez and Lee (2002) proposed a strategy to estimate the interval anelliptical parameter (hint) for pre-stack depth imaging in a VTI (transverse isotropy with a vertical symmetry) medium. As part of the strategy, hint is inverted from the effective anelliptical parameter (<b>heff)</b> <b>and</b> effective velocity (Vnmo), both of which are determined by scanning the P-wave moveouts on the common-image gathers from pre-stack time migration. Conventionally, the inversion is done by the Dix equation. Because of its differential nature, the Dix equation boosts errors present in the inputs, making the output unstable. This is especially true in the inversion for hint due to the involvement of the velocity in the form of its 4 th-order power. A small error in the velocity can be translated into large errors in the output hint. To solve the instability problem, we propose an inversion approach based on damped least squares (DLS). The approach consists of a “model damping ” goal, as well as the “data fitting ” goal. The latter is a mean to stabilize and smooth the inverted model and is fulfilled by minimizing its wiggliness. The inversion is formulated into a linear problem. We solve it with conjugate gradients to handle a large dimension of the parameter space. We also employ a preconditioning technique (Claerbout and Fomel, 2001) to speed up convergence...|$|R
