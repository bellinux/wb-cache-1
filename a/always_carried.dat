5|$|Merrick {{settled into}} {{his new life}} at the London Hospital. Treves visited him daily and {{spent a couple of}} hours with him every Sunday. Now that Merrick had found someone who {{understood}} his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor. Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves that he was an only child, and Treves had the impression that Merrick's mother, whose picture Merrick <b>always</b> <b>carried</b> with him, had abandoned him as a baby. Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers. It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.|$|E

The back cover of the leading home computer magazine, Byte, <b>always</b> <b>carried</b> a full page Altair advertisement. This ended with the September 1977 issue. Roberts and Yates stayed on and worked on special projects.|$|E

25|$|As {{an initial}} letter in Classical Greek it <b>always</b> <b>carried</b> the rough {{breathing}} (equivalent to h) {{as reflected in}} the many Greek-derived English words, such as those that begin with hyper- and hypo-. This rough breathing was derived from an older pronunciation that used a sibilant instead; this sibilant was not lost in Latin, giving rise to such cognates as super- (for hyper-) and sub- (for hypo-).|$|E

25|$|Late in 1939 it {{was decided}} that a third and entirely {{civilian}} ferry pool should be set up at White Waltham, near Maidenhead in Berkshire. The operations of this pool began on 15 February 1940. On 16 May 1940 RAF Maintenance Command took control through its No. 41 Group. Then, on 22 July 1941, the ATA was placed under the control of Lord Beaverbrook's Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP). Although control shifted between organisations, administration was <b>always</b> <b>carried</b> out by staff led by Commander Gerard d’Erlanger CBE, first at British Airways Ltd, then, after the merger in 1940, at BOAC.|$|E
25|$|Khoruhva {{was mostly}} of a crimson color {{embroidered}} with coats of arms, saints, crosses, and others. It was <b>always</b> <b>carried</b> {{in front of}} the army next to the hetman or otaman. A badge (znachok) was a name for a kurin's or company's (sotnia) banners. There was a tradition when the newly elected colonel was required at his own expense prepare palanka's banner. One of the banners was preserved until 1845 in Kuban and was made out of tissue in two colors: yellow and blue. Kettledrums (lytavry) were large copper boilers that were fitted with a leather which served for transmission of various signals (calling cossacks to a council, raising an alarm etc.).|$|E
25|$|A former {{politician}} and leading Marxist theoretician, Djilas wrote a lengthy study of Njegoš's life {{and works in}} the late 1950s while serving a prison sentence after a row with Yugoslavia's communist leadership. The manuscript was smuggled out of the prison by Djilas' associates in the early 1960s and taken to the West, where it was edited, translated from the original Serbo-Croatian into English, and published under the title Njegoš: Poet, Prince, Bishop, in 1966. The book remains the only English-language biography of Njegoš, and the subsequent Serbo-Croatian edition (1988) is likely the most extensive study {{of his life in}} that language, as well. Djilas himself was a great admirer of Njegoš, and later recounted that Gorski vijenac was the only text that he <b>always</b> <b>carried</b> by his side during the Second World War.|$|E

25|$|Throughout its history, {{the station}} has <b>always</b> <b>carried</b> local news programming. Branded {{for years as}} Eyewitness News from 1974 to 1995, its newscasts were retitled as Fox 7 News from 1995 to 1998 {{following}} the affiliation switch to Fox. When WTVW joined Fox, news programming on the station was expanded to two hours on weekday mornings, along {{with the addition of}} a 5 p.m. newscast. Newscasts came and went, with the midday news being cancelled in the late 1990s, later followed by the 5 p.m. and finally, the morning news. This eventually left only the 6 and 9 p.m. newscasts (the 10 p.m. news had earlier been moved into the 9 p.m. slot and expanded to an hour); however, the morning and midday newscasts returned in March 2002. In 2006, the weekday morning newscast expanded to three hours, the midday newscast moved to noon and a 6:30p.m. weeknight newscast was added to the schedule.|$|E
25|$|The Story of {{his death}} of Churaman runs as follows :- “ One of his relation, wealthy man died childless. The brethren sent for Muhkam, the eldest son of Churaman, and made him head of the deceased’s zamindari and gave over to him all his goods. Zul karan, the second son of Churaman said to his brother, “ Give me too a share in those goods and admit me as partner.” A verbal dispute {{followed}} and Muhkam made ready to resist by force. Zul Karan determined to have the quarrel out, gathered men together, and attacked his brother. The elders of the place sent word to Churaman spoke to Muhkam. The son replied to his father in abusive language, and showed himself ready to fight his father {{as well as his}} brother. Churaman lost his temper, and from chagrin swallowed up a dose of deadly poison which he <b>always</b> <b>carried</b> with him and going to an orchard in that village lay down and gave up the ghost. After a long time had elapsed, men were sent to search for him and they found his dead body.|$|E
25|$|Theoretically it was {{the duty}} of the pharaoh to carry out temple rituals, as he was Egypt's {{official}} representative to the gods. In reality, ritual duties were almost <b>always</b> <b>carried</b> out by priests. During the Old and Middle Kingdoms, there was no separate class of priests; instead, many government officials served in this capacity for several months out of the year before returning to their secular duties. Only in the New Kingdom did professional priesthood become widespread, although most lower-ranking priests were still part-time. All were still employed by the state, and the pharaoh had final say in their appointments. However, as the wealth of the temples grew, the influence of their priesthoods increased, until it rivaled that of the pharaoh. In the political fragmentation of the Third Intermediate Period (c. 1070–664 BC), the high priests of Amun at Karnak even became the effective rulers of Upper Egypt. The temple staff also included many people other than priests, such as musicians and chanters in temple ceremonies. Outside the temple were artisans and other laborers who helped supply the temple's needs, as well as farmers who worked on temple estates. All were paid with portions of the temple's income. Large temples were therefore very important centers of economic activity, sometimes employing thousands of people.|$|E
