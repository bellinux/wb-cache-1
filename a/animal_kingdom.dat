5|$|Le Règne Animal (The <b>Animal</b> <b>Kingdom)</b> is {{the most}} famous work of the French naturalist Georges Cuvier. It sets out to {{describe}} the natural structure of {{the whole of the}} <b>animal</b> <b>kingdom</b> based on comparative anatomy, and its natural history. Cuvier divided the animals into four embranchements ("Branches", roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes (cnidaria and other phyla).|$|E

50|$|At its conclusion, {{the book}} gives a sobering {{summary of the}} dwindling spiral of life on Earth {{as a result of}} the {{deterioration}} of the plant and <b>animal</b> <b>kingdoms</b> and the planet's environment.

5|$|In 1909 an American {{artist and}} amateur zoologist, Abbott Thayer {{published}} a book, Concealing-Coloration in the <b>Animal</b> <b>Kingdom,</b> which was widely read by military leaders, though his advocacy of countershading was unsuccessful, despite his patent for countershading submarines and surface ships.|$|E

5|$|The book's general {{method is}} to present {{a wide range of}} {{examples}} from across the <b>animal</b> <b>kingdom</b> of each type of coloration, including marine invertebrates and fishes as well as terrestrial insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The examples are supported by a large number of Cott's own drawings, diagrams, and photographs. This essentially descriptive natural history treatment is supplemented with accounts of experiments by Cott and others. The book had few precedents, but to some extent follows (and criticises) Abbott Handerson Thayer's 1909 Concealing-Coloration in the <b>Animal</b> <b>Kingdom.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Bug's Land is {{a section}} of Disney California Adventure that is {{inspired}} by A Bug's Life.

5|$|The name Molluscoida was {{formerly}} used to denote {{a division of}} the <b>animal</b> <b>kingdom</b> containing the brachiopods, bryozoans, and tunicates, the members of the three groups having been supposed to somewhat resemble the molluscs. As it is now known these groups have no relation to molluscs, and very little to one another, the name Molluscoida has been abandoned.|$|E
40|$|Elegant post-translational {{regulation}} {{is achieved by}} ‘microProteins', which form homotypic dimers with their targets and act through the dominant–negative suppression of protein complex function.

50|$|These three {{domains of}} life {{represent}} the main evolutionary lineages of early cellular life and currently include Bacteria, Archaea (single-celled organisms superficially similar to bacteria), and Eukarya. Eukarya includes only organisms having a well-defined nucleus, such as fungi, protists, and all organisms {{in the plant}} and <b>animals</b> <b>kingdoms</b> (see figure).|$|R
50|$|Phenethylamine is {{produced}} by {{a wide range of}} species throughout the plant and <b>animal</b> <b>kingdoms,</b> including humans; it is also produced by certain fungi and bacteria (genus: Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacteriaceae) and acts as a potent anti-microbial against certain pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli (e.g., the O157:H7 strain) at sufficient concentrations.|$|R

5|$|Pest {{control is}} the {{regulation}} or management {{of a species}} defined as a pest, {{a member of the}} <b>animal</b> <b>kingdom</b> that impacts adversely on human activities. The human response depends on the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eradicate the pest. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an integrated pest management strategy.|$|E
5|$|Several motion {{pictures}} have featured Iguanodon. In the Disney film Dinosaur, an Iguanodon named Aladar {{served as the}} protagonist with three other iguanodonts as other main characters; a loosely related ride {{of the same name}} at Disney's <b>Animal</b> <b>Kingdom</b> is based around bringing an Iguanodon back to the present. Iguanodon is one of the three dinosaur genera that inspired Godzilla; the other two were Tyrannosaurus and Stegosaurus. Iguanodon has also made appearances in some of the many Land Before Time films, as well as episodes of the television series.|$|E

5000|$|At first, {{microscopic}} organisms {{were classified}} within the <b>animal</b> and plant <b>kingdoms.</b> However, by the mid-19th century, {{it had become}} clear to many that [...] "the existing dichotomy of the plant and <b>animal</b> <b>kingdoms</b> become rapidly blurred at its boundaries and outmoded". In 1866, Ernst Haeckel proposed a third kingdom of life, the Protista, for [...] "neutral organisms" [...] which were neither animal nor plant. Haeckel revised the content of this kingdom {{a number of times}} before settling on a division based on whether organisms were unicellular (Protista) or multicellular (animals and plants).|$|R
5|$|The {{action of}} this {{principle}} is exactly {{like that of}} the centrifugal governor of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the <b>animal</b> <b>kingdom</b> can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.|$|E

Expedition Everest first opened for previews on January 26, 2006, and had its grand opening on April 7, 2006, in ceremonies led by Disney CEO Bob Iger and theme parks chairman Jay Rasulo.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} {{adopted by}} Cuvier {{to define the}} natural structure of the <b>animal</b> <b>kingdom,</b> including both living and fossil forms, was as follows, the list forming {{the structure of the}} Règne Animal. Where Cuvier's group names correspond (more or less) to modern taxa, these are named, in English if possible, in parentheses. The table from the 1828 Penny Cyclopaedia indicates species that were thought to belong to each group in Cuvier's taxonomy. The four major divisions were known as embranchements ("branches").|$|E
