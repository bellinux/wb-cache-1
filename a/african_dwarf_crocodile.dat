2500|$|The bank {{is home to}} 14 {{species of}} the 23 crocodilian species living across the world, {{two of which are}} listed by the IUCN as {{critically}} endangered and three more as threatened. The 14 crocodile species available in the bank are mugger (Crocodylus palustris), salt-water crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), tomistoma (Tomistoma schlegelii), American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus Moreletii), spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), West <b>African</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Osteolaemus tetraspis), Australian fresh water crocodile (Crocodylus Johnsoni), African slender-snouted crocodile (Mecistops cataphractus), dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus), yacare caiman (Caiman yacare), Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) and the endangered Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis). The bank currently houses over 2,400 crocodiles and also many species of turtles, snakes, and lizards which are viewable by the public. The bank houses 12 endangered species of turtles and tortoises and 5 species of snakes, including king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), Asian water monitors (Varanus salvator salvator), two species of pythons, and albino cobras. Of the 5,000 reptiles bred at the bank, 3,000 represent the native Indian species Crocodylus palustris, known as muggers. One of the biggest attractions of the park is a fierce salt-water crocodile known as Jaws III. This species, believed to be the biggest in southern Asia, is [...] long and weighs over a ton. The bank is also going to get four new species of crocodiles. These are black caimans, smooth-fronted caimans, Cuban crocodiles and broad-snouted caimans. Anacondas will also appear at the bank. Since April, 2016 four Komodo dragons - three male, one female - {{have been added to the}} list of exhibits. The dragons were acquired from Bronx Zoo in New York.|$|E

The majority of isolates were from farmed Nile crocodiles (145), three from wild-caught <b>African</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> 11 from captive snakes, 13 from lizards and one from a tortoise. The isolates from the tortoise and lizards were subspecies I isolates (Zaire and Tsevie, respectively). Of the snakes, nine isolates were S. lll.

The most frequently identified serovars were Typhimurium (seven), Tsevie (six), Duval (six), Schwerin (six), Tinda (six), and Tallahassee (six). On two commercial crocodile breeding farms that had experienced ongoing problems for about two years, many isolates of Salmonella were made. Some of these serovars were isolated more than once, and also months apart. No single Salmonella serovar predominated, nor did a single pathological condition.

50|$|The slender-snouted {{crocodile}} lays {{an average}} of 16 (minimum 13, maximum 27) very large eggs (relative to body size) {{about a week after}} completion of the mound nest. The incubation period is long compared with most other crocodilian species, sometimes lasting over 110 days. The female remains close to the nest, but does not defend it with the same vigor as some other species of crocodilians. Once the eggs begin to hatch, and the juveniles emit their characteristic chirping, she will break open the nest and assist in the hatching process. Hatchlings then disperse across the flooded forest floor. Although losses from predators do occur (e.g. by soft-shelled turtles), they apparently are minimal, possibly accounting for the small number of relatively large eggs laid, and the long incubation period. They also have very sharp teeth for protection. It is one of four species of crocodile in Africa, the other three being the Nile, West <b>African</b> and <b>dwarf</b> <b>crocodiles.</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>African</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>crocodile,</b> Osteolaemus tetraspis (Crocodilidae, Reptilia), {{possesses}} {{a pair of}} skin glands, the paracloacal glands, the secretion of which {{is thought to be}} used to mark nest sites or attract mates. Ten aromatic steroidal esters were isolated from this secretion and characterized on the basis of NMR spectroscopic investigations, electrospray ionization-MS analyses, and chemical degradation. These esters, which account for more than 90 % of the paracloacal glandular secretion, are derived from either cholesterol or cholestanol, esterified with a C- 20 or C- 22 acid closely related to dianeackerone, the only significant volatile compound found in this secretion...|$|E
40|$|The major {{volatile}} {{component in the}} paracloacal glandular secretion of the adult <b>African</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Osteolaemus tetraspis) was isolated and characterized as a 19 -carbon aromatic ketone, dianeackerone (3, 7 -diethyl- 9 -phenyl- 2 -nonanone). This ketone is absent from the secretion of immatures. Careful examination of dianeackerone samples isolated from individual adults revealed that this ketone occurs as both the (3 S, 7 S) and (3 S, 7 R) stereoisomers, with different individuals presenting strikingly different ratios of the isomeric forms. Our initial suspicion that the stereoisomeric dianeackerones might be indicators of gender proved untenable, leaving the role of these glandular constituents a challenge for future study...|$|E
40|$|Overexploitation of {{wildlife}} {{is a leading}} threat to biodiversity in tropical Africa. Effective management requires integrating information {{on the extent of}} exploitation, distribution, and status of exploited species. I explore how trade filters affected the final destination of bushmeat for different species involved in the trade. I highlight the trade in reptiles, in particular <b>African</b> <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Crocodiles</b> (Osteolaemus tetraspis) to investigate why they are rare in markets yet ubiquitously hunted. Hunting locations and methods determined the types of species entering bushmeat markets while selling conditions and prices determined whether species were traded locally or in urban markets. To prioritize conservation efforts of over-exploited species, it is important to determine the distribution and status of populations. I conducted detailed sampling of Osteolaemus populations in Cameroon and around the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL), to investigate the distributional limits and number of cryptic Osteolaemus species in the country. I found that O. tetraspis extends west beyond the CVL, thus, this mountain chain does not represent the distributional limit of this species. I also found O. osborni in Cameroon. I provided information on the population ecology of O. tetraspis and O. osborni in Cameroon to facilitate independent conservation of these two species. Both species are threatened in Cameroon based upon low encounter rates, young population structures and continued threats of habitat loss and hunting pressure. Crocodilians link nutrients and energy between food webs through their movements across heterogeneous habitats. These connections may differ among habitats and as they undergo ontogenetic shifts in diet. I compared food web associations of Ostoelaemus species inhabiting a large river and small tributary using stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen. Osteolaemus species inhabiting perennial rivers have aquatic food web associations as opposed to the largely terrestrial food web associations detected when they occupy swamp habitats. These species have large dietary overlap between juveniles, adults and, sexes. Through my research, I have provided a working knowledge of the distribution, ecology, and hunting pressure of Osteolaemus species necessary for assessing their conservation status and developing sound management. These widely distributed species should be regionally managed to conserve their evolutionary diversity...|$|R

40|$|Bush meat {{markets and}} habitat {{encroachment}} {{are on the}} increase, and the current demand for crocodilian bush meat is not sustainable. Of the three species of <b>African</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> the <b>dwarf</b> <b>crocodile,</b> Osteolaemus tetraspis, {{is by far the}} most heavily hunted. This preference is influenced by its small size and relatively non-aggressive nature, which facilitates easy capture, and further it stays alive while being transported to markets. The location of bush meat markets is determined by human population density and infrastructure. In general, a lack of infrastructure, whether it be a river or a paved road, implies only subsistence hunting. Many officially protected areas, where animals should be safe from depredation by humans, are not actually safe havens for O. tetraspis. There is often a lack of protection inside and around national parks in Central Africa, and when conducting research into this specific species, it was found that often more animals can be found per day in a bush meat market, compared with the same amount of effort in a national park. Crocodile mortality caused by people, both deliberate and inadvertent, must be controlled. However, conservation should be within the realms of politics, economics, ecology and social problems at a local level. CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.
