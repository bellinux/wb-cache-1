30|$|In 1974, Dr. W. Donner Denckla {{proposed}} Death Hormone or DECO (decreasing {{oxygen consumption}} hormone) Theory (Denckla 1974). Regularly {{released by the}} human pituitary gland, DECO suppresses the ability of cells to use thyroxine (Denckla 1974), which causes people to age. The principal functions of thyroxine are to stimulate oxygen consumption and control metabolism of all cells and tissues in the body (Welcker et al. 2013). Age-related decrease in use of growth hormone (GH) by body cells has also been found (Blackman et al. 2002). However, the death hormones are nonetheless unidentified. Because of high expression of IL 17 RC in peripheral blood and chorioretinal tissues with AMD lesions increases age-related macular degeneration (AMD) risk (Wei et al. 2012), exploration of IL 17 RC signaling pathways sheds light on possible molecular biology mechanisms that reduce {{the use of the}} relevant hormones in the body cells.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{realising}} {{the idea}} of standardising the internal policy of the European Union, the Republic of Slovenia follows the path fellow member states took when dealing with real estate taxation. Such unification of real estate taxation is not directly specified {{or in any other}} way regulated by the European Union, since it is closely connected to the local regulation of each individual member state. With the mentioned real estate taxation local communities across Europe mostly help finance the public service sector, as this represents a simple way of inhabitants funding a local government’s budget. The real estate taxation in the Republic of Slovenia should be levied {{on the basis of the}} generalised market value of the entire real estate. As one of the alternatives the existing literature names a taxation which would be based on the land value. The aim of this graduation thesis is to analyse the possibility of introducing land value tax as an alternative to real estate tax. In 2013 the Real Property Tax Act was passed. The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Slovenia then decided to abolish the Real Property Tax Act and the Real Property Mass Valuation Act due to them being unconstitutional. It would be sensible to unify all the current laws connected to the real estate taxation – the charge for the use of construction land, the tax on property and the tax on use of forest roads – into one individual tax. This is also one of the aims of this graduation thesis. The introduction of an <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land value taxation would lead to administrative procedure being more transparent and simple, which would also result in easier maintenance of the real estate database. The results of the model of forming an alternative taxation, discussed in the graduation thesis, point to the fact of land value taxation representing an instrument of control over land use. One of the aims of the alternative proposal is also the regulation of activities which affect the physical environment and guiding the real estate owners towards a more rational land use. In this manner the land areas would become less interesting for speculations and investments which could lead to a decrease in property values...|$|E

A chronological analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> panamerican projects (according to three steps : that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Bolivarian project, <b>the</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ECLA -Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean- continental planning agenda, and <b>the</b> recent era <b>of</b> <b>the</b> integration via goods and markets flow) shows that, indeed, revolutionary and liberal stakeholders have been able to appropriate themselves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> integration project through its simple reformulation. <b>The</b> idea <b>of</b> Latin American integration, synonymous since <b>the</b> 1990 's <b>of</b> ultraliberalism can, through <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>of</b> going beyond <b>the</b> State's borders, appear as profoundly revolutionary, thus containing two contradictory connotations. We here formulate the hypothesis that the word integration depends on <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> freedom that is implies. In a varied and changing manner, integration can thus appear as a step to a revolutionary turn or to a liberal, reformist, opening-up, the contradiction between both proposals justifying that one integration process may be opposed to another.

La lutte contre la ZLEA passe par la constitution de propositions alternatives d'intégration des Amériques, qu'il s'agisse de l'ALBA d'H. Chavez, des regroupements territoriaux sub-continentaux ou d'autres encore. Cela pose la question du lien entre idée intégrationniste et identité territoriale latino-américaine que l'on tente d'explorer ici. Une analyse chronologique des projets de regroupement panaméricains (selon trois phases : celle du projet bolivarien, du schéma d'aménagement continental de la production de la CEPAL et de l'intégration par les flux de marchandises et des marchés) montre de fait que, successivement, des acteurs révolutionnaires et libéraux ont pu se saisir du projet d'intégration selon des termes différents. Le projet d'intégration latino-américain, synonyme d'ultralibéralisme depuis les années 90 peut, de par sa proposition de dépasser les frontières de l'Etat, apparaître comme profondément révolutionnaire, connotation apparemment contradictoire : c'est poser l'hypothèse que son sens dépend fortement de l'interprétation du mot de liberté qui le sous-tend. De façon diverse et évolutive, l'intégration dans ce contexte apparaît tour à tour comme porteuse d'un envol révolutionnaire ou d'une ouverture libérale réformiste, la contradiction entre les deux termes pouvant justifier que l'on oppose une intégration à l'autre. Cette grille de lecture permet de relire le positionnement des acteurs en fonction de leurs représentations territoriales des projets intégrationnistes...|$|R

Three designs are evaluated: first, a large elliptical layout, second, a very large circular layout, and third, a layout with twin large roundabouts and slip bypass ramps. These three designs were actually proposed by two different Italian Highway Agencies. Comparisons are made through the respective proper analysis model (i. e., British model for the elliptical traffic circle and French SETRA model for the twin roundabout solution and the very large circular layout) evaluating capacity and performance requirements. Results are summarized and they highlighted that the twin roundabout design is assessed as the preferred solution for traffic operations, as well as safety, maintenance, visual intrusion, and lighting requirements.
