Its safety profile is superior to older antidepressants; data comparing it with newer antidepressants (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are limited (SOR: <b>A,</b> 1 <b>systematic</b> review). <b>A</b> small but statistically significant clinical benefit has been demonstrated for saffron, lavender, borage, dan zhi xiao yao (SOR: B, 1 systematic review and 3 randomized controlled trials), folate (SOR: <b>A,</b> 1 <b>systematic</b> review), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) (SOR: A, 1 meta-analysis and 1 systematic review).
