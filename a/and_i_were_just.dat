500|$|On tour {{following}} {{the release of}} Dog Beats, Insane Clown Posse was scheduled to perform at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan, but were delayed by a blizzard. After they arrived, the group was announced by their manager, Alex Abbiss. Bruce remembers that [...] "e came out with no microphones or nothing; we were just right up in the people's faces. Shaggy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> fuckin' yelling over our own cassette. The people were staring at us in amazement and bewilderment. They {{must have been in}} shock and awe. We finished our two-song set, and the crowd...didn't cheer or boo. They just stood there, stunned"; they later learned that the concert was supposed to occur earlier in the evening, and that they were performing in the wrong building.|$|E
60|$|Oh, won't you {{sit down}} and have a {{cigarette}} before you go? Anne <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> going to stroll {{to the end of the}} garden to have a look at the Nile.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{you made}} me engage Wrench. It's fifty-fifty. I wish you wouldn't keep picking on Eustace, Algie dear. He does no harm. Mr Sherriff <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> saying how peaceable he is. He wouldn't hurt--' ...|$|E
60|$|Sab. <b>And</b> you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> of an age, sir; and therefore, methinks, {{we should}} not hate one another.|$|R
60|$|Rectus {{had gone}} on board, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> about to follow him, when our old Minorcan stepped up to me.|$|R
60|$|SYNORIX. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> as sure, my lord, I struck him. (Aside.) <b>And</b> <b>I</b> may strike {{your game}} {{when you are}} gone.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Apparently no,' he said, swiftly {{removing}} his hat from the ruler. 'In reality, yes. Mr Rossiter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> scheming out {{a line of}} work for me as you came up. If you had arrived a moment later, you would have found me toiling.' ...|$|E
6000|$|One night, when prayer meeting came out, Stephen {{stepped up}} to Prissy as usual {{and asked if he}} might see her home. Thomas <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> behind--we weren't married {{ourselves}} then--and we heard it all. Prissy gave one scared, appealing look at Emmeline and then said, [...] "No, thank you, not to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{sergeant}} {{followed her}} pointing hand, and, as it happened, Lucille <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> passing beyond the rise riding close together side by side. Mackay looked steadily after us, and doubtless noticed that Lucille rode very well. [...] "I would not blame them. I'm just thinking I'm sorry for Corporal Cotton," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very well,' {{returned}} Miss Brass. 'My brother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> the same. <b>I</b> {{can take}} any instructions, or {{give you any}} advice.' ...|$|R
60|$|That night <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in my flat in London. I had {{finished}} reading the accumulated letters of some weeks, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> going comfortably to bed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{sorry to}} have kept you waiting, but Mrs Richardson has got a few lady-friends to tea, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{in the middle of}} a set.' ...|$|R
60|$|But it was {{too much}} for our enemies. I cannot imagine that the Indians would have {{withheld}} their fire for so long, girls or no girls, had they not obeyed instructions from the whites who were with them. At any rate Jed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> starting on another trip when a rifle went off from the Indian hill, and then another.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, now, Zilla, Georgie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> {{saying how}} hard Paul's been working all year, {{and we were}} {{thinking}} it would be lovely if the Boys could run off by themselves. I've been coaxing George {{to go up to}} Maine ahead of the rest of us, and get the tired out of his system before we come, and I think it would be lovely if Paul could manage to get away and join him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well, Dick; but I think that you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> as much frightened as the Spaniards were, when we saw how the thing had succeeded, and that all our troops were called out. There is no saying {{what they would have}} done to us, had they found out who started the report. The very least thing that would have {{happened}} would have been to be tried by court martial, and dismissed from the service; and I am by no means sure that worse than that would not have befallen us." ...|$|E
60|$|An hour passed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{dropping}} into a light doze when a noise outside attracted my attention. <b>I</b> listened intently <b>and</b> heard a man's footsteps.|$|R
50|$|Indigenous Australian artist Lin Onus {{used the}} Great Wave {{as the basis}} for his 1992 {{painting}} Michael <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> slipping down the pub for a minute.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is so much}} at stake," [...] rejoined Ralph. [...] "I feel as if a fuse had <b>been</b> lighted, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{waiting for}} {{something}} to explode." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{the best}} joak {{of all was}} at last. Singin, swagrin, and swarink--up stares came Mr. Dick Blewitt. He flung opn Mr. Dawkins's door, {{shouting}} out, [...] "Daw my old buck, how are you?" [...] when, all of a sudden, he sees Mr. Deuceace: his jor dropt, he turned chocky white, and then burnin red, and looked as if a stror would knock him down. [...] "My dear Mr. Blewitt," [...] says my master, smilin and offring his hand, [...] "how glad I am to see you. Mr. Dawkins <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> talking about your pony! Pray sit down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a hop {{merchant}} myself, and as I have {{an income}} of seven or eight hundred, we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a nice eighty-pound-a-year villa at Norbury. Our little place was very countrified, considering {{that it is so}} close to town. We had an inn and two houses a little above us, and a single cottage at {{the other side of the}} field which faces us, and except those there were no houses until you got half way to the station. My business took me into town at certain seasons, but in summer I had less to do, and then in our country home my wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> as happy as could be wished. I tell you that there never was a shadow between us until this accursed affair began.|$|E
6000|$|One day Mr. Dalton {{called on}} my brother-in-law, on {{a matter of}} business, and I was asked if I could {{entertain}} him awhile, until my brother-in-law should finish an engagement with another gentleman. I said I could, and took {{him up to the}} billiard-table. I had played with him many times at the club, and knew that he could play billiards tolerably well--only tolerably well--but not any better than I could. He <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> a match. He didn't know our table; he didn't know those balls; he didn't know those warped and headless cues; he didn't know the southeastern slant of the table, and how to allow for it. I judged it would be safe and profitable to offer him a bet on my scheme. I emptied the avalanche of thirteen balls on the table and said: ...|$|E
2500|$|In August, Maroney competed at the Visa Championships in Dallas, Texas. [...] She placed twenty-seventh in the {{all-around}} with {{a two-day}} combined score of 104.800 {{and third in}} the vault final with a score of 29.900. When asked about {{the first time she}} performed an Amanar in competition, Maroney said, [...] "The first time <b>I</b> did it <b>was</b> at Visa Championships <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> thirteen years old. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> really little <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't really know what was going on. [...] But I <b>just</b> did it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> very happy that I landed on my feet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{there was}} a horrible little cad making faces,' exclaimed Bernard, unable to resist {{claiming}} part of the glory,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> going to have pitched into him--' ...|$|R
6000|$|Lize began, abruptly: [...] "I'm down, but not out; in fact, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{coming up}} to see you this afternoon. Lee <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> about pulling out for good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Markham, soothingly; [...] "he's ashore {{with the}} Padre, and {{everything}} else is all right too. But it's rather ridiculous to think that those idiotic Indians believed {{the only way they}} could show Mr. Hurlstone that they meant us no harm was to drag us all up to THEIR Mission, as they call that half heathen cross of theirs--for safety against--who do you think, dear?--the dreadful AMERICANS! And imagine all the while the Padre <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> behind you, bringing up the rear of the procession--only they wouldn't let us join you because they wanted to show you special honor as"--she sank her voice to a whisper in Eleanor's ear--"as the future Mrs. Hurlstone! It appears they must have noticed something about you two, {{the last time you were}} there, my dear. And--to think--YOU never told me anything about it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were talking}} of you," [...] {{observed}} the last, [...] "at {{the very moment}} you appeared. Ravensnest is now becoming a valuable property; and its income, added to the products of this large and very excellent farm {{that you have in}} your own hands, should keep a country house, not only in abundance, but with something more. You will naturally think of marrying ere long, and your mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> saying that you ought to build a good, substantial stone dwelling on this very spot, and settle down on your own property. Nothing contributes so much to the civilization of a country, as to dot it with a gentry, and you will both give and receive advantages by adopting such a course. It is impossible for those who have never been witnesses of the result, to appreciate the effect produced by one gentleman's family in a neighborhood, in the way of manners, tastes, general intelligence, and civilization at large." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if that isn't John Drew all over! I {{suspected}} {{he was at}} the bottom of it as soon as I laid my eyes on that animal. John Drew is a cousin of mine. He's been living out at Poplar Valley and he writes me that he has gone out west, and wants me to take 'old Nap.' I suppose that is the horse. He says that Nap is getting old and not much use for work and he couldn't bear the thought of shooting him or selling him to someone who might ill-treat him, so he wants me to take him and be kind to him for old times' sake. John <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> like brother and sister when we were children. If this isn't like him nothing ever was. He was always doing odd things and thinking they were all right. And now he's off west and here is the horse. If it were a cat or a dog--but a horse!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ve {{been shot}} from behind," [...] ses Walter. [...] "I’d got {{something}} in my boot, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> stooping down to fasten it up agin when I got it.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a nuisance, Peter, they'll all {{be wanting}} to talk now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> so comfortably off. Well, I suppose it's no use {{trying to get}} any more sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you call}} me up at one {{o'clock in the morning}} to ask silly questions?" [...] the man replied insolently. [...] "Every one's in bed here <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> going." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} but admire, even {{at such a}} moment, {{the way in which}} a {{dominant}} spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and adventures {{in different parts of the}} world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door. Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along the hall. The Count was evidently prepared for some surprise, at least he feared it.|$|E
6000|$|He had {{recovered}} enough {{to lock the}} door; he clumped up-stairs ahead of her, growling, [...] "You don't know what you're talking about. I'm perfectly willing to pay my full tax--fact, I'm {{in favor of the}} income tax--even though I do think it's a penalty on frugality and enterprise--fact, it's an unjust, darn-fool tax. But just the same, I'll pay it. Only, I'm not idiot enough to pay more than the government makes me pay, and Sam <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> figuring out whether all automobile expenses oughn't to be exemptions. I'll take a lot off you, Carrie, but I don't propose for one second to stand your saying I'm not patriotic. You know mighty well and good that I've tried to get away and join the army. And {{at the beginning of the}} whole fracas I said--I've said right along--that we ought to have entered the war the minute Germany invaded Belgium. You don't get me at all. You can't appreciate a man's work. You're abnormal. You've fussed so much with these fool novels and books and all this highbrow junk----You like to argue!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Some of my {{fraternity}} brothers <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> {{sitting around}} one evening," [...] Baldwin recalls, [...] "and {{came to the}} agreement that what Wake Forest needed was someone dressed like a deacon -- top hat, tails, a black umbrella and all that. We {{wanted him to be}} more dignified than other mascots, sort of like an old Baptist Deacon would dress" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm told it's {{an active}} sort of life. You're fast asleep, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> now, {{when you were}} preaching. We'd better go to bed. Nine o'clock for breakfast, I suppose?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{gave her}} a look that made her catch 'er breath, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{stepping}} through the wicket, when she laid hold of my coat and tried to hold me back.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{going to}} explain how things stood when out of the library came leaping Uncle Willoughby looking as braced as a two-year-old. The old boy was a changed man.|$|R
