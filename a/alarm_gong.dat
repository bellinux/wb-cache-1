5000|$|Cephas is {{currently}} working with the Baltimore City Council to find a space to move the cramped storefront museum to and is seeking grants to fund the move. [...] On January 29, 2015, the Baltimore Housing department {{set the stage for}} the museum's preferred location by awarding the RFP(request for proposal) to renovate 1220 E. Oliver Street to the African American Fire Fighters Association for [...] "a firehouse of significant importance in the Oliver neighborhood". Should funding be secured, the association has plans to create a working museum and reclaim the blighted property. Over the years elementary school groups, clubs and churches have visited the current location and Cephas envisions an expanded museum to allow him to display many of the artifacts he has in storage. Currently, the Museum, at 203 N. Carey St. is open Wednesday and Thursday from 9am -4pm; alternate Sundays, Mondays and by Appointment. The collection of museum quality artifacts include an <b>alarm</b> <b>gong,</b> call boxes, signs, hoses, photographs, fire engines models, lanterns, bells, and water buckets. Copies of newspaper articles, photo prints, helmets, badges, calendars, correspondence and fire patches from departments all over the world round out the collection.|$|E
25|$|Bell System {{installations}} typically had <b>alarm</b> bells, <b>gongs,</b> or chimes {{to announce}} alarms {{calling attention to}} a failed switch element. A trouble reporting card system was connected to switch common control elements. These trouble reporting systems punctured cardboard cards with a code that logged {{the nature of a}} failure. Reed relay technology in stored program control exchange finally quieted the environment.|$|R
2500|$|Just after midnight, German small-arms fire began {{along the}} fronts of the 73rd and 72nd brigades, in the centre and {{left of the}} 24th Division and the 76th Brigade on the right flank of the 3rd Division. Soon after, a gas {{discharge}} began on a [...] from La Petite Douve Farm to Spanbroekmolen. (In German reports of the operation, the gas was said to rise above head-height and was illuminated by British flares. British return-fire began and after five minutes, artillery-fire commenced.) Along most of the line, German rifle and machine-gun fire blanketed the hiss of gas and smothered the sound of <b>alarm</b> <b>gongs</b> and klaxons. The first warning for many British soldiers was the smell, since with the wind speed and no man's land being only [...] wide in places, the gas arrived without warning. The British donned their helmets and a volley of Very lights revealed the gas cloud. German artillery began a bombardment behind the British front, on artillery positions, observation posts, support trenches and strong points. The gas signal reached the divisional HQs at [...] and three minutes later, the artillery of the 24th and 50th divisions, behind Hill 63 and the Vierstraat spur and the corps heavy artillery, began to bombard their night lines.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 25 April 1999, then-Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin issued a letter {{indicating}} his desire to see Falun Gong defeated. The letter expressed <b>alarm</b> at Falun <b>Gongâ€™s</b> popularity, particularly among Communist Party members. He reportedly called the Zhongnanhai protest [...] "the most serious political incident since the 'June 4' political disturbance in 1989." ...|$|R
2500|$|Standing orders {{had been}} {{enforced}} after the chlorine gas attacks earlier in 1915. The {{state of the}} wind was monitored by an officer in each corps and during conditions favourable for a gas release, a [...] "Gas Alert" [...] was issued. A sentry was posted near every <b>alarm</b> horn or <b>gong,</b> at every dug-out big enough for ten men, each group of smaller dugouts and at all signal offices. Gas helmets and alarms were tested every twelve hours and all soldiers wore the helmet outside the greatcoat or rolled up on their heads, with the top greatcoat button undone to tuck the helmet in. Special lubricants were provided, for the working parts of weapons in forward positions.|$|R
