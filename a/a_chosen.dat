After some discussion, Kecal announces {{that he has}} found a groom for Mařenka – Vašek, younger son of Tobiáš Mícha, a wealthy landowner; the older son, he explains, is a worthless good-for-nothing. Kecal extols the virtues of Vašek ("He's a nice boy, well brought up"), as Mařenka re-enters. In the subsequent quartet she responds by saying that she already has <b>a</b> <b>chosen</b> lover. Send him packing, orders Kecal. The four argue, but little is resolved. Kecal decides he must convince Jeník to give up Mařenka, as the villagers return, singing and dancing a festive polka.|$|E

The lot of any security forces posted nearby was to play a constant game of hide-and-seek with the communists, whereby the army would indefinitely search for and destroy any base camps and food caches the MNLA set up. The Commonwealth leaders surmised that the MNLA could not possibly resist such a campaign forever, and would, in time, simply give up attempting to regroup.|$|E

They crossed paths at the Ombifotsy ("White Zebu") river, so named because the two sacrificed a white zebu there in honor of their friendship and the peace agreement between their two territories of Imamo and Imerina. Andriambahoakafovoanitany's son dug a trench along the river, where he erected a stone to commemorate the agreement. Imamo was divided into four parts, each administered by one of Andriambahoakafovoanitany's sons.|$|E

It was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 and is a follow-up to the 1992 Game Boy title Wave Race. Most of the game involves the player racing on a Jet Ski {{on a variety of}} courses while successfully manoeuvring the vehicle around various buoys. A multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other on <b>a</b> <b>chosen</b> course is also included. The game supports the Controller Pak, which allows players to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.|$|E

Irving injects {{himself with a}} variant of the Las Plagas {{parasite}} and mutates into a huge octopus-like beast. Redfield and Alomar defeat him, and his dying words lead them to a nearby cave to learn more. The cave is the source of a flower used to create viruses previously used by Umbrella, as well as a new strain named Uroboros. Redfield and Alomar find evidence that Tricell, the company funding the BSAA, took over a former Umbrella Corporation underground laboratory and continued Umbrella's research. In the facility, they discover thousands of capsules holding human test subjects. Although Redfield finds that one of the capsules is Valentine's, it is empty. When they leave, they discover that Tricell CEO Excella Gionne has been plotting with Wesker to launch missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe; it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to take <b>a</b> <b>chosen</b> few from the chaos of infection and rule them, creating a new breed of humanity. Redfield and Alomar pursue Gionne, but are stopped by Wesker and the hooded figure, who is revealed to be a mind-controlled Valentine. Gionne and Wesker escape to a Tricell oil tanker; Redfield and Alomar fight Valentine, subduing her and removing the mind-control device before she orders Redfield to follow Wesker.|$|E
5|$|Drakengard 2 {{takes place}} in an unnamed land nearly two decades after the events of Drakengard: {{originally}} said to take place after the game's first ending, it was later retconned so it took place in an isolated timeline following events similar to Drakengard. In the original game, two powers, the Empire and the Union, {{were engaged in a}} religious war over the Seals, magical bindings tied to <b>a</b> <b>chosen</b> Goddess of the Seal that kept dark entities known as the Watchers from appearing in the mortal world and destroying humanity. Caught up in the conflict were Caim and Angelus, a human and a dragon who had made a pact (a magical ritual that linked their souls), and fought to try to keep both the Seals and the Goddess safe. Though they ultimately failed, Angelus became the new seal, averting the end of the world. Eighteen years later, the Seals are protected by the Knights of the Seal, who eventually grow to become a dominating force in the land.|$|E

5|$|During battle, {{the player}} can {{converse}} with enemies, {{though they are}} restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original Persona. If the player succeeds in talking with the enemy using the right character, it both causes the enemy to leave the battlefield and gains a spell card (a Tarot card linked {{to one of the}} Arcanum or family of Personas), which can be used to create Personas in a location called the Velvet Room. In the Velvet Room, the player can summon a new Persona that belongs to a spell card's particular Persona family group. As a character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from a spell card's group become available. In addition to pre-set spell cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can be tailored to fit <b>a</b> <b>chosen</b> Persona family.|$|E
5|$|In Time Trials, {{the player}} can freely race {{on a course}} to perform the best times, which are {{recorded}} in the game's data. In the Stunt Mode, the player must earn points by executing stunts and passing through rings.

The multiplayer mode uses a horizontal split-screen and allows two players to compete against each other on <b>a</b> <b>chosen</b> course. Only the courses that have been unlocked in the Championship mode can be played in the Time Trials, Stunt, and multiplayer modes. The game offers four personalized racers for players to select from, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak can be used to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.|$|E

The film's mecha designer Takeuchi Atsushi noted that while the film does not have <b>a</b> <b>chosen</b> setting, it is obviously based on Hong Kong because the city represented the theme of the film, {{the old and the new}} which exist in a strange relationship in an age of an information deluge. Before shooting the film, the artists drew sketches that emphasized Hong Kong's chaotic, confusing and overwhelming aspects.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens with}} {{a vision of the}} player's {{character}} wielding a blade of light to strike down a masked man in black robes. The vision is a dream the player has while on a carriage ride to their chosen starting city—Gridania, Ul'dah, or Limsa Lominsa. Players returning from the original release appear in a forest in a pillar of light—Louisoix's final spell to save their lives from the devastation at Carteneau. Through undertaking various odd jobs, the player character ingratiates him or herself with the local Adventurer's Guild and earns comparisons with the fabled Warriors of Light, brave adventurers who participated in the Battle of Carteneau whose identities have been mysteriously erased from the memories of all who knew them. A pattern emerges amid these quests involving a series of attacks by masked men, as well {{as a member of the}} Scions of the Seventh Dawn who claims to know the origin of the player's visions. The adventurer meets the leader of this secret society, Minfilia, who reveals that the visions are a manifestation of the Echo and mark the player as <b>a</b> <b>chosen</b> representative of Hydaelyn, the Mothercrystal.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{come in two}} types: random {{encounters}} with standard enemies, and staged boss battles. The battle system revolves around turn-based combat: each side is allowed to perform an action or multiple actions, with each character having independent movements and commands: these actions include attacking with the equipped weapon, using magic, or using an item. The party also has the option to escape from most battles. Key to the battle system are the Bravely and Default options. Brave Points (BP) dictate the number of actions a character or enemy can take within a turn, along with being needed for the execution of certain abilities. Party members can utilize BP down into negative figures, enabling up to four actions within a single turn. When the BP gauge is into negative figures, they must wait for the BP counter to reach zero before they can act again. BP are naturally recovered once per turn. Alternately, <b>a</b> <b>chosen</b> character can Default, which accumulates BP and reduces the damage taken by enemy strikes. An additional power is Bravely Second, an ability which freezes time for the enemy, allowing a party member to move four times in a single turn with no cost. Bravely Second requires SP, a currency which is either replenished while the 3DS is in sleep mode or through buying regenerative SP Drinks using microtransactions. Battle speed during combat can be sped up or returned to normal by the player's choice.|$|E
