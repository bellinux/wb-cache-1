To begin, {{it is essential to}} look at the standard materials used to perform the empirical temperature correction on heating and cooling of the DSC via 2 nd degree polynomial fits as well as literature values. It is clear from the data in Fig. 5. that there is good agreement between the corrected temperatures and the reference values over a broad range of temperatures suggesting that independent empirical fits on heating and cooling self-consistently model the instrumental errors. Despite the low accuracy of Type-S thermocouples at low temperature, anything measured within the temperature range of the references should produce reliable, repeatable, Curie temperature data.

The impulse response of the thermocouple was analyzed by using both a one-dimensional solution and a two-dimensional model. The experimental impulse response of the thermocouple was investigated by a laser impulse excitation experiment to validate the modelling results. The modelling results showed that {{there was a significant difference}} between the two-dimensional modelling and the one-dimensional analytical solution, especially before 1 ms. The two-dimensional modelling result is closer to the laser impulse experiment result, which implies the existence of a multi-dimensional effect on the transient heat conduction within the eroding thermocouple. Engine heat flux measurements were obtained using the impulse response analysis, and a comparison of the computed heat flux has been made using the experimental impulse response and the different models. The use of a laser impulse calibration is recommended.

To analyze the risks associated to this process, the safety characteristics of these explosive mixtures {{have to be taken}} into account. A literature review showed that some safety features of methane in oxygen or in air were not available. Thus, the flammability ternary diagram of CH 4 /O 2 /CO 2 mixtures was determined at room temperature and 1 bar pressure. Furthermore, the influence of oxygen content on the explosion severity (Pmax; dP/dt) was investigated. The ternary mixtures were prepared directly in a 20 L spherical test vessel. The concentrations of reactants were adjusted using the relationship between the partial pressure and the molar fraction of gas. The ignition source used was an <b>alumel</b> fusing wire. The flammability limits of methane in oxygen were extrapolated at 5 and 68 % vol., by using the established CH 4 /O 2 /CO 2 mixtures ternary diagram.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Two new {{experimental}} {{techniques are}} presented which enable the direct measurement of heat transfer coefficients in fine particle gas fluidized beds. The first technique uses fine electrically heated <b>Alumel</b> wires to probe fluidized beds of fine particles. The wires varied in diameter from 50. 8 to 813 μm while the bed material consisted of uniformly sized sand, glass, aluminum and polyethylene particles from 105 to 754 μm. The wires are loose and hence {{are free to}} move around and sample the cross-section of the bed. By measuring the voltage and current flow in the wire the temperature and hence heat transfer coefficient can be determined. The heat transfer coefficients obtained varied from 262 to 2100 W/m². K and these were successfully correlated by a new equation. The heat transfer coefficients obtained for fine wires in fine particle fluidized beds are greater than for fine wires in air alone. The significance of this enhancement in heat transfer is discussed. The second technique uses the change in magnetic properties of a low Curie-point ferrite to track the changing temperature of a cold sample of particles injected into a hot fluidized bed. The hot fluidized bed {{is surrounded by a}} detector coil which is connected to an electronic sensor. This coil-sensor arrangement is capable of detecting small changes in the magnetic properties of the material in the fluidized bed. A model was developed {{to take into account the}} effects of particle size distribution, mixing, equipment lag, and changing magnetic permeability on the output response of the ferrite sensor. By comparing the data and model the heat transfer coefficient could be evaluated. The size of particles studied varied from 125 μm to 355 μm while the heat transfer coefficients obtained varied from 70 to 230 W/m². K. The heat transfer coefficients evaluated using this technique are greater than the previously reported values but lie below those predicted for a single particle in air alone. A qualitative discussion is presented that supports the argument that the true fluid-particle heat transfer coefficients for fine particle fluidized systems lie above the correlation for single spheres in air...|$|E

K-type thermocouple powders consisting of <b>alumel</b> (Ni 2 Al 2 Mn 1 Si) and chromel (Ni 10 Cr) werestudied as candidate feedstock materials. A thermocouple sensor using these materials was firstproduced by coaxial continuous wave (CW) or pulsed laser cladding process onto the standardyttria partially stabilized zirconia (7 ~ 8 wt. % YSZ) coated substrate and afterwards embeddedwith a second YSZ layer deposited by the atmospheric plasma spray (APS) process. The processparameters of the laser cladding were optimized with respect to the degradation of the substrate,dimensions, topography, thermosensitivity and embeddability, respectively. Infrared cameraswere used to monitor the surface temperature of clads during this process. The manufacture of the cladded thermocouple sensors provides minimal intrusive features to thesubstrate. The dimensions were in the range of two hundred microns in thickness and width forCW laser cladding and less than 100 microns for pulsed laser cladding. Additionally, continuousthermocouple sensors with reliable performance were produced. It is possible to embed sensorsmanufactured by CW laser cladding rather than by pulsed laser cladding due to the limitedbonding strength between the clads and the substrate. Periodically droplets were formed alongthe clads under improper parameters, the mechanism to this is discussed in terms of particle sizedistribution after interaction with the laser beam, melts duration and Rayleigh’s theory.
