40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} three {{questions}} concerning the knee joint and total knee arthroplasty. 1. Are there parameters which can be changed to reduce bone resorption, caused by TKA, without affecting other relevant parameters? A debonded anterior flange of the femoral TKA component reduces bone resorption without jeopardizing the implant fixation. 2. Can {{the design of the}} femoral component be changed to obtain more physiological patellar kinematics? The orientation of the natural trochlea is significantly different (even opposite) to the orientation of the patella groove of an implanted femoral TKA component. The patellar kinematics are strongly correlated to the orientation of the trochlea and the groove. A more <b>anatomical</b> <b>groove</b> design is proposed. 3. Is it possible to increase the range of motion without adversely affecting the mechanical performance in high flexion TKA? Dynamic FE models were used. High flexion TKA shows a similar mechanical behavior as conventional TKA in normal flexion (120 degrees). It should be noted that high flexion TKA still creates relatively high stress levels in high flexion even if the prosthetic components are optimized for high flexion...|$|E
50|$|The {{long term}} {{effectiveness}} of scaling and root planing depends upon {{a number of}} factors. These factors include patient compliance, disease progress {{at the time of}} intervention, probing depth, and <b>anatomical</b> factors like <b>grooves</b> in the roots of teeth, concavities, and furcation involvement which may limit visibility of underlying deep calculus and debris.|$|R
40|$|Groove {{pancreatitis}} {{is a rare}} form {{of chronic}} pancreatitis that affects the <b>groove</b> <b>anatomical</b> area between {{the head of the}} pancreas, duodenum, and common bile duct. We provide a summary of the clinical findings of 4 groove pancreatitis cases diagnosed at a tertiary academic medical center over a 5 -year period. A detailed review of the current literature surrounding this clinical entity is also provided. Although rare, groove pancreatitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with pancreatic head mass lesions, as appropri-ate diagnosis can help avoid unnecessary surgical procedures...|$|R
40|$|Patellofemoral {{problems}} {{are a common}} cause of morbidity and reoperation after total knee arthro-plasty. We made a prospective study of 52 patients who had bilateral arthroplasty (104 knees) and in whom the patella was resurfaced {{on one side and}} not on the other. A movable-bearing prosthesis with an <b>anatomical</b> femoral <b>groove</b> was implanted on both sides by the same surgeon using an otherwise identical technique. The mean follow-up was 5. 24 years (2 to 10). In the 30 available patients (60 knees) {{there was no difference between}} the two sides in subjective preference, performance on ascending and descending stairs or the incidence of anterior knee pain. Radio-graphs showed no differences in prosthetic alignment, femoral condylar height, patellar congruency or joint line position. The use of an appropriate prosthetic design and careful surgical technique can provide equivalent results after knee arthroplasty with or without patellar resurfacing. Given the indications and criteria, which we discuss, retention of the patellar surface is an acceptable option...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Groove {{pancreatitis}} is {{an uncommon}} cause of chronic pancreatitis {{that affects the}} <b>groove</b> <b>anatomical</b> area between {{the head of the}} pancreas, duodenum, and common bile duct. Clinical case: A 67 -year-old man with frequent biliary colic and an alcohol consumption of 30 – 40  g/day was admitted to the hospital complaining of jaundice and pruritus. Laboratory analysis revealed cholestasis and the ultrasound scan showed intra-hepatic biliary ducts dilatation, middle third cystic dilatation of common bile duct, enlarged Wirsung and pancreatic atrophy. The magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed imaging findings compatible with groove pancreatitis. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy later excluded duodenal neoplasia. He was submitted to a Roux-en-Y cholangiojejunostomy because of common bile duct stricture. Five months later a gastrojejunostomy was performed due to a duodenal stricture. The patient remains asymptomatic during follow-up. Discussion: Groove pancreatitis is a benign cause of obstructive jaundice, whose main differential diagnosis is duodenal or pancreatic neoplasia. When this condition causes duodenal or biliary stricture, surgical treatment can be necessary...|$|R
40|$|Background: Arthritis of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint is {{characterized}} by loss of MTP joint range of motion (ROM) and pain. Joint arthroplasty is one treatment option, and while results can be satisfactory, there is still room for improvement. The aim was to use cadaveric model to compare the sagittal kinematics and articulating contact properties of 4 different first metatarsal head designs of an MTP joint implant. Methods: Six cadaveric feet were each prepared with a single modular first MTP joint total arthroplasty. A standard cyclic load, which induced hallux dorsiflexion, was applied and motion measured from high resolution images. Contact behavior was collected simultaneously using a pressure transducer. Data collected compared the native joint with 4 different reconstructed cases. Each reconstructed joint used a different metatarsal-head-component while reusing the same phalangeal component to compare the 4 alternative metatarsal head designs. Results: All reconstructed joints displayed greater ROM compared with the intact joint. Of the 4 metatarsal head components, the <b>grooved,</b> <b>anatomical</b> design demonstrated the greatest dorsiflexion {{when compared to the}} standard design, 31. 6 degrees (SD ± 8. 6 degrees), P <. 05. All reconstructed joints displayed contact areas lower than the intact (~ 50 %, P <. 001). The grooved metatarsal-head-component experienced the least contact force (P <. 015), and the eccentric component underwent the greatest contact pressure (P <. 05) when compared to the intact case. Conclusions: In this study of a first metatarsophalangeal joint replacement design, ROM was shown to be better for the more anatomically designed metatarsal head, while contact properties did not vary across different designs. Clinical Relevance: This information may be useful in the development of new metatarsal components. 9 page(s...|$|R
