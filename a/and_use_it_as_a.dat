5|$|Jibril is a , a {{powerful}} angelic race {{known for their}} ruthlessness. Jibril is over 6000-years old and is the youngest and most powerful of her species. She won Elkia's library from Stephanie's grandfather in order to store her books <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> home. After losing to Sora and Shiro {{in a game of}} Shiritori, she becomes their slave, but is treated as an equal. She often provides magic or transportation necessities for the protagonists. Later on, she begins publishing novels based on Sora and Shiro which makes them famous among the flügels. She is voiced by Yukari Tamura and English dubbed by Amelia Fischer.|$|E
5|$|The {{interface}} and gameplay style do {{not differ}} much from the previous title. MediEvil 2 sees the player once again in control of Sir Daniel Fortesque, who can use various forms of weaponry, such as close range swords and clubs to long-range crossbows or catapults. The game contains several of the original forms of gameplay, weaponry, and graphics that {{were present in the}} first instalment of the series. Similar to its predecessor, Dan is able to tear off his skeletal arm <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> club to fight off enemies during the early levels. Whilst featuring many of the classic swords and other medieval weaponry, new weapons featured in MediEvil 2 include pistols, shotguns and Gatling guns.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{with the}} project still unfinished, the museum {{published}} a report examining {{the reasons for the}} delay and additional cost. It found that the museum had greatly underestimated the work required due to the poor condition of the locomotive, much of which had been missed by a rushed inspection, which produced an overly optimistic assessment which was not based on engineering realities. It also found that once the project was underway, management lacked the experience, continuity or resources to undertake such a complex task, which was also hampered by illness and recruitment issues. Although the museum had a formal contract system to manage suppliers, managers failed to implement it properly, and it was ill-suited to the cottage industry nature of the heritage railway sector which the suppliers were largely drawn from, many of whom had failed to meet their contractual targets. Problems were also caused by the conflicting objectives of producing a certified main line locomotive while retaining as many original components and assemblies as possible, and between the need to overhaul the locomotive <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> marketing tool for the museum. The report recommended that the NRM consider the scope, size and responsibilities of their project management and engineering functions, and their contracting policy.|$|E

5|$|On 29 January 1686, Captain Melchor Rodríguez Mazariegos, acting {{under orders}} from the governor, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán, where he {{recruited}} indigenous warriors from the nearby villages, 61 from San Mateo itself. It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtatán were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the Lacandon region, which included parts {{of what is now}} the Mexican state of Chiapas and {{the western part of the}} Petén Basin. To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, named as Cristóbal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango. The governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtatán on 3 February, where Captain Rodríguez Mazariegos was already awaiting him. The governor ordered the captain to remain in the village <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. The Spanish missionaries Fray de Rivas and Fray Pedro de la Concepción also remained in the town. Governor Enriquez de Guzmán subsequently left San Mateo Ixtatán for Comitán in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via Ocosingo.|$|E

The Pueblos also had one or more kivas, which served as religious chambers. The leader of each Pueblo would serve as the community religious leader, or cacique. The cacique would observe the sun <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> guide for scheduling ceremonies, some which were kept secret.|$|E

25|$|The railway {{first thought}} {{of using a}} diesel {{locomotive}} in the early 1970s, when a small four-wheeled diesel-mechanical locomotive built by Ruston & Hornsby (their class 48DL) was bought second-hand from a quarry. It was intended to regauge it <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> yard shunter at Llanberis. It was sold to the Llanberis Lake Railway in 1978 without being regauged or used on the SMR. It {{would have been the}} railway's only locomotive without pinions, and as such would have been of limited use – it is doubtful if it would have had sufficient grip on the grease covered rails to shunt a dead steam locomotive. This locomotive has since been dismantled and scrapped.|$|E
25|$|In 1792 Speyer {{was again}} occupied, {{this time by}} French revolutionary troops, and once more the cathedral was pillaged. During the Napoleonic Wars (1803 to 1815) the cathedral {{was used as a}} stable and storage {{facility}} for fodder and other material. In 1806 the French had in mind to tear the building down <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> quarry, which was only prevented by the bishop of Mainz, Joseph Ludwig Colmar. After Napoleon's victories over the Prussian and Russian armies in the Battles of Grossgörschen and Lützen in 1813, around 4,000 wounded soldiers came to Speyer. After the battle of Leipzig there were even more and the cathedral was needed as an army hospital.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{increasing}} flight of Kuber's Byzantine subjects to Thessaloniki, he and Mauros hatched a plan to seize the city <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> base for future expansion. Mauros {{was seen as the}} ideal candidate to carry out the mission not only due to Kuber's trust in him, but also because Mauros was fluent in Slavic and Greek. In line with the plan, Mauros was sent by Kuber to Thessaloniki pretending to be a refugee in charge of a group of people fleeing from Kuber. Mauros was not only welcomed inside the city, but also put in charge of all Bulgar and Sermesianoi refugees and given the title of hypatos by Byzantine Emperor Justinian II (r. 685–695, 705–711). Mauros appears to have commanded his own military force, consisting of former subjects of Kuber who were nominally part of the Byzantine army. While many of Thessaloniki's notables were suspicious of Mauros, his significant power enabled him to effectively deal with anyone who was close to uncovering his plot.|$|E

25|$|Karl Popper {{tried to}} {{establish}} a criterion of demarcation between science and metaphysics, but the speculative turn taken by certain developments in theoretical physics has contributed to muddle the issue again. Mosterín has been concerned {{with the question of}} the reliability of theories and claims. He makes a distinction between the standard core of a scientific discipline, that at a certain point in time should only include relatively reliable and empirically supported ideas, and the cloud of speculative hypotheses surrounding it. Part of the theoretical progress consists in the incorporation of newly tested hypotheses of the cloud to the standard core. In this connection, he has analyzed epistemic notions like detection and observation. Observation, but not detection, is accompanied by awareness. Detection is always mediated by technological instruments, but observation only sometimes (like glasses in vision). The signals received by detectors have to be transduced into types of energy accessible to our senses. Following the path open by Patrick Suppes, Mosterín has paid much attention to the structure of metric concepts, because of their indispensable mediating role at the interface between theory and observation where reliability is tested. He has also made contributions to the study of mathematical modeling and of the limits of the axiomatic method in the characterization of real-world structures. The real world is extremely complex, and sometimes {{the best we can do}} is to apply the method of theoretical science: to pick up in the set-theoretical universe a mathematical structure with some formal similarities with the situation we are interested in, <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> model of that parcel of the world. Together with Roberto Torretti, Mosterín has written a uniquely comprehensive encyclopedic dictionary of logic and philosophy of science.|$|E
