40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focuses on}} the original mineralogy of Wuchiapingian (Late Permian) to Induan (Early Triassic) strata of the Shahreza section of Iran to understand changes in marine carbonate system during this transition. Aragonitic carbonates precipitated during {{the early part of}} the Wuchiapingian, gradually changing to calcite during the middle part of the Wuchiapingian and continuing through the Changhsingian. Carbonate precipitation ceased during the latest Changhsingian at the end-Permian Event Horizon (EH). A sharp reversal back to aragonite precipitation occurred in the Early Triassic. These changes are interpreted as the ocean's response to a changing climate. This study proposes three types of seawater for the Late Permian to Early Triassic interval. Normal (Anahita-type) seawater during the Late Permian was hospitable to life and supported a highly <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> factory. Acidic (Jahi-type) seawater during the PTB transition was acidic and hostile to life, slowing or halting carbonate production. Alkaline (Amordad-type) seawater during the Early Triassic was life-nurturing and supported an <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> factory. It sustained life until a normal (Anahita-type) seawater could be re-established...|$|E

40|$|International audienceHydrotalcite derived {{catalysts}} promoted with Ce, Zr and CeZr showed considerable {{activity in}} dry methane reforming (DMR) at low temperatures (550 °C). Direct methane decomposition {{resulting in the}} extensive formation of fishbone-type carbon nanofibers was substantially inhibited {{in the presence of}} Zr. Physicochemical characterization by means of N 2 adsorption, XRD, TPR and CO 2 -TPD evidenced narrower porosity and higher surface areas for the Zr-containing catalysts, together with the presence of smaller Ni particles (around 4 nm) and CO 2 preferential adsorption in weak basic sites. Such small Ni particles are inactive towards the direct methane decomposition reaction. The ability of the Zr-containing catalysts to adsorb CO 2 on weak basic sites results in the formation of <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> species that are able to react with methane through the DMR route. The reverse Boudouard reaction occurs simultaneously to a certain extent in the presence of Zr-promoted catalyst, since carbon nanotube formations were visible on the catalyst surface upon its utilization...|$|E

The reservoir drill-in fluid (RDF) {{is the first}} non-native fluid to contact formation, and which influences directly the ultimate capacity {{of oil and gas}} well. The paper discusses the smart RDF design method based on conventional drilling fluid. The designed RDF system is characterized as good formation damage control, as well as the performance easily adjusted for field application. The technology combines ideal packing technology with <b>active</b> calcium <b>carbonate</b> to obtain low permeability filter cake, high return permeability and low initial flowing pressure. The sized calcium carbonates contribute to develop sealing zone for preventing filtrate and solids from invading into formation, and the organophilic passageway in filter cake (the <b>active</b> calcium <b>carbonate)</b> is favorable to open automatically passageway for oil and gas during production. Different modifiers used to ground calcium carbonate surface modification are evaluated in laboratory.

40|$|The Northern Head {{group is}} an upper Middle Cambrian to Lower Ordovician base-of-slope {{sediment}} apron, deposited downslope from a shallow-water carbonate platform, and now disposed in imbricate thrust slices within the Humber Arm Allochthon, western Newfoundland. The group encompasses the upper Middle Cambrian to upper Tremadoc Cooks Brook Formation {{and the upper}} Tremadoc to middle Arenig Middle Arm Point Formation. The discovery of numerous fossil localities has facilitated the erection of a stratigraphic framework, embodying several correlatable members. These subdivisions reflect a natural change in the depositional style upward, from carbonate to shale-dominated. [...] The Cooks Brook is characterized by abundant platform-derived, gravity-transported carbonate, and hemipelagic black shale, deposited in a deep water, poorly-oxygenated environment. Earliest sediments accumulated at the mouths of submarine canyons but were buried by debris flow conglomerate sheets and carbonate sand turbidites from an active, upslope shallow-water platform margin. [...] Gravity transport of carbonate sharply diminished in earliest Ordovician time but hemipelagic carbonate sedimentation persisted into late Tremadoc time. [...] The change to shale-dominated sediments of the Middle Arm Point reflects a new, low-relief margin upslope. Hemipelagic shale was accompanied by detrital, windblown dolomite and both were reworked by bottom currents. Diminished input of shelf and slope-derived organic carbon, and more vigorous marine circulation, resulted in elevated Eh levels in the depositional environment which are indicated by (1) a pronounced increase in bioturbation, and (2) a new "suboxic" diagenetic regime, distinguished by widespread precipitation of Mn-carbonate and barite, largely within the stability field of hematite. Condensed sedimentation characterizes {{the middle of the}} Middle Arm Point, spanning the Tremadoc/Arenig boundary. Shale deposition continued until the collapsing margin was buried by sandstones of the overlying Eagle Island formation during middle Arenig time. [...] The Northern Head group and contemporaneous Cow Head Group were both part of an <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> margin until the Tremadoc. Their depositional and paleoceanographic histories diverged in late Tremadoc time, when a low-relief margin developed upslope from the Northern Head group while <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> sedimentation continued upslope from the Cow Head Group.

The purpose of the work was to examine the structure of a calcium silicate bioactive glass prepared by the sol-gel method. The samples were characterized by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). No traces of organic matter or nitrates in the stabilized material were found according to FTIR and TG/DTA measurements. The materials produced are amorphous even after stabilization at 700 degrees C up to about 850 degrees C. However, the materials sinterized at 1000 degrees C for 1 hour reveal crystalline phase and indeed that of CaSiO 3 (wollastonite). Thus, the materials prepared by the sol-gel method are homogeneous with high purity and after their stabilization below their crystallization temperature, they are amorphous.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{outlines}} {{the evolution of}} the late Cenozoic mixed carbonate-siliciclastic depositional system in the Gulf of Papua (GoP), using seismic, gravity, multibeam bathymetry, well data sets, and Landsat imagery. The deposition of the mixed sedimentary sequences was influenced by dynamic interplay of tectonics, eustasy, in situ carbonate production, and siliciclastic sediment supply. The roles of these major factors are estimated during different periods of the GoP margin evolution. The Cenozoic mixed system in the GoP formed in distinct phases. The first phase (Late Cretaceous-Paleocene) was mostly driven by tectonics. Rifting created grabens and uplifted structural blocks which served later as pedestals for carbonate edifices. Active neritic carbonate accumulation characterized the second phase (Eocene-middle Miocene). During this phase, mostly eustatic fluctuations controlled the large-scale sedimentary geometries of the carbonate system. The third phase (late Miocene-early Pliocene) was characterized by extensive demise of the carbonate platforms in {{the central part of the}} study area, which can be triggered by one or combination of several factors, such as eustatic sea level fluctuations, increased tectonic subsidence, uplift, sudden influx of siliciclastics, or dramatic changes in environmental conditions and climate. The fourth phase (late Pliocene-Holocene) was dominated by siliciclastics, which resulted in the burial of drowned and/or <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> platforms, although some platforms still remain alive until present-day...|$|E

Archaeal and bacterial communities composition was investigated using PCR-based methods (clone libraries, Denaturating Gel Gradient Electrophoresis, quantitative PCR) targeting 16 S rRNA genes, methyl coenzyme M reductase A and dissimilatory sulfite reductase subunit B genes. Methanosarcinales (Euryarchaeota) and Thaumarchaea {{were the main}} archaeal members. The Methanosarcinales, also observed by epifluorescent microscopy and FISH, consisted of two phylotypes that were previously solely detected in two other serpentinitzing ecosystems (The Cedars and Lost City Hydrothermal Field).

The bacterial community mainly consisted of Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Alpha-, Gamma-, Beta-, and Delta-proteobacteria and of the candidate division NPL-UPA 2. Members of these taxa were consistently found each year and may therefore represent a stable core of the indigenous bacterial community of the PHF chimneys.

40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>carbonate</b> {{platforms}} provide modern analogs {{to study}} microbial-mat development and taphonomy in the sedimentary record. Microbial-mat descriptions and classifications for tropical tidal-flat environments have focused predominantly on morphological observations. This is exemplified by flat and biscuit-shaped mats, where the mat morphotypes are postulated to reflect different Cyanobacteria communities {{as the main}} mat-building taxa. To compare the total microbial communities of these two mat types and test this Cyanobacteria hypothesis, we applied optical microscopy and gene sequencing methods using samples from a tidal algal marsh on Little Ambergris Cay, Turks and Caicos, B. W. I. With gene sequencing we find that total diversity and community composition differs significantly between morphotypes; the biscuit mat is more diverse than the flat mat. Microscopy results support that Cyanobacteria populations colonizing the surface layer of these two mat types are responsible {{for much of the}} mat's structural elements; however, genetic data find the Cyanobacteria population is indistinguishable between the two mat types. The recovered Cyanobacteria populations fall predominantly into three taxa: Scytonema, Halomicronema, and Crinalium. We propose that the morphology of these two mat types is not controlled by the Cyanobacteria, but instead reflects a time-integrated microbial response to environmental factors, where the microbial community becomes more diverse with time since environmental disturbance...|$|E

The most famous of all the natural summer truffle (Tuber aestivum Vittad.) habitats is the commonly called Jászság region. This area is situated {{in the middle of}} Hungary, between river Danube and Tisza. The flatland area is basically covered by river alluviums with main soils of chernozems, fluvisols, solonchaks and arenosols. Climate of the region is typically continental: warm and dry summers and cold winters vary. The area is traditionally of agricultural use, although strong afforestation was made in the late 1950 ’s. The English oak (Quercus robur L.) populations planted at that time gave a basis for current excellent truffle production. Nowadays the region has proved to be the best natural summer truffle (T. aestivum) producing area of Hungary with early season opening (June) and high quality truffles as early as August. In the research the best truffle producing forest blocks were selected for ecological investigation. Results of the detailed site description showed uniform climate characteristics and dominance of English oak (Q. robur) or mixed English oak-Turkey oak (Quercus cerris L.) forests. Soil types revealed differences from earlier findings: dominance of gleysols and water affected chernozems was declared.

40|$|Low-salinity {{waterflooding}} (LSW) is ineffective when {{reservoir rock}} is strongly water-wet or when crude oil is not asphaltenic. Success of LSW {{relies heavily on}} the ability of injected brine to alter surface chemistry of reservoir crude-oil brine/rock (COBR) interfaces. Implementation of LSW in carbonate reservoirs is especially challenging because of high reservoir-brine salinity and, more importantly, because of high reactivity of the rock minerals. Both features complicate understanding of the COBR surface chemistries pertinent to successful LSW. Here, we tackle the complex physicochemical processes in chemically <b>active</b> <b>carbonates</b> flooded with diluted brine that is saturated with atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) and possibly supplemented with additional ionic species, such as sulfates or phosphates. When waterflooding carbonate reservoirs, rock equilibrates with the injected brine over short distances. Injected-brine ion speciation is shifted substantially in the presence of reactive carbonate rock. Our new calculations demonstrate that rock-equilibrated aqueous pH is slightly alkaline quite independent of injected-brine pH. We establish, for the first time, that CO 2 content of a carbonate reservoir, originating from CO 2 -rich crude oil and gas, plays a dominant role in setting aqueous pH and rock-surface speciation. A simple ion-complexing model predicts the calcite-surface charge as a function of composition of reservoir brine. The surface charge of calcite may be positive or negative, depending on speciation of reservoir brine in contact with the calcite. There is no single point of zero charge; all dissolved aqueous species are charge determining. Rock-equilibrated aqueous composition controls the calcite-surface ion-exchange behavior, not the injected-brine composition. At high ionic strength, the electrical double layer collapses and is no longer diffuse. All surface charges are located directly in the inner and outer Helmholtz planes. Our evaluation of calcite bulk and surface equilibria draws several important inferences about the proposed LSW oil-recovery mechanisms. Diffuse double-layer expansion (DLE) is impossible for brine ionic strength greater than 0. 1 molar. Because of rapid rock/brine equilibration, the dissolution mechanism for releasing adhered oil is eliminated. Also, fines mobilization and concomitant oil release cannot occur because there are few loose fines and clays in a majority of carbonates. LSW cannot be a low-interfacial-tension alkaline flood because carbonate dissolution exhausts all injected base near the wellbore and lowers pH to that set by the rock and by formation CO 2. In spite of diffuse double-layer collapse in carbonate reservoirs, surface ion-exchange oil release remains feasible, but unproved...|$|R

Our research focused on humus forms in alluvial soils, which are considered as young and heterogeneous environments. We hypothesized that the soil structure formation is determined by both {{the nature of the}} recent alluvial deposits and the soil fauna. For this purpose, six sites were chosen throughout two types of softwood forests (willow and alder forest) representing two stages of vegetation succession. Evidence of soil texture influence on aggregate stability was observed. A dominance of a coarse sand fraction caused a quick colonization of enchytraeids and epigeic earthworms while a silty texture favoured the presence of anecic earthworms, thus increasing the aggregate stabilisation. Iron forms, acting as cementing agents, were observed in the coarse silt, while calcium carbonates were equally distributed among the textural fractions. <b>Active</b> calcium <b>carbonate</b> fraction, binding organic matter with mineral components, was not found in the coarse sand fraction.

40|$|Fault {{slip and}} healing history may crucially affect the fault seismogenic {{potential}} in the earthquake nucleation regime. Here we report direct shear friction tests on simulated gouges derived from a carbonate fault breccia, and from a clay/carbonate fault-core gouge, retrieved from a surface exposure of the Longmenshan Fault Zone (LFZ) which hosted the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. The experiments were conducted under dry and hydrothermal conditions, at temperatures up to 140 °C, at an effective normal stress of 50 [*]MPa, and involved sequential velocity-stepping (VS), slide-hold-slide (SHS), and velocity-stepping stages. Dry tests performed on breccia-derived samples showed no dependence of (quasi) steady state friction (μss) on SHS or VS history, and a log linear relation between transient peak healing (Δμpk) and hold time, or classical “Dieterich-type” healing behavior. By contrast, all experiments conducted under hydrothermal conditions were characterized by “non-Dieterich” healing behavior. This included (1) an increase in μss upon resliding after a hold period and (2) an increase in friction rate parameter (a[*]−[*]b), after SHS testing. Comparison with previous results suggests that the healing behavior seen in our wet tests {{may be attributed to}} solution transfer processes occurring during hold periods. Our findings imply that the shallow portions of faults with carbonate/clay-rich cores (e. g., the LFZ) can heal much faster than previously recognized, while the upper limit of the seismogenic zone may migrate to deeper levels during interseismic periods.

Low-impact development and maintenance have preserved prediscovery macroscopic cavern features and minimized disturbances to biological communities within the cave [...] The goal {{of this study was to}} examine fungal diversity in Kartchner Caverns on actively-forming speleothem surfaces. Fifteen formations were sampled from five sites across the cave. Richness was assessed using standard culture-based fungal isolation techniques. A culture-independent analysis using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to assay evidence of community homogeneity across the cave through the separation of 18 S rDNA amplicons from speleothem community DNA. The culturing effort recovered 53 distinct morphological taxonomic units (MTUs), corresponding to 43 genetic taxonomic units (GTUs) that represented 21 genera. From the observed MTU accumulation curve and the projected total MTU richness curve, it is estimated that 51 percent of the actual MTU richness was recovered. The most commonly isolated fungi belonged to the genera Penicillium, Paecilomyces, Phialophora, and Aspergillus. This culture- based analysis did not reveal significant differences in fungal richness or number of fungi recovered across sites. Cluster analysis using DGGE band profiles did not reveal distinctive groupings of speleothems by sample site. However, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) analysis of culture-independent DGGE profiles showed a significant effect of sampling site and formation type on fungal community structure. Taken together, these results reveal that diverse fungal communities exist on speleothem surfaces in Kartchner Caverns, and that these communities are not uniformly distributed spatially. Analysis of sample saturation indicated that more sampling depth is required to uncover the full scale of mycological richness across spelothem surfaces...|$|E

Based on 3 D and 2 D seismic surveys combined with exploration well data, this study demonstrates that the stratigraphic organisation of the Malita ISB is mainly driven by fluctuations of the relative sea-level. It can be divided in three main 3 rd-order system tracts: (1) a transgressive system tract, corresponding to a period of <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> aggradation during the late Pliocene, (2) a highstand system tract, associated with a period of strong carbonate progradation during the early-middle Quaternary, and; (3) a last system tract phasing late Quaternary high-frequency fluctuations of the accommodation space, and associated with backstepping and progressive burial of most of antecedent carbonate platforms by mixed siliciclastic/carbonate sediments. In detail, 3 D seismic stratigraphy and geomorphology analysis reveals that the mixed sedimentary system of the Malita ISB is also associated with higher-order sequences, marked by phases of carbonate growth during 4 th to 5 th order transgressions and highstands, while tide-dominated shallow water deposits accumulate during 4 th – 5 th order lowstands. Throughout the late Pliocene and up to the middle Quaternary, periods of lower sea-levels were associated with widespread tidal and fluvial incisions across the intra-shelf basin, resulting in a complex stratigraphic architecture in the inter-reef areas. Our findings clearly indicate that the well constrained Plio-Quaternary evolution of the Malita ISB represents an outstanding analogue to improve the knowledge of ancient intra-shelf basin depositional settings, which frequently coincide with prolific hydrocarbon systems...|$|E

Data closely obey the Freundlich equation and indicate 2 distinct mechanisms of adsorption (fig 1, table II) according to whether the cadmium in the bulk solution is present in tracer or in higher amounts. In addition, some precipitation with a concomitant decrease in pH could also occur at initial concentrations of Cd higher than 5 mg/l (fig 2). Statistical analysis (tables III and IV) points out that the adsorbed amounts of Cd may be estimated from the CEC (AcNH 4) values and the <b>active</b> calcium <b>carbonate</b> content. The agreement between the predictive values and the experimental ones is shown to be fairly good (fig 3). The higher adsorption of Cd in comparison with the noncalcareous soils is due to the reactivity of calcite surfaces (chemisorption and nucleation-precipitation, respectively at low and high rates of Cd) and also to the commonly high pH of the soils studied (7. 6 < pH < 8. 6). Comparison of the adsorption isotherms measured in chloride (CaCl 2 0, 01 mol. l- 1) and perchlorate (Ca(ClO 4) 2 0, 01 mol. l- 1) media (fig 4) points out that adsorption of Cd is mainly determined by the activity of free Cd 2 + in the soil solution...|$|R
40|$|The {{northern}} {{portions of}} the Catinaccio and Sciliar Buildups provide the best available record of the syn-volcanic evolution of the Dolomites platforms. During the middle Ladinian tectono-magmatic event, the gravitational instability of the slopes cut large scalloped structures into the margins, while huge carbonate fragments ruined into the adjacent basins, generating megabreccia bodies. Although {{the climax of the}} volcanic activity deeply affected the carbonate factory in the western Dolomites, it never completely stopped the carbonate production. The resilience of the carbonate systems was indeed such that some calcareous production stayed alive throughout the entire volcanic activity. Even if the study area was close to the major magmatic centres of the Dolomites, a real syn-volcanic carbonate production has been documented. The onset of the volcanism however triggered strong modification in the carbonate facies composition: the margin-slope facies dominated by large syn-depositional cement crusts suddenly gave way to automicritic facies, quite similar to the Cipit Boulders post-volcanic ones. Loose bioclastic resediments also reappeared, after being extremely scanty in the pre-volcanic basins. A fully <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> platform growth was promptly re-established at the fading of the magmatic activity. The depositional architecture of the platform finely records a sharp reduction in the subsidence rate just before the magmatic event, a decrease probably related to the crustal heating, within a prevailingly extensional tectonic framework. A comparatively reduced subsidence is also recorded by the moderate thickness (75 - 80 m) of the post-volcanic platform top beds on the Schlern Plateau. This subsidence evolution reflects the crustal evolution during the Ladinian tectono-magmatic event, which left an important structural heritage that was going to influence the Alpine deformation, more than 100 million years later...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOman Exotics {{represent}} {{remnants of}} a Triassic carbonate platform, also named Misfah Formation. Several basaltic intrusions or lava flows were coeval with the carbonate platform buildup. We present field observations related {{to one of these}} volcanic events, including associated deformation of the host rocks and interaction of volcanism with the sedimentation. These observations allow us to reconstruct the structure of the volcanic conduit and vent and the successive stages of the evolution of the eruption. The initial ascent of magma probably occurred along on a normal fault related to gravity-driven sliding towards the platform edge. Magma was first emplaced in a saucer-shaped sill a few tens of meters below the sea-floor. This intrusion provided a decollement layer, that may have sped up the gravity-driven sliding, opening fractures that brought sea water into contact with the magma, hence triggering a hydromagmatic eruption. Eruption was followed by the collapse of the host limestones that formed a megabreccia infilling the eruptive vent and prohibiting further contact between sea water and magma. Most of the magma was emplaced at depth in two superposed small magmatic bodies (300 × 100 m and 200 × 50 m in sections, respectively) that replaced the host sediments and uplifted the overlying vent. Despite the shallow submarine setting, this eruption produced a vent quite similar to sub-aerial maars developed in soft substrate. This emphasizes that the rheology of the substrate may be more important than the amount of water to control magma–water interaction in hydromagmatic eruptions. In an <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> platform like Misfah Formation during Triassic times, the early diagenesis of lime mud determined the mechanical comportment of the sediment at the time of eruption, and especially the way it could be mixed with the magma and/or slide into the vent...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOngoing {{research}} on martian meteorites {{and a new}} set of observations of carbonate minerals provided by an unprecedented series of robotic missions to Mars in the past 15 years help define new constraints on the history of martian climate with important crosscutting themes including: the CO 2 budget of Mars, the role of Mg-, Fe-rich fluids on Mars, and the interplay between carbonate formation and acidity. Carbonate minerals have now been identified {{in a wide range of}} localities on Mars as well as in several martian meteorites. The martian meteorites contain carbonates in low abundances (< 1 vol. %) and with a wide range of chemistries. Carbonates have also been identified by remote sensing instruments on orbiting spacecraft in several surface locations as well as in low concentrations (2 - 5 wt. %) in the martian dust. The Spirit rover also identified an outcrop with 16 to 34 wt. % carbonate material in the Columbia Hills of Gusev Crater that strongly resembled the composition of carbonate found in martian meteorite ALH 84001. Finally, the Phoenix lander identified concentrations of 3 - 6 wt. % carbonate in the soils of the northern plains. The carbonates discovered to date do not clearly indicate the past presence of a dense Noachian atmosphere, but instead suggest localized hydrothermal aqueous environments with limited water availability that existed primarily in the early to mid-Noachian followed by low levels of carbonate formation from thin films of transient water from the late Noachian to the present. The prevalence of carbonate along with evidence for <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> precipitation suggests that a global acidic chemistry is unlikely and a more complex relationship between acidity and carbonate formation is present...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the central}} Apennines, {{interacting}} siliciclastic and carbonate marine clastic wedges filled the foreland basin system {{during the late}} Miocene. Conjunction of collisional thrust tectonics and prethrusting normal faults generated a complex foredeep with intrabasinal structural highs that represented additional source areas to the basin. Detrital modes of the late Miocene central Apennines orogenic system range in composition from intrabasinal carbonate to quartzofeldspatholithic and calclithite arenites. The external zone of the foredeep is characterized by hemipelagic deposits, called the Orbulina Marl. Their arenite beds are composed by intrabasinal carbonate, with dominant bioclasts and minor intraclasts, and glauconite derived from an <b>active</b> shallow-marine <b>carbonate</b> source. These hemipelagic deposits are partly coeval with and partly overlain by siliciclastic turbidites of the Frosinone and the Argilloso-Arenacea Formations, and they represent deposition within local foredeep depocenters. Siliciclastic turbidite sandstones are quartzofeldspatholithic, which documents provenances from metamorphic, plutonic, ophiolitic, and sedimentary rocks. Carbonate intrabasinal structural highs were the main source for carbonate breccias, intrabasinal arenites, and calclithites of the Brecce della Renga Formation, the deposits of which are locally interbedded with the coeval siliciclastic turbidite sandstones. Evolution of late Miocene sandstone detrital modes reflected {{the changing nature of}} the central Apennines thrust belt through time and the complex architecture of the foreland basin system; it records the history of accretion, deformation of the foredeep, and progressive areal reduction of carbonate-producing areas along with the sedimentary and structural evolution of local intrabasinal highs...|$|R
40|$|Pisana' {{is a new}} apricot cultivar, {{resulting}} from Pisa University's breeding programme, with low vigour, late blooming and ripening and self-compatibility, but with very few flowers. The fruit is very big, attractive and delicious. A trial {{was carried out in}} northern Italy, in the dry sandy soil of the Berici hills, near Vicenza, in order to evaluate the behaviour of cultivar 'Pisana' on several rootstocks. Fifteen rootstocks were tested (10 lines of apricot seedlings and 6 Prunus clones). In the dry conditions of the Berici hills, with an <b>active</b> limestone (calcium <b>carbonate)</b> content higher than 8 %, the best performance came from apricot seedlings, with great differences between lines. They began to crop in the third year: the average crop per tree ranged between 45 and 60 kg, with an average fruit weight of 70 g. The refractomer index was never lower than 14 - 15 degrees Brix. The Prunus clones suffered due to the sandy soil and the lack of water and induced a higher sensitivity to trunk bacterial canker...|$|R
40|$|Catechol {{carbonate}} (CC) {{has been}} investigated as an innovative and highly <b>active</b> reactant for <b>carbonate</b> interchange reactions (CIRs). Under mild conditions (atmospheric pressure, and 60 – 80 °C), the selective synthesis of symmetric aliphatic carbonates (ROCO 2 R) has been achieved by the reaction of a slight excess of both primary and secondary alcohols with CC {{in the presence of}} NaOMe or MgO as a catalyst. Quantitative conversions have been reached in only 1 hour and products have been isolated in yields of up to 58 % for dibutylcarbonate. Of note is that the reaction of glycerol with CC also proceeded under similar conditions (40 – 60 °C, 1 atm) to afford glycerol carbonate (96 – 98 %). The comparison of the reactivity of CC with that of conventional dialkyl carbonates, including dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylene carbonate (EC), proved the superior performance of CC in all the investigated CIR processes. Accordingly, a mechanism has been formulated based on the leaving group ability of a catecholate anion originating from CC...|$|R
40|$|A major {{volcanic}} {{episode is}} recorded across the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian transition in the Moroccan Anti-Atlas. Several volcanic cones are still {{preserved in the}} El Graara massif, laterally correlatable with volcanic flows dated as Early Cambrian (U/Pb date of 534 +/- 10 Ma). Volcanic ashes and flows are interbedded with the uppermost part of the Adoudou dolostones, whereas the best-preserved volcano (the boho Jbel) is onlapped by the overlying Lie-de-Vin strata. Available petro-geochemical data fom the Boho volcano suggest an alkaline magmatism probably derived from low-grade melting of a garnet-lherzolite mantle source, followed by fractional crystallization. The silica-undersaturated basaltic liquid evolved to form oversaturated rocks: the fractionation of a ferromagnesian phase with high-Ca and low-Al contents is suggested as the main process to cut across the critical plane of silica undersaturation in this geochemical series. Although the Boho geochemical patterns {{are similar to those}} of some rift emplacements, more data from other coeval magmatic eruptions are necessary to constrain their geodynamic setting. Erosion of the Boho volcano favoured formation of a slope-apron composed of four sedimentary facies belts: chaotic megabreccia (related to downslope mass movements of rigid blocks), amalgamated breccia sheets (emplaced by viscous debris flows), a heteregeneous terrigenous belt (representing offshore substrates interrupted by channels intersected by cross-bedded shoals), and variegated shales and stromatolitic dolostones (typical of the Lie-de-vin Formation). Sharp changes in sedimentation rate were associated with modifications in paleorelief sloping and transport mechanisms from subaerial (?) rock fall at the foot of the cone escarpment to sheet-like debris flow on the slopes, and the replacement by sedimentation under wave and storm influence. The presence of an <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> productivity, recorded in the primary porosities of the Boho slope-apron, is suggested by widespread development of a robust, coelobiontic, microbial carbonate factory resilient to poisoning by terrigenous influx. Diagenesis in these deposits includes marine, meteoric and deep-burial cementation of calcite, dolomite, iron oxides, quartz, feldspar, and celestine, the latter indicating precipitation from hypersaline pore fluids...|$|E
40|$|Low-lying reef {{islands are}} among the most {{vulnerable}} environments on earth to anthropogenic-induced climate change and sea-level rise over the next century because they are low, composed of unconsolidated sediment that is able to be mobilised by waves and currents, and depend on sediments supplied by reef organisms that are particularly sensitive to environmental changes (e. g. ocean temperatures and chemistry). Therefore, the spatial and temporal links between <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> production and island formation and dynamics are fundamental to predicting future island resilience, yet remain poorly quantified. In this paper we present results of a detailed geomorphological and sedimentological study of a reef and sand cay on the northern Great Barrier Reef. We provide an empirical investigation of the temporal linkages between sediment production and reef island development using a large collection of single grain AMS 14 C dates. Large benthic foraminifera (LBF) are the single most important contributor to contemporary island sand mass (47 %; ranging from 36 % to 63 %) at Raine Island, reflecting rapid rates of sediment production and delivery. Standing stock data reveal extremely high production rates on the reef (1. 8 kg m− 2 yr− 1), while AMS 14 C dates of single LBF tests indicate rapid rates of sediment transferral across the reef. We also demonstrate that age is statistically related to preservation and taphonomic grade (severely abraded tests > moderately abraded tests > pristine tests). We construct a contemporary reef and island sediment budget model for Raine Island that shows that LBF (Baculogypsina, Marginopora and Amphistegina) contribute 55 % of the sediment produced on the reef annually, of which a large proportion (54 %) contribute to the net annual accretion of the island. The tight temporal coupling between LBF growth and island sediment supply combined with the sensitivity of LBF to bleaching and ocean acidification suggests that islands dominated by LBF are likely to be very sensitive to short and long term climate change projections. Potential outcomes of this work relate to improving the understanding of the future change dynamics of reef islands in response to climate change. © 2014, Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Coral reefs are now {{subject to}} global threats and {{influences}} from numerous anthropogenic sources. Foraminifera, {{a group of}} unicellular shelled organisms, are excellent indicators of water quality and reef health. Thus we studied a set of samples taken in 1992 to provide a foraminiferal baseline for future studies of environmental change. Our study provides the first island-wide analysis of shallow benthic foraminifera from around Moorea (Society Archipelago). We analyzed the composition, species richness, patterns of distribution and abundance of unstained foraminiferal assemblages from bays, fringing reefs, nearshore and back- and fore-reef environments. A total of 380 taxa of foraminifera were recorded, a number that almost doubles previous species counts. Spatial patterns of foraminiferal assemblages are characterized by numerical abundances of individual taxa, cluster groups and gradients of species richness, as documented by cluster, Fisher α, ternary plot and Principal Component Analyses (PCA). The inner bay inlets are dominated by stress-tolerant, mostly thin-shelled taxa of Bolivina, Bolivinella, Nonionoides, Elongobula, and Ammonia preferring low-oxygen and/or nutrient-rich habitats influenced by coastal factors such as fresh-water runoff and overhanging mangroves. The larger symbiont-bearing foraminifera (Borelis, Amphistegina, Heterostegina, Peneroplis) generally live in the oligotrophic, well-lit back- and fore-reef environments. Amphisteginids and peneroplids were among the few taxa found in the bay environments, probably due to their preferences for phytal substrates and tolerance to moderate levels of eutrophication. The fringing reef environments along the outer bay are characterized by Borelis schlumbergeri, Heterostegina depressa, Textularia spp. and various miliolids which represent a hotspot of diversity within the complex reef-lagoon system of Moorea. The high foraminiferal Fisher α and species richness diversity in outer bay fringing reefs {{is consistent with the}} disturbance-mosaic (microhabitat heterogeneity) hypothesis. Calculations of the FORAM Index (FI), a single metric index to assess reef vitality, indicate that all fore- and most back-reef environments support <b>active</b> <b>carbonate</b> accretion and provide habitat suitability for carbonate producers dependent on algal symbiosis. Lowest suitability values were recorded within the innermost bays, an area where natural and increasing anthropogenic influences continue to impact the reefs. The presence of habitat specific assemblages and numerical abundance values of individual taxa show that benthic foraminifera are excellent recorders of environmental perturbations and good indicators useful in modern and ancient ecological and environmental studies...|$|E
40|$|During the NAUTINIL cruise (September-October 2003), mud volcanoes and {{pockmarks}} {{located in}} four selected {{areas of the}} Nile deep-sea fan (caldera, central, eastern, North Alex) were investigated at water depths ranging from 500 to 3019 m. Authigenic carbonate crusts were observed directly by a submersible {{in each of these}} fluid-venting areas, in close association with specific chemosynthetic biological communities. Authigenic carbonates occur typically as pavements, slabs and mounds on the seafloor, but are also present as millimeter- to centimeter-size concretions dispersed within sediments. Mineralogical analyses of carbonate crusts and concretions indicate that aragonite and high-Mg calcite represent the most dominant carbonate phases. Low-Mg calcite, dolomite and ankerite also occur as minor components. Petrographic observations of carbonate crusts and concretions show that they are composed mainly of microcrystalline carbonate cement, with minor amounts of detrital minerals, lithoclasts and bioclasts. Aragonite is present as microcrystalline cement or acicular crystals infilling bioclasts and voids. Pyrite occurs as framboids or cubic crystals, which are often associated with authigenic carbonates, thereby indicating that sulfate reduction was <b>active</b> during <b>carbonate</b> precipitation. Numerous millimeter- to centimeter-size euhedral gypsum crystals have been observed within carbonate crusts and concretions, and as isolated crystals in sediments recovered from the eastern province. In this area, precipitation of gypsum is related to the presence of rising sulfate-rich fluids, which originate from the dissolution of underlying Messinian evaporites. Millimeter-size barite concretions have also been discovered in sediment from the central province and precipitated from ascending fluids, which are enriched in barium due to the dissolution of biogenic and/or authigenic barite below the depth of sulfate depletion. The oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of the carbonates display very large ranges, from - 0. 67 ‰ to 4. 15 ‰ Vienna PeeDee Belemnite (V-PDB) and from - 42. 14 ‰ to 3. 10 ‰ V-PDB, respectively.

40|$|Cascade poly(aryl ether) {{containing}} aryl sulfide or aryl sulfone groups, and aryl fluoride terminal functionality, were synthesized. Four {{generations of}} the dendrimers were prepared. The divergent initiator core method was employed, using 4, 4 $ sp prime$-difluorodiphenyl sulfone, as the core precursor, and a relatively high molecular weight phenol as the monomer. The strategy {{is based on an}} activation/condensation sequence that involves oxidation of the aryl sulfide group and the displacement of the activated aryl halide moiety by a phenolate ion. The aryl halide was activated by a sulfone group formed by oxidation of a sulfide group. Optimum conditions for the condensation reaction utilized a very <b>active</b> metal <b>carbonate,</b> such as cesium carbonate, in conjunction with magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate which removes some of the fluoride ions formed. The phenolate was generated in situ from an organic carbonate, thus eliminating the usual dehydration step. NMR characterization indicated that the reactions were most quantitative and MALDI-TOF-MS confirmed those results up to the third generation. No reaction intermediates were detected. Imperfections in some molecules of the dendrimers, formed by reaction of the core precursors with an impurity present in the phenol, were also identified. Simultaneously, aryl halide-terminated and phenol-terminated hyperbranched poly(ether sulfone) s were prepared by the polycondensation of A$ sb 2 $B monomers via a one-pot approach. Syntheses were developed for all the new monomers required. The main advantage of this method is its simplicity, which allows rapid access to large amounts of hyperbranched polymers.

Although soil {{is one of}} {{the factors}} in the biology of Tuber melanosporum (black truffle of Périgord), which {{has been the subject of}} much study, there are few {{quantitative}} analyses relating to its effects on carpophore production. The aim of this work is to establish the statistical relationship between T. melanosporum productivity in 20 soil surface horizons and their conventional soil properties (granulometric texture, pH, calcareous fractions, organic carbon, total nitrogen, exchangeable cations). The study area is situated in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula under a Mediterranean climate. Statistical analysis shows that the collective influence of these conventional soil features is low, as principal component analysis explains only 27 % of the variance in T. melanosporum production. However, a high percentage of <b>active</b> limestone (calcium <b>carbonate</b> extractable with ammonium oxalate) accounts for 40 % of the variance in T. melanosporum production. Active limestone is very important to T. melanosporum because it regulates soil pH and exchangeable Ca 2 + availability and participates in the organisation andmaintenance of the soil structure; it also plays a role in the truffle’s nutrition. These results obtained for active limestone may be of use in truffle cultivation...|$|R
