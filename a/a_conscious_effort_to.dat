5|$|When Paramount {{announced}} its first slate of DVD releases in August 1998, First Contact {{was one of}} the first ten titles released in October, announced in <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> showcase effects-driven films. This version contained the feature and two trailers, but no other special features. The film was presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic aspect ratio, with a surround sound Dolby Digital 5.1 audio mix.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{said that}} Spira {{deviates}} from {{the worlds of}} past Final Fantasy games most notably {{in the level of}} detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> maintain during the design process. Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E
5|$|Selbie {{also made}} <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> attract the wealthy classes to the railway. Stations such as Sandy Lodge (now Moor Park) were built to serve {{golf courses and}} hunts along the route, and horse-vans were {{provided}} at stations serving hunts and point to points. Two Pullman cars were introduced in 1909 on selected services between the City of London and Chesham, Aylesbury and Verney Junction {{for the benefit of}} businessmen travelling to work and theatregoers returning from London.|$|E

5000|$|According to Grof, death crises {{may occur}} over {{a series of}} {{psychedelic}} sessions until they cease to lead <b>to</b> panic. <b>A</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> not <b>to</b> panic {{may lead to a}} [...] "pseudohallucinatory sense of transcending physical death". According to Merkur, Repeated experience of the death crisis and its confrontation with the idea of physical death leads finally to an acceptance of personal mortality, without further illusions. The death crisis is then greeted with equanimity.|$|R
5000|$|Companies {{typically}} {{focus on}} inspection {{to ensure that}} defective product doesn't reach the customer. But this is both costly and still lets nonconformances through. [...] Prevention, {{in the form of}} [...] "pledging ourselves <b>to</b> make <b>a</b> constant <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> do our jobs right the first time", {{is the only way to}} guarantee zero defects. Beyond that, examining the production process for steps where defects can occur and mistake proofing them contributes to defect-free production.|$|R
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> give her own look and style to the character.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the terrible}} death toll of the aircrews {{involved}} in the Dambusters raid, he made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> never again <b>to</b> endanger {{the lives of his}} test pilots.

50|$|Pre-Millennium Tension is {{the second}} album from Tricky, {{released}} in 1996. It was <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> by Tricky <b>to</b> depart away from the trip hop label with which critics had described his previous music. The album was well received by critics, being named the ninth best record {{of the year in}} the 1996 Pazz & Jop poll.|$|R
5|$|While {{the entire}} script {{was still in}} the draft phase, Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their {{opinions}} on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not be made into a video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E

5000|$|Commenting on a 2011 {{interview}} with Whitson about Libya on NPR, Hugh Fitzgerald wrote: “Even with the few instances of live video feed we see coming from protests in Libya, the crowd's shouted mantra is, 'Allahu Akbar!' I don't think self-appointed Middle-East Experts such as Ms. Whitson would notice {{the signs of}} overt religious motivation, {{and if they did}} notice it, I think they would make <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> not <b>to</b> report it. She didn't mention the role of Islam in the protests of Bahrain or Libya (nor, one assumes, would she have in Egypt if asked).” ...|$|R
40|$|This project investigates what Asian American women {{consider}} traditional Asian, Asian American, {{and mainstream}} American beauty ideals and practices, and which set they follow. The findings are further split between East Asian and South Asian perspectives. Data was gathered through participant observation and interviews of second generation Asian American women. Findings show that many characteristics are universally desirable. Asian American women have beauty ideals {{similar to the}} mainstream American standard with some traditional influence. While both groups try to emulate white beauty standards, East Asian Americans appear <b>to</b> make <b>a</b> more <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> do so than South Asian Americans. unpublishe...|$|R
5000|$|The album {{represented}} <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> by Kiss <b>to</b> {{return to}} the hard rock style that had helped them achieve commercial success with Destroyer and Love Gun. Their pop-oriented albums Dynasty and Unmasked had started a decline in popularity that reached rock bottom with 1981's Music from [...] "The Elder". By 1982, Kiss knew it needed to deliver on their earlier 1980-81 promise of a heavy record.|$|R
25|$|The 2006/7 {{school year}} saw the Council make <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> be more known {{throughout}} the school, {{through a variety}} of methods including sponsoring showings of various films, posters around the school, and running charity events such as the Five Ways interpretation of World AIDS Day.|$|E
25|$|Other magazines, such as Granta, Tin House, and Boston Review {{have responded}} to The Count by making <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> remedy the gender {{disparity}} within their journals.

25|$|Another {{work that}} has {{included}} direct experiences from the women raped is Ami Birangona Bolchhi ("I, the heroine, speak") by Nilima Ibrahim. The work includes in {{its name from the}} word Birangona (Heroine), given by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after the war, to the raped and tortured women during the war. This was <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> alleviate any social stigma the women might face in the society.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} season of Survivor to have an odd number of castaways, with 19. Mellisa McNulty {{would have been the}} twentieth castaway, but dropped out the night before the show because of panic attacks and {{irritable}} bowel syndrome. Due to the timing and lack of alternates, her spot could not be replaced. Gary Stritesky was the only contestant who applied to be on the show; McNulty and the other 18 contestants were recruited. The cast retained the same amount of diversity as the previous season, Survivor: Cook Islands, in <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> intended <b>to</b> show that the racial diversity of Survivor: Cook Islands was not just a ratings stunt.|$|R
40|$|Meditation {{includes}} {{a variety of}} techniques that share <b>a</b> common <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> focus attention in a non-analytic way. In terms of its goals, meditation is a state of completely focused attention devoid of external thoughts [...] a state of heightened choice-less awareness. This study was designed to: (1) Identify and critically review professional literature on the effectiveness of meditation; (2) Provide an overall measure of effectiveness through the statistical meta-analysis technique; (3) Provide a classification of findings through the voting method; and (4) summarize and integrate highlights and major findings for the purpose of generating implications for future research and practice in counseling and psychotherapy...|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Jones {{left the}} band and Lanny Hussey was {{promoted}} to full membership. Ginger then made <b>a</b> more <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> develop its own distinctive sound, adding some trip hop and electronic elements to their album Suddenly I Came to My Senses. [...] Jones played keyboards on the album, billed as a [...] "special guest"; long-time session sideman Ashby was also a guest performer. Sarah McLachlan (billed merely as an [...] "additional musician") performed some of the backing vocals on the album. The song, [...] "Come To Me" [...] was featured in the film Kissed, and was included on the soundtrack album as well.|$|R
25|$|Lavoisier's {{fundamental}} {{contributions to}} chemistry were {{a result of}} <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> fit all experiments into {{the framework of a}} single theory. He established the consistent use of the chemical balance, used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous).|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Nintendo made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> {{revitalize the}} Pokémon brand with the Pokémon Black & White duology, which {{streamlined}} the battle system and introduced {{an entirely new}} lineup of characters in a new region based on New York City. These games were followed up with a direct numbered sequel in 2012, a first for the main series. 2012 also saw the release of Pokémon Conquest, a crossover with the Nobunaga's Ambition series of strategy role-playing games.|$|E
25|$|For example, Rivers {{proposed}} that officers and soldiers {{who suffer from}} night terrors {{do so because they}} are trying to wittingly repress emotions and their associated instincts back into the unconscious. Repression, according to Rivers, is never adequate for removing conflict; it is only fruitful when a person can exert <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> do so. As a result, the repressed instincts, along with their associated emotions and memories, seep into consciousness when soldiers are sleeping. The result is night terrors.|$|E
50|$|The Innisfail Water Tower is a {{distinctive}} landmark visible {{from all parts}} of Innisfail. At the time of construction it was described as a dignified structure of imposing presence overlooking the town. Through the unemployment relief schemes, <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> was made <b>to</b> produce concrete structures of pleasing appearance and the Innisfail Water Tower well illustrates the design elements, reflecting interwar Modernist concerns with functional simplicity, believed to impart this value.|$|R
5000|$|In {{relation}} to the script writing, Bein stated [...] "We made <b>a</b> very <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> make sure the man was very masculine, because {{a number of people}} when they heard about the subject felt that the man must be very wimpy." [...] In {{relation to}} the casting, Bein stated [...] "Judith Light said yes immediately. Peter Strauss was our second choice. Our first choice was an actor who said he was very offended that we sent him the script. He was angry at his agent for soliciting the script and forwarding it to him for him to read. Peter Strauss, a very bright man, accepted and did a very good job." ...|$|R
25|$|During {{this period}} in history, war rape took place not {{necessarily}} as <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> of war <b>to</b> terrorize the enemy, {{but rather as}} earned compensation for winning a war. There is little {{evidence to suggest that}} superiors regularly ordered subordinates to commit acts of rape. Throughout this period of history war became more regulated, specific, and regimented. The first formal prosecution for war crimes did not take place until the late Middle Ages.|$|R
25|$|Conservative Judaism {{holds that}} Orthodoxy has {{deviated}} from historical Judaism through excessive concern with recent codifications of Jewish law. Conservative rabbis make <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> use historical sources {{to determine what}} kind of changes occurred, how and why they occurred, and in what historical context. With this information they believe that can better understand a proper way for rabbis to interpret and apply Jewish law to our conditions today. Like Orthodoxy, {{there is no one}} legal body that speaks for all Jews in their religious community.|$|E
25|$|In 1635, in <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> emulate his warrior predecessors, Sultan Murad IV himself {{took up the}} {{leadership}} of the army. The Ottomans took Revan (on 8 August) and plundered Tabriz. The victorious Sultan returned in triumph to Constantinople, but his victories were short-lived: in the spring of the next year, Shah Safi retook Revan and defeated an Ottoman army. Renewed Persian peace proposals failed, and in 1638, Murad IV again personally led an army against Baghdad. The city fell in December after a siege of 39 days, effectively restoring Ottoman control over Iraq, and peace negotiations began soon after.|$|E
25|$|Dr. King {{decided to}} make <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> get arrested, {{for the benefit of}} publicity. On February 1, King and Ralph Abernathy refused to {{cooperate}} with Chief Baker's traffic directions {{on the way to the}} courthouse, calculating that Baker would arrest them, putting them in the Selma city jail run by Baker's police, rather than the county jail run by Clark's deputies. Once processed, King and Abernathy refused to post bond. On the same day, SCLC and SNCC organizers took the campaign outside of Dallas County for the first time; in nearby Perry County 700 students and adults, including James Orange, were arrested.|$|E
25|$|The dialects of French {{spoken in}} Ontario are similar to, but {{distinct}} from, Quebec French and constitute {{part of the}} greater Canadian French dialect. Due to the large English majority in the province, English loanwords are sometimes used in the informal or slang registers of Franco-Ontarian French. While English loanwords occur {{to a large extent}} in many varieties of French in Canada and Europe, there has been more of <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> in Quebec <b>to</b> eliminate anglicisms.|$|R
2500|$|In September 1934, S. Sadanand (who {{was running}} The Free Press Journal) started the Tamil daily Dinamani with T.S. Chockalingam as editor.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{deconstruct}} images of empresses (archduchesses) from the Habsburg- Lorraine dynasty, currently present in the pop culture. The author makes her own psychological and sociological analyses (including a gender studies viewpoint) of these historical heroines, using contemporary historical studies as well as pop cultural and popular science publications from the turn of the 19 th and 20 th century.
