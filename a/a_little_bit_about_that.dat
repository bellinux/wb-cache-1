5000|$|The book {{is built}} upon one what it terms {{one of the}} largest {{participatory}} photography programs ever undertaken, which the editors brought to the New York City Housing Authority in 2010 on behalf of the 501(c)(3) non-profit Seeing for Ourselves. Participants recruited from the projects were given single-use film cameras and trained in a twelve-week lecture/workshop course in photography. In between sessions, the participants would put into practice the lesson learned at the previous class. As Davis would tell CUNY-TV, [...] "We talked <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> photography technique, such as light and shadow, or camera language, or composition. And we talked <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> the history of photography, and offered some inspirational photographers. And then the latter half was the photographers sharing their own work." [...] According to the book, cameras were donated by Kodak and computers by Dell Computers, while film was processed at cost by Duggal Visual Solutions. Beginning in a project in West Harlem that fall with 15 participants, the program is said by the book to have mushroomed to serving hundreds of residents of 16 projects by the time it ended in the spring of 2013. The program was covered by a New York City tabloid early on.|$|R
