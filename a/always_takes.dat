5|$|Each {{chapter of}} Yotsuba&! {{takes place on}} a specific, nearly {{sequential}} day of a common year starting on Wednesday. The year was initially believed to be 2003, coinciding with {{the date of the}} manga's serialization, but Azuma has stated that the manga <b>always</b> <b>takes</b> place in the present day. This allows the appearance of products created after 2003, such as the Nintendo DS Mr. Ayase plays in chapter forty-two.|$|E
5|$|Cortana's {{original}} design {{was based on}} the Egyptian queen Nefertiti; the character's holographic representation <b>always</b> <b>takes</b> the form of a woman. Bungie first introduced Cortana—and Halo—through the Cortana Letters, emails sent during Combat Evolveds production in 1999. Since then, the character has been used extensively to advertise the series. Cortana has been recognized for her believability and character depth, and her holographic representation has been noted for its sex appeal. The character was the inspiration for Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly <b>always</b> <b>takes</b> the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E

5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical <b>always</b> <b>takes</b> the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E

The Scottish-accented Sinatra {{works in}} The Day Today travel pod, perched {{at the top}} of a tower looming a full mile above the centre of Great Britain. The traffic reports cover strange traffic accidents, such as a piece of pie {{blocking}} the road and coverage of an ongoing crash that has been in progress south of Newcastle upon Tyne for several weeks; police marksmen to shoot speeding drivers in the chin; as well as general traffic reports including a claim that workers have finished cobbling the M25.

She has remarked that, when travelling, she <b>always</b> <b>takes</b> cookery classes to immerse herself in the local culture. In 2010 and again in 2011, Lively spoke {{publicly}} of her desire to become a restaurateur. In 2011 she created a s'mores cupcake to be sold at Sprinkles bakeries. In 2012 Lively's wedding reception was featured in Martha Stewart Weddings; food photography was {{the focal point of}} the picture spread. In 2013 she appeared in Elle Decor to recount her experiences designing a custom La Cornue oven for her newly purchased Bedford home.

25|$|Barth’s {{doctrine}} of objective atonement develops as he distances himself from Anselm of Canterbury’s {{doctrine of}} the atonement. In The Epistle to the Romans, Barth endorses Anselm’s idea that God who is robbed of his honor must punish those who robbed him. In Church Dogmatics I/2, Barth advocates divine freedom in the incarnation {{with the support of}} Anselm’s Cur Deus Homo. Barth holds that Anselm’s {{doctrine of the}} atonement preserves both God’s freedom and the necessity of Christ’s incarnation. The positive endorsement of Anselmian motives in Cur Deus Homo continues in Church Dogmatics II/1. Barth maintains with Anselm that the sin of humanity cannot be removed by the merciful act of divine forgiveness alone. In Church Dogmatics IV/1, however, Barth’s doctrine of the atonement diverges from that of Anselm. By over-christologizing the doctrine, Barth completes his formulation of objective atonement. He finalizes the necessity of God’s mercy at the place where Anselm firmly establishes the dignity and freedom of the will of God. In Barth’s view, God’s mercy is identified with God’s righteousness in a distinctive way where God’s mercy <b>always</b> <b>takes</b> the initiative. The change in Barth’s reception of Anselm’s doctrine of the atonement shows that Barth’s doctrine entails support for universalism.|$|E
500|$|Producer/director Lisa Simon stated, {{regarding}} the difficulty the producers and writers had with crafting the episode, [...] "We {{hope to get}} to it {{by the end of the}} season. It <b>always</b> <b>takes</b> us a while to figure out how to do an issue appropriately, from a child's point of view". Puppeteer Jerry Nelson, who was one of the original performers of Snuffy, noted, [...] "Now we delve into things like divorce that are likely to affect small children very heavily. We didn't touch those things before".|$|E
500|$|Recording a {{new album}} was, {{according}} to Robert, a [...] "natural progression" [...] after the band began playing together again. [...] "The thing that kind of introduces us back together is all those memories of the songs, and once you start playing those songs... it <b>always</b> <b>takes</b> us back to... 18 years now. It can {{take us back to}} our past and think about where we were when we were writing these songs, and that's a bond, I think, [...] will always keep us together as four people....

500|$|Toivonen {{was known}} as a {{competitive}} driver both on loose (gravel, dirt, sand, snow and ice) and tarmac surfaces, and he found it difficult to choose between circuit racing and rallying. After becoming a rally driver, he still competed in some circuit racing events, successfully in two World Sportscar Championship events and also in a few races for Eddie Jordan's British Formula Three Championship team. Jordan called Toivonen's performances [...] "incredible" [...] and compared him to Ayrton Senna. After Toivonen's death, Jordan weighed in on his chances in Formula One: [...] "I don't know if he would have become a champion in Formula One. It <b>always</b> <b>takes</b> a lot of luck, and now [...] one can doubt if he would have been granted that. But he would have won Grands Prix– of that I'm absolutely sure." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Say It Right" [...] is {{performed}} with a moderate techno groove and {{is written in}} F minor. It is set in common time; in 4/4 count. The chord progression is Fm–E♭–D♭–B♭m. Furtado's vocal range spans from Ab3 to F5. Furtado has cited the [...] "spooky, keyboard-driven pop sound" [...] of the band Eurythmics, particularly their 1983 song [...] "Here Comes the Rain Again", as an influence on [...] "Say It Right" [...] and other tracks on Loose. [...] "I'm not 100 percent sure what [...] about, but it <b>always</b> <b>takes</b> me away to another place, and I love it", she said. In fact the song deals with mystic or transcendental experiences as she explains {{in an interview in}} 2007. [...] "It {{is a kind of a}} magical song. It has a mystery to it, that I have not quite figured out. It has a haunting twist to it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ocean" [...] was {{the first}} of two promotional singles to be {{released}} from Silver Eye, with the other being [...] "Moon in Your Mouth" [...] which was released two weeks later; the song was distributed to digital retailers on 10 March 2017 through Mute Records following its initial debut on Billboards official website. It was written and produced by members Alison Goldfrapp and William Owen Gregory with The Haxan Cloak and John Congleton serving as additional producers. While creating material for Silver Eye, the duo had trouble writing songs that they actually enjoyed; Goldfrapp claimed that [...] "it <b>always</b> <b>takes</b> about three months to write all the rubbish out of your system before you get something you like". Along with the announcement of [...] "Ocean" [...] as a promotional single, tickets for a promotional tour for Silver Eye were made available for purchase, with show legs in Europe and the United States.|$|E
