As an environmentally friendlier alternative, hydrides or other reducing agents can often be used to accomplish the same synthetic result. Another environmentally friendly alternative is an alloy of aluminium and gallium which similarly renders the aluminium more reactive by preventing it from forming an oxide layer.|$|E

In Section "A" cholesterol has been investigated as a potential resolving group.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to develop a flexible, stereocontrolled route to huperzine A and B and other lycopodium alkaloids. One of the main objectives was to investigate whether intramolecular radical cyclisation reactions on to carbon-nitrogen double bonds might provide a new method for the synthesis of key intermediates in the total synthesis. To this end the intramolecular cyclisation reactions of vinyl and aryl radicals on to oxime ethers have been explored and these reactions have been used to prepare a number of useful bicyclic and tricyclic carbocyclic compounds and related heterocyclic compounds in good yields. This represents essentially new synthetic methodology as prior to this work there was only one reported example of the use of an oxime ether as a radical trap. The best reagent for these reactions utilising vinyl and aryl halide precursors was found to be tributyltin hydride. Preliminary attempts to carry out tandem radical cyclisation reactions incorporating oxime ethers have not, so far, been successful on the model systems investigated. This new synthetic strategy has been used to carry out one-carbon ring expansions of five-membered cyclic oxime ethers similar to those reported recently for carbonyl compounds. However, attempts to extend this ring expansion to the two-carbon system resulted only in cyclisation to give a bicyclic compound, rather than ring expansion. Attempts to cleave the N-O bonds of some of the hydroxylamines resulting from these cyclisation reactions proved to be unsuccessful using SmI 2, Zn and acetic acid or <b>aluminium</b> <b>amalgam.</b> Attempted cleavage of the N-O alkyl bond of a hydroxylamine group adjacent to an aromatic ring using lithium aluminium hydride resulted in a novel ring expansion reaction, which may occur by an unusual electron transfer process to give radical intermediates...|$|E
40|$|The work {{contained}} {{in this thesis}} examines the aziridination {{of a number of}} ?-diketones via their enol forms using oxidative addition of N-aminoquinazolin- 4 (3 H) -ones, to give N-(quinazolinone-N'-y 1) -N-acyl-a-aminoketones which result from C-C cleavage of the intermediate aziridine ring. Products which have the N-N bond di-acylated are primed for reductive cleavage. One example has been studied in which reduction was successfully accomplished using <b>aluminium</b> <b>amalgam</b> to afford an N-acylated amino acid ester in good yield. The N-acetoxyaminoquinazolinone has been shown to function as an NH 2 + equivalent. Aziridination of 3 -methylpentan- 2, 4 -dione using oxidation of N-aminoquinazolinone in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) afforded the aziridine C-N cleavage product. The effects of retarded N-N bond rotation in many of the products from these aziridinations were observed in their n. m. r. spectra: the barriers involved were quantified in some cases but were too large to be measured in others. The good leaving group ability of the quinazolinone ring was revealed in attempted alkylation reactions under basic conditions a- to the exocyclic nitrogen with the N-(quinazolinone-N'-y 1) -N-acyl-a-aminoketones above. Synthesis of N-(2 -isopropylquinazolin- 4 (3 H) -one- 3 -y 1) - 6 -ethoxycarbony 1 - 2 -pyridone was accomplished with the expectation that elimination of the quinazolinone ring could be stereoelectronically inhibited. However, attempted methylation of this compound also resulted in elimination of the quinazolinone ring. In their reactions with stabilised anions, the N-acetoxyaminoquinazolinones function as synthetic equivalents of the NH 2 + synthon. Oxidation of the N-aminoquinazolinones with lead tetra-acetate (LTA) in the presence of pyridine and its derivatives gave N-(quinazolin- 4 (3 H) -one- 3 -y 1) pyridinium ylides. These pyridinium ylides, on heating, functioned as aziridinating agents e. g. for styrene and diethyl fumarate. From the n. m. r. spectra of one of these pyridinium ylides at various temperatures, the barrier to rotation around both N-N bonds could be calculated. An investigation of the possible mechanisms of aziridination of alkenes using these pyridinium ylides was undertaken...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} analogues of 4, 4 -bisdimethylaniinobenzophenone, Michler's ketone, {{in which the}} {{terminal}} dimethylamino-groups {{have been replaced by}} diethylamino, pyrrolidino, piperidino, N-methylpiperazino and morpholino moieties has been prepared utilising the reaction between an aryl-lithium and a substituted benzonitrile. The aromatic ketones have been reduced to their hydrols and pinacols with sodium borohydride and <b>aluminium</b> <b>amalgam,</b> respectively. The UV-visible spectra of the substituted benzophenones in cyclohexane and ethanol {{are similar to those of}} Michler's ketone in the same solvents. All the compounds fluoresce in solution at room temperature with quantum yields of the order of 0. 001 and decay times shorter than 100 psec. At 77 K both fluorescence and phosphorescence are observed. The phosphorescence spectra usually exhibited a shoulder to the red of the emission maximum, although a second peak is occasionally observed. In methylcyclohexane, phosphorescence lifetimes of the order of 10 - 20 msec were found, which increased by a factor of ten when ethanol was used as solvent. Photolysis of the ketones in cyclohexane resulted in their decomposition with high efficiency. The hydrol and the pinacol were identified amongst the photolysis products in most cases. No reaction was observed when 2 -propanol was used as the solvent. Microsecond flash photolysis revealed two transient species which were assigned to the excited triplet state and to the ketyl radical. The transient absorption spectra of the former were recorded. The decay kinetics of both species were found to be strongly dependent on the age of the ketone sample; different kinetics were observed for new samples which had not been flashed and for samples which had been flashed at least once. The results have been rationalised in terms of abstraction of hydrogen from both the solvent and any photolysis product by the excited triplet state. The decay of the ketyl radical was also dependent on the presence or absence of previously formed products. A series of some twenty pyridyl analogues of Michlers ketone has also been synthesised and their UV-visible, fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra have been measured in ethanol or methylcyclohexane. Fluorescence decay times in the region of 0. 5 - 2. 5 nsec were recorded and 3 -(4 -dimethylaminopyridyl) 2 -pyridyl ketone was found to fluoresce very efficiently...|$|E
40|$|The stereochemical {{study of}} heterocyclic {{compounds}} containing nitrogen {{in the ring}} {{is considered to be}} important {{to the study of the}} constitution and function of alkaloids, vitamins and ferments, because those cyclic systems are the important frame of such natural substances. The present author studied the stereoisomerism of several heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen, such as 2, 3 -diphenyl- 2, 3 -dihydropyrazine and 2, 3 -diphenyl-piperazine. Connected with those studies, the stereoisomerism of 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetraphenyl-piperazine (the following formula I) was studied by the author and a part of the result obtained is reported in this paper. It was considered to be probable that the spatial configuration of the piperazine ring might be similar to that of the cyclohexane ring and only the chair form might exist. In the chair form configuration of 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetraphenyl-piperazine, there are seven possible geometrical isomers, A, B, C, D, E, F and G, represented in Fig. I, in which isomers the relation of the spatial position of four hydrogen atoms and four phenyl groups differs from one other. Of these isomers, B, C and E may be resolvable into optical active antipodes respectively. 2, 3, 5, 6 -Tetraphenyl-piperazine was obtained from 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetraphenyl-pyrazine (amaron) and trans- 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetraphenyl- 2, 3 -dihydropyrazine. Amaron, obtained by the reaction of meso-stilbenediamine and benzil, was reduced by sodium and boiling amylalcohol, and four isomers, α (colorless plate crystals, mp 161 - 2 °), β (colorless fine prism crystals, mp 209. 5 - 210. 5 °), γ (colorless prism crystals, mp 266 - 8 °) and ε (colorless plate crystals, mp 300 - 2 °) were separated by the fractional crystallisation from acetone. As seven possible geometrical isomers are supposed to be produced from amaron, the configuration of these four isomers cannot be established from the result of the reduction. Trans- 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetraphenyl- 2, 3 -dihydropyrazine, mp 246 - 7 °, obtained by the condensation of (d+ 1) -stilbenediamine and benzil, was reduced by sodium and boiling amylalcohol. Besides four isomers above mentioned, amaron, which is produced by the removal of two trans-hydrogen atoms of 2 -and 3 -carbon atoms of tetraphenyl- 2, 3 -dihydropyrazine, was obtained. If there is no removal of hydrogen atoms, the phenyl groups of 2 - and 3 -carbon atoms of these four tetraphenyl-piperazine i somers is considered to have a trans-configuration. However, as the dehydrogenated compound, amaron, was obtained, it is considered that in the first place amaron may be produced and, next, it may be reduced, and therefore the configuration of isomers obtained from amaron can not be determined. In order to avoid the removal of hydrogen atoms which may occur at higher temperature, reduction at low temperature by <b>aluminium</b> <b>amalgam</b> in the ethereal solution containing some water, was done. In this case, a new isomer, δ (colorless fine needle crystals, mp 291 - 2 ゜) was obtained with γ-isomer, and amaron was also obtained. From the results above mentioned can only be concluded that the five isomers obtained are probably five among-seven geometrical isomers which are expected to exist from the assumption that the configuration of the piperazine ring is chair form. The study of the configuration of isomers obtained and also that of the stereoisomerism of other tetra-substituted piperazines are now being continued and those results will be reported in the next papers...|$|E
