In previous work we have proposed <b>a</b> <b>requirements</b> model from which it is possible to do simulation and high-level test generation. <b>A</b> <b>requirements</b> metamodel captures the key concepts to model the requirements and allows us to define several automatic model transformations to manipulate the requirements. In this paper, we focus on surface languages that can assist the edition of such <b>a</b> <b>requirements</b> model for simulation or testing purposes.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{integrate}} requirements {{into the current}} Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach, the traditional document-based requirements specification process should be changed into <b>a</b> <b>requirements</b> modelling process. To achieve this we propose <b>a</b> <b>requirements</b> metamodel called REMM (Requirements Engineering MetaModel) which includes the elements that should appear in <b>a</b> <b>requirements</b> model (requirements, stakeholders, test cases, etc.) together with the relationships that may appear between them. This metamodel {{is the basis of}} the REMM-Studio environment which enables: (1) to build graphical requirements models, (2) to validate them against the metamodel and against a set of additional OCL constraints, and (3) to automatically generate <b>a</b> navigable Software <b>Requirements</b> Specification (SRS) document as the main deliverable of the Requirements Engineering process. REMM-Studio is expected to ease the integration of requirements with other development models (e. g. component models) and to facilitate the validation of the SRS thanks to its navigability. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} tasks of {{requirements}} engineering (RE) {{is the creation of}} <b>a</b> <b>requirements</b> document that precisely, consistently, and completely describes the functional and non-functional properties of the system to be built. At some point during the RE process, the requirements are written down using a natural language or <b>a</b> <b>requirements</b> specification language. On one hand, natural language is flexible, universal, and wide-spread. On the other hand, natural language requirements are recognized widely as being incomplete, inconsistent, and inherently ambiguous. Semi-formal and formal requirements specification techniques, such as UML [13] or SCR [5], have been proposed to overcome these deficiencies. Completeness and consistency of these specifications can be tackled to some degree mechanically by tools. However, as a recent study shows, ambiguity rarely surfaces during the development of <b>a</b> <b>requirements</b> model [10]. Thus, since <b>a</b> <b>requirements</b> specification technique enforces precision, the resulting requirements model becomes unambiguously wrong. In this paper, we show how to detect ambiguities in natural language <b>requirements</b> using <b>a</b> checklist. We distinguish between linguistic and RE-specific ambiguities.
