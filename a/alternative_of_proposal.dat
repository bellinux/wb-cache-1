An illustration of the approach is included and a number of possible applications are discussed.

After the presentations, discussions about progress and challenge from each thematic were carried out, resulting on the following general considerations: the necessity of creating more efficient mechanisms in order to lead the results of researches to society decision makers; the necessity of validating the establishment of technological packages under subtropical conditions; and the adoptions <b>of</b> <b>alternatives</b> as <b>proposals</b> <b>of</b> future actions, for example, the creation of award mechanisms to farmers who adopt practices in order to conserve the natural resources...|$|R

40|$|The {{publication}} develops {{an approach}} to the appraisal of economic interests and positions in climate negotiations. The approach {{is based on a}} full-scale analysis of costs and benefits of climate treaties. Interest is defined as the ‘best’ treaty a country can obtain, that is, the policy they would have chosen if they could dictate the treaty to the world. The position is found by a ranking <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>proposals</b> imposed on each country, which are different from the ’best’ treaty. The proposals are ranked according to their costs, measured in terms of consumption loss and increase in damage of climate change relative to the interest.
