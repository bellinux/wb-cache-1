40|$|This chapter, {{which is}} {{conceived}} {{for an international}} audience, offers {{an overview of the}} state of the art of public sector accounting in Italy. It deals separately with central and local government : in both of them reform bills have been passed over the last few years, that have introduced significant changes. It is then possible to briefly elaborate on a few working reflections upon the scope of accounting autonomy that national law has granted to local authorities; in the same time, it is interesting to make a comparison among the solutions specified by the law for these two levels of government. § 2 illustrates the key innovations in central government accounting. § 3 is devoted to the introduction of a modified <b>accrual</b> <b>budget</b> in central government accounting. The reform of local government accounting is discussed in § 4. The authors identify the main critical aspect of the previous accounting system and examine the reform process. The conclusions illustrate and discuss the gap between the reform’s objectives and its actual impact. Real effects of the Local Government Accounting Act only partly coincide with expectations. The authors highlight in particular that:- obligation- and cash-based accounting continues to prevail over accrual accounting in regard to all the issues relevant to the functioning of local governments, starting from the definition of current and capital transfers;- given the different accounting modalities, it is still quite difficult to compare the results of different local governments;- the new system still does not permit the identification of reliable efficiency and effectiveness indicators that truly help managers to take decisions;- accrual reports are, at least for now, virtually unusable and do not create any significant comments nor political debates. Therefore, the reform has failed to considerably improve the levels of accountability in Local governments. In order to propose an alternative improvement path for the functionality of the Italian local government accounting system the authors observe the reforms carried out in other countries, and identify the conditions required for the success of any top-down reform (as the Italian reform has actually been) ...|$|E
40|$|There {{would appear}} to be a growing {{consensus}} among OECD member countries concerning the merits of adopting accrual accounting in the public sector. Nearly one-third of member countries have adopted full accrual accounting {{and a number of other}} member countries have adopted accrual accounting for specific transactions – most frequently for the recording of interest on the public debt and employee pension costs (see Table 1). There {{would appear to}} be less consensus regarding the adoption of <b>accrual</b> <b>budgeting</b> (<b>accrual</b> appropriations) 1 where views diverge widely on its desirability. Only three member countries have adopted full <b>accrual</b> <b>budgeting,</b> although several member countries have adopted accruals for specific transactions in the budget – again, most frequently for the recording of interest on the public debt and employee pension costs (see Table 2).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the phenomenon that governments in many Western countries have transferred their cash-based systems into accrual-based systems for reporting purposes {{during the last}} decades, while still retaining cash-based budgeting systems. The main question we want to answer is whether there are more substantial reasons why governments prefer cash above <b>accruals</b> for <b>budgeting.</b> Our paper {{is the result of}} a comprehensive literature review. At first glance, combining <b>accruals</b> for both <b>budgeting</b> and reporting seems to be preferable above combining cash for <b>budgeting</b> and <b>accruals</b> for reporting: there is consistency between the budgeting and reporting logic, and accrual information is richer than cash information. However, we are in favor of a more nuanced perspective. The combination of cash for <b>budgeting</b> and <b>accruals</b> for reporting can be defended through the lens of a fundamental budgeting logic that identifies all expenditures and revenues expected for the budget year and sees the comparison between cash-based appropriations and actual cash-outflows as an easy and straightforward control mode. Moreover, this combination aligns with the dominance of budgeting over reporting and the limited accounting expertise of many accounting information users (for example, public sector managers and especially politicians). We argue that the ultimate transfer from cash to <b>accruals</b> in <b>budgeting</b> needs to be based on a solid assessment of its added value to these users, and not due to pressures of accounting experts...|$|R

A principal conclusion is that reform in public financial management needs to be defined against the capacity of countries to sustain it at the national level. This requires a careful definition of priorities for action and the determination of appropriate pacing and sequencing of reform.

40|$|Fiscal Responsibility Laws (FRLs) {{appear to}} be more popular in middle-income {{countries}} than advanced countries, even though their success is limited. The reasons why few advanced countries have a FRL include: the existing legal framework for the budget system is adequate; supranational rules and political agreements in EU countries; failed attempts to include quantitative fiscal rules in laws; lack of consensus or interest in attaining the goals of FRL-type legislation; and lack of need for a law to regulate fiscal transparency, accountability and macro-fiscal stabilization. Without commitment to fiscal discipline, adoption of a FRL may not contribute to attaining fiscal consolidation goals.
