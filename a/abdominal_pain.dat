5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> {{and a small}} amount of {{diarrhea}} in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|Other {{symptoms}} include: headache, {{nausea and}} vomiting, <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> muscle pain, or a scarlatiniform rash or palatal petechiae, {{the latter being}} an uncommon but highly specific finding.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms in PID {{range from}} none to severe. If there are symptoms, then fever, {{cervical}} motion tenderness, lower <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> new or different discharge, painful intercourse, uterine tenderness, adnexal tenderness, or irregular menstruation may be noted.|$|E

50|$|The syndromes are diverse, but tend {{to cause}} episodes of fever, joint <b>pains,</b> skin rashes, <b>abdominal</b> <b>pains</b> and {{may lead to}} chronic {{complications}} such as amyloidosis.|$|R
5|$|Symptoms may be {{different}} in adults and children; the main symptoms in adults are headache, <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> memory loss, kidney failure, male reproductive problems, and weakness, pain, or tingling in the extremities.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} cholangitis may {{complain}} of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> (particularly {{in the right}} upper quadrant of the abdomen), fever, rigors (uncontrollable shaking) {{and a feeling of}} uneasiness (malaise). Some may report jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin and the whites of the eyes).|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of lead poisoning in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression, loss of appetite, intermittent <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and muscle pain. Other early signs in adults include malaise, fatigue, decreased libido, and problems with sleep. An unusual taste {{in the mouth}} and personality changes are also early signs.|$|E
40|$|Acute {{intermittent}} porphyria (AIP) as a precipitant of self-multilation in inmates, has {{not been}} documented. This case illustrates how AIP can go undiagnosed {{unless there is a}} high index of suspicion of this disease in the psychiatric patient, with persistent <b>abdominal</b> <b>pains.</b> This case illustrates the need to take seriously, the complaints of psychiatric patients, especially toxic-like symptoms, increasing paralysis, and <b>abdominal</b> <b>pains.</b> Perhaps acute intermittent prophyria {{has not been}} given the necessary attention in the literature which accounts for our failure to develop specific treatment methods...|$|R
50|$|Russula queletii {{otherwise}} known as the gooseberry russula, is a common, inedible, Russula mushroom found growing in groups, predominantly in spruce forest.Eating this mushroom causes <b>abdominal</b> <b>pains.</b>|$|R
40|$|In a large {{population-based}} study, {{the prevalence}} of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pains</b> in preschool-age children {{was found to be}} high (39. 7 %) [1]. However in this sample the presence of recurrent <b>abdominal</b> <b>pains</b> (RAP), according to Apley’s criteria, was much lower (3. 8 %– 11. 8 %). It is likely that, using the new, more restricted, criteria of ICHD II [2], {{the prevalence of}} RAP will be lower than in previous reports. Moreover, children with RAP are more likely to experience headache than those without RAP, 27. 7 % vs. 14. 3 % at 42 months and 55. 4 % vs...|$|R
5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is poisoning {{caused by}} drinking ethylene glycol.

5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E
50|$|Solanine {{levels in}} S. nigrum can be toxic. Children {{have died from}} {{poisoning}} after eating unripe berries. However, the plant is rarely fatal, with ripe berries causing symptoms of mild <b>abdominal</b> <b>pains,</b> vomiting, and diarrhea.|$|R
40|$|<b>Abdominal</b> <b>pains</b> are {{the most}} common manifestation of {{functional}} or organic pathology of the gastrointestinal tract; however, in girls they are often caused by various diseases of pelvic organs. The article presents the main nosological forms of gynecological diseases in female children and adolescents, the main symptom whereof is <b>abdominal</b> <b>pains.</b> The authors discuss methods of differential diagnosis and demonstrate that failures of diagnosis and management and treatment tactics are caused by insufficient knowledge of anatomy and physiology of the reproductive system, neglect of gynecological anamnesis, untimely diagnosis of apoplexies of ovaries and complicated functional cysts, lack of oncological suspicion when encountering tumors and tumor-like ovarian neoplasms.  </p...|$|R

5|$|The classic {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children are loss of appetite, <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> vomiting, weight loss, constipation, anemia, kidney failure, irritability, lethargy, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. Slow development of normal childhood behaviors, such as talking and use of words, and permanent intellectual disability are both commonly seen. Although less common, {{it is possible for}} fingernails to develop leukonychia striata if exposed to abnormally high lead concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Up to 85% {{of people}} {{infected}} with H. pylori never experience symptoms or complications. Acute infection may appear as an acute gastritis with <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> (stomach ache) or nausea. Where this develops into chronic gastritis, the symptoms, if present, are often those of non-ulcer dyspepsia: stomach pains, nausea, bloating, belching, and sometimes vomiting or black stool.|$|E
5|$|Analgesics may {{be needed}} for the {{abdominal}} and joint pains. It is uncertain as to whether HSP needs treatment beyond controlling the symptoms. Most patients do not receive therapy {{because of the high}} spontaneous recovery rate. Steroids are generally avoided. However, if they are given early in the disease episode, the duration of symptoms may be shortened, and <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> can improve significantly. Moreover, the chance of severe kidney problems may be reduced. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials did not find any evidence that steroid treatment (prednisone) is effective at decreasing the likelihood of developing long-term kidney disease.|$|E
50|$|A 22-year-old {{pregnant}} woman presenting <b>abdominal</b> <b>pains</b> was initially diagnosed with RLP and was discharged.

5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus.

Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of bowel cancer.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} or the other. Abdominal cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause {{is less likely to}} be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> and may persist for several weeks.|$|E
