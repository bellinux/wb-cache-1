500|$|During his gubernatorial campaign, Laffoon {{had promised}} not to seek higher office if elected governor. Term-limited by the state constitution, he {{returned}} to private life following his four years in office. On the day of Chandler's inauguration, Laffoon said [...] "I'm going to Madisonville right after the inauguration, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> get some clients at my law office by Wednesday morning." ...|$|E
500|$|Somalia was {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2016 Games in athletics – Mohamed Daud Mohamed, a 5000 metres runner. It marked his first appearance at an international athletics competition, following a transition into athletics from football. He said prior to the Olympics, [...] "I am improving by the day <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> improve on my finish time. Running is hard and all athletes aim to win. My objective is to win; but there are different ways of winning. It is not about being first, second or third. If I set a new personal record, it is a win for me". Mohamed competed on 17 August in the first heat of the 5000 metres, finishing in 24th position out of the 25 runners, only ahead of Rosefelo Siosi of the Solomon Islands, thus eliminating him from the competition.|$|E
500|$|For {{months on}} end Jeannette hardly moved at all; De Long {{recorded}} on March 2 that their position was almost precisely {{what it had}} been three months earlier. On May 5, the ship passed {{to the west of the}} 180° meridian, but two months later had retreated back to the other side of the line. [...] The summer brought no relief; although it briefly seemed possible in August that Jeannette might break free and find open water, this proved a false hope. The condition of Danenhower was a further source of anxiety. His syphilis began to take toll of his body, particularly his left eye which, despite Ambler's repeated operations—stoically endured, given the lack of anesthetic—left the navigator largely incapacitated and unable to perform his duties. On the last day of 1880 De Long wrote in his journal: [...] "I begin the new year by turning over a new leaf, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> God we are turning over a new leaf in our book of luck".|$|E

"Well," [...] I went on smoothly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> render what <b>I</b> {{was going}} to say the means of enlightening him without offence {{concerning}} the little mistake he had just made with the waitress, [...] "of course we don't take that in its closest literality." ...|$|R

"I {{would not}} have taken you thus by surprise," [...] {{continued}} the youth, [...] "but one of my horses lost a shoe yesterday, and we were constrained to halt at Portkiln for the night, and ride on this morning. Herries went on <b>to</b> the Deanery, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> have seen you before church, but found you had already entered." ...|$|R
2500|$|Pauling {{attributes}} {{his interest}} in becoming a chemist to being amazed by experiments conducted by a friend, Lloyd A. Jeffress, who had a small chemistry lab kit. He later wrote: [...] "I was simply entranced by chemical phenomena, by the reactions in which substances, often with strikingly different properties, appear; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> learn more <b>and</b> more about {{this aspect of the}} world." ...|$|R
500|$|In September 2014, Wirkola {{announced}} {{that he would not be}} returning to direct the sequel: “I have been lately attached to a few more things, it’s just a matter of time and priorities. I did Dead Snow, then Hansel & Gretel, and then [...] I want to do something a little bit different now and not just do sequels. I did write the script <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> be involved in it. But yeah, I won’t be directing it.” He said [...] "the first film was a learning curve for me working in the studio system and the script I wrote for the original was so different [...] We ended up taking a lot out and altering stuff that first time. I tried taking what I learned and still delivered a sequel script that’s an R-rated action film." [...] Cinema Blend reported Renner said that despite his busy schedule he agreed to reprise the role of Hansel because the first film [...] "was a lot of fun doing the movie," [...] but without Wirkola directing again he might be less likely to return for the sequel.|$|E
500|$|In the 2003 off-season, Diarra {{admitted}} that he would love to return to Liverpool stating [...] "I'm someone who is ambitious <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> win my place at Anfield next season". However, in July 2003, Houllier confirmed that Diarra would remain in France on loan, this time with Corsican club Bastia. Upon his arrival to the club, Diarra was inserted as a starter by manager Gérard Gili and paid immediate dividends scoring in back-to-back weeks in a 4–2 win against Guingamp and a 4–1 loss to Auxerre in September. On 7 March 2004, he scored a goal in Bastia's surprising 4–1 win over Marseille. Diarra ultimately finished the campaign with 38 total appearances and four goals. After the season, Diarra returned to Liverpool for pre-season training, however, not {{under the guidance of}} his recruiter Houllier, but under Spanish coach Rafael Benítez. As a result, he was, for the third consecutive season, linked with a loan move. His non-inclusion on the club's roster for its North America tour meant a loan move was inevitable and, on 27 July 2004, he was loaned to Lens.|$|E
2500|$|On March 23, 2015, Cruz {{announced}} his 2016 presidential candidacy for the GOP primaries and caucuses, in a morning speech delivered at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. Also, {{at the same}} hour, he posted on his Twitter page: [...] "I'm running for President <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> earn your support!" [...] He was the first announced major Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 campaign. During the primary campaign, his base of support was mainly among social conservatives, though he had crossover appeal to other factions within his party, including in particular libertarian conservatives.|$|E
60|$|My {{horse had}} come down {{with me at the}} end of a long ride the night before, and had hurt himself, luckily, much more than he had hurt his master.

"My object then," [...] replied Darcy, [...] "was to show you, {{by every}} civility in my power, that I {{was not so}} mean as to resent the past; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been {{attended}} to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in {{about half an hour}} after I had seen you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Prince George {{decided to}} travel to Europe and {{announced}} to the Cretan population that [...] "When I am traveling in Europe I shall ask the Powers for annexation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> succeed on account of my family connections". The statement reached the public without the knowledge or approval of the Committee. Venizelos said to the Prince {{that it would not}} be proper to give hope to the population for something that wasn't feasible at the given moment. As Venizelos had expected, during the Prince's journey, the Great Powers rejected his request.|$|E
2500|$|In foreign relations, Prince George {{alone was}} {{authorised}} {{to deal with}} the Great Powers, as illustrated by the absence of a foreign affairs minister. The Prince took responsibility for the matter of Greek annexation of the island and discussing the subject with the foreign ministers of Russia, France, Italy and Britain, without taking care to speak to his counselors. In the summer of 1900, when he was preparing to tour the European courts, the prince declared: [...] "When I am travelling in Europe, I shall ask the Powers for annexation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> succeed on account of my family connections".|$|E
2500|$|Such a fruit {{as the one}} {{shown in}} the {{illustration}} grew one year ago in my garden, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> grow more of those. This fruit is pointed above and has at the top a small long distaff (- the pitom); {{it has a very}} pleasant smell, very like that of the Florentine citron described below. It contains very little juice and tastes somewhat sour and also somewhat bitter. As it seems, this plant thrives better in pots, than standing in the ground, for this tree of mine has remained very short in height, and its branches have not overgrown the [...] stalk.|$|E

Some other time, perhaps, I will tell you more," [...] she added.|$|R
2500|$|Fellow nine-time All-Ireland medallist {{and former}} Kilkenny goalkeeper Noel Skehan said {{of him in}} the {{build-up}} to the 2012 All-Ireland final: [...] "Oh, as it stands, you’re talking about the greatest hurler ever even if he didn’t win on Sunday. He’ll still be the greatest hurler. He’s a fantastic sportsman. What he has achieved up until now, even forgetting the result on Sunday, you’d have to put him well up on top of the ladder. To do it all on the pitch is a great achievement. To start every championship match since he came on the scene, it goes without saying how good that is <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> God that he achieves it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Benny {{was profoundly}} shaken by Allen's sudden death {{from a heart}} attack in 1956. In a {{statement}} released on the day after Allen's death, Benny said, [...] "People have often asked me if Fred Allen and I were really friends in real life. My answer is always the same. You couldn't have such a long-running and successful feud as we did, without having a deep and sincere friendship at the heart of it." [...] Allen himself wrote, [...] "For years people have been asking me if Jack and I are friendly. I don't think that Jack Benny has an enemy in the world.... He is my favourite comedian <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> be his friend until he is forty. That will be forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 28, 2001, Johnson being {{ineligible for}} a third term under Ohio's term limits law, Governor Taft {{appointed}} him director of the Ohio Department of Development to replace C.

[...] "His experience as a capable manager and knowledge of utility issues, tax policies, economic development, and the law make him an excellent choice" [...] said Taft. [...] The department, {{with a staff of}} five hundred and a half-billion dollar budget, is charged with promoting economic development in Ohio, attracting new industry, and promoting tourism in the state. [...] Johnson resigned from his Senate seat on September 17 and David Goodman, a 34-year-old member of the Ohio House, was appointed by the Senate Republican caucus in Johnson's place. [...] Upon his departure, Johnson told his colleagues [...] "I hope to make you proud, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> pick your pocket." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout series three (2007), {{companion}} Martha Jones pines for the Doctor's affection {{ever since}} a kiss between them {{which was only}} used as a [...] "genetic transfer" [...] to distract their pursuers. She is distraught when, temporarily turned into a human in [...] "Human Nature", the Doctor's human persona John Smith, {{falls in love with}} nurse Joan Redfern. She admits in [...] "The Family of Blood" [...] to Smith that [...] " [...] is everything to me, and he doesn't even look at me, but I don't care, because I love him to bits, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> God he won't remember me saying this". The Doctor tells Joan he is capable of everything that Smith was, but she rejects his attempt to establish a relationship with her as the Doctor. In the following episode, [...] "Blink", he refers to being [...] "rubbish at weddings, especially my own". Martha eventually quits as the Doctor's full-time companion in the series finale [...] "Last of the Time Lords" [...] because she is in love with the Doctor and he seems unable or unwilling to reciprocate; she received similar commiseration from Jack Harkness, who is also infatuated with him, in [...] "The Sound of Drums".|$|E
2500|$|In August 2010, Fry {{joined the}} board of {{directors}} at Norwich City Football Club.

[...] Fry stepped down from his Board position in January 2016, to take up a new position as [...] "Norwich City Ambassador". Fry said, [...] "My five years in the role have been an honour and a privilege beyond almost anything I can remember. I wish I could take credit for ushering the club up from League One to the Premiership during that time on the Board. Actually, I’m going to. It was all me. It can’t have been a coincidence ... But now I’m so happy to relinquish my seat on the board to Thomas Smith and to engage as fully as I can in the role of ambassador for Norwich City. We have so much to be proud of, both on and off the pitch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> welcome many new fans to the greatest club of all. On the Ball, City!" [...] In February 2014, Fry became the honorary president of Proud Canaries, a new club for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender fans.|$|E
