I verify the hypothesis of the influence of warm weather, rainfall and snow cover on the representation of small mammals and birds species in the diet of the Long-eared Owl in this thesis. In addition, my thesis is devoted to the analysis of methodology and species identification in food of the Long-eared Owl by skulls and pelvic bones. In my thesis, when determining the type of small mammals I deal with sexing of Common Vole (Microtus arvalis) and Wood Mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) of the pelvic bones.
