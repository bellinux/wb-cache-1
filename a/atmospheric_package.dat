40|$|A {{small and}} {{sophisticated}} optical depth sensor (ODS) {{has been selected}} in the payload of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>package</b> DREAMS onboard the MARS 2016 mission. ODS was built {{to carry out the}} opacity due to the Martian dust and to characterize the high altitude clouds at twilight on Mars. Dust and clouds are primary elements for studying the interactions of solar radiation with the Mars atmosphere and surface and their influence on the radiation balance. In addition, dust lifted by storms are the unique condensation nuclei available at the Mars atmosphere. Therefore a capability of modeling the dust and clouds is vital for understanding of meteorology and climate on Mars. For the clouds detection, the index colour (CI) is used, defined as the ratio between the scattered light at red and blue wavelengths. If a cloud is present during twilight, then a peak must be observed in the CI. The opacity due to the Martian dust can be detected by comparing the sunlight scattered at zenith and direct sunlight. In order to retrieve the dust and cloud properties, a radiative transfer three- dimensional model in spherical geometry must be used. In this presentation, we will show the principle of the instrument, we will describe the procedure which is used in order to retrieve the dust and cloud physical properties and we will finally present some results of field campaigns made in terrestrial environment...|$|E

The N-MAP showed the least oxidation, O-MAP the highest and the control moderate. The redness (CIE a*) decreased to 3. 67 ± 0. 83 by day 10 in the O-MAP, the N-MAP and control initially had lower values indicating slower oxidisation. The free carbonyl production was higher in the O-MAP than the N-MAP and control. TBARS remained relatively constant for the N-MAP and control, but increased to 9. 70 ± 3. 26 (day 10) in the O-MAP. Drip loss (non-cumulative), was initially high (5 - 6 %) for N-MAP and control, followed by a decrease on day 2 (2 %) that increased to day 10 (4 - 6 %).

40|$|Resonant mode micromechanical {{devices have}} great {{potentials}} {{due to their}} high sensitivity and easy signal processing. As they are also sensitive to environmental effects, vacuum packaging is often required, which largely increases the costs. The current study focuses on such environment induced reliability problems and degradation processes. Stiffening effect was observed on thin silicon nitride and silicon carbide cantilever beams in air. The resonance frequency gradually increases in time. When the cantilever is subjected to mechanical shock or large deflection, the resonance frequency suddenly drops, and then increases again. Air, increased humidity, argon rich and nitrogen rich atmosphere influence the stiffening and the shock response behavior. The effects are explained with the surface oxidation model. The oxide layer introduces stress in the structure increasing the overall stiffness, while mechanical shocks crack the layer. Silicon resonators gather airborne particles from the atmosphere due to electrostatic charging. The extra mass results in decrease of the resonant frequency. All these processes lead to unstable resonance frequency and thus to failure of the resonant mode device.

40|$|Aims: To {{quantify}} {{and model}} the combined effects of temperature (T) (10 – 40 °C), water activity (aw) (0 · 993 – 0 · 818) and CO 2 concentration (9 · 4 – 55 · 1 %, v/v) {{on the growth}} rate of Aspergillus niger and Alternaria alternata that cause spoilage during the storage and packaging of dates. Methods and Results: The effects of environmental factors were studied using the γ-concept. Cardinal models were used to quantify the effect of studied environmental factors on the growth rates. Firstly, the cardinal parameters were estimated independently from experiments carried out on potato dextrose agar using a monofactorial design. Secondly, model performance evaluation was conducted on pasteurized date paste. The boundary between growth and no-growth was predicted using a deterministic approach. Aspergillus niger displayed a faster growth rate and higher tolerance to low aw than Al. alternata, which in turn proved more resistant to CO 2 concentration. Minimal cardinal parameters of T and aw were lower than those reported in the literature. Conclusions: The combination of the aw and CO 2 effects significantly affected As. niger and Al. alternata growth. The γ-concept model overestimated growth rates, however, it is optimistic and provides somewhat conservative predictions. Significance and Impact of the Study: The developed model provides a decision support tool for the choice of the date fruit conservation mode (refrigeration, drying, modified <b>atmospheric</b> <b>packaging</b> or their combination) using T, aw and CO 2 as environmental factors.

Pericarp browning, desiccations, loss of quality and post harvest decay have been identified as major problems restricting expansion of the industries in litchi exporting countries. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) has been considered to be beneficial to maintain high humidity essential for prevention of water loss and browning of litchi pericarp. Accurate measurement of respiration rate and its modeling is an important aspect to the success of design and operational features of techniques like modified atmosphere storage. The respiration data generated at temperatures 0 - 30 oC in the step of 5 for litchi using the closed system method was used for modeling respiration rate using neural network technique. Here O 2, CO 2, temperature and time are considered as independent parameters and respiration rate as the dependent parameters. To establish a specific relationship between these parameter using neural network modeling three layers are taken i. e. input layer, output layer and a hidden layer. In this method first of all the experimental values are coded in between - 1 to + 1.

40|$|Summary This thesis {{reports on}} the design of new types of planar optical sensors (often {{referred}} to as optodes) for oxygen and carbon dioxide, respectively. Such sensors are of highest interest for monitoring oxygen and CO 2 in modified <b>atmospheric</b> <b>packaging</b> (MAP). The oxygen sensors are based on the quenching effect that oxygen exerts on the fluorescence (or luminescence in general) of certain fluorophores. In the particular case, luminophores out of the group of ruthenium dipyridyl and ruthenium phenanthroline complexes have been used. These have absorption maxima at around 450 nm which make them compatible with blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) which can acts as low-cost light sources for fluorescence excitation. Their luminescence is far red-shifted and peaks at around 620 nm. Both the intensity and the decay time of the luminescence of the ruthenium complexes is strongly affected by molecular oxygen, and this finding forms the basis for the sensing scheme applied here. The sensor for carbon dioxide (CO 2) is based on a quite different analytical approach. CO 2 is a weakly acidic gas that can change the pH of a buffer contained inside a gas-permeable sensor membrane. The acidification of such an "immobilised" buffer resulting from exposure to CO 2 is indicated by a fluorescent pH indicator. Several possibilities were considered, of which the measurement of fluorescence intensity, fluorescence decay time, fluorescence energy transfer, and of "dual luminophore referenced luminescence" (DLRF) came into closer consideration. A careful analysis of the merits of each method was performed which led to the following conclusions: (a) In case of oxygen sensors it is found that the measurement of luminescence intensity is slightly inferior to measurement of fluorescence decay time. However, in view of the substantial additional costs for decay time based sensors it is recommended that luminescence intensity be measured which still gives adequate results for many MAP applications. (b) The situation is different for CO 2 sensors where the superiority of DLRF became quite obvious after a short time. Energy transfer is second to it yet much better than the other two methods. The method of DLRF is therefore described in some detail (chapter 3) both in theory and in terms of practical implementation and choice of materials (chapter 4). The last experimental chapter (no. 5) refers to the use of microparticles and nanoparticles which are shown to be useful reference materials in optical sensors. These are made from sol-gels and modified sol-gels and have unique properties including narrow particle distribution and high luminescent brightness. In order to test the sensor obtained in the studies summarised before, all sensor types were tested for the parameters and properties that are of relevance in context with MAP. In conclusion, {{it can be said that}} the two types of optical presented here represent a novel type of sensors for MAP applications, with several advantages over existing sensor types. In particular, the costs for sensor preparation, the ease of depositing the material on package materials, and the possibility of reading the signal through an optically transparent package material (usually colourless plastic), thereby avoiding the risk of bacterial contamination (as a result of opening the package) are substantial advantages that make the results of this work highly promising. I am confident that further studies (to be performed in the respective industry) will demonstrate the enormous potential of this new method...|$|R

This development was necessary as accurate results {{could not be obtained}} for our Case 2 water study area in coastal Louisiana with OCM data by using existing <b>atmospheric</b> correction software <b>packages.</b> In addition, since OCM-retrieved radiances were abnormally low in the blue wavelength region, a vicarious calibration procedure was developed. The results of our combined vicarious calibration and atmospheric correction procedure for OCM data were compared with the results from the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) software package outputs for SeaWiFS and OCM data. For Case 1 waters, our results matched closely with SeaDAS results. For Case 2 waters, our results demonstrated closure with in situ radiometric measurements, while SeaDAS produced negative normalized water leaving radiance (nLw) and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). In summary, our procedure resulted in valid nLw and Rrs values for Case 2 waters using OCM data, providing a reliable method for retrieving useful nLw and Rrs values which can be used to develop ocean color algorithms for in-water substances (e. g., pigments, suspended sediments, chromophoric dissolved organic matter, etc.) at relatively high spatial resolution in regions where other software packages and sensors such as SeaWiFS and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) have proven unsuccessful. The method described here can be applied to other sensors such as OCM- 2 or other Case 2 water areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{hardware}} and software for a computer controlled optical radar, or lidar, system are described. The system builds on a previously installed pulsed ruby backscatter lidar, capable of acquiring data at controlled azimuth and elevation angles through the atmosphere. The described system replaces hardwired logic with computer control. Two coupled computers are used to allow a degree of real time control while data are processed. One of these computers reads and controls mount elevation angle, reads the laser energy monitor, and senses firing of the laser. The other computer serves as a user interface, and receives the lidar return data from a digitizer and memory, and the angle and energy information from the other computer. The second computer also outputs data to a disc drive. The software provided with the system is described, and the feasibility of additional software for both control and data processing is explored. Particular attention is given to data integrity and instrument and computer operation {{in the presence of}} the high energy pulses used to drive the laser. A previously described laser energy monitor has been improved to isolate it from laser transients. Mount elevation angles are monitored with an absolute angle readout. As a troubleshooting aid, a simulator with an output that approximates the lidar receiver output was developed. Its output is digitally generated and provides a known repetitive signal. Operating procedures are described for standard data acquisition, and troubleshooting is outlined. The system can be used by a relatively inexperienced operator; English sentences are displayed on the system console CRT terminal to lead the operator through data acquisition once the system hardware is turned on. A brief synopsis of data acquired on the system is given. Those data are used as the basis of other referenced papers. It constitutes soundings for over one hundred days. One high point has been operation of the system in conjunction with a balloon borne <b>atmospheric</b> particulate sampling <b>package.</b> The system has also been used occasionally as the transmitter of a lidar system with physically separated receiver and transmitter...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Planetary Entry Science PayloadsSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopThe entry, descent and landing of ExoMars offer a rare (once-per-mission) opportunity to perform in situ investigation of the martian environment over a wide altitude range. We present an initial assessment of the atmospheric science that can be performed using sensors of the Entry, Descent and Landing System (EDLS), over and above the expected engineering information. This is intended to help fulfill the concept of an <b>Atmospheric</b> Parameters <b>Package</b> (APP), as mentioned in the ExoMars draft Science Management Plan [ESA, 2005]. Mars' atmosphere is highly variable in time and space, due to phenomena including inertio-gravity waves, thermal tide effects, dust, solar wind conditions, and diurnal, seasonal and topographic effects. Atmospheric profile measurements, drawing on heritage from the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (HASI), which encountered Titan's atmosphere in 2005 [1], should allow us to address questions of the martian atmosphere's structure, dynamics and variability. By careful definition of EDLS measurements to yield science as well as a successful landing, we aim to obtain continuous atmospheric density, temperature and pressure profiles over the widest ever altitude range, with the highest sensitivity and spatial resolution. Extrapolation to the ExoMars case of the flight performance of the HASI entry accelerometry experiment is encouraging. Up to now, only three high vertical resolution and high accuracy vertical profiles of density, pressure and temperature of the martian atmosphere have been derived from in situ measurements performed by Viking 1 and 2 in day-time [2] and by Mars Pathfinder in night-time [3, 4]. Two more vertical profiles have been retrieved from the deceleration curves and aeroshell drag properties of the two Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) during atmospheric entry [5], but with a much lower accuracy. Such profiles are vital for testing of atmospheric models used in numerous studies of atmospheric variability, on a range of temporal and spatial scales, {{as well as for the}} practical issue of reaching the martian surface reliably [e. g. 6]. New data from different site, season and time period are essential to investigate the thermal balance of the surface and atmosphere of Mars, diurnal variations in the depth of the planetary boundary layer and the effects of these processes on the martian general circulation. A better understanding of the martian environment and meteorology is also essential for refining and constraining landing techniques at Mars and to evaluate the possible hazardous to machines and humans in view of future Martian explorations. As the ExoMars project definition proceeds, the entry, descent and landing sequence may offer further science opportunities. We would be interested in exploring these and welcome additional members to the consortium. References: [1] Fulchignoni, M. et al. (2005), Nature 438 (7069), 785 - 791. [2] A. Seiff, D. B.

40|$|This {{monograph}} {{is motivated}} {{by the lack of}} an autonomous icing protection solution for small unmanned aerial vehicles. The atmospheric phenomenon commonly referred to as aircraft icing is one the most dangerous weather hazards to all of aviation. When an aircraft operates in atmospheric conditions that sustain icing, a potential of ice forming on exposed aircraft surfaces arises. The most significant of these surfaces are the leading edge of aircraft wings, stabilisers, and various control surfaces. This monograph focusses on icing as it forms on the leading edge of wings. The consequences of icing range from insignificant to dire, even fatal. For unmanned aerial vehicles, as is the case for conventional aircraft, the impact of icing primarily relates to controllability of the aircraft. Once icing forms on the wings the aerodynamic shape is altered. Typically this leads to changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing, i. e. maximum lift can decrease by as much as 80 % and drag can increase by more than 60 %. For small unmanned aerial vehicles there are no commercially available icing mitigating solutions, aside from grounded operations. This monograph is a presentation of just such a solution. The icing protection solution is based on three primary elements, 1) an electro-thermal source, 2) an intelligent control unit, and 3) a power source. In essence the solution provides according to the following; the control unit is primed by an on-board <b>atmospheric</b> sensor <b>package,</b> measuring ambient environmental conditions. Once the risk of icing is established, two ice detection algorithms - working in parallel - are activated. This approach ensures robustness and accuracy. If icing is detected, control algorithms trigger the power supplied to the electro-thermal source, thereby achieving temperature control of the thermal source. For conventional aircraft, icing detection is usually performed by larger optical sensors or a pilots visual inspection. For UAVs icing detection is a relatively new research topic. In this monograph two markedly different approaches to icing detection for UAVs are proposed. Common for both is the objective of detecting icing as it forms on the leading edge of aircraft wings. One icing protection solution presented in this monograph is denoted the modelbased icing detection algorithm. It addresses the issue in a fault diagnosis framework by generating residuals used to detect aircraft surface faults (that is aerodynamic changes), indicating that icing is forming on {{the leading edge of the}} aircraft wings. The proposed algorithm relies on estimates of aerodynamic parameters - obtained under nominal flight conditions - and the aerodynamic model of the aircraft. Should these parameters change unexpectedly a surface fault has occurred, i. e. icing is forming on the wings of the aircraft. The proposed algorithm has been validated through numerical analyses. The second icing detection algorithm proposed is denoted the electro-thermalbased icing detection algorithm. It also addresses the issue of icing detection in a fault diagnosis framework, but where the prior algorithm uses the aerodynamic model of the aircraft to accomplish this, the latter algorithm applies a model of the thermodynamic system surrounding the aircraft wings and the electro-thermal source. The electro-thermal-based icing detection algorithm uses temperature gradients, obtained from the electro-thermal source, and unexpected changes in these to detect changes in the thermodynamic system. A change could be an added element as a layer of ice. The proposed approach has been validated through a simulation study. To evaluate the electro-thermal source layout and area size, several thermodynamic analyses are conducted. Simulations are conducted to determine the relationship between area size and power consumption, while responses from other simulations are used to investigate and evaluate the thermal distribution differences of electro-thermal sources applied to various UAV platforms. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed icing detection solution wind tunnel experiments and flight tests have been conducted. Preliminary integration procedures are developed to ensure little to no negative aerodynamic impact, while abiding by requirements for airworthiness and safe flight operations. Wind icing tunnel experiments have been conducted for various required icing protection program routines, i. e. icing detection, de-icing, and anti-icing. Experiments have been conducted in atmospheric conditions ranging from non-icing to varying severity degrees of icing. Preliminary flights include the worlds first flight for any UAV fitted with an autonomous icing protection solution, completed in a collaboration between NTNUAMOS and NASA Ames Research Center and conducted in Anchorage, Alaska. Operational flights have been conducted at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, where the aforementioned icing protection program routines have been tested, verifying the icing protection solution...|$|R
