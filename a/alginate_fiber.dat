The effect of nano-particles SiO 2 on the structure and properties of alginate fibers were studied via many tests. The {{results showed that the}} tenacity of blend fibers increased with the growth of the content of SiO 2 ranging from 1 % to 5 %, however, the tenacity of fibers became worse when the content of SiO 2 was more than 5 %. The effect of SiO 2 content on hardness and tribological properties of the calcium <b>alginate</b> <b>fiber</b> was studied. The morphologies of the fibers surfaces were examined with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The result showed that the surface of blend fibers was still smooth when the consent of SiO 2 not up to 7 %, the best surface was obtained when SiO 2 content was 5 %. The incorporation of SiO 2 also affected the absorption property of <b>alginate</b> <b>fiber</b> and made it decrease with the increase of SiO 2 content.

The {{cytotoxicity}} and anti-influenza virus (IFV) {{activity of}} calcium or zinc <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers</b> were investigated {{to explore the}} feasibility {{of them to be}} used as biomaterials. African Green Monkey kidney cell (Vero) and human cervical cancer cell (Hela) cultured with alginate fibres were used to screen cytotoxic effects. After 48 h, MTT (3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 -thiazol) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H tetrazolium bromide) assays were performed. Then cytotoxicity was evaluated with six grades according to cell relative growth rate (RGR). In anti-IFV activity assay, IFV were added to all fibers and the Vero cell survival were detected by MTT assays with calculating the percentage of protection. The cytotoxity of calcium <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers</b> on Vero were grade 0 or 1 in contrast to zinc <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers</b> which was grade 0. The cytotoxity of calcium or zinc <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers</b> on Hela were grade 0. Furthermore, partial calcium or zinc <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers</b> could promote Vero or Hela cell growth. In antiviral assay the highest percentage of protection of calcium <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers</b> was 34. 42 %, while that of zinc <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers</b> was 59. 42 %.

A novel dispensing {{system based}} on two coaxial needles deliver simultaneously an alginate and calcium chloride solutions permitting the direct deposition of alginate fibers according to any designed pattern. Coating of the <b>alginate</b> <b>fiber</b> with chitosan and subsequent cross-linking with EDC and genipin assured the endurance of the scaffold in culture environment for a prolonged period of time. The cross-linking protocol adopted, imparted to the scaffold a hierarchical chemical structure as evidenced by Confocal Laser Microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy.

40|$|Alginates are {{a family}} of {{naturally}} occurring polysaccharides that form gels {{in the presence of}} Ca 2 +-ions at physiological conditions. Calcium phosphate mineralized alginates have previously been investigated as a synthetic extracellular matrix in bone tissue engineering. The isotropic nature of hydrogels fails to mimic the directional structure observed at different lengths scales in bone tissue. A composite structure of calcium phosphate mineralized <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers</b> embedded in a matrix of unmineralized alginate gel has been suggested as a method for imitating the structure of bone tissue. The fabrication of mineralized <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers</b> for bone tissue engineering applications using microfluidic devices has been investigated in this work. Fabrication of mineralized fibers was attempted using coaxial flow in microfluidic channels. A glass capillary microfluidic device was investigated to generate a coaxial flow of sodium alginate and phosphate ions surrounded by a flow of CaCl 2. The device was prone to clogging caused by buildup of alginate and minerals at the device surfaces. A second microfluidic device was designed in an attempt to prevent clogging. A flow of DI water was flown between the sodium alginate and CaCl 2 to act as a buffer delaying the onset of gelation until the flows cleared the device walls. Device geometries, flow rates and viscosities of the solutions were investigated to find parameters resulting in stable flow. Short lengths of calcium phosphate mineralized <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers</b> were successfully fabricated. Precipitation of CaP minerals and alginate buildup along device walls was decreased in the second device, but still resulted in device failure. Mineralized fibers were shown to have a inhomogeneous structure with CaP minerals concentrated around the perimeter. Calcium phosphate minerals were observed in SEM micrographs as nano-sized sheets within the gel network. Mineralized fibers were found to have a higher resistance to deformation compared to unmineralized. Further process development is required for stable fabrication of mineralized <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers.</b> A 3 D microfluidic design has been proposed to further separate the sodium alginate flow from device walls in an attempt to prevent buildup of gel and minerals along device walls.

40|$|The {{successful}} encapsulation {{of human}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG 2) cells would greatly assist {{a broad range}} of applications in tissue engineering. Due to the harsh conditions during standard chitosan fiber fabrication processes, encapsulation of HepG 2 cells in chitosan fibers has been challenging. Here, we describe the successful wet-spinning of chitosan-alginate fibers using a coaxial flow microfluidic chip. We determined the optimal mixing conditions for generating chitosan-alginate fibers, including a 1 : 5 ratio of 2 % (w∕w) water-soluble chitosan (WSC) solution to 2 % (w∕w) alginate solution. Ratio including higher than 2 % (w∕w) WSC solution increased aggregation throughout the mixture. By suspending cells in the WSC–alginate solution, we successfully fabricated HepG 2 cell-laden fibers. The encapsulated HepG 2 cells in the chitosan-alginate fibers were more viable than cells encapsulated in pure <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers,</b> suggesting that cross-linked chitosan provides a better environment for HepG 2 cells than alginate alone. In addition, we found that the adhesion of HepG 2 cells on the chitosan-alginate fiber is much better than that on the <b>alginate</b> <b>fibers...</b>|$|R

Single fibers were assembled over cylindrical molds by reeling to form spiral shapes, both having different geometries and sizes. An uninterrupted nanometric multilayer coating produced by a perfusion-based LbL technique, using alginate and chitosan, generated stable 3 D spiral-shaped macrostructures by gripping and affixing the threads together without using any crosslinking/binding agent. The chelation process altered the internal microenvironment of the 3 D construct from the solid to the liquefied state while preserving the external geometry.  L 929 cell viability by MTS and dsDNA quantification favor liquefied 3 D constructs more than nonliquefied ones.

Surgical thread was covered in alginate-cell solution by the microfluidic nozzle system to give a stronger structure to be used for implanting the cells. The thickness of the cell-encapsulated alginate layer produced by microfluidic nozzle processing system was controlled by varying the flow rate of alginate being pumped through the nozzle as well as by varying the speed by which the thread was extracted from the nozzle. The study showed that higher flow rates of alginate and lower thread speeds result in thicker alginate layers for encapsulating more cells within the fiber.

Solution viscosities of SA, PVA and their mixtures showed fiber spinning to be strongly influenced by the balance between SA-PVA and PVA-PVA intermolecular polar interaction and SA-SA repulsion. Low viscosity SA l (50 mPa s at 1 %) enabled higher SA loadings without significantly increasing mixture viscosities, producing more cylindrical fibers. All aqueous mixtures containing 33. 3 - 60 % SA l (5. 68 - 7. 15 % total SA l -PVA) had viscosities ranging from 530 to 3600 mPa s and could be electrospun continuously for at least 48 h.

40|$|The {{survival}} rates of burn wound patients have increased significantly {{during the past}} decades thanks {{to the development of}} state-of-the-art diagnostic tools and treatments. However, patients still suffer from prolonged physical and psychological pains. In addition, they are also facing a heavy financial burden. A universal wound dressing does not exist since wound characteristics can greatly differ. There exist however a number of criteria wound healing dressings should fulfill such as maintaining a moist environment, be non-adherent, provide mechanical support, etc. Commonly used (burn) dressings such as Kaltostat®, Flaminal®, etc. contain alginates. These linear polysaccharides extracted from brown algae are biocompatible and known for their ability to absorb and retain large amounts of exudate, hereby creating an optimal moist wound environment. Another interesting biopolymer is gelatin, a derivative of collagen which is a very important structural protein in the human body, including the skin. Interestingly, unlike alginate, gelatin has cell-interactive properties which can be an advantage for wound healing when aiming at skin regeneration. In the present work, gelatin and alginate have been modified with methacrylamide and methacrylate functionalities respectively. Chemically crosslinked networks were obtained through UV irradiation. The hydrogels developed have been characterized using IR-mapping, rheology and swelling experiments. Interestingly, in addition to conventional polymer networks, double networks or interpenetrating networks (IPN's) have been synthesized by incubating a UV-crosslinked gelatin-methacrylamide hydrogel film in a (modified) alginate solution, followed by a second crosslinking procedure using either UV irradiation or Ca 2 + ions. A very important aspect of burn wound treatment is the prevention of infections. Therefore, the incorporation of an antimicrobial agent in the hydrogels would greatly improve their performance as burn wound dressings.
