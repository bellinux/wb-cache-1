5|$|The Chesepian {{were the}} {{historic}} indigenous {{people of the}} area now known as Tidewater in Virginia {{at the time of}} European encounter. Little is known about them but archeological evidence suggests they may have been related to the Carolina Algonquian, or Pamlico people. They would have spoken one of the Algonquian languages. These were common among the numerous tribes of the coastal area, who made up the loose Powhatan Confederacy, numbering {{in the tens of thousands}} in population. The Chesepian occupied an area which is now defined <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach.|$|E
5|$|The Gudovac {{massacre}} was {{the mass}} killing of around 190 Bjelovar Serbs by the Croatian nationalist Ustaše movement on 28 April 1941, during World War II. The massacre occurred {{shortly after the}} German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia {{and the establishment of}} the Ustaše-led Axis puppet state known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> State of Croatia (NDH). It was the first act of mass murder committed by the Ustaše upon coming to power, and presaged a wider Ustaše-perpetrated campaign of genocide against Serbs in the NDH that lasted {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Wagiman is {{differentiated}} {{from other}} Australian languages {{in that it}} has a regular and productive process of verbalisation, whereby coverbs can become verbs and act <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> head of a clause. Despite being fully productive, meaning that all coverbs may undergo verbalisation, in practice only a handful of coverbs are commonly verbalised. The process appears to be unique to Wagiman within Australian languages.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> {{state of}} Belgium {{consolidated}} after the Revolution, {{the issue of}} a consensus language in the country became an increasingly important political question. At the start of the period, French was the dominant language, and was the only language that was approved for use in legal and government business anywhere in the country. It was also the language of the economic and social elite, even in Flanders. By the 1860s, with Flemish dialects in decline, increasing numbers of Flemish people of all social classes were bilingual, paralleling a similar decline in northern France. However, partly inspired by a resurgence in Flemish literature and culture, the Flamingant political movement began to develop, with their first political parties formed in the 1860s and 70s. Political agitation by Flamingant groups, often directed by local priests, led to Belgium becoming officially bilingual in 1870. Teaching Dutch in all secondary schools in Flanders became compulsory, reinforcing the language's presence. By 1898, Dutch was officially recognized as an equal language to French in legal matters. During {{the first decades of the}} 20th century, the Flemish Movement became increasingly radicalized and began to develop as a mass political movement (although not a united one), fully emerging during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Sava {{served with the}} 1st Monitor Division. Along with her fellow monitor , she laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border {{during the first few}} days of the invasion. The two monitors fought off several attacks by the Luftwaffe, but were forced to withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, navigation was difficult, and Sava was scuttled on 11 April. Some of her crew tried to escape cross-country towards the southern Adriatic coast, but all were captured prior to the Yugoslav surrender. The vessel was later raised by the navy of the Axis puppet state known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> State of Croatia and continued to serve as Sava until the night of 8 September 1944 when she was again scuttled.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>independents</b> are {{in effect}} the small, medium and even micro operators. They are known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>independents</b> because they are <b>independent</b> of <b>the</b> major music companies, known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> “majors”. Sometimes <b>independents</b> are {{referred}} to as SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), like other companies of similar sizes in other sectors. 99% of music businesses are small, medium or even micro operators, accounting for 80% of all new releases and 80% of the sector’s jobs. The collective market share of <b>the</b> <b>independents</b> has shrunk from 40% to 20% due to concentration and under capitalisation.|$|R

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Flight 370's disappearance, discussions {{concerning}} the analysis of satellite data began on the website of space scientist Duncan Steel. The informal group of people, most with scientific backgrounds, soon became known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> Group (IG) and has worked to analyse possible flight paths to determine the most likely final location of Flight 370. For the first few months, their efforts were hindered {{by a lack of}} data publicly released and they were critical of the official analysis by Inmarsat; the IG also pressured officials to release data related to Flight 370's satellite communications. The IG did not believe there was sufficient evidence, using publicly available information, to exclude the possibility of Flight 370 following a northern track prior to the release of the communication logs on 27 May. Some of the IG members have worked on analysing specific elements of Flight 370's flight path, such as the mid-flight speed of Flight 370 and precise location of the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to their}} {{invasion}} of his country, the Germans had offered Andrić {{the opportunity to}} evacuate to neutral Switzerland. He declined {{on the basis that}} his staff {{would not be allowed to}} go with him. On 6 April 1941, the Germans and their allies invaded Yugoslavia. The country capitulated on 17 April and was subsequently partitioned between the Axis powers. In early June, Andrić and his staff were taken back to German-occupied Belgrade, where some were jailed. Andrić was retired from the diplomatic service, but refused to receive his pension or cooperate in any way with the puppet government the Germans had installed in Serbia. He was spared jail, but the Germans kept him under close surveillance throughout the occupation. Because of his Croat heritage, they had offered him the chance to settle in Zagreb, then the capital of the fascist puppet state known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> State of Croatia, but he declined. Andrić spent the following three years in a friend's Belgrade apartment in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest. He directed most of his energies towards writing, and during this time completed two of his best known novels, Na Drini ćuprija (The Bridge on the Drina) and Travnička hronika.|$|E
5|$|Ramarayaningar {{was made}} a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire on 5 June 1926. In the Assembly {{elections}} which took place on 8 November 1926, no party {{was able to get}} a clean majority. The Swarajya Party won 41 of the 98 seats and emerged as the single largest party while the Justice party won 21. The Raja resigned as the Chief Minister of the Presidency as the popular verdict appeared to be against the Justice Party. As no party had a clean majority and the Swarajya Party which was the single largest party in the assembly was reluctant to form the government, the Governor appointed P. Subbarayan <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> Chief Minister and nominated 34 members to the Council to support him.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first named as Clavaria {{botrytis}} in 1797 by Christian Hendrik Persoon. In 1821, Elias Magnus Fries sanctioned the genus name Clavaria, and treated Ramaria as {{a section of}} Clavaria. It was given its current name in 1918 by Adalbert Ricken. Obsolete historical synonyms include Gotthold Hahn's 1883 Corallium botrytis and A. A. Pearson's variety Clavaria botrytis var. alba, which is no longer recognized as an independent taxon. Currie Marr and Daniel Stuntz described the variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa in their 1973 monograph of western Washington Ramaria; Edwin Schild and G.Ricci described variety compactospora from Italy in 1998. In 1950, E.J.H. Corner published George F. Atkinson's 1908 Clavaria holorubella as R.botrytis var. holorubella, but this taxon is now known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> species Ramaria holorubella.|$|E
