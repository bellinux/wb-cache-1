25|$|Archeological work at Lake Ilo NWR in the 1990s {{resulted}} in creating {{one of the}} largest assemblages of Paleo Indian artifacts found on land managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These artifacts help to educate modern peoples <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> lived in the region more 10,000 years ago, and enhances the refuge with a human culture story that was not anticipated when the region was set aside for wildlife protection.|$|E
25|$|Some specialists say {{the word}} may have {{originated}} during the Great Portuguese Discoveries, giving meaning to the sadness felt <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> departed on journeys to unknown seas and disappeared in shipwrecks, died in battle, or simply never returned. Those who stayed behind—mostly women and children—suffered deeply in their absence. However, the Portuguese discoveries only started in 1415 and since the word {{has been found in}} earlier texts, this does not constitute a very good explanation. The Reconquista also offers a plausible explanation.|$|E

25|$|Many adults {{returned}} at {{the same}} time as the school children; however, some who had volunteered for the armed services were demobbed in 1946. The meetings of families could be equally traumatic, with wives and husbands meeting again for the first time in five years and discovering they had lived very different lives which were hard to talk <b>about.</b> <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> had been evacuated were told that it was tougher in the islands. Alderney residents were not allowed to return to their island until December 1945.|$|E
25|$|The Archive is {{the oldest}} {{department}} of Yad Vashem. Before presenting an exhibition, Yad Vashem collects items. The best known of these are the historical photographs, {{as well as the}} Pages of Testimonies collected from survivors. The latter is a database of personal information <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> survived and those who perished in the Holocaust. Yad Vashem has also acquired access to the database of the International Tracing Service of Bad Arolsen of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and these two databases complement each other for research purposes.|$|E
25|$|Learners {{learn about}} their identities {{and how they are}} {{situated}} within multiple relationships (for example, family, friends, school, local community, country), as a basis for understanding the global dimension of citizenship. They develop an understanding of difference and diversity (for example, culture, language, gender, sexuality, religion), of how beliefs and values influence people’s views <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> are different, and of the reasons for, and impact of, inequality and discrimination. Learners also consider common factors that transcend difference, and develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes required for respecting difference and living with others.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} deaths caused by the {{shooting}} is disputed. While the 'official' figure given by the British inquiry into the massacre is 379 deaths, the method used by the inquiry was corrupt. In July 1919, {{three months after the}} massacre, officials were tasked with finding who had been killed by inviting inhabitants of the city to volunteer information <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had died. This information was incomplete due to fear that those who participated would be identified as having been present at the meeting, and some of the dead may not have had close relations in the area. When interviewed by the members of the committee, a senior civil servant in Punjab admitted that the actual figure could be higher.|$|E
25|$|In his What <b>About</b> <b>Those</b> <b>Who</b> Have Never Heard? Sanders tells a {{story about}} a college student who {{rejected}} Christianity because, he claimed, it “damns to hell all those who never hear about Jesus.” Sanders replied that though some Christians held that position there are several other views which have been affirmed by Christians throughout history. In his book, No Other Name, he discusses a range of views affirmed by Christians. Sanders coined the term “restrictivism” for the view that Christian salvation is possible only for those who have heard about the gospel of Jesus and put their faith in Jesus prior to their death. Those who die without knowing about Jesus cannot inherit eternal life. The second view he discusses is universalism (or apokatastasis) according to which every human who has ever lived will be redeemed. Between these polar views are what Sanders calls the “wider hope” and he spends the most time on two views in this category. One is what he calls eschatological evangelization or postmortem salvation. In this view if a person dies without having heard of Jesus then he or she will encounter Jesus after death and be provided an opportunity to put their faith in Jesus. The final position Sanders covers is the one he affirms: inclusivism. The unevangelized are saved by the work of Jesus if they respond in faith to God based on the revelation they have available.|$|E
25|$|On 6 October 2001, Adelaide was {{the ship}} which intercepted SIEV 4, the event which sparked the Children {{overboard}} affair. Under orders to prevent SIEVs from entering Australian waters, Adelaide attempted {{to warn the}} craft, carrying over 200 passengers (including children), against crossing from international waters during the night and into 7 October. When the SIEV failed to heed these warnings, Adelaide fired warning shots and initiated a RHIB boarding action, with the boarding party {{took control of the}} craft that afternoon. Between this time and when the craft was manoeuvred from Australian territory late the next morning, several attempts were made to sabotage the craft, and some adult passengers jumped or were thrown overboard while others threatened to do so; the fourteen people that entered the water were recovered by the frigate's RHIB and taken back to the SIEV. Adelaide observed the craft as it headed towards Indonesia, and moved in to provide further assistance a few hours later, after systematic sabotage immobilised the small vessel. Adelaide was instructed to take the vessel in tow and head for Christmas Island. The SIEV began to take on water during the afternoon of 8October, and despite the appearance that the problem had been rectified, the craft sank without warning at 17:00. All aboard were forced into the water, and were rescued by personnel from Adelaide. Reports of the sinking were conflated with information <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> jumped or were thrown overboard the day previous {{to give the impression that}} the threat of throwing children overboard had been made or carried out, a story that was later proven false but taken up at the time by the Howard government during the lead-up to the 2001 election to support their campaign promises to tighten border controls and immigration.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and motivation regarding clinical hypnosis. A comparison was made between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had previous experience with hypnosis {{and people who}} had no previous experience with hypnosis. Results indicated that previous experience with hypnosis was associated with significantly more accurate knowledge, more positive attitudes and beliefs about hypnosis, and greater intention to use clinical hypnosis. There {{were no significant differences}} between younger and older non-experienced or hypnosis-experienced participants in relation to accuracy of knowledge, positive beliefs about hypnosis, beliefs about the mental stability of hypnotisable people, or fear <b>about</b> hypnosis. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> obtained their information about hypnosis from personal experiences had significantly more accurate knowledge <b>about</b> hypnosis than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> obtained their information from stage hypnosis/television presentations. They also had significantly more positive beliefs and less fear <b>about</b> hypnosis than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> obtained their information from stage hypnosis/television presentations...|$|R

500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{criticism}} of the Tamil Nadu government's mishandling of the crisis, many notable personalities and other people helped those affected by floods. In Chennai, people across the city offered aid, shelter and food through social media channels like Twitter, Whatsapp, and Facebook. Social media sites were also used extensively to relay information about flooded areas, rescue agencies and food and relief centers. Chennai residents set up a temporary website to crowd source information about people needing help and <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were ready to help. Celebrities such as RJ Balaji, actor Siddharth and Chinmayi actively participated in the relief process by using social media to coordinate aid and gather information. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh members distributed food and relief materials in various rain-hit areas of Chennai, districts of Cuddalore and Kancheepuram. RSS workers swung into action immediately, involved in rescuing operations wading through neck-deep water. Swayamsevaks cleared street lamp post, cleared traffic, distributed food and relief materials. Around 5500 RSS-Sevabharati volunteers served the affected areas. [...] Food was distributed to 21 lakh people in 118 relief centres; family kit was distributed with 20 essential items to 63000 families. [...] Around 133 medical camps were conducted with 160 Doctors benefitting 23000 people. Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu visited and distributed relief materials to the flood victims at Tambaram.|$|E
