Methods and Results: An 868 array with 300 mm spaced electrodes was placed over the His bundles of isolated, perfused rabbit hearts (n = 12). Ventricular myocardial (VM) and His activations were differentiated by calculating Laplacian recordings from unipolar signals. Activation rates of the VM and His bundle were compared and the His bundle conduction velocity was measured during perfused VF followed by 8 minutes of unperfused VF. During perfused VF the average VM <b>activation</b> <b>rate</b> of 11. 04 activations/sec was significantly higher than the His bundle <b>activation</b> <b>rate</b> of 6. 88 activations/sec (p, 0. 05).

The difference in {{distribution of the}} Purkinje system in dogs and pigs was explored to determine if Purkinje activation propagates to stimulate working myocardium (WM) during LDVF and WM pacing. Methods and Results-âIn-vivo extracellular recordings were made from 1044 intramural plunge and epicardial plaque electrodes in 6 pig and 6 dog hearts. Sinus activation propagated sequentially from the endocardium to the epicardium in dogs but not pigs. During epicardial pacing, activation propagated along the endocardium and traversed the LV wall almost parallel to the epicardium in dogs, but in pigs propagated away from the pacing site approximately perpendicular to the epicardium. After 1 minute of VF, <b>activation</b> <b>rate</b> near the endocardium was significantly faster than near the epicardium in dogs (P 0. 05). From 2 to 10 minutes of LDVF, recordings exhibiting Purkinje activations were near the endocardium in dogs (P< 0. 01) but were scattered transmurally in pigs, and the WM <b>activation</b> <b>rate</b> in recordings in which Purkinje activations were present was significantly faster than the WM <b>activation</b> <b>rate</b> in recordings in which Purkinje activations were absent (P< 0. 01).

To explore this synergy, we model the dynamics of F-actin at the leading edge, motivated by data from EGF-stimulated mammary carcinoma cells. We study how synergy depends on the localized rates and relative timing of cofilin and Arp 2 / 3 activation at the cell edge. The model incorporates diffusion of cofilin, membrane protrusion, F-actin capping, aging, and severing by cofilin and branch nucleation by Arp 2 / 3 (but not G-actin recycling).
