40|$|This {{study will}} follow the {{development}} of the rules pertaining to <b>apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages,</b> with particular emphasis on the <b>Apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Damages</b> Act 34 of 1956 (‘the Act”) and its applicability to contractual claims. It furthermore delves into the current legal position in England, Australia and New Zealand. In Thoroughbred Breeders Association v Price Waterhouse 1999 (4) SA 968 (W), the Court decided that the Act was applicable to contractual claims and apportioned the damages payable by the defendant to the plaintiff. However, the matter was taken on appeal with the decision of the Court a Quo overturned. It will be argued that, although the reasoning at first glance seems sound, upon closer examination, the application of the Act need not be limited solely to delictual claims. The best manner in which to remedy this lacunae in our law is an amendment to Section 1 (1) and 1 (3) of the Act, to explicitly extend the application thereof to contractual claims.

40|$|State tort {{laws that}} govern the <b>apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> from {{accidents}} often bar potential plaintiffs who played even a minor causal role in the accident from recovering damages from other culpable parties. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that judges and juries fail to enforce {{the letter of the}} law, which leads to a weaker relationship between fault in an accident and recovery for injuries than the laws would predict. Data from insurance settlements arising out of auto accidents are consistent with the anecdotal evidence. This indicates that {{the letter of the law}} may be less important in shaping individuals' behavior than scholars have supposed. ...|$|E

40|$|Contributory intent” {{refers to}} the {{situation}} where, besides the defendant being at fault and causing harm to the plaintiff, the plaintiff also intentionally causes harm to him- or herself. “Contributory intent” can {{have the effect of}} either excluding the defendant’s liability (on the ground that the plaintiff's voluntary assumption of risk or intent completely cancels the defendant's negligence and therefore liability), or limiting the defendant’s liability (where both parties intentionally cause the plaintiff's loss thereby resulting in the reduction of the defendant’s liability). Under our law the "contributory intent" of the plaintiff, can either serve as a complete defence in terms of common law or it can serve to limit the defendant's liability in terms of the <b>Apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Damages</b> Act 34 of 1956.

40|$|In {{terms of}} delictual liability, the term "fault" {{generally}} {{refers to the}} defendant's conduct, whereas "contributory fault" refers to the plaintiff's conduct. "Contributory intent" {{is a form of}} "contributory fault" and may apply as a defence limiting delictual liability within the ambit of the <b>Apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Damages</b> Act 34 of 1956 (hereinafter referred to as the "Act"). In terms of the Act, the extent of the plaintiff's as against the defendant's fault is taken into account, resulting (in certain instances) in a reduction of the award to the plaintiff. The Act currently regulates the <b>apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> based on fault in South Africa. The Act does not specifically provide for conduct performed intentionally, and this also seems to be the situation in quite a few foreign jurisdictions. Initially our courts applied the Act to instances of "contributory negligence" (the other form of "contributory fault") only, but in recent times they have applied it to instances of "contributory intent". This change has occurred as a result of practical situations that arose unexpectedly, where the courts had in the interest of serving justice to deal with cases of intentional conduct {{on the part of the}} plaintiff and the defendant. The effect of "contributory intent" as a defence in terms of delictual liability is uncertain and contentious not only in South Africa but in foreign jurisdictions as well. The South African Law Reform Commission undertook a review of the Act and published a report on its findings. The Commission acknowledged that since the Act was passed there have been major developments in the law of delict which the Act has been unable to accommodate, resulting in anomalies in this area of the law. It acknowledged that it is unsatisfactory for our courts to go beyond the parameters of the Act in order to reach a just and equitable result when dealing with the apportionment of liability. The Apportionment of Loss Bill 2003 (hereinafter referred as the "Bill") has been drafted to replace the current Act but has unfortunately not been promulgated. Over ten years have passed since it was drafted. In respect of the Bill, "contributory intent" as a defence limiting delictual liability would be recognised. It is hoped that this contribution will bring about a renewed interest in this forgotten but valuable Bill...|$|E
40|$|Few {{issues have}} proven more vexing to private {{antitrust}} enforcement than {{those related to}} indirect-purchaser class actions. The current dual system of enforcement—federal and state—exacerbates the difficulty of litigating indirect-purchaser claims by layering procedural complexity on top of substantive complexity and by explicitly allowing (perhaps even incentivizing) duplicative recovery. Almost all commentators are in substantial agreement that reform is necessary, but Congress appears unlikely to take action on {{the issue in the}} near future. This Note proposes a procedural solution that would consolidate litigation in a single federal court based on the limited-fund class action model of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (b) (1) (B). Under the limited-fund model, the purpose of consolidated litigation is to determine liability before turning to the <b>apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages.</b> This Note also advocates for a presumption that damages are appropriately allocated to purchasers on a pro rata basis, consistent with common practice in the limited-fund class action context. Proper allocation would depend on the purchaser’s position in the supply chain, with direct purchasers receiving the largest share of the recovery. This Note’s proposal provides three primary advantages: (1) it eliminates the possibility of duplicative litigation; (2) it aligns the interests of all the potential plaintiffs to better incentivize vigorous antitrust enforcement; and (3) it reduces the need for complex damages calculations...|$|E

The Act addresses venue for cases involving joint defendants and {{the doctrine of}} forum non conveniens. It also amends procedures relating to affidavits in professional malpractice cases by requiring that plaintiff file, with the complaint, an affidavit of an expert competent to testify. In addition, the Act also requires authorizing {{the release of the}} plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s medical information in medical malpractice cases. The Act further provides guidelines associated with offers of settlement and the reduction of frivolous lawsuits. Moreover, the Act provides that courts shall not admit certain statements of apology or similar statements by health care providers as evidence in civil actions.

40|$|From {{initially}} {{placing the}} burden of injury almost exclusively on the injured employee, growing social awareness of the inherent risks in the workplace has seen an ever increasing willingness to hold the employer liable. 1 This was initially driven by the courts, but developments were soon overtaken {{by the work of}} political activists and trade unions, which placed great pressure on business and the state to find more equitable systems of worker protection. 2 This culminated in what is so often referred to as a new balance 3 being struck in the form of comprehensive legislation to protect workers. In South Africa, this comprehensive legislation is the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act 3 of 1993 ('the COIDA'). The COIDA extinguishes an employee's common law rights to sue the employer for damages 4 and instead introduces a no-fault system of compensation in which the employee is guaranteed an amount of compensation, when the harm from the accidents or occupational disease arises in the workplace. 5 The compensation payable is in most situations significantly less to that which could be claimed at common law, being capped at a maximum of the total pecuniary loss to an employee. 6 The employer thus avoids the risks associated with the possibility of costly damages claims while being obliged to fund the legislative compensation scheme through a tariff system. The tariffs payable are dependent on the risks associated with the class of industry and the safety record of the individual business. 7 THE COIDA in recognition of the need to discourage employers from maintaining unsafe workplaces preserved a common law like 8 fault based entitlement to what is termed 'increased compensation' under s 56 of the COIDA. 9 The significance of the provision lies in the ability of an injured employee or their dependents to claim back the difference between the no-fault compensation paid and their respective pecuniary loss. 10 While potentially having a dramatic impact on the compensation received the section is completely underutilised. 11 The reasons for this underutilisation are said to lie in potential claimants either being ignorant of the provisions or unable to institute claims. 12 This thesis will examine the interaction between the law that regulates workmen's compensation and one aspect of how this modern system of law deals with the age old problem of negligently caused harm in the workplace. In particular, it argues that another important reason why claims for increased compensation are underutilised is because the common law defence of contributory negligence is said to apply to a claim for increased compensation. The result of this is that laws, which have since been abolished with the passing of the <b>Apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Damages</b> Act 34 of 195613 ('the ADA') continue to apply in this one statute. The result is that cases developed over a century ago, which involved law on hobbled donkeys and steam powered trains, continues to have a major influence on whether a claim for increased compensation is successful or not. 14 As will be shown, this position is untenable and a new interpretation of the provision for increased compensation is required...|$|E
40|$|Where a party wrongfully suffers harm {{due to the}} {{negligent conduct}} of another, that harm is {{repaired}} through the payment of damages. In terms of the principle res perit domino, it is however a fundamental principle {{of the law of}} delict that a person should bear the loss he suffers. It stands to reason that where he contributes to his damages by his own negligent conduct, this should be taken into account and his damages reduced accordingly. The legal position regarding contributory negligence and the effect on recovery of damages, is governed by the <b>Apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Damages</b> Act 34 of 1956. The relevance of the Act is often considered when dealing with the issue of liability; however, it ultimately effects the quantum of a damages award. This {{is not to say that}} the apportionment of liability will or should mirror the extent to which the damages are apportioned. In certain cases, damages may be further apportioned to account for other factors. In practice, the Act is often exercised incorrectly and differently from case to case, due to varying interpretations and approaches to underlying principles. The Act does not define concepts fundamental thereto nor does it prescribe an approach to determine the reduction of a party’s damages. Specifically the meaning of fault in the Act, whether this fault relates to the damage or damage-causing event, as well as how this fault should be measured and applied to the facts of each case have been interpreted and applied inconsistently. The highlight the various scenaria that have appeared in the practical application of the Act to claims arising out of delict and specifically, motor vehicle collisions. Through practical illustrations and case law, one can deliberate on the factors to be considered when a particular approach is adopted. It is ultimately necessary to determine whether the Act can be applied effectively and fairly, by adopting a single approach, or whether the law has to be revised. If the Act were to be reviewed, the extent to which negligent conduct is to be applied as well as how this is to be assessed should be clarified. It is necessary for courts to bear in mind that a person’s conduct as it is causally linked to harm, should be apportioned and a separate enquiry to extent to which harm is exacerbated by contributory negligence should be done. Mere negligent conduct is not sufficient – it must be linked to increased harm. As it stands, he approach followed in the Jones case provides for a definable formula in which the parties’ conduct as it relates to the harm are assessed separately and then compared. If the comparative approach can be enforced, uniformity will be achieved and the uncertainty of discretionary application can be eliminated, even if the Act is not redrafted. If legal practitioners are able to clearly make this distinction and apportion the parts to which a claimant’s actions are related, the purpose of the Act can be achieved.
