5|$|The murders raised public <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for {{bodies for}} medical {{research}} {{and contributed to}} the passing of the Anatomy Act 1832.

5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead. During the 1930s, the New Deal programs promulgated by President Franklin Roosevelt led to a heightened awareness of the parkway proposals; a 1937 report by the Maryland State Planning Commission increased awareness further. Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was {{called one of the}} deadliest roads in the world at the time) along with <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to mobilize national defense before World War II provided additional motivation for construction of the parkway.|$|E

5|$|Payton's legacy {{continues}} through the charitable Walter and Connie Payton Foundation. His own appeals—and after his death, his foundation's—for greater <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for organ donations are widely credited with bringing national {{attention to the}} problem. After his appeals, donations in Illinois skyrocketed, and the regional organ bank of Illinois was overwhelmed with calls. In response, the City of Chicago inserted organ donation requests into city-vehicle-registration mailings in early 2000, and by August 2000, 13,000 people had {{signed on to the}} program. The foundation continues to run a program that Payton organized to donate toys to underprivileged children across the Chicago area each Christmas. The family established the Walter Payton Cancer Fund in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The murders {{committed}} by Burke and Hare raised public <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for bodies for medical purposes, {{and of the}} trade that doctors had conducted with grave robbers and murderers. The East London murder of a 14-year-old boy and the subsequent attempt to sell the corpse to the medical school at King's College London led to {{an investigation of the}} London Burkers, who had recently turned from grave robbing to murder to obtain corpses; two men were hanged in December 1831 for the crime. A bill was quickly introduced into Parliament, and gained royal assent nine months later to become the Anatomy Act 1832. This Act authorised dissection on bodies from workhouses unclaimed after 48 hours, and ended the practice of anatomising as part of the death sentence for murder.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, a {{redevelopment}} {{plan in the}} West district, to widen Haian Rd and build an underground plaza proved a failure as lack of geological surveying and overall planning meant that the works ran into a layer of groundwater. The development destroyed part of the historic Go-tiau-kang area. As a consequence, the Zhongzheng Road district, previously the most popular shopping precinct in Tainan since Japanese rule, went into decline due to the poor quality of the environment. By the mid-1990s, there was a growing <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to protect Tainan's historical and cultural treasures. Since then, the government and civil societies have worked to protect Tainan's heritage. It is an ongoing issue for Tainan to protect its past while reviving its old business center.|$|E
500|$|Garfield's {{murder by}} a {{deranged}} office-seeker awakened public <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for civil service reform legislation. Senator George H. Pendleton, a Democrat from Ohio, launched a reform effort {{that resulted in}} the Pendleton Act in January 1883. This act reversed the [...] "spoils system" [...] where office seekers paid up or gave political service to obtain or keep federally appointed positions. Under the act, appointments were awarded on merit and competitive examination. To ensure the reform was implemented, Congress and Arthur established and funded the Civil Service Commission. The Pendleton Act, however, covered only 10% of federal government workers. For Arthur, previously known for having been a [...] "veteran spoilsman," [...] civil service reform became his most noteworthy achievement.|$|E

[...] His words received support from a few readers. [...] Others, however, welcomed the open reporting, considering it helpful in raising public <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for vigilance even in a city with low crime rates.

500|$|McCartney {{ventured into}} orchestral music in 1991, when the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society {{commissioned}} a musical piece by him to celebrate its sesquicentennial. He collaborated with composer Carl Davis, producing Liverpool Oratorio. The performance featured opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Sally Burgess, Jerry Hadley and Willard White, with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir of Liverpool Cathedral. Reviews were negative. The Guardian was especially critical, describing the music as [...] "afraid of anything approaching a fast tempo", and {{adding that the}} piece has [...] "little <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for recurrent ideas that will bind the work into a whole". The paper published a letter McCartney submitted in response in which he noted several of the work's faster tempos and added, [...] "happily, history shows that many good pieces of music were not liked by the critics of the time so I am content to... let people judge for themselves {{the merits of the}} work." [...] The New York Times was slightly more generous, stating, [...] "There are moments of beauty and pleasure in this dramatic miscellany... the music's innocent sincerity makes it difficult to be put off by its ambitions".
