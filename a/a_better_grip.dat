40|$|Designing and {{developing}} a cosmesis solution that maintains mechanical and environmental durabil-ity while minimizing mechanical drag and allowing sensor function was {{the crux of the}} challenge. For the BACKGROUND A cosmesis is the last component to be placed on a prosthetic arm, hand, or both, and it is the first com-ponent that others interact with, either visually or by contact. Historically, the cosmesis has had two primary functions. The first has been to provide a cosmetic cover over the nonhuman-appearing mechanism of the pros-thetic limb. This cover helps the patient feel more com-fortable in social settings (Fig. 1). The second function has been to provide <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>gripping</b> surface than that of the underlying mechanism for the hand to promote picking up and holding objects. In the work described in this article, we imposed other requirements, such as pro-viding a first barrier against the environment and allow-ing sensors to measure force, vibration, and temperature through the cosmesis. cosmesis fulfills multiple functions, from providing a cos-metic covering to increase social acceptance to improving the gripping capability of a prosthetic hand. This article explores the requirements imposed on the cosmesis developed for the Revolutionizing Prosthetics (RP) 2009 program and looks at the dual glove-solution path that evolved during the development and testing. The requirements are drivers for the materials selection, and the processing method that was selected is an evolution of traditional cosmesis fabrication. Future directions in cosmesis fabrication are discussed...|$|R

The materials used in our study are 5086 aluminum alloy and 304 L stainless steel with various surface qualities: polished 120, mirror polished and sandblasted. The projection powder {{is a combination of}} "ceramic-metal " WC-Co whose average grain size is 30 microns. The layers thicknesses obtained after 3 passes vary between 90 and 120 microns depending on the operating conditions: gas protection, temperature and surface condition.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{are mixed}} into SBR/NR and SBR/IR blends using a wet mixing process. The phase specific localization of CNTs in rubber blends is predicted theoretically using surface energy data of blend components and determined experimentally {{by means of}} the wetting concept. Almost all CNTs are found to be localized in the SBR matrix of SBR/IR blends due to the better affinity of CNTs to SBR than to IR. In contrast, a high CNT loading localized in the NR phase of SBR/NR blends results from the presence of phospholipids in NR. Electrical and mechanical properties of the rubber blends depend strongly on CNT localization. A lower CNT loading in SBR matrix of SBR/NR blends imparts <b>a</b> <b>better</b> wet <b>grip</b> and lower rolling resistance to tire tread compounds...|$|R

500|$|The Middleton Railway, {{founded in}} 1758, {{is the oldest}} {{continuously}} working railway in Britain to be established by an Act of Parliament; the first such act in England. The railway, owned by Charles Brandling, (1733–1802) was a horse drawn wooden waggonway linking the collieries at Middleton to Cassons Close near Leeds Bridge in the centre of Leeds. In 1810 John Blenkinsop, Brandling's agent at Middleton, was looking for cheaper ways of moving coal to Leeds. He designed the rack railway and Matthew Murray built the first Middleton Railway locomotive, [...] "Salamanca", at his Round Foundry in Holbeck. The locomotive's first run, reported in The Leeds Mercury on 27 June 1812, was [...] "witnessed by thousands of spectators and crowned a complete success....". Three more locomotives were built.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with families of plane algebraic curves that contain a given and quite special finite set X of points in the projective plane. We focus on the {{case in which the}} set X is formed by transversally intersecting pairs of lines selected from two given finite families of cardinality d. The union of all lines from both families is called a cage, and the intersection X consists of d^ 2 points at which a line from the first family intersects a line from the second. The points of X are called the nodes of the cage. We study the subsets A of the nodal set X such that any plane algebraic curve C of degree d that contains A must contain X as well. As a corollary, we get a few generalizations of the famous Pascal theorem, generalizations that employ polygons (instead of hexagons as in Pascal's theorem) inscribed in a quadratic curve. Our results are closely related to the classical theorems of Chasles and Bacharach. Although the nodal sets X produced by our cages are quite special in comparison to more general complete intersections studied by Bacharach, the cages provide us with <b>a</b> much <b>better</b> <b>grip</b> on the combinatorics of subsets A of X with the property that is described above.

50|$|Open heel fins are {{secured to}} the foot by a strap which passes {{around the back of}} the ankle. These are usually elastic and may be adjustable. Early fins used rubber straps {{connected}} to the fin by a wire buckle, and were not readily adjustable. Later versions incorporated swivels, buckles, quick release connectors and adjustable tension, but the increased complexity and decreased reliability, and tendency of the loose strap ends to hook on things triggered a return by some manufacturers and aftermarket accessory manufacturers to simpler systems. These include stainless steel spring straps and bungee straps, which once set up, are not adjustable, and which reduce the number of potential failure points and places where the fin can snag on obstructions like net, line and seaweed. Some heel straps have <b>a</b> loop for <b>better</b> <b>grip</b> with wet hands or gloves.Some fins designed for surf use have integral straps which can neither be replaced nor adjusted, but are simple and have no projections which can snag or scratch the swimmer's legs.

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the risk of}} being fearful or fearless of falls in older people. Methods. Using a force plate, postural control in different sensory and rhythmic conditions was measured in 263 community-dwelling older people. Other assessments included fear of falling, and handgrip strength. Fall incidence was assessed at baseline and during a one-year follow-up period. Results. Logistic regression analysis revealed that increased lateral sway in near-tandem stance with eyes open (OR = 5. 33; p < 0. 01) and a worse performance on anteroposterior rhythmic weight shifts (OR 0. 65; p < 0. 05) were related to falls. Univariate analyses revealed that older people with inappropriate high fear of falling according to their fall incidence had worse balance capacities on the rhythmic weight shifts (p < 0. 05) but had similar static balance and physical capacities. Older people with inappropriate low fear of falling had <b>a</b> <b>better</b> hand <b>grip</b> (p < 0. 05) but equally worse balance capacities than the comparison group. Conclusions. The results indicate the importance of lateral stability in relation to falls. They also suggest a substantial impact of inappropriate fear of falling on physical performance. Inappropriate high fear of falling may result in worse performance during dynamic balance tests, whereas older people with inappropriate low fear seem to overrate their capacities because of higher strength...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the optimum tube diameter {{of a standard}} handrim-propelled wheelchair, the effect of tube size and shape on physiological and kinetic parameters was studied. Six able-bodied male subjects performed two tests on a wheelchair ergometer. Tests were performed against work loads comparable to every day use and with two different handrim tube diameters, a handrim with an oval 25 by 30 mm diameter (LR) and one with an 18 mm diameter (SR). The large tube diameter (LR) yielded slightly but significantly lower values for the physiological parameters. Gross mechanical efficiency was on average 7 % for the LR and 6. 3 % for the SR. No significant results were found for force application parameters related to {{the direction of the}} applied force or the torque by the hand onto the handrim surface. As technique parameters could not explain the higher mechanical efficiency (ME) when using the LR, it is suggested that hand grip constraints in the push phase (finger flexor activity) might be responsible. Another possible explanation is that with <b>a</b> <b>better</b> hand <b>grip</b> using LR, less stabilization by the larger muscle groups at the elbow and shoulder is needed. The measured technique parameters seem to be determined by geometric constraints of the arm and shoulder.
