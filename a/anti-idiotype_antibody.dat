50|$|Anti-idiotypic {{vaccines}} comprise antibodies {{that have}} three-dimensional immunogenic regions, designated idiotopes, that consist of protein sequences that bind to cell receptors. Idiotopes are aggregated into idiotypes specific of their target antigen. An example of <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> is Racotumomab.|$|E
40|$|Inoculation {{of human}} {{subjects}} with mouse monoclonal antibody {{results in the}} production of <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> that reacts with the binding site of the monoclonal antibody. This reaction is hapten-inhibited, suggesting that an internal image of the antigen is produced by the anti-idiotype response. The <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> isolated from sera of three patients showed significant crossreactivity. Patients who developed the <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> improved clinically and had long remission from their disease. The possible presence of the internal image of cancer antigen on the human immunoglobulin molecule may change the conditions under which the immune system reacts to the tumor antigen and may open new approaches to the control of tumor growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{secreted}} IgMs of two human lymphoblastoid cell lines, RPMI- 6410 and RPMI- 8392, were purified. Antisera {{against these}} two IgMs {{were raised in}} rabbits and made idiotypically specific to the respective antigens through various absorption procedures. By immunofluorescence and radioimmunoassay techniques, the purified <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> were found to react also with the membrane Igs of the respective cell lines, but not {{with those of other}} cell lines. The purified <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> were then coupled with Chlorambucil to form antibody-drug conjugates, whose effectiveness in the in-vitro killing of target cells was evaluated by a chromium-release cytotoxicity assay. The results showed that these anti-idiotype antibody-Chlorambucil conjugates were specifically cytotoxic to lymphoblastoid cells that bore membrane Igs carrying the respective idiotypic determinant(s). Furthermore, the conjugates were far more effective in causing cytolysis to the target cells than either Chlorambucil or the <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> alone...|$|R
40|$|The antigen {{recognized}} by mouse monoclonal antibody YH 206 (MoAb YH 206) is mainly expressed in adenocarcinomas and also {{detected in the}} sera of cancer patients (Hinoda, Y. et al. : Jpn. J. Cancer Res. (Gann) 78, 607, 1987). Polyclonal and syngeneic monoclonal <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> were produced by immunization of MoAb YH 206 (IgM) to a rabbit and a BALB/c mouse, respectively. Enzyme immunoassay showed that the <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> reacted specifically with MoAb YH 206, but had no crossreactivity with other monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the antibodies strongly inhibited the YH 206 antigen-antibody reaction. By using these <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies,</b> we screened sera of normal individuals and cancer patients with or without YH 206 antigen {{for the detection of}} anti-YH 206 antibody. Our study revealed that anti-YH 206 antibody was detected in the sera of cancer patients, especially stomach and panceas cancer patients but not in normal individuals. The results suggest that there may be an immune response against adenocarcinoma-associated antigen YH 206 in cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|Combination {{chemotherapy}} {{remains the}} major current treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. B-cell lymphoma often has tumor-specific surface immunoglobulins called idiotypes. Clinical trials using murine monoclonal <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> as a targeting approach have shown some success. I describe a novel concept of using idiotype-specific peptides {{as an alternative}} targeting approach {{for the treatment of}} B-cell lymphoma. In brief, octapeptides that bind to the surface idiotype of the B-cell lymphoma are isolated from a large synthetic peptide library (10 (6) to 10 (7) peptides). Once the sequence of a tumor-specific octapeptide ligand is defined, large quantities can be synthesized and conjugated with a radionuclide (such as iodine 131). This should permit highly specific destruction of lymphoma cells that bind the labeled peptide. The theoretic advantages of this approach over the previous use of <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> are addressed...|$|R
40|$|Anti-idiotypic {{antibodies}} {{have been}} used to mimic antigen in the mouse antiphosphorylcholine response in order to investigate the induction of precursors of antibody-forming cells. We have shown that interaction of <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> with receptor antibody molecules induces the formation of antibodies that are specific for phosphorylcholine and carry the idiotypic determinants. This induction is dependent on the recognition of carrier determinants on the <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> by helper T cells. We conclude that receptor antibody molecules {{on the surface of the}} precursors of antibody-forming cells deliver the antigenic signal for the induction of these cells...|$|E
40|$|Pre-{{clinical}} {{and clinical}} studies of therapeutic antibodies require highly specific reagents {{to examine their}} immune responses, bio-distributions, immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics in patients. Selective antigen-mimicking <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> facilitates the assessment of therapeutic antibody in the detection, quantitation and characterization of antibody immune responses. Using mouse specific degenerate primer pairs and splenocytic RNA, we generated an idiotype antibody-immunized phage-displayed scFv library in which an <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> against the therapeutic chimera anti-CD 22 antibody SM 03 was isolated. The anti-idiotype scFv recognized the idiotype of anti-CD 22 antibody and inhibited binding of SM 03 to CD 22 on Raji cell surface. The anti-idiotype scFv was subsequently classified as Ab 2 c type. Moreover, our results also demonstrated firstly that the anti-idiotype scFv {{could be used for}} pharmacokinetic measurement of circulating residual antibody in lymphoma patients treated with chimera anti-CD 22 monoclonal antibody SM 03. Of important, the present approach could be easily adopted to generate anti-idiotype antibodies for therapeutic antibodies targeting membrane proteins, saving the cost and time for producing a soluble antigen...|$|E
40|$|Anti-idiotypic {{antibodies}} {{were raised}} in rabbits against four monoclonal antibodies with specificity for the surface antigenic determinants of Eimeria tenella sporozoites, the infective stage of the coccidial parasite. Two of the monoclonal antibodies (1073 and 15 - 1) transferred passive protection in chickens against E. tenella infection. The polyclonal <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> preparations against protective monoclonal antibodies contained specificities for the paratope-associated idiotypes of these monoclonal antibodies, as assessed by the competitive inhibition of binding of the homologous idiotype-anti-idiotype by the sporozoite antigen. Competitive inhibition of binding of homologous idiotype-anti-idiotype by the parasite antigen was not observed when the <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> preparations against monoclonal antibodies 1546 and 1096 were tested. The anti-idiotype 1073 and 15 - 1 antibodies functioned as surrogate antigens in vivo when used for vaccination of young chickens, {{as evidenced by the}} induction of partial protective immunity against subsequent challenge infection with virulent parasites and induction of antisporozoite antibodies. These data clearly support the view that anti-idiotypic antibodies raised against the paratope-associated idiotypes can mimic pathogen antigens and therefore can provide a possible alternative approach for the vaccination of chickens against coccidiosis...|$|E
40|$|IgA myeloma {{proteins}} of kappa- and lambda-types {{were isolated}} from two patients. These {{were used to}} produce and purify <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> of both broad (myeloma-related) and narrow (individual myeloma) specificities. The <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> were conjugated with fluorochromes and used as immunofluorescent probes to trace in the patients clonal expansion {{at different levels of}} B-cell differentiation. Our results (a) confirm that B lymphocyte precursors in IgA plasma-cell myelomas are involved in the malignant process, (b) show that B lymphocytes of the malignant clone include those expressing each of the major heavy-chain isotypes, mu, delta, gamma, and alpha, and (c) provide strong circumstantial evidence that pre-B-cell members of the malignant clone are also increased in frequency. T cells expressing idiotypic determinants were not detected. These findings argue that the initial oncogenic event may occur in a B-stem cell and is not influenced through stimulation by antigen. An interesting association was the increased frequency of related clones of B lymphocytes as detected by their reactivity with <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> of broad specificity. Neither plasma cell nor pre-B-cell members of these related clones were increased in frequency. Anti- idiotype antibodies or helper T cells reactive with myeloma-related idiotypes could be responsible for this phenomenon. We discuss other implications of these findings and speculate that all of the various phenotypes of B-lineage malignancies may result from oncogenic processes affecting stem cell targets...|$|R
40|$|A wide {{idiotype}} cross-reactivity {{was observed}} among six groups of monoclonal antibodies specific for arsonate and nitrophenyl haptens, hemagglutinin of PR 8 and X 31 influenza viruses, dextran, A 48 -idiotype, {{and a set}} of six monoclonal antibodies with unknown antigenic specificity. All of these antibodies are encoded by heavy-chain variable region (VH) genes belonging to the J 558 VH family. This idiotypic cross-reactivity was determined by studying the binding of these antibodies to a panel of six monoclonal <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies,</b> each one raised against a member of the six groups of monoclonal antibodies. The administration at birth of two such monoclonal <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> induced a long-lasting suppression not only of the corresponding idiotype but also of VH-related idiotypes with different antigenic specificities. These results suggest that the idiotypes encoded by VH genes that belong to the same VH gene family are interactive one with another. The possible physiological consequences of this immunochemical cross-reactivity are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Antibody molecules, {{besides being}} able to bind {{relevant}} antigenic determinants, can also function as immunogens. Antiantibodies can thus be produced against various parts of an antibody molecule. Antibodies directed at the antigen-binding sites or other unique parts of the variable area of the antibody molecule are called <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> (1). Such <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> are regularly produced by F 1 hybrid animals injected with alloantibodies raised in one parental strain against the other parent (2, 3). Proof {{that it is the}} F 1 hybrid which elaborates such antialloantibodies comes from an analysis of their allotype characteristics (4), the kinetics of their synthesis (5), {{and the fact that they}} are they are induced by determinants on the Fab portion of alloantibodies (6). Originally, antialloantibodies were detected by their effect on recognition of alloantigens by immunocompetent cells, which was specifically inhibited in certain in vitro systems (2), although not in others (7). Tests developed later ineluded binding of radiolabeled antialloantibody (3) and gel precipitation (8) ...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{specific}} antibodies (affinity-purified or hybridoma) directed against cell surface immunoglobulins on normal or neoplastic murine B lymphocytes were covalently coupled to the A chain {{of the plant}} toxin ricin. Such conjugates containing antibodies specific for IgM, for {{either of the two}} allotypes of IgD, or for the idiotype of the B cell tumor BCL 1 rapidly bound in vitro to cells expressing the corresponding surface antigen and inhibited protein synthesis in such cells. The results demonstrate that A chain-coupled <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> may be useful as a tumor-specific cytotoxic agent...|$|E
40|$|Peptide ligands for the antigen {{binding site}} of the surface {{immunoglobulin}} receptor of a human B-cell lymphoma cell line were identified {{with the use of}} filamentous phage libraries displaying random 8 - and 12 -amino acid peptides. Corresponding synthetic peptides bound specifically to the {{antigen binding site}} of this immunoglobulin receptor and blocked the binding of an <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody.</b> The ligands, when conjugated to form dimers or tetramers, induced cell death by apoptosis in vitro with an IC 50 between 40 and 200 nM. This effect was associated with specific stimulation of intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation...|$|E
40|$|In {{limiting}} dilution analysis, {{the absolute}} frequencies of lipopolysaccharide-reactive B cell precursors producing anti- trinitrophenyl antibodies or the MOPC 460 idiotype were studied in BALB/c mice, either normal, or immunized with antigen (Ab 1), the idiotype (Ab 2), or a monoclonal <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> (Ab 3). Anti- idiotype immunity {{results in the}} suppression of the B cell precursors for the relevant idiotype, and anti-(anti-idiotype) immunity leads to a 10 -fold increase in precursor B cell frequencies, with a comparatively lower increase in antibody-producing precursors. The findings can only be explained by variations in the composition of the B cell compartment in the various immune states...|$|E
40|$|It is {{possible}} to produce antibodies against the antigen-combining site of an antibody or its immediate vicinity. Such <b>antibodies</b> are called <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> (1). <b>Anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> are regularly produced by F 1 hybrid animals incoulated with alloantibodies raised {{in one of the}} parental strains against the other parent (2, 3). The fact that these anfialloantibodies are indeed made by the F 1 hybrid is indicated by their allotype (4) and the kinetics of their production (5). Such antialloantibodies have been shown to inhibit the specific in vitro recognition of immnnocompetent parental cells of the relevant alloantigen in some systems (2) but not in others (6). Recently, there has also been accumulating evidence that such anfialloantisera can exert specific inhibitory activity in vivo as expressed by the selective inhibition of graft-v. -host (GvH) 1 reactions of parental cells in F 1 hybrid recipient (7). In view of the latter finding implicating a specific effect on T cells, we have studied the distribution on normal B and T lymphocytes of idiotypic receptors for alloantigens...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} isotypic and {{structural}} requirements involved in signaling through the immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor on B lymphocytes, we established {{a panel of}} T 15 idiotype-positive transfectants that expressed wild-type IgM, wild-type IgD, or hybrid IgM molecules. Growth inhibition of the transfected lymphoma cells in response to <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{was used to measure}} signaling. Hybrid IgM molecules were constructed so that the membrane-spanning region of the mu heavy chain was replaced by that of delta, gamma 2 b, or alpha heavy chains or that of the I-Ab class II (Ia) alpha chain. All transfectants that expressed IgM or hybrid IgM molecules with membrane-spanning regions from another Ig isotype underwent signaling in response to <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies,</b> whereas the IgM-Ia hybrid transfectants did not. Transfectants that expressed wild-type IgD molecules also underwent signaling, although this response was particularly sensitive to serum concentrations. These results imply that signaling occurs in a similar manner through heavy-chain receptors of any isotype and suggest that conserved amino acid sequences in the transmembrane regions are important in this process...|$|R
40|$|Thy- 1, {{a member}} of the {{immunoglobulin}} superfamily, {{is one of the most}} abundant glycoproteins on mammalian neurons. Nevertheless, its role in the peripheral or central nervous system is poorly understood. Certain monoclonal antibodies to Thy- 1 promote neurite outgrowth by rodent central nervous system neurons in vitro, suggesting that Thy- 1 functions, in part, by modulating neurite outgrowth. We describe a binding site for Thy- 1 on astrocytes. This Thy- 1 -binding protein has been characterized by immunofluroesence with specific <b>anti-idiotype</b> monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> and by three competitive binding assays using (i) <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies,</b> (ii) purified Thy- 1, and (iii) Thy- 1 -transfected cells.

40|$|Active {{immunotherapy}} is {{an interesting}} field from the industry’s perspective {{and in the last}} years, regulatory agencies and the medical community have showed renewed expectations and interest in cancer vaccines. The development of new immune therapies offers many challenges, and this is reflected in the small number of phase III trials showing clear benefits. Traditional concepts applied in clinical trials for the development of chemotherapeutic agents may be inadequate for immunotherapies and a new paradigm is emerging. It is possible that organized efforts and funding will accelerate the development of therapeutically effective cancer vaccines. This article reviews the attributes of cancer vaccines which make them attractive from the industry&# 180;s perspective, and focuses especially in the characteristics of Racotumomab, an <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Cell surface receptors for the 86 -kDa {{glycoprotein}} (gp 86) {{of human}} cytomegalovirus (HCMV) {{were identified by}} using two monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies that bear the internal image of gp 86. These antibodies bound to cells permissive for HCMV infection by both ELISA and immunofluorescence assay and inhibited HCMV plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) cells. Immunoblot analysis showed specific binding of both internal image anti-idiotype antibodies as well as gp 86 to an HEL cell membrane protein with an approximate molecular mass of 92. 5 kDa. In addition, immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled membrane and cell surface proteins from human foreskin tissue, human foreskin fibroblasts, or HEL cells showed specific binding of <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> predominantly to the 92. 5 -kDa protein...|$|E
25|$|Idiotype Cross-Reaction – Idiotypes are {{antigenic}} epitopes {{found in}} the antigen-binding portion (Fab) of the immunoglobulin molecule.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for using mini-Marbrook chambers for culturing spleen cells together with <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> (anti-Id) to induce {{the appearance of}} suppressor T cells (Ts). Spleen cells that have been cultured with affinity prepared anti-Id (IgG) but not those cultured with normal IgG, suppress a secondary IgE response to timothy grass pollen antigen B (AgB) when injected intravenously into AGB-primed and boosted syngeneic recipient mice. Suppressor T cells are not induced if the spleen cells cultured with anti-Id are depleted of B cells of if the cells are cultured with the F(ab) 2 fragment of anti-Id: both of these results are compatible with Fc+ cells {{playing a role in}} the induction of Ts cells by anti-Id.

40|$|A {{young man}} with a long history of {{abnormal}} bleeding was seen in January 1985. Coagulation tests showed dysfibrinogenemia and an antifibrinogen autoantibody was demonstrable in his serum. This antibody, when purified, was capable of inhibiting the polymerization of normal fibrin monomers, apparently through binding to the alpha fibrinogen chain. 6 mo later the patient was asymptomatic, coagulation tests were normal, and the antifibrinogen autoantibody was barely detectable. At this time, affinity-purified autologous and rabbit antifibrinogen antibodies were capable of absorbing an IgG kappa antibody from the patient's serum, which reacted indistinctly with both autologous and xenogeneic antifibrinogen antibodies in enzyme immunoassays. It has been concluded that the patient's dysfibrinogenemia was the result of an antifibrinogen autoantibody, and that later on an <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody,</b> which binds an interspecies cross-reactive idiotype expressed on anti-human fibrinogen antibodies, inhibited the production of the antifibrinogen autoantibody which led to the remission of the disorder...|$|E

BALB/c mice immunized with these human Ab 2 produced anti-Ab 2 antibodies that were also reactive with the CEA epitope recognized by NP- 4.

Mice immunized with Ab 2 produced anti-Ab 2 (Ab 3) that was both antigen and idiotype specific with regard to Ab 1. We conclude that the Ab 2 antibodies mimicked a neutralizing epitope and acted as a network antigen for inducing a specific anti-human cytomegalovirus antibody response in this experimental system...|$|R
40|$|The {{migration}} pattern of lymphocytes labelled with indium- 111 was followed {{in a patient}} with B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with a murine monoclonal <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody.</b> During the early phase of continuous infusion of antibody rapid fluxes of labelled lymphocytes {{into and out of}} the blood were seen. Dynamic scanning showed immediate uptake in the lungs; thereafter activity decreased in the lungs and increased in the liver. Studies of labelled and unlabelled cells in the circulation showed that treatment resulted in the removal of lymphocytes from the blood which was repopulated from an extravascular compartment. Tumour cells were shown to be cleared from the blood by the reticuloendothelial system in the liver. Indium- 111 should be used circumspectly because it may cause chromosomal damage in labelled cells, but it is clearly useful as a radiolabel for following the migration pathways of lymphocytes in vivo...|$|E

The binding of NS 7 to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the phenylalanine hydroxylase sequence from residue 263 to residue 289 was blocked by the competitive inhibitor of phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme activity, 7, 8 -dihydro- 6, 7 -dimethylpterin. In addition this peptide competed with native phenylalanine hydroxylase for binding to 6, 7 -dimethyl- 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydropterin conjugated to a polyglutamate carrier. Application of this simple and direct approach to other enzymes is likely to greatly facilitate the identification of ligand binding sites on enzymes, which will significantly contribute to the understanding of enzyme structure-function relationships...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{production}} of protein-based tumor-specific vaccines {{for the treatment}} of malignancies is possible with the plant-based transient expression system described here. We created a modified tobamoviral vector that encodes the idiotype-specific single-chain Fv fragment (scFv) of the immunoglobulin from the 38 C 13 mouse B cell lymphoma. Infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants contain high levels of secreted scFv protein in the extracellular compartment. This material reacts with an <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> by Western blotting, ELISA, and affinity chromatography, suggesting that the plant-produced 38 C 13 scFv protein is properly folded in solution. Mice vaccinated with the affinity-purified 38 C 13 scFv generate > 10 μg/ml anti-idiotype immunoglobulins. These mice were protected from challenge by a lethal dose of the syngeneic 38 C 13 tumor, similar to mice immunized with the native 38 C 13 IgM-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate vaccine.

The possibility that idiotype-specific suppressor cells may be generated during the culture period was examined by coculturing the cells with untreated syngeneic spleen cells. Cells that had been preincubated with anti-T 15 idiotype (anti- T 15 id) antibodies and a PC-containing antigen, R 36 a for 3 d, were capable of specifically suppressing the anti-PC response of fresh normal spleen cells, indicating that idiotype-specific suppressor cells were generated during the culture period. The presence of specific antigen also appeared to be necessary because anti-T 15 id antibodies and a control antigen, DNP-Lys-Ficoll, were not capable of generating such suppressor cells. Suppressor cells were induced only in the population of spleen cells nonadherent to nylon wool and the suppressive activity was abrogated by treatment with anti-Thy 1. 2 serum and complement. These results indicate that <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> and specific antigen can generate idiotype-specific suppressor T cells in vitro.
