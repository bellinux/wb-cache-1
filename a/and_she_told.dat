5|$|The Philistines were infuriated by the riddle. The thirty groomsmen told Samson's {{new wife}} {{that they would}} burn her and her father's {{household}} {{if she did not}} discover the answer to the riddle and tell it to them. At the urgent and tearful imploring of his bride, Samson told her the solution, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> it to the thirty groomsmen.|$|E

25|$|Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met {{two days}} after the murder with family members {{representing}} Sarowar and Runi, along with their son, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> them that she would see to it that their son would educated {{and there would be no}} impunity in the couple's case and justice would be quick. The Prime Minister later criticised journalists for carrying out demonstrations and at other times praised them for raising awareness. In a widely repeated quote in connection with the case, she said the government could not protect everyone by posting a guard outside their bedrooms. She also told party members that more journalists were killed when her political opponents were in power.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Florence {{attempted}} to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that watched for sharks and {{were prepared to}} help her if she got hurt or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> her mother, who {{was in one of}} the boats, that she did not think she could make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As she sat in the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E
25|$|Naaman, the {{commander}} of the army of the king of Aram, was a great warrior, but he was a leper. The girl who waited on Naaman's wife was an Israelite whom the Arameans had taken captive, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Naaman's wife that if Naaman went to Elisha in Samaria, then Elisha would cure Naaman of his leprosy. Naaman told his lord the king of Aram what the girl said, and the king of Aram sent Naaman on his way with a letter to the king of Israel. Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothes. Naaman brought the king of Israel the letter, which asked the king of Israel to cure Naaman of his leprosy. When the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and complained that he was not God with power over life and death, but the king of Aram must have been seeking some pretext to attack Israel.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked {{where he was going}} (fourth apparition); Juan Diego {{explained}} what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked, “¿No estoy yo aquí que soy tu madre?” (Am I not here, I who am your mother?). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him to gather flowers from the top of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in December. Juan followed her instructions and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there. The Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan's tilma, or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak before archbishop Zumárraga on December 12, the flowers fell to the floor, and on the fabric was the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Stefan (Nikitin) was {{a medical}} doctor and this {{assisted}} his survival in the concentration camps through work as a camp doctor. He often allowed the overworked and underfed prisoners {{to be allowed to}} stay in hospital to recuperate. The camp authorities became aware of this and warned him that a new trial was probably awaiting him that would have a possible maximum sentence of fifteen years for wrecking Soviet industrial effort by taking workers from their jobs. The bishop was told by a nurse of a woman named Matrionushka in the Volga city of Penza who he should ask to pray for him, and he was told that Matrionushka did not need a letter because she could hear him if he asked for her help. He shouted for her help, and the threatened trial did not happen, and he was released several weeks later. He moved to Penza in order to find Matrionushka. When he met her, she supposedly knew intimate details about him and that he had asked for her help, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him that he had prayed to the Lord for him. She was soon arrested, however, and transported to a Moscow prison where she died.|$|E

500|$|The next {{opportunity}} for Rodin in America was the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Hallowell {{wanted to help}} promote Rodin's work and he suggested a solo exhibition, which she wrote him was beaucoup moins beau que l'original but impossible, outside the rules. [...] Instead, she suggested he send a number of works for her loan exhibition of French art from American collections <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him she would list them as being part of an American collection. Rodin sent Hallowell three works, Cupid and Psyche, Sphinx and Andromeda. [...] All nudes, these works provoked great controversy and were ultimately hidden behind a drape with special permission given for viewers to see them.|$|E
500|$|Lessing {{dedicated}} Shikasta to her father. While she {{was still}} a child in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) he often used to gaze up at the night sky and say, [...] "Makes you think – there are so many worlds up there, wouldn't really matter if we did blow ourselves up – plenty more where we came from." [...] Shikasta gave rise to a religious cult in America. Lessing {{said in an interview that}} its followers had written to her and asked, [...] "When are we going to be visited by the gods?", <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> them that the book is [...] "not a cosmology. It's an invention", and they replied, [...] "Ah, you're just testing us".|$|E
500|$|Sebastian Coe was {{instrumental}} in asking the Queen to take part, responding positively when Boyle first pitched the Happy and Glorious film sequence featuring the Queen. [...] Boyle suggested that the Queen be played either a lookalike, or by a world-class actress such as Helen Mirren, in a location to double as Buckingham Palace. [...] Coe asked Princess Anne, a British member of the IOC and LOCOG, what she thought, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him to ask the Queen. [...] Coe presented the idea to the Queen's Deputy Private Secretary. [...] Boyle was {{surprised to hear that}} the Queen would be happy to play herself, and wanted a speaking part. Filming took place in late March 2012, and Happy and Glorious was produced by the BBC, as was the opening film sequence Journey along the Thames.|$|E

500|$|In April 2011, a TV Week {{columnist}} {{reported that}} Mark {{would have a}} one-night stand with Kate's best friend, Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita). At the same time, Mark also became involved in a police corruption storyline, after he reported Constable Wes Holland (Daniel Hamill), for taking bribes. McGregor told an Inside Soap writer, [...] "Mark's life has been turned upside down since he blew the whistle on Constable Holland", adding that he was now being treated like he did the wrong thing. When Mark went to Charlie's to escape his troubles at the police station, he met up with Jade. They kissed as Jade became [...] "the perfect distraction" [...] for him. An Inside Soap reporter observed {{that of all the}} women Mark could have sought comfort in, Jade seemed the most unlikely as there was tension between them. Jade believed Mark had sided with Toadie against her sister <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Kate not to give him a second chance.|$|E
500|$|Axton and Durden give {{different}} {{accounts of}} how the song was written. Durden's account is that he had already written the song and performed it with his band the Swing Billys before he presented it to Axton. Axton's account is that Durden had only written a few lines of the song {{and asked her to}} help him finish it. She says that the report of the suicide [...] "stunned" [...] her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Durden, [...] "Everybody in the world has someone who cares. Let's put a Heartbreak Hotel {{at the end of this}} lonely street". They were interrupted by the arrival of Glenn Reeves, a local performer who had previously worked with Axton. The duo asked Reeves to help with the song, but after hearing the title he remarked that it was [...] "the silliest thing I've ever heard", and left them to finish it themselves. The song was written within an hour, and Durden recorded it onto Axton's tape recorder. Reeves returned, and after hearing the song he was asked to provide a voice demo for Axton in the style of Elvis Presley. Reeves obliged, but once again turned down the offer of a writing credit for his input.|$|E
500|$|In the pulpit, Wilson {{was said}} to have a voice that was harsh and indistinct and his {{demeanor}} was directed at strict discipline, but he had a penchant for rhymes, and would frequently engage in word play. [...] He was unpopular during his early days of preaching in Boston, partly attributable to his strictness in teaching, and partly from his violent and arbitrary manner. [...] His gruff style was further highlighted by the mild qualities of John Cotton, with whom he shared the church's ministry. [...] When Wilson returned to Boston in 1635, Hutchinson was exposed to his teaching for the first time, and immediately saw a big difference between her own doctrines and his. [...] She found his emphasis on morality, and his doctrine of [...] "evidencing justification by sanctification" [...] (a covenant of works) to be repugnant, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> her followers that Wilson lacked [...] "the seal of the Spirit." [...] Wilson's doctrines were shared with all of the other ministers in the colony, except for Cotton, and the Boston congregation had grown accustomed to Cotton's lack of emphasis on preparation [...] "in favor of stressing the inevitability of God's will." [...] The positions of Cotton and Wilson were matters of emphasis, and neither minister believed that works could help to save a person. [...] It is likely that most members of the Boston church could not see much difference between the doctrines of the two men, but the astute Hutchinson could, prompting her to criticize Wilson at her home gatherings. [...] Probably in early 1636 he became aware of divisions within his own Boston congregation, and soon came to realize that Hutchinson's views were widely divergent from those of the orthodox clergy in the colony.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{incident}} in 429 showed Qifu Mumo's harshness. [...] His mother had, during Qifu Chipan's reign, been accidentally injured by slingshots fired by Qifu Chipan's official Xin Jin (辛進), while Xin was attending Qifu Chipan on a hunt. [...] The injury disfigured her face. [...] In 429, Qifu Mumo asked his mother {{how she got}} injured, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him.
