40|$|Background: The {{past decade}} has seen the {{emergence}} of several molecular tools that render possible modification of cellular functions through accurate and easy addition, removal, or exchange of genomic DNA sequences. Among these technologies, transcription activator-like effectors (TALE) {{has turned out to}} be one of the most versatile and incredibly robust platform for generating targeted molecular tools as demonstrated by fusion to various domains such as transcription activator, repressor and nucleases. Results: In this study, we generated a novel nuclease architecture based on the transcription activator-like effector scaffold. In contrast to the existing Tail to Tail (TtT) and head to Head (HtH) nuclease architectures based on the symmetrical association of two TALE DNA binding domains fused to the C-terminal (TtT) or N-terminal (HtH) end of FokI, this novel architecture consists of the <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>association</b> of two different engineered TALE DNA binding domains fused to the N- and C-terminal ends of FokI (TALE:: FokI and FokI:: TALE scaffolds respectively). The characterization of this novel Tail to Head (TtH) architecture in yeast enabled us to demonstrate its nuclease activity and define its optimal target configuration. We further showed that this architecture was able to promote substantial level of targeted mutagenesis at three endogenous loci present in two different mammalian cell lines. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that this novel functional TtH architecture which requires binding to only one DNA strand of a given endogenous locus has the potential to extend the targeting possibility of FokI-based TALE nucleases...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} explores how geo-political power {{structures}} influence and/or determine the conception, acceptance {{and maintenance of}} what {{is considered to be}} valid archaeological knowledge. The nature of this contingency is exemplified through an examination of how the prehistory of Norrland, a region traditionally considered and portrayed as peripheral vis-à-vis the centre-South, was interpreted and presented by Swedish archaeologists during the 20 th century. This contextual situation is analysed through the implementation of three interrelated and complimentary perspectives; 1) The relationship between northern and southern Sweden is examined using concepts concerning the nature of colonialism, resulting in the formulation of 20 particulars that typify the colonial experience, circumstances that characterise the historical, and unequal, association that has existed between these two regions for the last 600 years. 2) Ideals of national identity and heritage as manufactured and employed by the kingdom and later by the nation-state, with the assistance of antiquarianism, archaeology and/or centralised cultural management, are outlined. The creation of these various concepts have reinforced and perpetuated the colonial and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>association</b> between what has naturally come to be viewed as the peripheral-North and the centre-South. 3) A century of archaeological research into the Norrlandian past is studied using the concepts ‘thoughtstyle’ and ‘thought-collective’ as devised by Ludwik Fleck. This analysis disclosed a persistent set of reoccurring explanations that have constantly been invoked when interpreting and presenting the prehistory of Norrland. This archaeological thought-style has normalised the unbalanced power relationship between North and South that has existed for the last 600 years by projecting it far back into the prehistoric past. This case study has demonstrated that archaeologists, unless acutely aware of the historical context in which they themselves move and work, risk legitimising debilitating economic and political power relationships in the present through their study and presentation of the past...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} to derive event relevance from event ontology constructed with Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a mathematical approach to data analysis and knowledge representation. The ontology is built from a set of relevant documents {{and according to the}} named entities associated to the events. Various relevance measures are explored, from binary to scaled, and from symmetrical to <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>associations.</b> We then apply the derived event relevance to the task of multi-document summarization. The experiments on DUC 2004 data set show that the relevant-event-based approaches outperform the independent-event-based approach. ...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePreliminary {{normalization}} {{is needed}} for probabilistic pairwise comparison between attributes in Data Mining. Normalization plays {{a very important part}} in preserving the discriminant property of the probability scale when the observation number becomes large. <b>Asymmetrical</b> <b>associations</b> between boolean attributes are considered in our paper. Its goal consists of comparison between two approaches. The first one is due to a normalized version of the "Likelihood Linkage Analysis" methodology. The second one is based on the notion of "Test Value" defined with respect to a hypothetical sample, sized 100 and summarizing the initial observed sample. Two facets are developed in our work: theoretical and experimental. A comparative experimental analysis is presented with the well known databases "Wages" and "Abalone"...|$|R
40|$|Many {{cognitive}} and motor functions are enabled by the temporal representation and processing of stimuli, {{but it remains}} an open issue how neocortical microcircuits can reliably encode and replay such sequences of information. To better understand this, a modular attractor memory network is proposed in which meta-stable sequential attractor transitions are learned through changes to synaptic weights and intrinsic excitabilities via the spike-based Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) learning rule. We find that the formation of distributed memories, embodied by increased periods of firing in pools of excitatory neurons, together with <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>associations</b> between these distinct network states, can be acquired through plasticity. The model's feasibility is demonstrated using simulations of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model neurons (AdEx). We show that the learning and speed of sequence replay depends on a confluence of biophysically relevant parameters including stimulus duration, level of background noise, ratio of synaptic currents, and strengths of short-term depression and adaptation. Moreover, sequence elements are shown to flexibly participate multiple times in the sequence, suggesting that spiking attractor networks of this type can support an efficient combinatorial code. The model provides a principled approach towards understanding how multiple interacting plasticity mechanisms can coordinate hetero-associative learning in unison...|$|R
40|$|Outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, {{including}} cholera, {{are related}} to floods and droughts in regions where water and sanitation infrastructure are inadequate or insufficient. However, availability of data on water scarcity and abundance in transnational basins, are a prerequisite for developing cholera forecasting systems. With {{more than a decade}} of terrestrial water storage (TWS) data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, conditions favorable for predicting cholera occurrence may now be determined. We explored lead–lag relationships between TWS in the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna basin and endemic cholera in Bangladesh. Since bimodal seasonal peaks in cholera in Bangladesh occur during spring and autumn seasons, two separate logistical models between TWS and disease time series (2002 – 2010) were developed. TWS representing water availability showed an <b>asymmetrical,</b> strong <b>association</b> with cholera prevalence in the spring (τ = − 0. 53; P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and autumn (τ = 0. 45; P 3 ̆c 0. 001) up to 6 months in advance. One unit (centimeter of water) decrease in water availability in the basin increased odds of above normal cholera by 24...|$|R
40|$|G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{respond to}} {{external}} stimuli by activating heterotrimeric G proteins inside the cell. There is increasing evidence that many GPCRs exist as dimers or higher oligomers, but the biochemical nature of such dimers and what roles they have, if any, in signal transduction remains unclear. We conducted a {{comprehensive study of}} dimerization of the 5 HT 2 c serotonin receptor using disulphide-trapping experiments. We found a dimer interface between transmembrane (TM) helices IV and V that is markedly sensitive {{to the state of}} receptor activation. This dimer seems to be quasisymmetrical in interfacial geometry and <b>asymmetrical</b> in its <b>association</b> with its cognate Gα protein. We also found a second interface at TM I helices, which is insensitive to the state of activation...|$|R
