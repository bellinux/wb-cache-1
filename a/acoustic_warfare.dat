5000|$|The ULQ-6 {{deception}} transmitter {{was one of}} {{the earlier}} shipboard ECM installations. [...] The Raytheon SLQ-32 shipboard ECM package came in three versions providing warning, identification and bearing information about radar-guided cruise missiles. [...] The SLQ-32 V3 included quick reaction electronic countermeasures for cruisers and large amphibious ships and auxiliaries in addition to the RBOC (Rapid Blooming Off-board Chaff) launchers found on most surface ships. [...] The BLR-14 Submarine <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Warfare</b> System (or SAWS) provides an integrated receiver, processor, display, and countermeasures launch system for submarines.|$|E
50|$|NSWC PCD conducts {{research}} on littoral warfare and its disciplines include optics, <b>acoustics,</b> mine <b>warfare</b> and robotics. NSWC PCD employs approximately 1,100 {{scientists and engineers}} within NSWC PCD. The newest facility on the base is the Littoral Warfare Research Facility, a $10 million research and development facility dedicated to littoral warfare research; it was completed in 2006.|$|R
50|$|Realizing the {{potential}} of these applications of acoustics to hydrographic surveying and navigation, particularly along the United States West Coast, where fog frequently interfered with attempts to fix ship positions accurately, Ernest Lester Jones (1876-1929), then Director of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, in consultation with United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officers, decided to investigate the use of acoustics in both depth finding and navigation. Nicholas H. Heck (1882-1953), a Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officer, had been assigned from 1917 to 1919 to World War I service with the United States Naval Reserve Force, during which he had researched the use of underwater <b>acoustics</b> in antisubmarine <b>warfare.</b> He was the obvious choice to lead the new effort.|$|R
25|$|Since {{most ancient}} Roman sources {{are based on}} bellicose {{encounters}} with the Celtic chiefdoms, the carnyx is today mostly seen as an instrument used during warfare, as Polybius e.g. reports for the battle of Telemon, Gallia Cisalpina, in 225 BC, where the Gauls used the instrument together with other brass instruments to frighten the Roman enemy. The limitation to <b>acoustic</b> or psychological <b>warfare</b> is however erroneous. Brass instruments were regularly used {{as a means of}} communication during battle, relaying orders for troop positioning, movement and tactics, also by the Gauls. Other sources confirm that the Gauls kept their military order even in situations of military mishaps. The musicians of their army camps played their horns to ensure a cohesive and controlled retreat. After the victory of Marius near Vercellae, his Roman rival Catulus Caesar reserved a Cimbrian signaling horn from the loot for himself. Music, musicians and instruments were strategically important elements for the Roman and Celtic armies alike.|$|R
5000|$|In 1930, {{before leaving}} Norway, Zachariasen married Ragni Durban-Hansen, granddaughter of the {{geologist}} W. C. Br√∏gger. The Zachariasens had two children, Fredrik and Ellen. As a couple, the Zachariasens were close friends {{with four other}} couples consisting of four male physicists and their wives. The four physicists were: Samuel Allison, Elmer Dershem (1881-1965), Marcel Schein, and John Harry Williams (1908-1966). Allison, Williams, and Zachariasen took a number of canoeing vacations together, sometimes accompanied by Rudolph [...] "Buddy" [...] Thorness (1909-1969) and perhaps one or two other men. In 1974, Zachariasen retired from the University of Chicago and moved with his wife to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where they purchased the first house they ever owned. He continued to write scientific papers, often working with his friends Finley H. Ellinger and Robert A. Penneman, both from Los Alamos National Laboratory. Zachariasen also worked with Bernd Matthias, {{a professor at the}} University of California, San Diego. Zachariasen's son, Fredrik [...] "Zach" [...] Zachariasen (1931-1999), was a theoretical physicist, specializing in the interactions of elementary particles at high energies. Fredrik Zachariasen was a physics professor at Caltech and coauthored two books on high energy physics and another book related to the <b>acoustics</b> of antisubmarine <b>warfare.</b>|$|R
