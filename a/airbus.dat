5|$|<b>Airbus</b> Innovations is the {{initiator}} of the project, providing CAD {{models of}} the <b>Airbus</b> A320 and developing operating scenarios.|$|E
5|$|<b>Airbus</b> {{has started}} {{design of a}} {{replacement}} aircraft for the Beluga in November 2014: the Beluga XL based on the <b>Airbus</b> A330.|$|E
5|$|Airbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned {{as part of}} {{a diverse}} family of {{commercial}} aircraft. In pursuit of this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, <b>Airbus</b> identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range <b>Airbus</b> A310. <b>Airbus</b> then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the <b>Airbus</b> A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital fly-by-wire controls. During these studies <b>Airbus</b> turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong Airlines’ growing network {{currently}} covers over 30 cities regionally, including Auckland, Gold Coast, Shanghai, Sanya, Bangkok, Bali, Tokyo, Sapporo, Beijing, Colombo, Vancouver, and Los Angeles.. The airline has {{a combined}} fleet of 35 aircraft. The current passenger fleet has 31 aircraft, which includes one <b>Airbus</b> A350-900, ten <b>Airbus</b> A330-300s, nine <b>Airbus</b> A330-200s and eleven A320s, with inflight entertainment system {{and an average}} age of around 5.0 years as of September 2017. The cargo fleet consists of four <b>Airbus</b> A330-200Fs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Airbus</b> A320 {{family are}} narrow-body (single-aisle) {{aircraft}} with a retractable {{tricycle landing gear}} and are powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. The <b>Airbus</b> A320 family is the only narrow-body aircraft from <b>Airbus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The airline was {{the launch}} {{customer}} for the <b>Airbus</b> A300-600F General Freighter, {{which was the}} new variant of the <b>Airbus</b> A300-600F.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Airbus</b> {{designed}} the <b>Airbus</b> A300 {{during the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against Boeing and Douglas, two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, <b>Airbus</b> had begun studies into derivatives of the <b>Airbus</b> A300B {{in support of this}} long-term goal. Prior to the service introduction of the first <b>Airbus</b> airliners, engineers within <b>Airbus</b> had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9. A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10. It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range <b>Airbus</b> A310. <b>Airbus</b> then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.|$|E
5|$|With {{launch of}} <b>Airbus</b> A330neo, the {{existing}} {{members of the}} <b>Airbus</b> A330 family (A330-200, 200F, 300, and MRTT) received the <b>Airbus</b> A330ceo ("current engine option") name.|$|E
5|$|After Biman {{became a}} public limited company, renewed {{attempts}} were made to procure new-generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet. In November 2007, Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777-200s (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft on lease for the interim period beginning in 2009. The average price of these aircraft was quoted as million. <b>Airbus</b> also made an offer to supply four <b>Airbus</b> A320 or <b>Airbus</b> A330 series aircraft at a much lower price than that of Boeing. To manage the fleet in the short run, Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase/dry lease with options to purchase two used <b>Airbus</b> A310-300 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|As of September 2017, <b>Airbus</b> had {{delivered}} 38 aircraft with four unfilled orders. The list price is $237million. As well as new-build freighters, <b>Airbus</b> has proposed passenger-to-freighter conversions of existing −200 airliners. The A330-200F is sized between the 767-300F and 777F, but trails both Boeing models in orders and deliveries.|$|E
5|$|During the A320 {{development}} programme, <b>Airbus</b> considered propfan technology, {{backed by}} Lufthansa. At the time unproven, it {{was essentially a}} fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering speed of a turbofan at turboprops economics; eventually, <b>Airbus</b> stuck with turbofans.|$|E
5|$|EVA Air {{operates}} a mixed fleet of <b>Airbus</b> and Boeing aircraft, with <b>Airbus</b> A330, <b>Airbus</b> A321, and Boeing 777 airliners primarily used on passenger routes, along with Boeing 747-400 and Boeing 777 freighter aircraft used on cargo routes. The airline {{was one of}} the first carriers to introduce the Premium Economy class (called Elite Class in EVA Air), which it debuted in 1991. Elite Class is onboard on Boeing 777.|$|E
5|$|Final {{assembly}} for the A321 would be, as a {{first for}} any <b>Airbus,</b> carried out in Germany (then West Germany). This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditure associated with the new plant, and the Germans, arguing {{it would be more}} productive for <b>Airbus</b> in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller <b>Airbus</b> A319 and A318. For the first time, <b>Airbus</b> entered the bond market, through which it raised $480million (€475 million) to finance development costs. An additional $180million (€175 million) was borrowed from European Investment Bank and private investors.|$|E
5|$|Since 2012, Finland's airline Finnair {{has been}} flying an <b>Airbus</b> A340-300 to its Asia {{destinations}} sporting a blue Unikko print, while an <b>Airbus</b> A330 painted in an Anniversary Unikko has been serving its other intercontinental routes.|$|E
5|$|The Toulouse Blagnac final {{assembly}} line builds A320s, whereas the Hamburg Finkenwerder {{final assembly}} line builds A318s, A319s, and A321s. The <b>Airbus</b> factory in Tianjin, China assembles A319s, A320s, and A321s; A320s and A321s are also assembled at the <b>Airbus</b> Americas factory in Mobile, Alabama. <b>Airbus</b> produced 42 A320 per month in 2015, and expects to increase to 50 per month in 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{competing}} <b>Airbus</b> is the A330-300.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>Airbus</b> A319 {{arrived in}} Bhutan on 19 October 2004; the date chosen after a Buddhist astrologer was {{consulted}} {{to ensure the}} aircraft arrived in Bhutan on an auspicious day in the Buddhist calendar. Before entering service on commercial flights on 31 October 2004, Drukair took their A319 on a country-wide flight in honour of the ascencion of Crown Prince Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck to the Chhoetse Penlop. The second aircraft was delivered by <b>Airbus</b> to Drukair in December 2004. On 31 August 2012, Druk Air took delivery of a third <b>Airbus</b> A319.|$|E

5|$|A new {{programme}} {{was initiated}} subsequently, called Joint European Transport (JET). This {{was set up}} in June 1977, and was based at the then British Aerospace (formerly Vickers) site in Weybridge, Surrey, UK. Although the members were all of Airbus' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from <b>Airbus.</b> This project was considered the forerunner of <b>Airbus</b> A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two CFM56s. It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0.84 (faster than Boeing 737). The programme was later transferred to <b>Airbus,</b> leading up {{to the creation of the}} Single-Aisle (SA) studies in 1980, led by former leader of JET programme, Derek Brown. The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called SA1, SA2 and SA3. Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively. The single-aisle programme created divisions within <b>Airbus</b> about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the West Germans, particularly Lufthansa. However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet.|$|E
5|$|A {{programme}} {{to convert}} A320 and A321 aircraft into freighters {{was set up}} by <b>Airbus</b> Freighter Conversion GmbH. Airframes would be converted by EADS EFW in Dresden, Germany, and Zhukovsky, Russia. The launch customer AerCap signed a firm contract on 16 July 2008 to convert 30 of AerCap's passenger A320/A321s into A320/A321P2F (passenger to freighter). However, on 3 June 2011, <b>Airbus</b> announced all partners would end the passenger to freighter programme, citing high demand for used airframes for passenger service.|$|E

5|$|<b>Airbus</b> briefly {{considered}} the variable camber wing, {{a concept that}} requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. <b>Airbus</b> estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected.|$|E
5|$|<b>Airbus</b> {{offers an}} {{avionics}} upgrade for older A320, the In-Service Enhancement Package, {{to keep them}} updated. Digital head-up displays are available.|$|E
5|$|Allegiant Air uses MD-82/83 jet {{aircraft}} seating 130–150 people. Occasionally Allegiant operates their <b>Airbus</b> A320s to ROA.|$|E
5|$|Although final {{assembly}} of A320 family aircraft {{takes place in}} Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; Tianjin, China; and Mobile, Alabama, USA, {{final assembly}} of the <b>Airbus</b> A318 was in Hamburg, Germany. The maiden flight of the <b>Airbus</b> A318 took place from Finkenwerder airfield in Hamburg on 15 January 2002. The first customer delivery was on 22 July 2003 to Frontier Airlines.|$|E
5|$|As <b>Airbus</b> targets a 60 monthly global {{production}} rate by mid-2019, the Tianjin line delivered 51 in 2016 {{and it could}} assemble six per month from four as it starts producing A320neos in 2017; 147 <b>Airbus</b> were delivered in 2016 in China, 20% of its production, mostly A320-family, a % market share as the country should become the world’s largest market ahead of the USA before 2027.|$|E
5|$|At the Singapore Airshow in February 2016, <b>Airbus</b> Group {{presented}} Air-Cobot {{and its use}} in {{its vision}} of the hangar of the future. The same month, the Singapore government enlisted <b>Airbus</b> Group to help local maintenance, repair, and operations providers to stay competitive against neighbour countries like Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines which are cheaper. To improve productivity, <b>Airbus</b> Group launches, in October 2016, a testbed hangar where new technologies can be tested. Upon entering the hangar, cameras study the aircraft to detect damages. Mobile robots, {{such as the one}} of the Air-Cobot project, and drones, such as the one of the Aircam project, carry out more detailed inspections.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{anticipated}} efficiency gains and development work, <b>Airbus</b> {{announced that the}} new winglets will not be offered to customers, claiming that {{the weight of the}} modifications required would negate any aerodynamic benefits. Instead, on 17 December 2008, <b>Airbus</b> announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, EVA Air {{embarked}} {{on its first}} major long-haul fleet renewal. The airline {{became one of the}} launch customers for the Boeing 777-300ER, ordering four aircraft plus eight options. At the same time, the airline placed three orders for the Boeing 777-200LR. In January 2001, EVA Air ordered its first <b>Airbus</b> aircraft, the A330-200. The Boeing 777 aircraft were intended for United States and European services, while the <b>Airbus</b> A330 aircraft were intended for regional Asian routes.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, <b>Airbus</b> tested three {{styles of}} winglet {{intended}} {{to counteract the}} wing's induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by <b>Airbus</b> and was based on work done by the AWIATOR programme. The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas. Two aircraft {{were used in the}} flight test evaluation campaign– the prototype A320, which had been retained by <b>Airbus</b> for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to JetBlue.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, <b>Airbus</b> {{introduced}} a new enhanced comfort cabin for the A320. <b>Airbus</b> says it offers better luggage storage and a quieter cabin, packaged with a more modern look and feel. Additionally, improved cabin efficiency from a new galley concept, reduced weight, improved ergonomics and food hygiene, and recycling requirements. LED ambiance lighting is optionally available. Anytime LEDs are used for the Passenger Service Unit (PSU) and passengers can get information with touchscreen displays. Older A320 series aircraft can be updated.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Russia's flag carrier, Aeroflot, {{named one}} of its <b>Airbus</b> A319-112 planes after Khachaturian.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Brussels Airlines painted an <b>Airbus</b> A320-200 with {{registration}} OO-SNB in {{a special}} Tintin livery.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, <b>Airbus</b> top sales {{executive}} {{and chief operating}} officer John Leahy confirmed plans for an enlarged variant, the A380-900, with more seating space than the A380-800. This would have a seating capacity for 650 passengers in standard configuration, and approximately 900 passengers in an economy-only configuration. Airlines that had expressed an interest in the −900 included Emirates, Virgin Atlantic, Cathay Pacific, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Kingfisher Airlines, and leasing company ILFC. In May 2010, <b>Airbus</b> announced that A380-900 development was postponed, until production of the A380-800 stabilises.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, JAL ordered 31 <b>Airbus</b> A350, {{likely to}} replace its 777: 18 A350-900s for 777-200(ER)s and 13 A350-1000s for 777-300ER.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Hong Kong Airlines {{introduced}} its first <b>airbus</b> A330F cargo freighter, launched {{the first full}} cargo route from Hong Kong to Hangzhou.|$|E
