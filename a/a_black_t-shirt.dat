25|$|The video {{opens with}} a close shot of Knowles face who's wearing a similar make-up to English model Twiggy. The video then shows shots of Knowles moving her arms like a clock and wearing <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>T-shirt</b> and black trousers. Scenes similar to 1957 film Funny Face follow with Knowles looking like Audrey Hepburn. Those shots are cut {{by a variety of}} brightly colored bathing suits and a {{black-and-white}} hat, set against a constantly changing background of colors which is similar to Vogue photo shoots. Knowles' baby bump is less visible in the bathing suit scenes but is featured prominently earlier in the video. The clip cuts quickly from the bathing suit sequence to shots of Knowles in an audition space similar to the 1980 film Fame. The sequence features choreographed moves from Knowles and her back-up dancers who snap with their fingers which is a reference to 1961 musical West Side Story.|$|E

There {{she was surprised}} to see a man wearing <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>t-shirt</b> with the message [...] "I am HIV positive" [...] written in capital letters. She found it to be a bold statement and inquired about the man, {{who turned out to be}} Zackie Achmat, a South African activist, film director, and co-founder of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC). Although the singer had been associated with the 46664 campaign, being introduced to Achmat gave her an opportunity to do more for the campaign and the project.|$|E

500|$|At {{approximately}} 3:05p.m. CST, Steven Kazmierczak {{entered a}} large auditorium-style lecture hall in Cole Hall (Auditorium 101), where an oceanography class was in session with approximately 120 students present. Kazmierczak was wearing dark brown boots with laces; jeans; <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>T-shirt</b> {{with the word}} [...] "Terrorist" [...] imposed over an image of an assault rifle; a coat; a black knit hat; and a black utility belt with two magazine holsters, a holster for a handgun, three handguns (a 9×19mm Glock 19, a [...]380 ACP SIG Sauer P232, and a [...]380 ACP Hi-Point CF380), eight loaded magazines, and a knife. He also carried in a 12 gauge Remington Sportsman 48 shotgun concealed in a guitar case. He opened the auditorium door with such extreme force that many witnesses described him as [...] "kicking the door in", entering at the extreme southwest corner, near the stage {{in front of the}} classroom, [...] and began firing at the students.|$|E
500|$|The {{licensing}} arm of Paramount {{took the}} step of significantly expanding retail distribution beyond specialty stores (Hot Topic, Spencer's) to big chains (Target, J.C. Penney), which involved carefully stripping T-shirts of racy slogans {{from the television}} show. Licensing industry observers credited Comedy Central with carving out a profitable niche in an industry dominated by powerful partnerships that link fast-food chains and Hollywood movie studios, which was particularly tough for South Park, as no fast-food chains wanted to ally themselves with the show's racy content. Eventually, J.C. Penney ended the tie-ins with the show in April 1999 {{as a result of}} customer complaints. On July 7, 1999, Parker and Stone appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien to promote the film's release. During the interview, Parker and Stone showed a clip of the film in which a caricature of O'Brien, played by Brett Spiner, hands over Terrence and Phillip to the US government and jumps to his death from the set of Late Night. Upon seeing the clip, a bemused O'Brien responded that his interns saw the film and thought it was [...] "really funny", but were annoyed that the Late Night set was portrayed as {{on the top floor of}} the GE Building, when it was really on the sixth floor. The film also suffered negative publicity before release. It was initially reported that on the day of the Columbine High School massacre, a friend of the killers (Chris Morris) was seen wearing <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>T-shirt</b> depicting characters from South Park. Both Parker and Stone come from Colorado, and Stone went to Heritage High School, not far from Columbine High. He proceeded to take three days off from work following the shootings. [...] "Nothing seemed funny after that," [...] he said. South Park was, at the time, generally waning in popularity: ratings dropped nearly 40 percent with the premiere of the series' third season and, according to Entertainment Weekly, [...] "it [...] the pop-culture behemoth it was last year [...]" [...] In response to the decline, Parker commented, [...] "Suddenly we suck and we're not cool anymore. The funny thing is, last year we were saying the same things and we were hip, fresh, and cute. Now they're telling us we're pushing 30, we're failures, and we're sellouts." ...|$|E

He used a Legion flight ring to fly and later used a gold wrist guard {{designed}} by the Gadget Guru of the Hairies that was powered by the same Legion flight ring.

The £1.4 million party paid by the singer's record company Warner Bros. and Us magazine was attended by 600 select guests who received special invitations. The party invites were sent out in white leather boxes, lined with black fur. A gold necklace was inside with letters spelling out the album's title, and only those wearing the necklaces would be allowed into the club. More than a dozen strippers were in attendance to keep the party in the same theme as from the music video for [...] "Music". She sported a five-carat diamond ring Ritchie gave her for her birthday, and <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>T-shirt</b> that read [...] "Snatch Coming Soon" [...] promoting Ritchie's film, while Ritchie promoted Madonna's album wearing a T-shirt with the word Music emblazoned on it.

Madonna's then-boyfriend Guy Ritchie was initially denied access into the VIP lounge by a security guard. He apparently got into a shoving match with a bodyguard who did not know who he was.|$|E
2500|$|In his journal, Klebold {{wrote about}} his view {{that he and}} Harris were [...] "god-like" [...] and more highly evolved than every other human being, but his secret journal records self-loathing and suicidal intentions. Page after page was covered in hearts, as he was {{secretly}} {{in love with a}} Columbine student. Although both had difficulty controlling their anger, Klebold's anger had led to his being more prone to serious trouble than Harris. Klebold was known to swear at teachers and fight with his boss at Blackjack Pizza. After their arrest, which both recorded as the most traumatic thing they had ever experienced, Klebold wrote a letter to Harris, saying how they would have so much fun getting revenge and killing cops, and how his wrath from the January arrest would be [...] "god-like". On the day of the massacre, Klebold wore <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>T-shirt</b> which had the word [...] "WRATH" [...] printed in red. It was speculated that revenge for the arrest was a possible motive for the attack, and that the pair planned on having a massive gun battle with police during the shooting. Klebold wrote that life was no fun without a little death, and {{that he would like to}} spend the last moments of his life in nerve-wracking twists of murder and bloodshed. He concluded by saying that he would kill himself afterward in order to leave the world that he hated and go to a better place. Klebold was described as being [...] "hotheaded, but depressive and suicidal." ...|$|E

5000|$|The show {{took the}} form of short, {{condensed}} sketches interspersed with links filmed in what was purportedly Adam and Joe's bedsit, but was actually a shared [...] "performance space" [...] above a branch of The Body Shop in Brixton, South London. When in this room, Adam wore <b>a</b> plain <b>black</b> <b>T-shirt</b> with 'Ad' and Joe wore one with 'Joe' written on the front. Although the two comedians were involved in other projects before and after it was aired, The Adam and Joe Show remains their most popular and well-known creation, and it gained a cult following.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{the rest}} of the Gang, Charlie likes to dress in costumes and assume other personae, {{including}} the legendary [...] "Green Man". In [...] "The Aluminum Monster vs. Fatty McGoo", he shows a remarkable sewing ability, a skill that he claims allows him to maintain his few articles of clothing. Unlike {{the rest of}} the Gang, Charlie almost always wears the same few outfits, due to living in squalor. He is rarely seen without his signature green jacket, black track jacket with red stripes, or gray MacGregor-brand hoodie. At home, he wears <b>a</b> worn <b>black</b> <b>T-shirt</b> depicting <b>a</b> shiny <b>black</b> horse and <b>an</b> old pair of long thermal underwear (described by Mac as being [...] "covered in piss").|$|R
2500|$|Superboy is a {{principal}} character in the Young Justice animated series, voiced by Nolan North. He {{has been referred to}} as the [...] "breakout character" [...] of the show by its producers and is the only member of Young Justice from the comics to appear {{as a member of the}} team in the first season, with other characters either appearing or joining next season. He first wore a white form-fitting solar suit and later wears <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>T-shirt</b> with the Superman logo across his chest and blue army-type pants with brown work boots. The result of Project Cadmus' [...] "Project Kr" [...] in the two-part pilot [...] "Independence Day", Superboy is a sixteen-week-old genomorph clone of Superman, created as a living weapon by Project Cadmus and Dr. Mark Desmond to either replace Superman if he falls or destroy him should he go rogue. Kept in a pod beneath the Cadmus facility, he was telepathically force-fed advanced knowledge in various areas including languages, history, math, reading, writing, culture, etc. While he possesses Superman's super strength, enhanced speed, telescopic vision, infrared vision, super hearing, and invulnerability, these powers are not at Superman's level, nor at the proportionate level for a Kryptonian of his physical age. In addition, he lacks Superman's more advanced powers such as flight, x-ray and heat vision, due to missing sequences in Superboy's Kryptonian DNA being bridged with human DNA, which stabilizes Superboy and withholds full Kryptonian powers. After being released by Aqualad, Robin, and Kid Flash, defeating the transformed Desmond (a.k.a. Blockbuster) and the Justice League's arrival, Superboy meets Superman, who has since found it uncomfortable being around his clone, and Superboy's failed attempts to work with and talk to Superman make Superboy angry and irrational. He has a burgeoning romantic relationship with Martian Manhunter's niece, M'gann. In [...] "Targets", Superboy is given the name [...] "Conner Kent"; the first name suggested by M'gann after the love interest of a sitcom titled [...] "Hello Megan" [...] whom he greatly resembles; and the surname by Martian Manhunter after Superman, which Miss Martian thought was in homage to Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson). At the end of [...] "Terrors", he kisses Miss Martian after Killer Frost had almost killed her. Since then, the two have started a romantic relationship, but attempted to keep it from their teammates, showing their affection in privacy or speaking telepathically. In [...] "Agendas", Superboy learns that he is the half-human clone of Lex Luthor, who gives him Shield-shaped patches to defeat the Superclone Match. Afterwards, Lex tells him the shields are a gift [...] "from a father to his son" [...] and quotes [...] "Red Sun" [...] to incapacitate Superboy when he tries to attack him. In [...] "Performance", Superboy displays signs of addiction to the [...] "shields", using them continuously in the field, but making him more aggressive when fighting Parasite. In [...] "Usual Suspects", Superboy confesses this to the Team, and agrees to meet Luthor on Santa Prisco for a restock on the [...] "shields". Upon arriving, Miss Martian and Artemis also appear to find Lex Luthor accompanied by Queen Bee, Bane, Blockbuster, Cheshire, and Sportsmaster. However the villains are surprised and attacked by them and the rest of the Team, as the [...] "Red Sun" [...] program has been wiped from his mind by Miss Martian. Luthor admits that no other programs were installed in time by Dr. Desmond. In [...] "Auld Acquaintance", he and Superman finally interact and reveal their civilian identities to one another. In the five-year gap, Superboy remained with the team sporting a long-sleeved Superman T-shirt, but retaining his appearance from season one, due to being force grown. He is now more relaxed, controlled, and makes use of strategy and technology in battles. In the episode [...] "Alienated", his relationship with Superman has visibly improved. Kal-El refers to Superboy as his little brother with the Kryptonian name Kon-El. At some point, he ended his relationship with Miss Martian in part because he does not outwardly age, but also because of her violent probing of hostile minds, leaving them in a catatonic state. Worse, she attempted to erase his memory of this argument. M'gann is shocked out of her ways after she telepathically attacks Aqualad, and eventually breaks up with Lagoon Boy, deciding with Connor to renew their relationship.|$|E

50|$|When Kilbourne Black Watch members {{attend an}} event, they dress {{in black and}} {{sometimes}} paint their faces royal blue {{in the manner of}} the Scottish warriors in the film “Braveheart.” Some members sport <b>a</b> standardized <b>black</b> <b>T-shirt.</b> The front features the Kilbourne <b>Black</b> Watch flag, <b>a</b> <b>black</b> WKHS “K” emblazoned upon the Cross of St. Andrew, the flag of Scotland.
