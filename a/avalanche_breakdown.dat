25|$|Avalanche photodiodes are photodiodes with {{structure}} {{optimized for}} operating with high reverse bias, approaching the reverse breakdown voltage. This allows each photo-generated carrier to be multiplied by <b>avalanche</b> <b>breakdown,</b> resulting in internal gain within the photodiode, {{which increases the}} effective responsivity of the device.|$|E
25|$|Once <b>avalanche</b> <b>breakdown</b> has occurred, the {{thyristor}} {{continues to}} conduct, {{irrespective of the}} gate voltage, until: (a) the potential VAK is removed or (b) the current through the device (anode−cathode) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer. Hence VG can be a voltage pulse, such as the voltage output from a UJT relaxation oscillator.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Local <b>avalanche</b> <b>breakdowns</b> {{take place}} in the {{neighbourhood}} of PN junction local defects at sufficiently high reverse voltage. These breakdowns give rise to microplasma noise which is often characterized by current impulses whose inception time and duration time are random. The effective cross-section of the microplasma region being rather small, the current density may achieve a high value, which in turn can result in local heating of the micro-region and, consequently, the junction destruction. The present paper deals with the effect of the temperature on statistical characterics of microplasma noise. This effect is intended to be used for the local defect temperature determination based on these characteristic measurement results...|$|R
25|$|When the anode is at a {{positive}} potential VAK {{with respect to}} the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate, junctions J1 and J3 are forward biased, while junction J2 is reverse biased. As J2 is reverse biased, no conduction takes place (Off state). Now if VAK is increased beyond the breakdown voltage VBO of the thyristor, <b>avalanche</b> <b>breakdown</b> of J2 takes place and the thyristor starts conducting (On state).|$|E
25|$|The usual {{breakdown}} {{route is}} that the field strength becomes large enough to pull electrons in the dielectric from their atoms thus causing conduction. Other scenarios are possible, such as impurities in the dielectric, and, if the dielectric is of a crystalline nature, imperfections in the crystal structure can result in an <b>avalanche</b> <b>breakdown</b> as seen in semi-conductor devices. Breakdown voltage is also affected by pressure, humidity and temperature.|$|E
25|$|Many simple DC power {{supplies}} regulate the voltage using either series or shunt regulators, but most apply a voltage reference using a shunt regulator {{such as a}} Zener diode, <b>avalanche</b> <b>breakdown</b> diode, or voltage regulator tube. Each of these devices begins conducting at a specified voltage and will conduct as much current as required to hold its terminal voltage to that specified voltage by diverting excess current from a non-ideal power source to ground, often through a relatively low-value resistor to dissipate the excess energy. The power supply is designed to only supply a maximum amount of current that is within the safe operating capability of the shunt regulating device.|$|E

2500|$|An {{avalanche}} transistor is a {{bipolar junction transistor}} designed for operation {{in the region of}} its collector-current/collector-to-emitter voltage characteristics beyond the collector-to-emitter breakdown voltage, called <b>avalanche</b> <b>breakdown</b> region.

40|$|Abstract—The growing use of single-photon {{avalanche}} diodes {{in strong}} magnetic fields has spurred {{an interest in}} understand-ing how the environment distorts the avalanche process. In this paper, we extend the multiplication-assisted diffusion avalanche model to include convection from a Lorentzian force caused by a strong magnetic field. Simulations imply that the avalanche is still expected to propagate at a speed of 2 D/τ, although from a point moving at a velocity given by the convection process. Sim-ulations of quench time differences are compared to experimental results at multiple temperatures and magnetic fields. There is an absolute mismatch between simulations and experimental results of roughly 35 %, although the simulations are able to predict the relative shift in quench times ranging from roughly 140 ps at − 50 ◦C to 210 ps at + 50 ◦C.
