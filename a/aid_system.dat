40|$|An {{intelligent}} pilot <b>aiding</b> <b>system</b> needs {{models of}} the pilot information processing to provide the computational basis for successful cooperation between the pilot and the <b>aiding</b> <b>system.</b> By combining artificial intelligence concepts with the human information processing model of Rasmussen, an abstraction hierarchy of states of knowledge, processing functions, and shortcuts are developed, which is useful for characterizing the information processing both of the pilot and of the <b>aiding</b> <b>system.</b> This approach {{is used in the}} conceptual design of a real time intelligent <b>aiding</b> <b>system</b> for flight crews of transport aircraft. One promising result was the tentative identification of a particular class of information processing shortcuts, from situation characterizations to appropriate responses, as the most important reliable pathway for dealing with complex time critical situations...|$|R

I 2 ̆ 7 d like {{to present a}} brief and {{somewhat}} general set of comments on diagnostic <b>aid</b> <b>systems.</b> The comrnents are general because I am summarizing previous and ongoing Rand study efforts. As you may be aware, Rand has done considerable work for t he Air Force in several areas related to diagnostic <b>aid</b> <b>systems,</b> such as investigations of engine health monitoring systems and studies of aircraft maintenance policies and programs. Recently, Rand has undertaken, under ARPA sponsor ship, a project to assess the utility and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic <b>aid</b> <b>systems</b> for U. S. Army ground vehicles.

40|$|Some of the {{conceptual}} {{issues associated with}} pilot <b>aiding</b> <b>systems</b> are discussed and an implementation of one component of such an <b>aiding</b> <b>system</b> is described. It is essential that the format {{and content of the}} information the <b>aiding</b> <b>system</b> presents to the crew be compatible with the crew's mental models of the task. It is proposed that in order to cooperate effectively, both the <b>aiding</b> <b>system</b> and the flight crew should have consistent information processing models, especially at the point of interface. A general information processing strategy, developed by Rasmussen, was selected to serve as the bridge between the human and <b>aiding</b> <b>system's</b> information processes. The development and implementation of a model-based situation assessment and response generation system for commercial transport aircraft are described. The current implementation is a prototype which concentrates on engine and control surface failure situations and consequent flight emergencies. The <b>aiding</b> <b>system,</b> termed Recovery Recommendation System (RECORS), uses a causal model of the relevant subset of the flight domain to simulate the effects of these failures and to generate appropriate responses, given the current aircraft state and the constraints of the current flight phase. Since detailed information about the aircraft state may not always be available, the model represents the domain at varying levels of abstraction and uses the less detailed abstraction levels to make inferences when exact information is not available. The structure of this model is described in detail...|$|R

500|$|The Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps (TVAC) {{was created}} in 1939 to serve the {{residents}} of Teaneck. TVAC has always been Teaneck's only emergency ambulance service and includes over 100 volunteers and four ambulances, serving Teaneck and its residents around the clock, without pay. In 2011, TVAC responded to over 4,300 emergency calls, routinely saving lives and reducing suffering with their rapid response and application of Basic Life Support skills. [...] Throughout the last 70 years, TVAC has never charged a patient nor the patient's family for service. The services of the Corps are entirely free of charge, whether the patients are residents of Teaneck, visitors, or individuals who need medical service while passing through the town.

500|$|The {{section of}} the Post Road between Bel Air Avenue in Aberdeen and the former {{racetrack}} in Havre de Grace, much of which is now MD132, was paved under the state <b>aid</b> <b>system</b> as a [...] wide macadam road by 1911. The first {{section of the}} gap between Rossville and Aberdeen {{was filled with a}} concrete road from Bradshaw to Winters Run by 1921. The remainder of the highway in Baltimore County and the section from Winters Run to Bynum Run were paved in concrete by 1923. The final piece of Philadelphia Road in Harford County was completed as a concrete road from Bynum Run to Aberdeen in 1926. The highway was paved in concrete along Main Street and Delaware Avenue through Elkton, {{with the exception of a}} gap at the west end of town, by 1923. The gap between Elkton and the Delaware state line was filled in 1925. The [...] gap at the west end of Elkton was left in inferior condition in anticipation of a grade separation of the Pennsylvania Railroad. This grade separation and its approaches was completed in 1929, completing US40, which had been assigned to the length of the Philadelphia Road in 1927.|$|E
500|$|During the Rim Fire, forest {{closures}} {{were put}} into effect and evacuation orders were issued by the Tuolumne and Mariposa County County Sheriff's Offices. Several thousand people [...] left their homes temporarily {{as a result of}} the evacuations. The Tioga Pass Road (Highway 120) was closed for a time. Highways 140 from Merced and 41 from Fresno remained open throughout the fire, providing access to the national park. Law Enforcement Command Posts were set up in the communities of Groveland and Tuolumne City, with hundreds of local and mutual aid Law Enforcement Officers from dozens of agencies responding to assist in evacuations, patrols, and road closures in the affected areas. The event is credited for being the single largest Law Enforcement mutual aid event in the history of the California Law Enforcement Mutual <b>Aid</b> <b>System.</b> At the height of the danger, an estimated 15,000 residents were under evacuation order or advisory, with plans drafted by a Search & Rescue Incident Management Team to evacuate the communities of Groveland, Pine Mountain Lake, Big Oak Flat, Tuolumne City, Tuolumne Rancheria, Ponderosa Hills, Sherwood Forest, Sugar Pine, and Miwuk Village. Several commendations and citations were issued by the county and state for these efforts to the Tuolumne County Sheriff's SAR Team, Sheriff's SAR Field Training Officer Jonathan Rodriguez, and Sheriff's SAR Volunteer Tornado Paul.|$|E

In Guangdong, Li cracked down on corruption to [...] "put the house in order." [...] In the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-98, Li set up a special task force to evaluate what to do with non-performing loans owed by two of the province's largest financial companies.

He also increased access to the legal <b>aid</b> <b>system</b> for the poor in the province. His tenure in Guangdong was seen as largely successful, having averted the brunt of the Asian Financial Crisis and also bringing Guangdong back to the political control of the central leadership under Jiang Zemin.|$|E

In the proposed EKF, the quaternion associated with the body rotation is included in the state vector together with the bias of the <b>aiding</b> <b>system</b> sensors. Moreover, in addition to the in-line procedure of sensor bias compensation, the measurement noise covariance matrix is adapted, to guard against the effects which body motion and temporary magnetic disturbance may have on the reliability of measurements of gravity and earth’s magnetic field, respectively. By computer simulations and experimental validation with human hand orientation motion signals, improvements in the accuracy of orientation estimates are demonstrated for the proposed EKF, as compared with filter implementations where either the in-line calibration procedure, the adaptive mechanism for weighting the measurements of the <b>aiding</b> <b>system</b> sensors, or both are not implemented...|$|R
