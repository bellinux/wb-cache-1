500|$|Oxford {{finished}} {{with a time of}} 18minutes 6seconds. [...] Rankov did not initially announce the result, instead he [...] "spread his arms wide <b>and</b> <b>shrugged</b> his shoulders". [...] The result was confirmed to Rankov by finishing judge Ben Kent, with the winning margin being approximately 0.05seconds, and announced to the crews by Rankov under Chiswick Bridge: [...] "One foot to Oxford". [...] James Livingston wrote of himself at the finish: [...] "eyes widen and bulge in horror. [...] Our desolation is total." ...|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt {{returned}} to theatre acting in June 2005 {{when he appeared}} in David Nicholls' After Sun, a ten-minute-play performed {{as part of the}} Old Vic's 24-Hour Play season. Nesbitt and Catherine Tate starred as a married couple who meet a pair of newlyweds returning from their honeymoon. Later that year, he appeared in his first full-length play in 11 years, in Owen McCafferty's Shoot the Crow. He enjoyed the stimulation of learning his lines and rehearsing with the cast and director. The play opened at the Trafalgar Studios in September 2005 and his role as Socrates gained mixed reviews. In The Independent, Michael Coveney suggested the role did not fit the actor: [...] "Nesbitt is cool. But I never felt that he was inside his role of a chap called Socrates [...] He grinned <b>and</b> <b>shrugged</b> through the evening which steadily became less about grouting on tiles and more about grating on nerves." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Charles Spencer described Nesbitt's acting as [...] "outstanding".|$|E
500|$|Born {{and raised}} in Delhi, Kohli {{represented}} the city's cricket team at various age-group levels before making his first-class debut in 2006. He captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, and a few months later, made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka {{at the age of}} 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011, <b>and</b> <b>shrugged</b> off the tag of [...] "ODI specialist" [...] by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa. Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen {{for the first time in}} 2013, Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016). In 2014, he became the top-ranked T20I batsman in the ICC rankings and holds the position, as of May 2017.|$|E

2500|$|In 1918, Hayakawa {{personally}} {{chose the}} American serial actress Marin Sais to appear opposite {{him in a}} series of films, the first being the racial drama The City of Dim Faces (1918), followed by His Birthright (1918), which also starred Aoki. His collaboration with Sais ended with Bonds of Honor (1919). Hayakawa also appeared opposite Jane Novak in The Temple of Dusk (1918) and Aoki in The Dragon Painter (1919). He became one of the highest paid stars of the era, earning $2 million per year through his production company from 1918 to 1921. Hayakawa's fame rivaled that of Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks. Hayakawa drove a gold plated Pierce-Arrow and entertained lavishly in his [...] "Castle", which was known as the scene of some of Hollywood's wildest parties. Shortly before Prohibition took effect in 1920, he bought a large supply of liquor, leading him to joke that he owed his social success to his liquor supply. During this period, Hayakawa lost $1 million during a single evening gambling in Monte Carlo, <b>and</b> <b>shrugged</b> off the loss.|$|E
