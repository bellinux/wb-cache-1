5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including limited <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>education,</b> poverty amongst women, inequalities {{and human rights}} abuses. Many quality female footballers leave their home countries for better opportunities elsewhere. Another issue facing women's football is institutional. Most of the funding for the sport in Africa comes from FIFA, not from national football federations.|$|E
5|$|Women {{have tended}} to be {{overlooked}} in Byzantine studies as Byzantine society left few records about them. Women were disadvantaged in some aspects of their legal status and in their <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>education,</b> and limited in their freedom of movement. The life of a Byzantine Greek woman could be divided into three phases: girlhood, motherhood, and widowhood.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} occupations became [...] "professionalized" [...] through the 19th and 20th centuries, gaining {{regulatory}} bodies, and passing laws or regulations requiring particular higher educational requirements. As women's <b>access</b> <b>to</b> higher <b>education</b> was often limited, this effectively restricted women's participation in these professionalizing occupations. For instance, women were completely forbidden <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Cambridge University until 1868, and were encumbered {{with a variety}} of restrictions until 1987 when the university adopted an equal opportunity policy. Numerous other institutions in the United States and Western Europe began opening their doors to women over the same period of time, but <b>access</b> <b>to</b> higher <b>education</b> remains a significant barrier to women's full participation in the workforce in developing countries. Even where <b>access</b> <b>to</b> higher <b>education</b> is formally available, women's <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the full range of occupational choices is significantly limited where <b>access</b> <b>to</b> primary <b>education</b> is limited through social custom.|$|R

5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>education,</b> formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|During Mao's rule (1949â€“1976), Chinese {{women were}} needed for their manual labor for farming and for urban industrialization. To {{compensate}} for their hard work, they were provided <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>education</b> and politics. The Chinese government supported women's education. The percentage of girls attending school was 96.2% compared to below 20% before the People's Republic (1949). The Chinese government {{has tried to}} decrease {{the number of women}} illiterates while promoting adult and vocational schools. The percentage number of illiterates has gone down from 90% in 1949 and 32% from 1993. In the first 30 years of Communist rule women's discrimination was decreasing, but they did not have jobs that had real decision-making power.|$|E

This paper reviews experiences in East and Southeast Asian countries in widening <b>access</b> <b>to</b> secondary <b>education</b> and draws lessons that might be applicable to countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Firstly, the paper looks at macro factors that contributed substantially to the widening of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> secondary <b>education</b> in East and Southeast Asian countries.

The objectives of education in Malta include intellectual and moral development and the preparation of every citizen to contribute productively to the national economy. Although Maltese citizens had <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>education</b> during the Arab occupation of 870 to 1090, the arrival of a number of religious orders in the following four centuries brought religious-based education to the island for wealthy families. The arrival of the Knights Hospitaller saw the establishment of the University of Malta, around which a number of primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions were established. Education in Malta has been universally available at the primary level since the ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French in 1798, when state-funded elementary schooling was established. In 1878, English replaced Italian as the primary language of instruction, and education was made compulsory in 1946 in response to a number of children not attending school due to poverty between World Wars One and Two. The age at which education became compulsory was lowered to five years in 1988.|$|E

5|$|Early {{development}} of the women's game at the time colonial powers brought football to Sierra Leone and the continent was limited, as colonial powers in the region tended to take concepts of patriarchy and women's participation in sport with them to local cultures that already had similar concepts already embedded in them. Other factors on the continent impact the {{development of}} the game, including limited <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>education,</b> poverty among women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When quality players are developed in Africa, they often leave for greater opportunities elsewhere Continent wide; most of the funding for women's football in a country and for the women's national team comes from FIFA, not the national football association. Future success for women's football in Africa is dependent on improved facilities and access by women to these facilities. Attempting to commercialise the game is not the solution, as demonstrated by the existence of many youth and women's football camps held on the continent that have resulted in improved national team performance as players progressed through the system.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of {{the early years of}} the legacy. This bequest was {{administered}} by the Corporation of London in around 1460 and a small college was founded next to Guildhall Chapel, also using the library facilities in the chapel. Despite the fact that this continued for over 70 years, the earliest certain evidence of the existence of Carpenter's Children can only be traced back to 1536, and thus it isn't clear who these boys were, what they were taught and where they lived. In 1547, under the Chantries Act the Guildhall Chapel and Library were forfeited. The funding for the four boys was also discontinued. The Corporation of London remained in control of Carpenter's estate and accounts from the next 300 years show that the money continued to be spent on children's benefits such as providing new coats to every child or providing them with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>education.</b>|$|E

5|$|Through {{the late}} 17th century, the various clans {{of the eastern}} coastal region were governed by chieftains who {{typically}} ruled over one or two villages. A zana-malata named Ratsimilaho emerged to unite these clans under his rule in 1710. His reign lasted 50 years and established a sense of common identity and stability throughout the kingdom, but his successors gradually weakened this union, leaving it vulnerable to the growing influence and presence of European and particularly French settlers, slave traders, missionaries and merchants. The fractured Betsimisaraka kingdom was easily colonised in 1817 by Radama I, king of Imerina who ruled from its capital at Antananarivo in the central highlands. The subjugation of the Betsimisaraka in the 19th century left the population relatively impoverished; under colonisation by the French (1896-1960) a focused {{effort was made to}} increase <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>education</b> and paid employment working on French plantations. Production of former plantation crops like vanilla, ylang-ylang, coconut oil and coffee remain the principal economic activity of the region beyond subsistence farming and fishing, although mining is also a source of income.|$|E
