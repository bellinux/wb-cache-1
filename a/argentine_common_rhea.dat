40|$|Sequential banding {{analysis}} (Giemsa-C-banding-Ag NOR) of chromosomes of the <b>common</b> <b>rhea</b> (Rhea americana) was performed. Metaphases {{were obtained}} by peripheral blood lymphocyte culture and monolayer embryo cell culture. The diploid chromosome number was 80, different from the 2 n = 82 in previous reports. Macrochromosome pairs 1, 2 and 5 were submetacentric and pair 3, subacrocentric. The 4 th pair was acrocentric {{and all of the}} microchromosomes appeared to be acrocentric, {{with the exception of a}} clearly metacentric pair which was fully heterochromatic. The Z was slightly larger than the W, both being acrocentric and C-band negative. Nucleolar organizer regions were observed in the secondary constriction of a microchromosome pair. Correct identification of the NOR-bearing pair was possible only by sequential analyses, Giemsa staining followed by the Ag-NOR technique...|$|R
2500|$|His first {{reference}} to transmutation {{appears in the}} Red Notebook around early March 1837, after John Gould {{told him that the}} <b>common</b> <b>Rhea</b> was a different species to the Petisse. Darwin wrote [...] "Speculate on neutral ground of 2 ostriches; bigger one encroaches on smaller. change not progressif: produced at one blow. if one species altered", proposing a sudden change or saltation in contrast to Lamarck's idea that species graded imperceptibly into each other: later, Darwin referred to this jump as inosculation. He drew on the relationship Owen had shown between fossils of the extinct giant Macrauchenia and the modern guanacos that Darwin had hunted in Patagonia: [...] "The same kind of relation that common ostrich bears to : extinct Guanaco to recent: in former case position, in latter time. .... – As in first cases distinct species inosculate, so must we believe ancient ones: not gradual change or degeneration. from circumstances: if one species does change into another it must be per saltum – or species may perish." [...] Here, he related the geographical distribution of species to their replacement over time, and tentatively proposed that the Rheas had a shared ancestor.|$|R

50|$|Argentina {{seemed the}} most {{promising}} of South American nations, and so they stayed, eventually concentrating in the north, which reminded them of the scrappy mountains and plains of Punjab.

Today, there are about 300 of them, many of whom run supermarkets and other shops. Mixed marriages with Catholic <b>Argentines</b> are <b>common.</b>|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{the current}} study were to collect {{intestinal}} spirochaetes (genus Brachyspira) from farmed and wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and to identify and classify those isolates that phenotypically resembled Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, an enteric pathogen of pigs. The isolation rate of Brachyspira spp. was high from both farmed (93 %) and wild mallards (78 %). In wild mallards, it appeared that Brachyspira spp. {{were more likely to be}} found in migratory birds (multivariate analysis: RR = 1 (.) 8, 95 % Cl 1 (.) 1 - 3 (.) 1) than in mallards sampled in a public park. Pure cultures of putative B. hyodysenteriae were obtained from 22 birds. All five isolates from farmed mallards and ten randomly selected isolates with this phenotype were used for further studies. All isolates from farmed mallards and two of the isolates from wild mallards were PCR-positive for the tlyA gene of B. hyodysenteriae. Two isolates from farmed mallards were selected for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. These isolates clustered with the type and reference strains of B. hyodysenteriae. 16 S rDNA sequence analysis performed on 11 of the strains showed that they were all closely related to each other and to the B. hyodysenteriae-Brachyspira intermedia cluster. Three of the mallard isolates had 16 S rDNA sequences that were identical to those of B. hyodysenteriae strains R 1 and NIV- 1 previously isolated from <b>common</b> <b>rheas</b> (Rhea americana). To conclude, the isolates from farmed mallards and two isolates from wild mallards were classified as B. hyodysenteriae based on the factthat they could not be differentiated by any of the applied methods from type, reference and field strains of B. hyodysenteriae. The remaining isolates could not be assigned irrefutably to any of the presently recognized Brachyspira species. These results point to a broader host spectrum of B. hyodysenteriae than is generally recognized, and to the presence in mallards of strongly haemolytic and indole-producing spirochaetes that possess many, but not all, of the currently recognized characteristics of B. hyodysenteriae...|$|R

50|$|Argentina and Chile {{were both}} ruled by {{military}} governments {{at the time}} of the negotiations. The Chilean and <b>Argentine</b> governments shared <b>common</b> interests: internal war against subversion, annihilating the opposition; external war against communism, remaining nonetheless part of the non-aligned movement; modernisation and liberalisation of the economy; a conservative approach towards social and class relations. By the end of 1977, the war against subversion and opposition was substantially over in both countries, as the Operation Condor had lost momentum and détente had improved East-West relations. The two countries maintained good economic relations.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} an ESA/ESOC led GSTP activity for an automation project (IDEA) {{consistent with a}} single integrated environment for the preparation of automation procedures. The intention is {{to bridge the gap}} between procedure definition in the offline environment and procedure validation in the execution environment. The project will capitalise on an existing generic product (MOIS) used by all missions at ESOC to create and manage procedures. It will execute these procedures automatically using the MATIS component which in turn interfaces with the ground control systems through a common Service Management Framework (SMF). MATIS was initially developed on a draft of the PLUTO language, modified to support direct use of the SMF services. The SMF offers the services of all the ground control system elements via a <b>common</b> interface. <b>RHEA</b> System’s Manufacturing and Operations Information System (MOIS) is used for the preparation of both manual and automation procedures. The main user-driven objective is to include automated operations seamlessly within the established infrastructure in order to provide a more coherent environment. The technical objectives of the project are to upgrade MATIS to support PLUTO version 1. 0 of the ECSS-E-ST- 70 - 32 C (E 32) standard, to develop a true PLUTO-aware editor conforming to this standard (in Eclipse RCP) and to deploy a Space System Model (SSM) consistent with the ECSS-E-ST- 70 - 31 C (E 31) standard. This will facilitate an abstracted hierarchical classification of the mission data and hide the implementation details of the SMF service layer from the PLUTO scripting interface. While this IDEA project is focused on automation procedures, a complementary MOIS and MORE project [ref 4] will further develop a single integrated environment for all types, including manual and on-board control procedures. The paper will present the project concepts, the design of the software and a demonstration of the new integrated PLUTO procedure preparation and automation system. I...|$|R
60|$|In the melodists proper the displays, in a {{majority}} of cases, are exclusively vocal, the singer sitting still on his perch. In the Troupials, a family of starling-like birds numbering about one hundred and forty species, there are many that accompany singing with pretty or grotesque antics. The male screaming cow-bird of La Plata, when perched, emits a hollow-sounding internal note that swells at the end into a sharp metallic ring, almost bell-like: this is uttered with wings and tail spread and depressed, the whole plumage being puffed out as in a strutting turkey-cock, while the bird hops briskly {{up and down on}} its perch as if dancing. The bell-like note of the male is followed by an impetuous scream from the female, and the dance ends. Another species, the <b>common</b> <b>Argentine</b> cow-bird of La Plata, when courting puffs out his glossy rich violet plumage, and, with wings vibrating, emits a succession of deep internal notes, followed by a set song in clear, ringing tones; and then, suddenly taking wing, he flies straight away, close to the surface, fluttering like a moth, and at a distance of twenty to thirty yards turns and flies in a wide circle round the female, singing loudly all the time, hedging her in with melody as it were.|$|R
40|$|Ants {{are often}} {{considered}} antagonists when they visit flowers because they typically steal nectar without providing pollination services. Previous research on ant-flower interactions on {{two species of}} South African Proteaceae in the Cape Floral Kingdom revealed that the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), but not native ants, displace other floral arthropod visitors. To determine how <b>common</b> <b>Argentine</b> ant use of inflorescences is, how Argentine and native ant visits differ in the numbers they recruit to inflorescences, and what factors may affect Argentine and native ant foraging in inflorescences, I surveyed 723 inflorescences in 10 species in the genera Protea and Leucospermum across 16 sites and compared ant presence and abundance in inflorescences with abundance at nearby cat food and jam baits. Argentine ants were the most commonly encountered ant of the 22 observed. Argentine ants, as well as six species of native ants were present in all inflorescences {{for which they were}} present at nearby baits. Mean Argentine ant abundance per inflorescence was 4. 4 ± 0. 84 (SE) ants and similar to that of Anoplolepis custodiens, and Crematogaster peringueyi, but higher than observed for the other most commonly encountered native ants, Camponotus niveosetosus, and Lepisiota capensis. Both Argentine ants and A. custodiens {{were more likely to be}} found foraging in spring and under humid conditions, and in inflorescences closer to the ground, with lower sucrose concentrations, and with a greater proportion of open flowers. Argentine ants were more likely to be found in Protea inflorescences, whereas A. custodiens and L. capensis more often visited Leucospermum inflorescences. Considering its displacement of floral arthropods and widespread use of Proteaceae inflorescences, the Argentine ant could be posing a serious threat to plant and pollinator conservation in this biodiversity hotspot...|$|R
6000|$|Turning {{now to the}} ostrich Order: {{the male}} of the common {{cassowary}} (Casuarius galeatus) would be thought by any one to be the female, from his smaller size and from the appendages and naked skin about his head being much less brightly coloured; and I am informed by Mr. Bartlett that in the Zoological Gardens, it is certainly the male alone {{who sits on the}} eggs and takes care of the young. (21. The natives of Ceram (Wallace, 'Malay Archipelago,' vol. ii. p. 150) assert that the male and female sit alternately on the eggs; but this assertion, as Mr. Bartlett thinks, may be accounted for by the female visiting the nest to lay her eggs.) The female is said by Mr. T.W. Wood (22. The 'Student,' April 1870, p. 124.) to exhibit during the breeding-season a most pugnacious disposition; and her wattles then become enlarged and more brilliantly coloured. So again the female of one of the emus (Dromoeus irroratus) is considerably larger than the male, and she possesses a slight top-knot, but is otherwise indistinguishable in plumage. She appears, however, [...] "to have greater power, when angry or otherwise excited, of erecting, like a turkey-cock, the feathers of her neck and breast. She is usually the more courageous and pugilistic. She makes a deep hollow guttural boom especially at night, sounding like a small gong. The male has a slenderer frame and is more docile, with no voice beyond a suppressed hiss when angry, or a croak." [...] He not only performs the whole duty of incubation, but has to defend the young from their mother; [...] "for as soon as she catches sight of her progeny she becomes violently agitated, and notwithstanding the resistance of the father appears to use her utmost endeavours to destroy them. For months afterwards it is unsafe to put the parents together, violent quarrels being the inevitable result, in which the female generally comes off conqueror." [...] (23. See the excellent account of the habits of this bird under confinement, by Mr. A.W. Bennett, in 'Land and Water,' May 1868, p. 233.) So that with this emu we have a complete reversal not only of the parental and incubating instincts, but of the usual moral qualities of the two sexes; the females being savage, quarrelsome, and noisy, the males gentle and good. The case is very different with the African ostrich, for the male is somewhat larger than the female and has finer plumes with more strongly contrasted colours; nevertheless he undertakes the whole duty of incubation. (24. Mr. Sclater, on the incubation of the Struthiones, 'Proc. Zool. Soc.' June 9, 1863. So it is with the Rhea darwinii: Captain Musters says ('At Home with the Patagonians,' 1871, p. 128), that the male is larger, stronger and swifter than the female, and of slightly darker colours; yet he takes sole charge of the eggs and of the young, just as does the male of the <b>common</b> species of <b>Rhea.)</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Here is {{a puzzle}} for ornithologists. In summer on the pampas {{we have a}} godwit--Limosa hudsonica; in March it goes north to breed; {{later in the season}} flocks of the same species arrive from the south to winter on the pampas. And besides this godwit, there are several other North American species, which have colonies in the {{southern}} hemi-spere, with a reversed migration and breeding season. Why do these southern birds winter so far south? Do they really breed in Patagonia? If so, their migration is an extremely limited one compared with that of the northern birds--seven or eight hundred miles, on the outside, in one case, against almost as many thousands of miles in the other. Considering that some species which migrate as far south as Patagonia breed in the Arctic regions as far north as latitude 82 degrees, and probably higher still, it would be strange indeed if none of the birds which winter in Patagonia and on the pampas were summer visitors to that great austral continent, which has an estimated area twice as large as that of Europe, and a climate milder than the arctic one. The migrants would have about six hundred miles of sea to cross from Tierra del Fuego; but we know that the golden plover and other species, which sometimes touch at the Bermudas when travelling, fly much further than that without resting. The fact that a <b>common</b> <b>Argentine</b> titlark, a non-migrant and a weak flyer, has been met with at the South Shetland Islands, close to the antarctic continent, shows that the journey may be easily accomplished by birds with strong flight; and that even the winter climate of that unknown land is not too severe to allow an accidental colonist, like this small delicate bird, to survive. The godwit, already mentioned, has been observed in flocks at the Falkland Islands in May, that is, three months after the same species had taken its autumal departure from the neighbouring mainland. Can it be believed that these late visitors to the Falklands were breeders in Patagonia, and had migrated east to winter in so bleak a region? It is far more probable that they came from the south. Officers of sailing ships beating round Cape Horn might be able to settle this question definitely by looking out, and listening at night, for flights of birds, travelling north from about the first week in January to the end of February; and in September and October travelling south. Probably not fewer than a dozen species of the plover order are breeders on the great austral continent; also other aquatic birds--ducks and geese; and many Passerine birds, chiefly of the Tyrant family.|$|R
