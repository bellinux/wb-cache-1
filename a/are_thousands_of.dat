5|$|The road {{has evolved}} from {{historical}} routes, some of which <b>are</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> years old including the Harrow Way and the Fosse Way. The modern route was first {{laid out in the}} early 19th century as the New Direct Road, a faster coaching route from London to Exeter. It was initially in demand but fell into disuse as railways became popular from the 1840s onwards. It was not thought of as a significant through route when roads were initially numbered, but was revived as a major road in 1933, eventually becoming a trunk road in 1958. Since then, the A303 has gradually been upgraded to modern standards, though there are still several unimproved parts.|$|E
5|$|Along crater and canyon walls, there <b>are</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> {{features}} that appear similar to terrestrial gullies. The gullies {{tend to be}} in the highlands of the southern hemisphere and to face the Equator; all are poleward of 30° latitude. A number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water, probably from melting ice, although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust. No partially degraded gullies have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed, indicating that these are young features, possibly still active. Other geological features, such as deltas and alluvial fans preserved in craters, are further evidence for warmer, wetter conditions at an interval or intervals in earlier Mars history. Such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of crater lakes across {{a large proportion of the}} surface, for which there is independent mineralogical, sedimentological and geomorphological evidence.|$|E
