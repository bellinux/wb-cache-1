25|$|When the {{government}} complained that Whitney's price per musket compared unfavorably with those produced in government armories, Whitney {{was able to}} calculate an <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> per musket by including fixed costs such as insurance and machinery, which {{the government}} had not included. He thus made early contributions to both the concept of cost accounting, {{and the concept of}} the efficiency of private industry.|$|E

On average 46% of European consumers claimed {{to be willing to}} pay substantially more for ethical products, including fair-trade products such as coffee. The study found that the majority of respondents were unwilling to pay the <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> premium of 27% for fair trade coffee.|$|E

The difference is between <b>actual</b> <b>prices</b> paid, and information about possible, potential or likely prices, or [...] "average" [...] price levels.

However, the CBI gave a clean sheet to Fernandes in the scam in its 2009 charge sheet.

25|$|Under the Duffie construct, {{the price}} of a credit default swap can also be derived by calculating the asset swap spread of a bond. If a bond has a spread of 100, and the swap spread is 70 basis points, then a CDS {{contract}} should trade at 30. However, there are sometimes technical reasons why this will not be the case, and this may or may not present an arbitrage opportunity for the canny investor. The difference between the theoretical model and the <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> of a credit default swap is known as the basis.|$|E

40|$|Two {{alternative}} long-term marketing contracts between {{producers and}} packers were compared over a 10 -year period. Contracts {{offered in the}} industry differ greatly. The two contracts considered here represent a cost-plus contract and a 38 - 48 window price contract. They were compared using <b>actual</b> <b>prices</b> from 1986 - 1996 and at prices that were five percent lower than <b>actual</b> <b>prices.</b> Both contracts reduced the variabillity of prices and produced higher minimum prices than were offered in the cash market.

25|$|On February 14, 2007, Skybus {{announced}} they {{had chosen the}} CFM56-5B engine built by CFM International to power the 65 A319 aircraft on order from Airbus. The <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> Skybus would have paid for the engines was not disclosed, but the list price for the order is estimated at over $750 million. As of April 2008, the Skybus Airlines fleet consisted of 13 Airbus A319 aircraft (out of a total order of 63), 12 received in December 2007 and one in March 2008, two of which were leased from Virgin America.

25|$|On October 26, 2006, Skybus {{announced}} {{a deal with}} the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus to buy 65 of its Airbus A319 aircraft. The order carried an estimated retail price of $3.7 billion, though the <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> Skybus would have paid had not been announced. Additionally, the aircraft were going to come with a 12-year maintenance agreement that was new for Airbus and Skybus was the launch customer for this service plan which helped them manage maintenance costs. Additionally, the aircraft would have been equipped with the latest in EFB (electronic flight bags) and HUD (heads up display) technology, as well as TCAS II terrain and traffic avoidance technology which is integrated in with an EGPWS technology box that protects from terrain collision. Skybus planned to lease aircraft of the same type until the new aircraft were to begin delivery in late 2008.|$|E
2500|$|A typical hedger {{might be}} a {{commercial}} farmer. The market values of wheat and other crops fluctuate constantly as supply and demand for them vary, with [...] occasional large moves in either direction. Based on current prices and forecast levels at harvest time, the farmer might decide that planting wheat {{is a good idea}} one season, but the price of wheat might change over time. Once the farmer plants wheat, he is committed to it for an entire growing season. If the <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> of wheat rises greatly between planting and harvest, the farmer stands {{to make a lot of}} unexpected money, but if the <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> drops by harvest time, he is going to lose the invested money.|$|E

2500|$|Electricity retailers, who in {{aggregate}} buy from the wholesale market, and generators who {{in aggregate}} {{sell to the}} wholesale market, are exposed to these price and volume effects and {{to protect themselves from}} volatility, they will enter into [...] "hedge contracts" [...] with each other. The structure of these contracts varies by regional market due to different conventions and market structures. However, the two simplest and most common forms are simple fixed price forward contracts for physical delivery and contracts for differences where the parties agree a strike price for defined time periods. In the case of a contract for difference, if a resulting wholesale price index (as referenced in the contract) in any time period is higher than the [...] "strike" [...] price, the generator will refund the difference between the [...] "strike" [...] price and the <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> for that period. Similarly a retailer will refund the difference to the generator when the <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> is less than the [...] "strike price". The <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> index is sometimes referred to as the [...] "spot" [...] or [...] "pool" [...] price, depending on the market.|$|E

50|$|The MACD can be {{classified}} as an absolute price oscillator (APO), because it deals with the <b>actual</b> <b>prices</b> of moving averages rather than percentage changes.

60|$|Land of an {{inferior}} quality requires a great quantity of capital {{to make it}} yield a given produce; and, if the <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> of this produce be not such as fully to compensate the cost of production, including the existing rate of profits, the land must remain uncultivated. It matters not whether this compensation is effected {{by an increase in}} the money price of raw produce, without a proportionate increase in the money price of the instruments of production, or by a decrease in the price of the instruments of production, without a proportionate decrease in the price of produce. What is absolutely necessary, is a greater relative cheapness of the instruments of production, {{to make up for the}} quantity of them required to obtain a given produce from poor land.|$|E

[Footnote 14: It will be observed, that I {{have said}} in a {{progressive}} country; that is, in a country which requires yearly the employment of a greater capital on the land, to support an increasing population. If there were no question about fresh capital, or an increase of people, and all the land were good, it would not then be true that corn must be sold at its necessary price. The <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> might be diminished; and if the rents of land were diminished in proportion, the cultivation might go on as before, and the same quantity be produced. It very rarely happens, however, that all the lands of a country actually occupied are good, and yield a good net rent. And in all cases, a fall of prices must destroy agricultural capital during the currency of leases; and on their renewal {{there would not be}} the same power of production.] ...|$|E
60|$|Every {{extensive}} {{country may}} thus {{be considered as}} possessing a gradation of machines {{for the production of}} corn and raw materials, including in this gradation not only all the various qualities of poor land, of which every large territory has generally an abundance, but the inferior machinery which may be said to be employed when good land is further and further forced for additional produce. As the price of raw produce continues to rise, these inferior machines are successively called into action; and, as the price of raw produce continues to fall, they are successively thrown out of action. The illustration here used serves to show at once the necessity of the <b>actual</b> <b>price</b> of corn to the actual produce, and the different effect which would attend a great reduction in the price of any particular manufacture, and a great reduction in the price of raw produce.|$|E

In this framework I we show that the consideration of behavioural aspects like herding behaviour, speculation and momentum trading can help to explain <b>actual</b> house <b>price</b> fluctuations. Following the different approaches, agents overreact to fundamentals and are influenced by past price movements and returns. House Prices, Bubbles, Investor Behaviour...|$|R
