Allen and Mary had five children together (Loraine, Joseph, Lucy, Mary, <b>and</b> <b>Pamela),</b> only two of whom reached adulthood.|$|E

5|$|Burnside {{was born}} in Liberty, Indiana and was the fourth of nine {{children}} of Edghill <b>and</b> <b>Pamela</b> (or Pamilia) Brown Burnside, a family of Scottish origin.

His father {{was a native of}} South Carolina; he was a slave owner who freed his slaves when he relocated to Indiana.

5|$|After {{returning}} from service, Al reunited with Lucille, but {{his inability to}} find steady work left the family impoverished. They both struggled with alcohol, and often fought when intoxicated. The violence sometimes drove Hendrix to withdraw and hide in a closet in their home. His relationship with his brother Leon (born 1948) was close but precarious; with Leon {{in and out of}} foster care, they lived with an almost constant threat of fraternal separation. In addition to Leon, Hendrix had three younger siblings: Joseph, born in 1949, Kathy in 1950, <b>and</b> <b>Pamela,</b> 1951, all of whom Al and Lucille gave up to foster care and adoption. The family frequently moved, staying in cheap hotels and apartments around Seattle. On occasion, family members would take Hendrix to Vancouver to stay at his grandmother's. A shy and sensitive boy, he was deeply affected by his life experiences. In later years, he confided to a girlfriend that he had been the victim of sexual abuse by a man in uniform. On December 17, 1951, when Hendrix was nine years old, his parents divorced; the court granted Al custody of him and Leon.|$|E
