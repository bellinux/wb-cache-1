25|$|For {{technical}} reasons (hardware/software protocols, overheads, encoding schemes, etc.) the actual bit rates {{used by some}} of the compared-to devices may be significantly higher than what is listed above. For example, telephone circuits using µlaw or <b>A-law</b> companding (pulse code modulation) yield 64kbit/s.|$|E
50|$|The µ-law {{algorithm}} {{provides a}} slightly larger dynamic range than the <b>A-law</b> {{at the cost}} of worse proportional distortions for small signals. By convention, <b>A-law</b> is used for an international connection if at least one country uses it.|$|E
50|$|G.711 defines {{two main}} {{companding}} algorithms, the µ-law algorithm and <b>A-law</b> algorithm. Both are logarithmic, but <b>A-law</b> was {{specifically designed to}} be simpler for a computer to process. The standard also defines a sequence of repeating code values which defines the power level of 0 dB.|$|E
50|$|Four {{years have}} passed since the final battle between Celestial Being and the UN Forces. Humanity, having {{established}} the Earth Sphere Federation, forms an autonomous peace-keeping force, <b>A-Laws,</b> separate from and above the formal Federation army. Given unfettered discretion, <b>A-Laws</b> is charged with the duty to further unify nations, enforce the will of mankind, and dispose of terrorist cells. Unknown to the general public, however, is that the <b>A-Laws</b> misuse their power and employ inhumane tactics to oppress freedoms, doctrines, and ideologies, {{all in the name of}} unity.|$|R
50|$|In AD2312, {{the uses}} of newly {{developed}} aquatic mobile armours by the <b>A-Laws</b> is confirmed. Celestial Being also developed a small bunch of supporting mobile armor, which works as support units of Gundams.|$|R
50|$|By AD 2312, the Earth Sphere Federation has the {{abilities}} to mass-produce GN Tau Drives, and deploy {{them to their}} peace-keeping forces. The <b>A-Laws</b> under the Federation also developed their own GN-Drive mobile weapon lines respectively. Celestial Being, during this time, would complete development of their first 4th Generation Gundam, in addition to producing enhanced 3rd Generation Gundams. The rebel group Katharon, and some nations not controlled by Federation are using suits widely used in 4 years ago. The Innovators seems to have ability to develop mobile weapons that outperforms the mobile suits the <b>A-Laws</b> possess; these units can perform on par with the Gundams in some instances.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Setsuna {{tries to}} confront the <b>A-Laws</b> by himself with his {{battered}} Gundam Exia, but is easily overpowered by their newer models. He is soon rescued by Tieria Erde, piloting his new mobile suit, the Seravee Gundam. By combining the GN Drives of Exia and 0 Gundam, Celestial Beings engineers manage to complete Aeolias plans for an advanced mobile suit with twin GN drives - the 00 Gundam - which is entrusted to Setsuna. To pilot the two remaining new units, Lockon Stratos twin brother is invited to assume his brothers codename and former position as the pilot of the Cherudim Gundam, and after Allelujah Haptism is rescued from the prison he was being detained in during the timeskip, he assumes the command of Arios Gundam. Saji Crossroad reclutantly joins Setsuna to pilot the upgraded 00 Raiser and confront his fiance Louise Halevy who has joined <b>A-Laws.</b>|$|R

50|$|After {{uncovering}} {{the truth about}} Ribbons true intentions, Celestial Being joins forces with dissident members of the <b>A-Laws</b> to stop their oppression and bring the fight to the Innovates. Being continuously exposed to the GN particles of the fully completed Gundam 00, Setsuna undergoes Innovation, becoming the first true Innovator with powers far greater than Ribbons and his group. The conflict ends in a final showdown between Ribbons and Setsuna with the latters victory. The story continues in Mobile Suit Gundam 00 the Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer.|$|R
