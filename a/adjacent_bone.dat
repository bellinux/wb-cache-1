5|$|Titanium has the {{inherent}} ability to osseointegrate, enabling use in dental implants that {{can last for}} over 30 years. This property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications. These benefit from titanium's lower modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still {{more than twice that}} of bone, so <b>adjacent</b> <b>bone</b> bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate.|$|E
25|$|Meningiomas usually can be surgically resected (removed) {{and result}} in a {{permanent}} cure if the tumor is superficial on the dural surface and easily accessible. Transarterial embolization has become a standard preoperative procedure in the preoperative management. If invasion of the <b>adjacent</b> <b>bone</b> occurs, total removal is nearly impossible. It is rare for benign meningiomas to become malignant.|$|E

Skeletal scintigraphy can be entirely normal in transient synovitis, and scintigraphic findings do not distinguish transient synovitis from other joint conditions in children.

25|$|Cells {{from the}} dental {{follicle}} {{give rise to}} the periodontal ligament (PDL). Specific events leading {{to the formation of}} the periodontal ligament vary between deciduous (baby) and permanent teeth and among various species of animals. Nonetheless, formation of the periodontal ligament begins with ligament fibroblasts from the dental follicle. These fibroblasts secrete collagen, which interacts with fibers on the surfaces of <b>adjacent</b> <b>bone</b> and cementum. This interaction leads to an attachment that develops as the tooth erupts into the mouth. The occlusion, which is the arrangement of teeth and how teeth in opposite arches come in contact with one another, continually affects the formation of periodontal ligament. This perpetual creation of periodontal ligament leads to the formation of groups of fibers in different orientations, such as horizontal and oblique fibers.|$|E

Tumor cells use MMP-2 secreted by bone marrow fibroblasts (BMFs). MMP-2 is stored in an inactive conformation in association with the cell surface (or extracellular matrix) of BMFs. Inactive MMP-2 present on the surface of BMFs is displaced by breast-cancer cells. Cancer cells can then use the proteinase to facilitate tissue invasion, which requires the degradation of connective tissue associated with vascular basement membranes and interstitial connective tissue. MMP-2 is unlike other MMP's as its activity is modulated by metalloproteases called tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP) and membrane type 1 MMP (Korhmann et at. 2009) ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Gorham’s {{disease is}} a rare {{musculoskeletal}} disease which causes progressive osteolysis and is characterized by massive bone destruction due to proliferation of vascular elements along with {{a great number of}} osteoclasts. The etiology of the disease is unknown. Gorham’s disease is essentially rare in the forearm bones. As far as we know, only 2 cases of Gorham’s disease of the forearm have been reported with 1 of them in the radius and the other starting in the radius and spreading to the lower portion of the humerus. Case Presentation: This case report shows that Gorham’s disease may affect the ulna primarily and spread to <b>adjacent</b> <b>bones</b> despite {{the fact that there are}} no such reports in the literature. Conclusions: Gorham’s disease has several manifestations as primary bone involvement. As in this rare case the ulna may be affected first and then the disease may spread to <b>adjacent</b> <b>bones.</b> More studies are needed to better recognize the behavior of this rare disease...|$|R
