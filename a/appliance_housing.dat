Scope of services provided by Hong Kong developers is much wider than those in Chinaï¿½s. Ronald Coase, Nobel economist 1991 addresses two questions in his 1937 paper: why firms exist and what determines their scale and scope.

40|$|Purpose Life cycle {{thinking}} and assessment require a {{holistic approach to}} the evaluation of product supply chains. An assessment from raw material extraction to end of life of any products is based on modeling a wide number of aspects and options, e. g., at technological, geographical, and temporal levels. Since the use phase {{is one of the}} most contributing life cycle stages for some products (e. g., <b>appliance,</b> <b>housing,</b> cars), a robust modeling of this stage is fundamental. Several attempts to better modeling use-phase have been performed; however, so far no systematic study is available on how to integrate behavioral science (BS) insights into LCA. This is even more important when the impact of the product under consideration is strongly determined by the use phase relatively to other life cycle stages. The aim of this paper is to explore how behavioral science has been used to date and how BS can contribute towards more robust modeling of use phase in LCA and as basis for a behavior-driven ecodesign. Methods We identified the key areas in which LCA and ecodesign may benefit from integrating insights from behavioral science and developing a conceptual model. Both robust modeling and the design of behavior change interventions rest on a sound understanding of behavior in the specific context of interest though empirical investigation. Hence, we reviewed literature on behavioral science and introduce key drivers of human behavior that are relevant in the context of use phase modeling and ecodesign. We provide examples where these were applied to facilitate the integration of BS elements by practitioners. Results and discussion Consumer’s behavior is increasingly recognized as one of the drivers of overall environmental impact of a product, and some examples of use of BS for LCA are available in literature. We suggest that behavioral science can be useful in the context of life cycle assessment in two ways: measuring behavior and assessing potential and means for changing behavior. Specifically, insights and methods from behavioral sciences could be applied for assessing variability of consumer behavior, understanding leverages for behavioral changes, and possible rebound effects. Conclusions This insight may help to model the use phase more accurately, to identify realistic scenarios, and to support behavior-driven eco-innovation. JRC. I. 2 -Public Health Policy Suppor...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{most of the}} {{companies}} {{are interested in the}} activities that support sustainable environment. Because, the rapid increase of the industrial activities and uncontrolled consumption of natural resources cause environmental problems. Here, the responsibility of {{the companies}} is to redesign their activities in order to prevent those problems. Besides, the companies encounter with the pressure both from government and consumers that they must reorganize operational activities such as raw material supply, distribution and production in an environmental friendly way. Based on this scope, reverse logistics and its drivers were explained in this research. Drivers of reverse logistics from the producers’ perspective were analyzed in <b>house</b> <b>appliance</b> industry in Turkey. The research was carried out in two firms which are among the largest companies in the <b>house</b> <b>appliance</b> industry.

30|$|As a {{motivating}} example, {{consider a}} CS system for wireless body area networks (WBAN). WBAN allows {{the transition from}} centralized health care services to ubiquitous and pervasive health monitoring in everyday life. Typical signals that are monitored by WBAN are electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, and CS is a promising framework to lower WBAN’s energy consumption. However, ECG signals are typically corrupted by electromyographic noise which shows an impulsive behavior. Another application of interest is a nonintrusive load monitoring system that identifies <b>house</b> <b>appliances</b> and their energy consumption. A CS system {{can be used to}} acquire the power signal and then a sparse classification system used to classify the <b>house</b> <b>appliances.</b> However, the power signals exhibit impulsive behavior due to the switching nature of the appliances. If the compressive sampling process has infinite or even very large variance, the reconstructed signal obtained utilizing traditional approaches is far from the desired original signal. Thus, there are clear motivations for developing robust CS techniques that address these challenging environments.|$|R

50|$|Vitreous enamel {{has many}} useful properties: it is smooth, hard, {{chemically}} resistant, durable, scratch resistant (5-6 on the Mohs scale), has long-lasting colour fastness, {{is easy to}} clean, and cannot burn. Enamel is glass, not paint, so it does not fade under ultraviolet light. A disadvantage of enamel {{is a tendency to}} crack or shatter when the substrate is stressed or bent, but modern enamels are relatively chip- and impact-resistant because of good thickness control and coefficients of thermal expansion well-matched to the metal. The Buick automobile company was founded by David Dunbar Buick with wealth earned by his development of improved enamelling processes, c. 1887, for sheet steel and cast iron. Such enameled ferrous material had, and still has, many applications: early 20th century and some modern advertising signs, interior oven walls, cooking pots, housing and interior walls of major kitchen <b>appliances,</b> <b>housing</b> and drums of clothes washers and dryers, sinks and cast iron bathtubs, farm storage silos, and processing equipment such as chemical reactors and pharmaceutical process tanks. Structures such as filling stations, bus stations and Lustron Houses had walls, ceilings and structural elements made of enamelled steel. One of the most widespread modern uses of enamel is in the production of quality chalk-boards and marker-boards (typically called 'blackboards' or 'whiteboards') where the resistance of enamel to wear and chemicals ensures that 'ghosting', or unerasable marks, do not occur, as happens with polymer boards. Since standard enamelling steel is magnetically attractive, it may also be used for magnet boards. Some new developments {{in the last ten years}} include enamel/non-stick hybrid coatings, sol-gel functional top-coats for enamels, enamels with a metallic appearance, and new easy-to-clean enamels.|$|R
