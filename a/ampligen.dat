5000|$|In 1988, Peterson was {{the first}} {{physician}} to treat an extremely ill person diagnosed with CFS with the experimental drug <b>Ampligen</b> by obtaining compassionate-use permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Quantitative improvement in the first patient enabled the next pilot study of <b>Ampligen</b> in CFS patients by Peterson and other researchers. During the 1990 CFIDS Conference in Charlotte, North Carolina, Peterson described positive results in 15 CFS patents after he treated them with <b>Ampligen</b> for approximately 6 months. In 1990 and 1991, Peterson {{was one of four}} principal investigators for the FDA approved phase II randomized placebo controlled double-blind study of the experimental intravenous drug <b>Ampligen.</b> The drug was administered in his Incline Village facility and three other sites. Peterson and others reported that there was statistically significant improvement in the patients receiving <b>Ampligen.</b> He is a principal investigator of the FDA-approved open-label safety and efficacy phase III drug study of <b>Ampligen</b> for treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. Hemispherx Biopharma's New Drug Application for marketing and sale of <b>Ampligen</b> to treat chronic fatigue syndrome was rejected in December 2009 because the FDA concluded that the two RCTs [...] "did not provide credible evidence of efficacy." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} year, on November 2, 1999, Mary Schweitzer, {{a chronic}} fatigue syndrome patient who had been treated with rintatolimod, {{raised the question of}} why <b>Ampligen</b> has never been fast-tracked by the US public health authorities at the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Co-ordinating Committee of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Grassroots activism for FDA approval of <b>Ampligen</b> grew and continues. Current efforts in 2015 to spur FDA approval of <b>Ampligen</b> include petitions, appeal for congressional hearing, and popular social media group organizing.|$|E
5000|$|Digital stock {{advisory}} The Street journalist, Adam Feuerstein, {{has published}} articles harshly critical of Hemispherx BioPharma, Inc. for {{over half a}} decade. In June 2009, Mr. Feuerstein alleged the company was [...] "seeking to divert investors' {{attention away from the}} delayed approval of <b>Ampligen</b> as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome" [...] by issuing three press releases in seven days about research from 2007 into possible applications for <b>Ampligen</b> as a flu vaccine booster, in which Hemispherx stated that <b>Ampligen</b> could be used against the H1N1 swine flu. This article also alleged the press releases were misleading, because they implied the research had been done in 2009. When Hemispherx offered <b>Ampligen</b> as a potential H1N1 vaccine or vaccine booster, the U.S. government turned them down, and Mr. Feuerstein wrote, [...] "Hemispherx Biopharma has been shut out of the U.S. government's efforts to stockpile vaccine against the H1N1 flu." [...] Mr. Feuerstein's subsequent articles on Hemispherx BioPharma for TheStreet.com|The Street continue to run in a similar vein.|$|E
50|$|Rintatolimod, {{sold under}} the tradename <b>Ampligen,</b> is a {{medication}} intended {{for treatment of}} chronic fatigue syndrome. However, there is only low-strength evidence that it can improve the ability to exercise.|$|E
50|$|Oragen {{drugs are}} highly {{experimental}} nucleic acid technologies related to <b>Ampligen,</b> developed by HEMISPHERx Biopharma, Inc. It is hoped {{they will have}} antiviral effects. They are undergoing pre-clinical (in-vitro) trials.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, {{and again}} during the 2009 swine flu outbreak, Carter said that rintatolimod {{could also be used}} as an H1N1 flu vaccine booster, citing in vitro studies with <b>Ampligen</b> and {{neuraminidase}} inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir (brand names Tamiflu and Relenza).|$|E
50|$|Rintatolimod is {{administered}} intravenously. It is generally administered twice weekly for periods {{of one year}} or longer. Two toxicology studies had been completed as of 2007, which established the safety of intranasal and intramucosal methods of <b>Ampligen</b> administration as a vaccine immunostimulant. Hemispherx has conducted research on a by mouth versions of rintatolimod using nucleic acid technology related to rintatolimod.|$|E
5000|$|One RCT {{evaluated}} rintatolimod {{and found}} an overall beneficial effect. In December 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to approve a New Drug Application (NDA) by the developer of the drug (Hemispherx Biopharma) to market and sell <b>Ampligen</b> for treatment of CFS. The FDA concluded that the two RCTs submitted [...] "did not provide credible evidence of efficacy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Annette Whittemore, {{co-founder and}} {{president}} of the institute, stated that the inspiration for the institute came from her daughter, Andrea Whittemore-Goad, who was diagnosed with Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) at the age of twelve. Whittemore stated that numerous doctors were unable to help her daughter, and that the first major improvement came ten years after her diagnosis when she was treated by Peterson with the experimental antiviral drug <b>Ampligen.</b> Hemispherx's new drug application for <b>Ampligen,</b> which permits sale and marketing, was rejected by the FDA in December 2009 and the agency asked for another clinical study. Interviewed by The New York Times, Whittemore said that [...] "she had long believed that the syndrome was an infectious disease, but that scientists had rejected the idea", and decided that, [...] "if there was a place of our own where we could find the answers, we could do it more quickly." [...] Her husband Harvey said that his wife also wanted to recognize Peterson for his history of treating the illness since 1984.|$|E
5000|$|Rintatolimod {{development}} {{evolved from}} a 1960s synthesis by Merck & Co., a double-stranded RNA compound of inosinic and cytidylic acid residues (poly I:poly C or poly I:C). Poly I:C inhibited tumor growth by inducing interferon production, but was too toxic to use. In the mid-1970s, William A. Carter, a post-doctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University, modified the dsRNA molecule by adding uridylic acid molecules at specific intervals along the RNA chain. The new compound, called <b>Ampligen</b> (for AMPLIfied GENetic activity) stimulated interferon production like poly I:C, but with much lower toxicity. It {{is also known as}} [...] "poly I:poly C12U".|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>Ampligen</b> {{was cleared}} {{for use in}} Canada in 1997, and {{obtained}} orphan drug status for treatment of CFS in the European Union in 2000, it is so far without FDA approval, and therefore classed as experimental in the United States. In 2007, Hemispherx filed a New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market and sell rintatolimod {{for the treatment of}} CFS, but this was rejected in December 2009, because the FDA concluded that the two RCTs [...] "did not provide credible evidence of efficacy" [...] and [...] "because of clinical, statistical, clinical pharmacology, nonclinical, product quality, and facilities inspection deficiencies." [...] The FDA requested Hemispherx conduct at least one additional controlled trial to demonstrate efficacy in treating CFS. In August 2012, Hemispherx submitted further analyses of the original clinical trial data, but did not submit additional trials for review. Four months later, a committee of the FDA voted 8-5 against approval for rintatolimod, again citing insufficient data.|$|E
5000|$|An {{independent}} review of rintatolimod trials in {{chronic fatigue syndrome}} {{was published in the}} December 2006 issue of the Journal of Clinical Virology. It concluded that <b>Ampligen</b> has been [...] "generally well tolerated", with a [...] "low incidence of clinical toxicity", particularly when compared with the toxicity of the diseases it is used to treat. [...] "No serious safety issues have resulted from the administration of ~75,000 doses IV (most commonly 400 mg) twice weekly for up to one year periods or greater. Animal toxicity studies support this observation in humans, with primates demonstrating the greatest margin of safety." [...] A mild flushing reaction has occurred in about 15% of patients, and more rarely reported side effects include chills, fever, malaise, leukopenia, neutropenia and leukocytosis. Some of these side effects may be attributed to a temporary Herxheimer reaction in response to pathogen die off. According to Hemispherx and patient testimonials, side-effects, when they occur, usually subside within three to four months or less.|$|E
5000|$|Rintatolimod {{has been}} studied in humans since 1994. In early 2015, the AMP 511 open-label study of rintatolimod in CFS was still {{recruiting}} participants. Open-label studies are typically used when the controlled trial has ended and treatment is continued so that the subjects and the controls may continue to receive the investigational drug until marketing approval is obtained. Hemispherx management had missed several target deadlines for new drug application (NDA) filing in the past, including the end of 2005, {{the third quarter of}} 2006, and {{the first quarter of the}} year 2007. In October 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <b>Ampligen</b> NDA was filed. In December 2009, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) refusing Hemispherx's new drug application for rintatolimod's treatment of CFS. The FDA concluded that the two RCTs [...] "did not provide credible evidence of efficacy." [...] The agency recommended a minimum of one additional six-month, 300-patient study, and rodent carcinogenicity studies.|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{permeability}} of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) {{were evaluated}} in two mouse models of viral encephalitis. The ability of sodium fluorescein (NaFl) {{to cross the}} BBB from the serum into {{the central nervous system}} was assayed in animals inoculated with virulent strains of either Banzi or Semliki Forest viruses. To test the hypothesis that increases in BBB permeability were associated with poor disease outcome subsequent experiments measured BBB permeability in conjunction with treatment with the interferon inducer <b>Ampligen</b> (poly I:poly C 12 U). A single intraperitoneal injection of <b>Ampligen</b> (1 mg/kg) administered either 24 h or 4 – 6 h before, but not 24 h after, virus inoculation with Banzi virus provided significant improvements in survival, viral brain titers, weight change and BBB permeability. In comparison, a similar treatment with <b>Ampligen</b> administered either 24 h or 4 – 6 h before inoculation with Semliki Forest virus was able to significantly improve weight change, and BBB permeability, but only animals receiving <b>Ampligen</b> 4 – 6 h pre-virus showed a significantly improved mortality. In general, it was found that evaluation of BBB permeability was a more sensitive indicator of disease outcome and the antiviral efficacy <b>Ampligen</b> than either weight change or brain viral titers...|$|E
40|$|Viral replication, {{as well as}} an immunopathological component, {{is assumed}} to be {{involved}} in coxsackie B virus-induced myocarditis. We evaluated the efficacy of the interferon inducer <b>Ampligen</b> on coxsackie B 3 virus-induced myocarditis in C 3 H/HeNHsd mice. The efficacy of <b>Ampligen</b> was compared with that of the interferon inducer poly(inosinic acid) -poly(cytidylic acid) [poly(IC) ], alpha interferon 2 b (INTRON A), and pegylated alpha interferon 2 b (PEG-INTRON-alpha- 2 b). <b>Ampligen</b> at 20 mg/kg of body weight/day was able to reduce the severity of virus-induced myocarditis, as assessed by morphometric analysis, by 98 % (P = 3. 0 x 10 (- 8)). When poly(IC) was administered at 15 mg/kg/day, it reduced the severity of virus-induced myocarditis by 93 % (P = 5. 6 x 10 (- 5)). Alpha interferon 2 b (1 x 10 (5) U/day) and pegylated alpha interferon 2 b (5 x 10 (5) U/day) were less effective and reduced the severity of virus-induced myocarditis by 66 % (P = 0. 0009) and 78 % (P = 0. 0002), respectively. The observed efficacies of <b>Ampligen</b> and poly(IC) were corroborated by the observation that the drugs also markedly reduced the virus titers in the heart, as detected by (i) quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR and (ii) titration for infectious virus content. Whereas the electrocardiograms for untreated mice with myocarditis were severely disturbed, the electrocardiographic parameters were normalized in Ampligen- and poly(IC) -treated mice. Even when start of treatment with <b>Ampligen</b> was delayed until day 2 postinfection, a time at which lesions had already appeared in untreated control animals, a marked protective effect on the development of viral myocarditis (as assessed at day 6 postinfection) was still noted. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of interferon alpha- 2 b, pegylated interferon alpha- 2 b, poly(I.

40|$|Compounds {{approved}} for therapeutic use and in vitro inhibitors of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were evaluated for inhibition in the mouse SARS-CoV replication model. A hybrid interferon, interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) B/D, and a mismatched double-stranded (ds) RNA interferon (IFN) inducer, <b>Ampligen</b> (poly I:poly C 124), {{were the only}} compounds that potently inhibited virus titres in the lungs of infected mice as assessed by CPE titration assays. When mice were dosed intraperitoneally (i. p.) with IFN-alpha B/D once daily for 3 days beginning 4 h after virus exposure, SARS-CoV replication in the lungs of infected mice was reduced by 1 log 10 at 10, 000 and 32, 000 IU; at the highest dose of 100, 000 IU, virus lung titres were below detectable limits. <b>Ampligen</b> used i. p. at 10 mg/kg 4 h prior to virus exposure also reduced virus lung titres to below detectable limits. Nelfinavir, beta-D-N 4 -hydroxycytidine, calpain inhibitor VI, 3 -deazaneplanocin A and Alferon (human leukocyte IFN-alpha-n 3) did not significantly reduce lung virus titres in mice. Anti-inflammatory agents, chloroquine, amodiaquin and pentoxifylline, were also inactive in vivo, suggesting that although they may be useful in ameliorating the hyperinflammatory response induced by the virus infection, they will not significantly reduce the replication of the virus, the inducer of inflammatory response. Thus, anti-inflammatory agents may only be useful in treating virus lung infections if used in combination with agents that inhibit virus replication. In summary, the data suggest that induction of IFN by mismatched dsRNA or actual treatment with exogenous IFN-alpha can inhibit SARS-CoV replication in the lungs of mice...|$|E

40|$|The {{developing}} {{epidemic of}} {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS) has prompted a broadly based research effort to find drugs and vaccines for preventing and treating this disease. Compounds such as zidovudine (AZT), <b>ampligen</b> and the broad spectrum of pyrimidine dideaxynucleosides have yielded some promise {{for the treatment of}} AIDS in terms of better quality of life for sufferers, but no cure is in sight yet. Also the quest for therapeutic and preventative vaccines has also been ongoing for several years. The latest development of the Salk vaccine has led to wild speculation in the lay press of a cure for AIDS. However, some seemingly insurmountable practical and moral-ethical problems beset both the development of AIDS chemotherapy and an AIDS vaccine. The most vexing of these problems is the lack of a suitable animal model for testing and the consequent questions of whether uninfected or HIV-infected but symptom-free volunteers can or should be used in testing potentially lethal compounds or vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Hemorrhagic {{fever of}} arenaviral origin is a {{frequently}} fatal infectious disease of considerable {{priority to the}} biodefense mission. Historically, the treatment of arenaviral infections with alpha interferons has not yielded favorable results. Here we present evidence that interferon alfacon- 1, a nonnaturally occurring bioengineered alpha interferon approved {{for the treatment of}} chronic hepatitis C, is active against Pichinde and Tacaribe arenaviruses in cell culture. In the hamster model of Pichinde virus (PCV) infection, interferon alfacon- 1 treatment significantly protected animals from death, prolonged the survival of those that eventually died, reduced virus titers, and limited liver damage characteristic of PCV-induced disease. Moreover, interferon alfacon- 1 also demonstrated therapeutic activity, to a lesser degree, when the initiation of treatment was delayed up to 2 days post-virus challenge. Despite the observed advantages of interferon alfacon- 1 therapy, efforts to stimulate the immune system with the known interferon inducer poly(I:C 12 U) (<b>Ampligen)</b> offered only limited protection against lethal PCV challenge. Taken together, these data suggest that the increased potency of the bio-optimized interferon alfacon- 1 molecule may be critical to the observed antiviral effects. These data are the first report demonstrating efficacious treatment of acute arenaviral disease with alpha interferon therapy, and further study is warranted...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDendritic cells (DC) are {{key players}} in the {{initiation}} and modulation of adaptive immune responses due to their ability to acquire and present antigen and stimulate T cells. For the induction of effector T cell functions, antigen must be presented by activated DC. In this study, we have compared uptake of antigen by mouse DC in the presence of different Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, which are potent inducers of DC activation. Here we show that the reduction in uptake of soluble antigen {{in the presence of the}} viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analogues polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid and <b>Ampligen</b> is independent of TLR-mediated DC activation. A reduction in antigen uptake by bone marrow-derived and splenic DC was also observed in response to other RNA homopolymers such as polyinosinic and polyguanylic acids, which are known inhibitors of scavenger receptor-mediated endocytosis. Pinocytosis and mannose receptor-mediated uptake of soluble antigen were not affected by any of the tested nucleic acids. The reduction in antigen uptake by dsRNA did not negatively influence the T cell stimulating properties of the DC. In summary, we conclude that the decrease in antigen endocytosis observed in the presence of a variety of TLR agonists is independent of TLR signalling and is caused by competition for specific surface receptors that are involved in the uptake of these TLR agonists and the antigen...|$|E
40|$|Background. Avian H 5 N 1 {{influenza}} A {{virus is}} an emerging pathogen {{with the potential}} to cause substantial human morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the ability of currently licensed seasonal influenza vaccine to confer cross-protection against highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 influenza virus in mice. Methods. BALB/c mice were inoculated 3 times, either intranasally or subcutaneously, with the trivalent in-activated influenza vaccine licensed in Japan for the 2005 – 2006 season. The vaccine included A/NewCaledonia/ 20 / 99 (H 1 N 1), A/NewYork/ 55 / 2004 (H 3 N 2), and B/Shanghai/ 361 / 2002 viral strains and was administered together with poly(I) :poly(C 12 U) (<b>Ampligen)</b> as an adjuvant. At 14 days after the final inoculation, the inoculated mice were challenged with either the A/HongKong/ 483 / 97, the A/Vietnam/ 1194 / 04, or the A/Indonesia/ 6 / 05 strain of H 5 N 1 influenza virus. Results. Compared with noninoculated mice, those inoculated intranasally manifested cross-reactivity of mu-cosal IgA and serum IgG with H 5 N 1 virus, as well as both a reduced H 5 N 1 virus titer in nasal-wash samples and increased survival, after challenge with H 5 N 1 virus. Subcutaneous inoculation did not induce a cross-reactive IgA response and did not afford protection against H 5 N 1 viral infection. Conclusions.

40|$|Previous {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated that}} double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) can exert an antiproliferative effect on human tumor cells, independent of interferon (IFN) induction. However, the mechanism by which dsRNAs inhibit tumor growth has not been elucidated. As {{a first step in}} determining the molecular events responsible for growth arrest, we have explored the role of signal transduction through the cAMP system in the antiproliferative effect of the mismatched dsRNA, r(I) n. r(C 12,U) n (<b>Ampligen).</b> These studies utilized the human glioma cell line A 1235, which does not produce detectable levels of IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma in response to mismatched dsRNA treatment. Treatment of A 1235 cells with mismatched dsRNA in combination with either 1 -(5 -isoquinolinesulfonyl) - 2 -methylpiperazine (H- 7), which inhibits cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, or N-(2 -guanidinoethyl) - 5 -isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA 1004), which preferentially inhibits the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, yielded an antagonism of the mismatched dsRNA-induced antiproliferative effect. Measurement of adenylate cyclase activation showed a dose-dependent increase in activity at antiproliferative mismatched dsRNA concentrations, but not at lower, nonantiproliferative doses. This increase in activity was rapid, seen as early as 30 sec after initiation of treatment, and it was sustained at peak levels for 1 - 2 hr. Analysis of the intracellular cAMP concentration gave similar kinetics of induction. Exposure of cells to the stable cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP yielded dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth. The cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine also inhibited proliferation. In contrast, neither H- 7 nor HA 1004 had an effect on growth inhibition induced by human natural IFN-alpha treatment. In addition, antiproliferative doses of IFN-alpha did not increase cAMP concentrations. These results indicate that the cAMP system is utilized by mismatched dsRNA as an early signal transduction mechanism for growth control. Furthermore, the antiproliferative effects induced by mismatched dsRNA and IFN can occur by different mechanisms of action...|$|E
