25|$|A trisboryl iridium complex {{has been}} {{proposed}} to facilitate the mechanism {{for each of these}} reactions that result in C–H borylation of arenes and heteroarenes.

25|$|Using {{the same}} {{catalyst}} system directing groups {{can be employed}} to achieve regioselectivity without substituents as steric mediators. For example, Boebel and Hartwig reported a method to conduct ortho-borylation where a dimethyl-hydrosilyl directing group on the <b>arene</b> undergoes iridium catalyzed borylation at the C–H bond ortho to the silane directing group. Selectivity for the ortho position {{in the case of}} using hydrosilyl directing groups has been attributed to reversible addition of the Si-H bond to the metal center, leading to preferential cleavage of the C–H bond ortho to the hydrosilyl substituent. Several other strategies to achieve ortho-borylation of arenes have been developed using various directing groups.|$|E

25|$|The word calixarene {{is derived}} from calix or chalice because this type of {{molecule}} resembles a vase and from the word <b>arene</b> that refers to the aromatic building block. Calixarenes have hydrophobic cavities that can hold smaller molecules or ions and belong to the class of cavitands known in host-guest chemistry.

25|$|In 1865, the German chemist Friedrich August Kekulé {{published}} {{a paper in}} French (for he was then teaching in Francophone Belgium) suggesting that the structure contained a ring of six carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds.

Kekulé used evidence that had accumulated in the intervening years—namely, that there always appeared to be only one isomer of any monoderivative of benzene, and that there always appeared to be exactly three isomers of every disubstituted derivative—now understood to correspond to the ortho, meta, and para patterns of <b>arene</b> substitution—to argue {{in support of his}} proposed structure. Kekulé's symmetrical ring could explain these curious facts, as well as benzene's 1:1 carbon-hydrogen ratio.|$|E
25|$|Reductions {{employing}} {{an excess}} of alkali metals in ammonia or amines are extremely rapid and should be quenched {{after a minute or}} so of reaction time—longer reaction times promote side reactions. When lithium or sodium in ammonia is used, the persistence of a deep blue color in the solution (due to solvated electrons) is a sign that the reaction is complete. Reductions employing alkali metal <b>arene</b> radical anion complexes similarly require a large excess of the reducing agent, very low temperatures and short reaction times. Reductive desulfonylations and reductive eliminations employing alkali or alkaline earth metals in ammonia present a high fire hazard and should be conducted in a properly functioning chemical fume hood away from flammable solvents. Ammonia is a corrosive gas with a pungent odor. Alkali metals react violently with water or even moist air to generate hydrogen, which can then be ignited by the heat of the reaction.|$|E

25|$|According to Dictys, Odysseus {{fled from}} Troy after {{being accused of}} murdering Aias. He first went north to the Black Sea for a while; he sacked the Ciconian town of Ismarus in Thrace on his way back. After visiting the lotus-eaters he went to Sicily, where he {{encountered}} three (or four) brothers, Antiphates, Cyclops, and Polyphemus (and possibly Laestrygon, according to Septimius), who each ruled {{a portion of the}} island. Odysseus and his men were mistreated by each of these kings in turn. Notably, they were imprisoned by Polyphemus when one of Odysseus' men fell in love with Polyphemus' daughter (<b>Arene</b> or Elpe) and tried to kidnap her; but they escaped. They passed through the Aeolian Islands, but the surviving accounts of Dictys do not give specific locations {{for the rest of the}} wanderings. Malalas' account of Dictys, however, tells us that Circe and Calypso were sisters ruling over neighbouring islands; that Odysseus visited a lake called Nekyopompos ("guide of the dead") near the sea, whose inhabitants were seers; that he passed some rocks called the Seirenidai; and Cedrenus' account seems to identify Scheria with Corfu, or at least an island near Ithaca.|$|E
