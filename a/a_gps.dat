Both of her parents are mortal and her powers were inherited from her maternal grandmother, making Helen a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. Billie has the basic abilities of a witch, including casting spells, performing rituals, brewing potions, scrying for lost people or objects using of a crystal pendant, and communicating with the dead. She also has the power of telekinesis and later develops the ability to warp reality using a power known as projection. She is shown mastering her original powers very easily and adapting them using unconventional methods, such as attaching a large quartz crystal to her computer's mouse to scry through <b>a</b> <b>GPS</b> system. Her telekinesis enables her to perform acrobatic moves, such as backflips. However, she experiences difficulty using her power of projection due to her fear of hurting others.

5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones allow {{players to}} freely explore the game world, which is {{typically}} {{on the scale}} of an entire city. Some games base their level design on real world cities, such as London, New York City, and Los Angeles. Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot. Some games put greater emphasis on leaping, climbing, and even swimming. Exploring the world is not just necessary to complete objectives, but also to gain valuable items, weapons, and vehicles. Different parts of the game world may be controlled by different enemy factions, who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways. However, more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their own territory. The freedom of navigating a huge game world may be overwhelming or confusing for new players. Game designers {{have come up with a}} variety of navigational aids to solve this problem. A mini-map feature is common, while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV go so far as to offer <b>a</b> <b>GPS</b> service. Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing.|$|E

40|$|In the Norwegian {{capitation}} system each {{general practitioner}} (<b>GP)</b> has <b>a</b> personal list of patients. The payment {{system is a}} mix of a capitation fee and fee-for-service. From a model of <b>a</b> <b>GP’s</b> decisions we derive the optimal practice profile contingent on whether <b>a</b> <b>GP</b> experiences <b>a</b> shortage of patients or not. We also find the conditions for whether <b>a</b> <b>GP,</b> who experiences <b>a</b> shortage of patients, is likely {{to increase the number of}} services he provides to his patients. Data give us the opportunity to reveal patient shortage, i. e. a positive difference between <b>a</b> <b>GP’s</b> preferred and actual list size, at the individual practice level. From the analysis of 2587 Norwegian <b>GPs</b> (out of <b>a</b> total 3650) the main result is that patient shortage has a positive effect on <b>a</b> <b>GP’s</b> intensity of service provision and hence, on the income per listed person. We also find that <b>a</b> <b>GP’s</b> income per listed person is influenced by the composition of the list according to indicators of need for services, and of accessibility according to the GP density in the municipality. These results are also valid when possible selection bias is accounted for, although the magnitude of the effects is then smaller. economic motives; capitation; general practice; patient shortage; service provision...|$|R

This analysis compares the determinants of a cervical cancer screening examination with the determinants of <b>a</b> <b>GP</b> visit in the same year and investigates if cervical cancer screening participation is more likely for women who visit their <b>GP.</b> <b>A</b> recursive probit model was used to analyse the determinants of GP visits and cervical cancer screening examinations. GP visits were considered to be endogenous in the cervical cancer screening examination. The analysed sample consisted of 52, 551 observations from 8, 386 women of the British Household Panel Survey. The analysis showed that a higher education level and a worsening self-perceived health status increased the probability of <b>a</b> <b>GP</b> visit, whereas smoking decreased the probability of <b>a</b> <b>GP</b> visit. GP visits enhanced the uptake of a cervical cancer screening examination in the same period. The only variables which had the same positive effect on both dependent variables were higher education and living with a partner. The probability of a cervical cancer screening examination increased also with previous cervical cancer screening examinations and being in the recommended age groups. All other variables had different results for the uptake of <b>a</b> <b>GP</b> visit or <b>a</b> cervical cancer screening examination.

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of primary care is {{providing}} equitable health-care, meaning equal access, equal treatment and equal outcomes of healthcare for all in equal need. Some studies show that patients from lower socioeconomic groups visit <b>a</b> <b>GP</b> more often, while other studies {{show that they are}} more likely to postpone a visit to <b>a</b> <b>GP.</b> In this study, we want to explore within the social group of low-income patients living in Flanders, Belgium, which patients have a higher risk of postponing a visit to <b>a</b> <b>GP.</b> <b>A</b> face-to-face questionnaire was administered among 606 low-income users of Public Social Services. The questionnaire consisted of questions on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, social networks, health and healthcare use. A multivariate logistic regression model was built to study the relationship between postponing or cancelling <b>a</b> <b>GP</b> visit which respondents thought they needed and variables on health, socio-demographic background. The multivariate regression indicates that depression, self-rated health and trust in the GP independently predict postponing a visit to <b>a</b> <b>GP.</b> Low-income people with a low trust in the <b>GP,</b> people with <b>a</b> poor self-rated health and people suffering from a severe depression are more likely to postpone or cancel <b>a</b> <b>GP</b> visit they thought they needed compared to other people on low incomes.
