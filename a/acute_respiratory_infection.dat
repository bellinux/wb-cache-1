Merapi spewed hot {{clouds in the}} afternoon. Sulfatara smoke was visible from several posts and avalanches were observed. Mount Merapi erupted at 10:10 local time Monday morning spewing hot clouds and dark fog masses in easterly direction punctuated by loud explosions. Lt Col Soekoso Wahyudi, chief of the Boyolali district military command, was reported by Antara news as saying the explosions this time were louder than those of Sunday evening 31 October. The hot clouds descended on part of the mountain slopes and moved in easterly direction. Local military and police commands deployed personnel on roads in areas around the mountain to regulate traffic which had become clogged by vehicles and people rushing to leave the danger zones. Reports from Klaten, Sleman and Boyolali districts suggested the volcanic explosions were so loud they caused panic and a rush to seek refuge. Merapi's heat and hot ash clouds continued to erupt throughout the day. A thick eruptive ash cloud was reported to rise [...] into the air. The Darwin VAAC reported that a possible eruption on 1 November produced an ash plume that rose to an altitude of [...] a.s.l., according to ground-based reports, analyses of satellite imagery, and web camera views. The WHO reported that Mount Merapi spewed out hot clouds of gas and ash again on Monday morning, 1 November 2010 at around 10:05 local time. Clouds of hot ash and gas billowed up to [...] into the atmosphere, before cascading back down up to [...] around the slopes of Merapi. An uninterrupted stream of smoke clouds were sent into the air for 40 minutes, heading southward toward a nearby river in Sleman regency, and took with it an estimated 2million cubic metres of rock and earth from the peak. From the previous eruption, Crisis Center MOH reported 42 people died and 103 people were admitted to several health facilities with respiratory difficulties and burn injuries.

The authors of the study included Panjabi as well as researchers from the Liberian health ministry, the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College, and Harvard University.

Furthermore, CHWs significantly increased the rates of pregnant women undergoing clinic-based births with a skilled provider by 28.2 percentage points. In addition, despite the Ebola virus disease outbreak, which caused substantial declines in health-care utilization in other regions of the country, the study showed increases in health-care use from formal providers for fever, <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>infection,</b> and diarrhea among children and facility-based delivery among pregnant women. The study noted:practices from this programme are being scaled up to over 240 remote communities in adjacent Rivercess County.
