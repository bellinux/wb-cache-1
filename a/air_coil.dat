50|$|A typical {{run-around}} coil system comprises {{two or more}} multi-row {{finned tube}} coils connected to each other by a pumped pipework circuit. The pipework is charged with a heat exchange fluid, normally water, which picks up heat from the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> and gives up heat to the supply <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> before returning again. Thus heat from the exhaust air stream is transferred through the pipework coil to the circulating fluid, and then from the fluid through the pipework coil to the supply air stream.|$|E
5000|$|In {{practical}} situations, when an <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> freeze stat is not used, bypassed, or defeated, the <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> can freeze, {{and this}} causes a lack of air flow to the facility. [...] By contrast, when a water coil freeze stat is not used, the water coil can get so cold that it can freeze the cooling liquid in the exchanger and burst the exchanger. [...] A ruptured heat exchanger mixes contaminants such as freon and oil into the coolant. The intrusion of coolant into the delicately balanced refrigeration system can cause expensive damage to components such as the freon compressor, and the reversing valve.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} an <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> freeze stat {{is to keep}} the refrigerant-to-air heat {{exchanger}} (commonly called air coils) from freezing. This kind of freeze stat is typically used for heating coils which are exposed to outside air and is usually installed on the supply air side of the coil. [...] To accomplish this, they typically shut down the flow of outside air to a mixing box when the temperature reaches a predetermined setpoint. The setpoint for <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> freeze stats is typically about 38 degrees Fahrenheit which is approximately when the dew point temperature of the air starts to drop below freezing point.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>air</b> core <b>coil</b> {{describes}} an inductor {{that does not}} use a magnetic core made of a ferromagnetic material. The term refers to coils wound on plastic, ceramic, or other nonmagnetic forms, {{as well as those}} that have only air inside the windings. <b>Air</b> core <b>coils</b> have lower inductance than ferromagnetic core coils, but are often used at high frequencies because they are free from energy losses called core losses that occur in ferromagnetic cores, which increase with frequency.

40|$|Among {{palm oil}} millers, the {{ripeness}} of oil palm Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) is determined through visual inspection. To increase {{the productivity of}} the millers, many researchers have proposed with a new detection method to replace the conventional one. The sensitivity of such a sensor {{plays a crucial role}} in determining the effectiveness of the method. In our preliminary study a novel oil palm fruit sensor to detect the maturity of oil palm fruit bunches is proposed. The design of the proposed <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> sensor based on an inductive sensor is further investigated to improve its sensitivity. This paper investigates the results pertaining to the effects of the <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> structure of an oil palm fruit sensor, taking consideration of the used copper wire diameter ranging from 0. 10 mm to 0. 18 mm with 60 turns. The flat-type shape of <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> was used on twenty samples of fruitlets from two categories, namely ripe and unripe. Samples are tested with frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 120 MHz. The sensitivity of the sensor between air to fruitlet samples increases as the coil diameter increases. As for the sensitivity differences between ripe and unripe samples, the 5 mm <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> length with the 0. 12 mm coil diameter provides the highest percentage difference between samples and it is amongst the highest deviation value between samples. The result from this study is important to improve the sensitivity of the inductive oil palm fruit sensor mainly with regards to the design of the <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> structure.

40|$|A DX <b>air</b> cooling <b>coil</b> may {{normally}} {{be assumed to}} have two regions in its refrigerant side, according to refrigerant status, a two-phase region (TPR) and a superheated region (SPR). Dry air side surface of the SPR in a DX <b>air</b> cooling <b>coil</b> has been normally assumed in lumped-parameter mathematical models previously developed without however being validated.

40|$|As {{the main}} {{exporter}} {{in the oil}} palm industry, {{the need to improve}} the quality of palm oil has become the main interest among all the palm oil millers in Malaysia. To produce good quality palm oil, it is important for the miller to harvest a good oil palm Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB). Conventionally, the main reference used by Malaysian harvesters is the manual grading standard published by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB). A good oil palm FFB consists of all matured fruitlets, aged between 18 to 21 weeks of antheses (WAA). To expedite the harvesting process, it is crucial to implement an automated detection system for determining the maturity of the oil palm FFB. Various automated detection methods have been proposed by researchers in the field to replace the conventional method. In our preliminary study, a novel oil palm fruit sensor to detect the maturity of oil palm fruit bunch was proposed. The design of the proposed <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> sensor based on the inductive sensor was further investigated mainly in the context of the effect of coil diameter to improve its sensitivity. In this paper, the sensitivity of the inductive sensor was further examined with a dual flat-type shape of <b>air</b> <b>coil.</b> The dual air coils were tested on fifteen samples of fruitlet from two categories, namely ripe and unripe.
