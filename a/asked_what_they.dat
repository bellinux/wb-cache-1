The area west of Green River was so remote that survey crews followed wild horses with jeeps to survey parts of the route. According to a story told at the highway's dedication, by an engineer who surveyed the highway, his group was approached by a sheep rancher and <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing.

Meymaneh {{is located in}} northwestern Afghanistan, which has become {{increasingly}} restless in recent years. Both the military and political heads {{of the armed forces}} agreed about the weakened state of the base. When the Norwegian Army was <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> needed to defend their position, they asked for 120 troops and long-range weapons. They also requested a mobile reaction force, so that allies in the region could assist each other if they came under heavy attack.|$|E

De Leyva then demanded to acknowledge their duty and obedience to the Spanish king but this was flatly refused by Wilkinson. After more demands were refused De Leyva then sent an ultimatum they would, 'either be sunk or be escorted into port' but he was rebuffed once more and the two fleets prepared for battle.|$|E

25|$|In 1849, George Long {{writes that}} Wallachia and Moldavia are {{separated}} {{only by a}} political boundary and that their history is closely connected. About the latter he {{says that it is}} inhabited mainly by Wallachians who call themselves Roomoon (Romanian). Ethnologist Robert Gordon Latham, writes in 1854, that the name by which a Wallachian, Moldavian or a Bessarabian designates himself is Roman or Rumanyo (Romanian), a name the author also applies to the Romance speakers of Macedonia. Similarly, in 1845, German brothers Arthur Schott and Albert Schott (historian) write in the beginning of their book – Walachische Mährchen (Wallachian Fairy Tales) – that Wallachians live in Wallachia, Moldavia, Transylvania, Hungary, Macedonia and Thessaly. The authors also mentions that Wallachians respond Eo sum Romanu (I am Romanian) when <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are.|$|E

Daniels tells Burrell that he needs the patrol division to begin searching for houses. Daniels leaves to begin organizing a citywide search.|$|E

When series background designer Kenny Pittenger was <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were, he answered, [...] "They function as clouds in a way, but since the show takes place underwater, they aren't really clouds. Because of the tiki influence on the show, the background painters use a lot of pattern."

500|$|The use of {{the phrase}} as a {{reference}} to demagoguery and hypocrisy is traced to a Russian political joke about a dispute between an American and a Soviet man. After receiving criticism of his country beca{{use of the}} deaths caused by the 1905 anti-Jewish Kishinev pogrom, the Russian Ambassador to the United States pointed out [...] "Americans had recently lynched blacks". The Russian Ambassador said locals engaged in violence when drunk, [...] "just like Americans." [...] Soviet artist Dmitri Moor produced the lithograph Freedom to the Prisoners of Scottsboro!, after the 1931 trial of the Scottsboro Boys of Alabama. The treatment of the Scottsboro Boys popularized the phrase in usage by the Soviet Union against the U.S. {{as a form of}} criticism against those who themselves criticized human rights abuses. In his 1934 book Russia Today: What Can We Learn from It?, Sherwood Eddy wrote: [...] "In the most remote villages of Russia today Americans are frequently <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are going to do to the Scottsboro Negro boys and why they lynch Negroes." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was clear}} that Lasseter and Jobs {{believed}} that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg. Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Universal lot's Technicolor facility in Universal City, where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton. When Katzenberg <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing next, Lasseter described what would become A Bug's Life in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas. Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story, and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. [...] "If this hits, it's {{going to be like}} space movies after Star Wars" [...] for computer animation companies, he told various friends. [...] "I should have been wary," [...] Lasseter later recalled. [...] "Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Edgeworth {{observed}} on his wife's death that being {{familiar with the}} experimental method in science, {{she was surprised to}} find that educational theory was based on very little empirical evidence, and set out to apply experimental science to child education and devised, executed and recorded experiments with children. She conceived and executed a register (2 volumes 1778–1779) of the reaction of children to new knowledge and experience, given her interest in applying experimental science to the field of child education. She observed the questions that children <b>asked,</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did, and how they solved problems. An extensive example of her recorded dialogue is given by Richard and Maria Edgeworth in [...] "Practical Education". This formed the basis of Richard Edgeworth's Essays on professional education (1809). In the Bodleian Library there is a short story in manuscript dated 1787 and other fragments attributed to Honora Sneyd. Her parents' principles of childhood education were to be a profound influence on Maria Edgeworth's own career as a writer for children.|$|E

500|$|The school's {{philosophy}} {{is that students}} learn best at their own pace. The original curriculum was a cross between [...] "instruction and home life". The Albany Free School has no firm schedule and does not grade students. The day begins at 8:15a.m. and students are <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want to do each day. Students are grouped by age and present their own plan for each day. They pursue various projects including writing, filmmaking, and studying language or history. The school also offers structured math and reading classes {{for those who want}} it. Classes tend to have five to seven students per teacher and the school's teacher–student relationships are close. Teachers report a relative ease in holding students accountable to their stated plans. In 2006, the school had ten teachers, four interns, and a number of parent volunteers for 58 students between the ages of three and fourteen (pre-K to eighth grade). The school has a [...] "Living and Learning" [...] program between 10 a.m. and noon, followed by lunch, which the students make themselves as part of the program. The children play sports until their 3 p.m. class and school ends at 4 p.m.|$|E
