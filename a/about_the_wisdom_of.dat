5|$|Sherman's {{military}} {{record in}} 1862–63 was mixed. In December 1862, forces {{under his command}} suffered a severe repulse at the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou, just north of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Soon after, his XV Corps was ordered to join Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand in his successful assault on Arkansas Post, generally regarded as a politically motivated distraction from the effort to capture Vicksburg. Before the Vicksburg Campaign {{in the spring of}} 1863, Sherman expressed serious reservations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>of</b> Grant's unorthodox strategy, but he went on to perform well in that campaign under Grant's supervision.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of his last {{contemporary}} on the faculty in 1845, Tucker resigned his professorship and moved to Philadelphia, where he enjoyed the availability of more libraries, meetings at the American Philosophical Society and a reunion with his friend Robley Dunglison. Nevertheless, there were drawbacks – for one, the lack of accommodation that slaveholding had brought him—he had emancipated all five of his slaves upon his departure from Charlottesville. He later expressed doubt <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>of</b> the latter decision when he learned that three of them had, by law, been exiled from Virginia, and shortly thereafter died. As well, the two freed slaves who accompanied him to Philadelphia immediately deserted their posts upon arrival there.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Kentucky, accepting the pastorate of First Presbyterian Church of Lexington. His return to Kentucky was also {{motivated by a}} growing fondness for his cousin, Virginia Hart Shelby, who had cared for two of his children during his stay in Pennsylvania. Virginia was the widow of Alfred Shelby, the son of Isaac Shelby, who was twice governor of Kentucky. Their written exchanges included love poems from Robert and concerned questions from Virginia <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>of</b> engaging in a relationship. Despite being advised by her sisters to avoid the marriage and her own wavering on the issue, the two were married in April 1847. They had three children, only one of whom survived to adulthood. Disagreements among the children of both partners' previous marriages exacerbated an already tense union, which almost ended in divorce in September 1856. Robert managed to reconcile with his wife, and they remained together until Virginia's death in 1859.|$|E

5|$|The WSPU's {{approval}} of property destruction {{led to the}} departure of several important members. The first were Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and her husband Frederick. They had long been integral members of the group's leadership but found themselves in conflict with Christabel <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>of</b> such volatile tactics. After returning from a vacation in Canada they found that Pankhurst had expelled them from the WSPU. The pair found the decision appalling, but to avoid a schism in the movement they continued to praise Pankhurst and the organisation in public. Around the same time, Emmeline's daughter Adela left the group. She disapproved of WSPU endorsement of property destruction and felt that a heavier emphasis on socialism was necessary. Adela's relationship with her family – especially Christabel – was also strained as a result.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} Lord Richard {{was one of}} a number of events during 1978 that brought UDI to an abrupt end. The loss of one man did not amount to much in the whole scheme of things, but it was the {{identity}} of that man and the nature of his loss that had an impact. One factor that had sustained UDI since 1965 was tacit support from some elements in the British establishment who were variously influenced by anti-communism, appreciation of the colonial era's achievements and a wish to safeguard investments. Lord Richard was the embodiment of that support. His death brought the UDI project into question and made certain people think very hard <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|E

500|$|For the 1969 season, Rindt {{signed for}} the 1968 World Constructors' Champion Lotus, where {{he joined the}} {{defending}} Drivers' Champion Graham Hill. Rindt felt uncomfortable with the move, owing to the notorious unreliability of the Lotus car; in a twenty-month period between 1967 and 1969, the team was involved in 31 accidents. Hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970, which led him to joke: [...] "Every time I am being overtaken by my own wheel, I know I am in a Lotus." [...] When Rindt joined Lotus, his friend and de facto manager Bernie Ecclestone, who had negotiated the deal, remarked that they were aware that Brabham {{may have been a}} better choice of team but the speed of the Lotus gave Rindt a chance to win the championship. Rindt commented: [...] "At Lotus, I can either be world champion or die." [...] Because of his uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>of</b> joining the team, Rindt did not sign the Lotus contract until shortly before the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix.|$|E
500|$|Charles Monselet, in Le Monde Illustré, praised Taillade and the [...] "curious" [...] {{nature of}} the voyages, but found the play as a whole tiresome. On the other hand, two other major {{illustrated}} journals, L'Illustration and L'Univers Illustré, greeted the play with wholly positive reviews, particularly lauding the spectacular staging. Auguste Vitu gave the play a largely positive review, praising the actors, the decor, {{and the use of}} Verne's ideas, but expressed doubts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>of</b> combining so many disparate styles—dramatic realism, scientific fiction, and pure fantasy—in one production. Anonymous reviewers in the Revue politique et littéraire and the Revue Britannique, as well as [...] in Le Correspondant and Arthur Heulhard in the Chronique de l'Art, all wrote similarly mixed reviews, speaking highly of the actors and of Verne's characters and concepts but saying that d'Ennery's dramatizations and revisions were clumsy. In his 1910 history of the féerie, Paul Ginisty hailed Journey Through the Impossible for introducing a [...] "scientific element" [...] to the genre and for bringing characters from Verne's books to the stage, but sharply criticized d'Ennery for putting [...] "furiously outdated" [...] sentiments in the mouth of the character Volsius.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. Goebbels {{was one of the most}} enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the Reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: [...] "ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing." [...] In the lead-up to the Sudetenland crisis in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the Sudeten Germans while campaigning against the Czech government. Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing [...] "war panic" [...] in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity. After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in Danzig and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war. He privately held doubts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>of</b> risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.|$|E

2500|$|While {{there has}} been little publicized {{criticism}} of the concept of cognitive liberty itself, drug policy reform and the concept of human enhancement, both closely linked to cognitive liberty, remain highly controversial issues. The risks inherent in removing restrictions on controlled cognitive-enhancing drugs, including of widening the gap between those able to afford such treatments and those unable to do so, have caused many to remain skeptical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>of</b> recognizing cognitive liberty as a right. Political philosopher and Harvard University professor Michael J.
