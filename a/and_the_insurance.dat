5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners {{to do something with}} the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At the time of its demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} after the fire One Meridian Plaza {{stood in the middle}} of Philadelphia vacant. The fate of the {{building}} was up in the air as the building's owners <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> company prepared for ligation on how to proceed with repairs, who would control those repairs, and at what cost. E/R Partners were proposing deconstructing the building down to the 19th floor and rebuilding from there. Aetna Corporation, the fire insurer, claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used cutting $115 million in repair costs from the owner's $250 million estimate. Aetna also proposed taking over the reconstruction. E/R Partners spent $50 million securing One Meridian Plaza and spent up to $500,000 a month on security guards, utilities and inspections by engineers as the building stood empty.|$|E
5|$|Tara {{finds her}} {{strength}} in Shiv, a wiser and more experienced counterpart. The two start {{spending most of}} their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra (Rajat Kapoor), tells Tara that Rajat has a hematoma in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat {{would not want to}} take the risk, and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> companies who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts that she is a realist, and dismisses Shiv for being selfish and making his wife go through pain for his own sake.|$|E

25|$|Other {{types of}} {{third-party}} mailings—among them stock-purchase confirmation slips, annual reports and proxy statements—have {{also been found}} to be part of ongoing fraudulent schemes and thus supporting mail fraud convictions. Months after Schmuck, the Seventh Circuit relied on it in overturning a district court's acquittal of the mail fraud charges of two Chicago men accused of an insurance-fraud scheme, holding that correspondence between their lawyer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> company over settling the claim was part of their scheme. Flaum followed the Supreme Court in rejecting the counterproductivity argument. In a civil suit under RICO, Schmuck was read to allow the plaintiff telephone company to argue that the bills it sent customers allegedly bilked by the defendant premium texting provider constituted mail fraud.|$|E
25|$|In January 1872 Isaac Rich died, {{leaving the}} vast {{bulk of his}} estate to a trust that would go to Boston University after ten years of growth while the University was organized.

By December, however, the Great Boston Fire of 1872 had destroyed {{all but one of the}} buildings Rich had left to the University, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> companies with which they had been insured were bankrupt.

25|$|In {{order to}} recruit migrant {{domestic}} workers, Lebanese recruitment agencies collaborate with {{agencies in the}} migrant sending countries. Migrant domestic workers are required to pay a fee to the local agent in their home country, usually a large sum of money which causes them to incur a large debt. Once the fee transaction is complete the agency arranges the transportation. The employer is obliged to meet the migrant worker at the airport gate where a general security guard who holds the employee's passport will hand it over directly to the employer. A medical examination and the resulting report must be fulfilled before the work permit is issued <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> for the worker must be paid by the employer within three months. A standard unified contract is drawn up which is more in favour of the employer than the migrant worker.|$|E
25|$|After Georgian independence, the {{government}} found that its Soviet-style centralized healthcare system was underfunded and failing. State-run centralized medical facilities were typically inefficient {{and in need}} of renovation and technological upgrades. As a result, {{the government}} privatized almost all public hospitals and clinics, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> system was deregulated, with private insurance companies able to offer coverage. Only a few specialized facilities for mental health and infectious diseases remained in government hands, and the state continued to provide health insurance for those below the poverty line, whose insurance was paid for by public funds and provided by private insurers, and some civil servants, amounting to about 40% of the population. As a result, the level of healthcare greatly improved, with new hospitals and clinics beginning to replace older facilities. However, a portion of the population was uninsured, as it could not afford private insurance and did not qualify for public insurance.|$|E
25|$|The two-year {{war between}} the ABA and the USBA was perhaps the ugliest rivalry that BMX has ever saw. It seems the USBA was making most of the {{aggressive}} moves. The motivation for rivalries like this was the $2 million to $4 million in revenue yearly that BMX generated at the time. Compared to other older more established sports like baseball, European football (soccer), American football and auto racing, this was a pittance but still enough to generate bad promoters and political infighting between and within sanctioning bodies. Track operators had quite thin profit margins to work with, which perhaps made the back biting even worse since there was so little to go around. There was a slump in the BMX racing market as mentioned {{with the growth of}} Freestyle, the resurgence of skateboarding siphoning off young people <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> crises to drain resources further. Pretty desperate times for the organizers of BMX racing, and desperate times generate desperate acts, including actions straight out of Watergate.|$|E

25|$|Further {{expansions}} to Lian {{was also}} considered, but management was skeptical to having two destinations, since {{they would not}} create the necessary critical mass. Then the tavern and farm at Ugla burnt down in 1931, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> company allowed the insurance money {{to be used to}} be built at Lian. To finance the line extension, Graakalbanen decided to create a new company; A/S Ugla–Lian was organized {{in such a way that}} it would have no expenses, only income. A/S Ugla–Lian would build the line, and Graakalbanen would pay NOK 0.05 per passenger freighted on the line. Graakalbanen would cover all operating, maintenance and administrative expensive, even for the other company. The initial sale raised NOK 73,375. Wholesaler Johan P. Dahl bought the largest share, for NOK 10,000, that he gave to the construction workers. The company was founded on 20 December 1932, and had its share capital expanded to 80,000 two years later.|$|E
