5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grounding {{in a sense of}} duty based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over the conduct of the war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|Carey has {{routinely}} written {{throughout his}} career, including developing his stand-up comedy routines {{in his early}} stand-up career, and then moving on to assist in writing sitcoms. In 1997, Carey published his autobiography, , wherein he shared memories of his early childhood <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's death when he was eight. He also revealed that he was once molested, had suffered bouts of depression, and had made two suicide attempts by swallowing {{a large amount of}} sleeping pills. The book discusses his college fraternity years while attending Kent State University and his professional career up to that time. The book featured large amounts of profanity and, as the title suggests, includes multiple dirty jokes (there is one at the start of each chapter) and references to beer, which was a departure from his on-screen persona. The book was featured on The New York Times bestseller list for three months.|$|E
50|$|John Work Garrett <b>and</b> several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{family members}} were well known {{collectors}} <b>of</b> rare books <b>and</b> manuscripts, coins and other items.

5|$|Controversy was ignited {{with the}} {{publication}} of Roland Huntford's book Scott and Amundsen (1979, re-published and televised in 1985 as The Last Place on Earth). Huntford was critical of Scott's supposedly authoritarian leadership style <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> poor judgment of men, and blamed him for a series of organisational failures that led to the death of everyone in the polar party. Scott's personal standing suffered from these attacks; efforts to restore his reputation have included the account by Ranulph Fiennes (a direct rebuttal of Huntford's version), Susan Solomon's scientific analysis of the weather conditions that ultimately defeated Scott, David Cranes's 2005 biography of Scott, and Karen May's new analysis of Scott's disobeyed orders specifying that the dog teams transport his returning party swiftly back to the base camp.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his mentor Cai E (November 1916) <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first wife, Zhu {{developed}} a severe opium habit that afflicted him until 1922, when he underwent treatment in Shanghai. His troops continued to support him, and so he consolidated his forces to become a warlord. In 1920, after his troops were driven from Sichuan toward the Tibetan border, he returned to Yunnan as a public security commissioner of the provincial government. Around this time he decided to leave China for study in Europe. He first traveled to Shanghai, where he broke his opium habit and, according to historians of the Kuomintang, met Dr. Sun Yat-sen. He attempted to join the Chinese Communist Party in early 1922, but was rejected due to his being a warlord.|$|E
5|$|For the 2007 presidential {{election}}, Le Pen and Mégret {{agreed to}} join forces. Le Pen came fourth in the election with 11% of the vote, and the party won no seats in the legislative election of the same year. The party's 4.3% support was the lowest score since the 1981 election and only one candidate, Marine Le Pen in Pas de Calais, reached the runoff (where she was defeated by the Socialist incumbent). These electoral defeats partly accounted for the party's financial problems. Le Pen announced {{the sale of the}} FN headquarters in Saint-Cloud, Le Paquebot, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personal armoured car. Twenty permanent employees of the FN were also dismissed in 2008. In the 2010 regional elections the FN appeared to have re-emerged on the political scene after surprisingly winning almost 12% of the overall vote and 118 seats.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí left {{hardly any}} written documents, apart from {{technical}} reports {{of his works}} required by official authorities, some letters to friends (particularly to Joan Maragall) and a few journal articles. Some quotes collected by his assistants and disciples have been preserved, above all by Josep Francesc Ràfols, Joan Bergós, Cèsar Martinell and Isidre Puig i Boada. The only written document Gaudí left {{is known as the}} Manuscrito de Reus (Reus Manuscript) (1873–1878), a kind of student diary in which he collected diverse impressions of architecture and decorating, putting forward his ideas on the subject. Included are an analysis of the Christian church <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ancestral home, as well as a text about ornamentation and comments on the design of a desk.|$|E
5|$|Hearing of Olid's rebellion, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{clash with}} González, Cortés sent his cousin Francisco de las Casas {{to bring the}} rival captains into line. Cortés was {{confident}} {{that the majority of}} Olid's men would rally to las Casas, and only assigned him about 150 men for the expedition. Las Casas arrived off Triunfo de la Cruz as Olid was making preparations to attack Gil González Dávila, who was in the Naco valley.|$|E
5|$|However, {{while he}} cares {{for the welfare}} of the people <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family, Vayne is willing to use any means {{necessary}} to maintain order and retain power. He ensures the complete subjugation of Nabradia and Dalmasca and exterminates their royal families in order to acquire their deifacted nethicite. He confronts Dalmasca's resistance movement with absolute ruthlessness, accepting no surrender. He even {{goes so far as to}} murder his own ailing father and frame the Imperial senators, to put an end to their scheming against himself and Larsa, and to level cities in nethicite testing experiments. Vayne's ultimate goal is to free humanity from the control of the Occurians, a race of god-like beings that have for centuries secretly meddled with the course of human history.|$|E

5|$|James was presumably an Italian, {{like the}} other members of the Gregorian mission. The dates of his birth <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arrival in Britain are unknown. He went with Paulinus to Northumbria {{accompanying}} Æthelburh, sister of King Eadbald of Kent, who went to Northumbria to marry King Edwin. Traditionally this event is dated to 625, but the historian D. P. Kirby argues that the mission to Northumbria probably happened before 619.|$|E
5|$|John's {{position}} in France was considerably {{strengthened by the}} victory at Mirebeau, but John's treatment of his new prisoners <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ally, William de Roches, quickly undermined these gains. De Roches was a powerful Anjou noble, but John largely ignored him, causing considerable offence, whilst the king kept the rebel leaders in such bad conditions that twenty-two of them died. At this time most of the regional nobility were closely linked through kinship, and this behaviour towards their relatives was regarded as unacceptable. William de Roches and other of John's regional allies in Anjou and Brittany deserted him in favour of Philip, and Brittany rose in fresh revolt. John's financial situation was tenuous: once {{factors such as the}} comparative military costs of materiel and soldiers were taken into account, Philip enjoyed a considerable, although not overwhelming, advantage of resources over John.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{came from}} a humble {{seafaring}} background and began his naval career as a boy seaman in 1891. His Antarctic experiences began 10 years later, when he joined Scott's Discovery Expedition as an Able Seaman. In 1907 Shackleton recruited Joyce {{to take charge of}} dogs and sledges on the Nimrod Expedition. Subsequently Joyce was engaged in a similar capacity for Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition in 1911, but left the expedition before it departed for the Antarctic. In 1914 Shackleton recruited Joyce for the Ross Sea party; despite his heroics this expedition marked the end of Joyce's association with the Antarctic, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> exploring career, although he made repeated attempts to join other expeditions.|$|E

5|$|Longford Park was {{the home}} of John Rylands, industrialist, philanthropist, and Manchester's first multi-millionaire, from 1855 {{until his death in}} 1888 <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> widow Enriqueta Augustina Rylands until her death in 1908. The house Rylands {{constructed}} in the park in 1857, Longford Hall, was demolished in 1995. It replaced an earlier house of the same name that had been the residence of Thomas Walker (died 1817) and subsequently of his sons Thomas (died 1836) and Charles. Today only the front porch, coach house, and the stable buildings remain. The estate and hall were sold to Stretford Council in 1911 after a poll of ratepayers, and the park was opened to the public the following year.|$|E

5|$|Sejanus was {{so great}} a person by reason both of his {{excessive}} haughtiness <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vast power, that, to put it briefly, he himself {{seemed to be the}} emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, inasmuch as the latter spent his time on the island of Capreae.|$|E
5|$|Tactically, Pirlo {{was capable}} of playing in several midfield positions, but was usually {{deployed}} by his club and national sides as a central midfielder, {{in the role of}} a deep-lying playmaker, due to his vision and passing accuracy. A highly technical and creative player, Pirlo is regarded by players, managers, and pundits {{as one of the greatest}} ever players in his position, as one of the best midfielders in the world <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> generation, and as one of the greatest Italian players of all time. He started his career in a more advanced role, as an offensive midfielder, and also played as a supporting striker on occasion. Although he was considered a talented young prospect, even drawing comparisons with former Italian footballer Gianni Rivera, Pirlo occasionally struggled in this role, due to his lack of pace, and competition from other talented and more dynamic players in his position.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{starts with}} a {{narration}} by its protagonist, Cal (his masculine identity), also known as Calliope (feminine): He recounts how 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, a recessive condition, caused him to be born with female characteristics. The book continues with accounts of his family's history, starting with his paternal grandparents in their home village and ending with his father's funeral. These accounts cover the conception of Cal, his teenage years, and the discovery of his intersex condition. Throughout the book, Cal weaves his opinion of the events in hindsight <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life after his father's funeral. Eugenides sets Middlesex in the 20th century and interjects historical elements, such as the Balkan Wars, the Nation of Islam, the 1967 Detroit riot, and the Watergate scandal in the story.|$|E
