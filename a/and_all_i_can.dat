25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the same publication, Ne-Yo explained how he wrote the lyrics, [...] "I'm listening to the track, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see is Rihanna and some random person sitting across from each other at the table with a gun sitting {{in the middle of the}} table and playing Russian roulette." [...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he knew she would like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me to be me. That's the coolest thing about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us." [...] When Harmony heard the song, both he and Ne-Yo were aware that they should change some elements and that it had to be darker and edgier.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Niamh and {{eliminate}} Keisha. Before announcing his decision he said, [...] "First, I'm {{going to say}} this is a complete and utter travesty, neither of you should be in the bottom two, it's completely wrong. I've been put into a situation that I have never wanted to be in. For the first time on a television show, I am angry." [...] And after choosing to eliminate Keisha, he told her, [...] "You were absolutely wonderful. I think you have a huge career ahead of you <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say is that I'll do anything I can to help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I've heard {{nearly enough}} about her, Dr Macphail," [...] said the governor, smiling. [...] "I've {{given her the}} order to get out next Tuesday <b>and</b> that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] Paul summed up, {{with a note}} {{of regret}} in his voice, [...] "the chances are that we'd spoil the adventure. So it's a shame, <b>and</b> that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} man he looked at. [...] "I've lost three dollars, <b>and</b> that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> spare. Can't spare it, for that matter, but it's gone. I'm going broke if this weather lasts.|$|R
2500|$|Silva {{asked him}} where he shot the picture and was looking around to take the photo too. Carter pointed to a place [...] away. Then Carter {{told him that he}} had chasing the vulture away. He was {{completely}} shocked by the situation he had just photographed. He said to Silva [...] "I see all this, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> think of is Megan". Megan was his young daughter. He lit a cigarette and became more and more emotional by the minute. [...] "I can't wait to hug her when I get home." [...] A few minutes later they got into the small UN plane and left Ayod for Kongor.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, CBS News {{broadcast}} a 60 Minutes {{critique of the}} doctrinal assessment, and interview of Farrell and Sartain. Sartain described his role as follows: [...] "In {{the context of the}} Church, we're always going to have the concern about being faithful to Christ. <b>And</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say to you [...] is I don't have any doubt about the reason why the Holy Father has asked me to do this, which is his genuine love and concern for religious women." [...] On the other hand, Farrell noted that there is disagreement over the meaning of vows of obedience for nuns: [...] "Well I think there is one of the areas of misunderstanding and difference. Our first obedience is to God. What we obey is God and God's call to us as expressed in so many different sources, it's not just the teaching authority of the Church, although that is certainly a legitimate part of it." [...] "We have never wanted the men to tell us what to do." [...] She added that the motivation of the inquisition by men in the Vatican appeared to be motivated by their fears rather than the love and concern Sartain cited. Farrell commented: [...] "I don't know, but it feels to me like fear. What would happen if women really were given a place of equality in the Church?" [...] The Holy See says [...] "good works aren't the issue, its annual meetings" [...] are the issue. [...] "It doesn't make sense," [...] Sartain reasoned about the speakers selected by the LCWR, [...] "that a conference of Women Religious would want to give a platform to somebody who would espouse ideas antithetical to what the Church teaches." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Humph! {{at least}} you {{see what you can}} do, if you'll only face fact as it stands, and talk about the realities of life. I'll puff your sermon beforehand, I assure you, <b>and</b> bring <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to hear it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am quite}} ready to help you, <b>and</b> do <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to serve you, madam,' he said, 'only I beg you will {{be good enough to}} hide me from your husband, for I should not like to be eaten at all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's that?" [...] he said. [...] "I know a--pretty--woman when I see one, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say is, I don't see {{the young}} man about that's fit for her; but perhaps--you--do, come, perhaps--you-do!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't {{say exactly}} where it will be," [...] he answered, [...] "but if you will {{go down to the}} shore of the lake and blow four times on the dinner-horn I'll come to you, cave <b>and</b> <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> easily pull it over the water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “So am I, thank you. Stupid thing, selling lemons. But the wolf’s at {{the door}} <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do is shoot lemons at the brute. Lemons!

6000|$|... "Ah, John, I {{wish that}} I {{might be a}} man with a man's philosophy, but I am but a woman, seeing with my heart rather than my head, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see is too horrible, too unthinkable to put into words.|$|R
6000|$|... "My motive in {{desiring}} {{to become}} acquainted with Mr Keswick," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "is one you could scarcely understand, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say about it is, that I believed that if I knew the gentleman who had formerly been the accepted lover of a lady, I should better know the lady." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least, uncle. I {{dare not}} ask my father any {{questions}} about his duty, for he thinks {{it is not a}} woman's business; <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say is, that we are to sail as soon as the wind will permit, and that we are to be absent a month." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{that is what}} {{my brother}} cannot see. Well, my poor boy must be left to his fate.

6000|$|... "If {{we thought}} alike of Miss Bingley," [...] replied Jane, [...] "your {{representation}} {{of all this}} might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; <b>and</b> <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hope {{in this case is}} that she is deceiving herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|SCANTLEBURY. [With dignity.] Exactly! [Turning to EDGAR.] And as to you, young sir, I can't {{sufficiently}} express my--my {{distaste for}} the way you've treated the whole matter.

6000|$|Mr Flintwinch, who had {{cast his}} eyes towards the portrait, twisted himself about again, and again found himself {{the subject of}} the same look and smile.

60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER. I can't argue: I'm too old: {{my mind is}} made up <b>and</b> finished. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{tell you}} is that, old-fashioned or new-fashioned, if you sell yourself, you deal your soul a blow that <b>all</b> the books <b>and</b> {{pictures}} and concerts and scenery in the world won't heal [he gets up suddenly and makes for the pantry].|$|R
