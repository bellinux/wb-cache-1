5|$|Sonnet 18 is {{a typical}} English or Shakespearean sonnet. It {{consists}} of three quatrains followed by a couplet, {{and it has the}} characteristic rhyme scheme: abab cdcd efef gg. The poem reflects the rhetorical tradition of an Italian or Petrarchan Sonnet. Petrarchan sonnets typically discussed the love <b>and</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> a beloved, often an unattainable love, but not always. It also contains a volta, or shift in the poem's subject matter, beginning with the third quatrain.|$|E
5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus on the present moment and to {{know that there is a}} universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness <b>and</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E

However, foulness and ugliness make the wings shrink and disappear.|$|E

25|$|Adelina Patti (10 February 184327 September 1919) was an Italian-French 19th-century opera singer, earning huge fees at {{the height}} of her career in the music capitals of Europe and America. She first sang in public as a child in 1851, and gave her last {{performance}} before an audience in 1914. Along with her near contemporaries Jenny Lind and Thérèse Tietjens, Patti {{remains one of the most}} famous sopranos in history, owing to the purity <b>and</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> her lyrical voice and the unmatched quality of her bel canto technique.|$|E
25|$|The variety <b>and</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> {{the masks}} of Melanesia {{are almost as}} highly {{developed}} as in Africa. It is a culture where ancestor worship is dominant and religious ceremonies are devoted to ancestors. Inevitably, many of the mask types relate to use in these ceremonies and are linked with the activities of secret societies. The mask is regarded {{as an instrument of}} revelation, giving form to the sacred. This is often accomplished by linking the mask to an ancestral presence, and thus bringing the past into the present.|$|E

The lounge represents a world-class experience carefully planned with appropriate amenities, for example: an exclusive smoking zone, an enclosed VIP sitting area and baby changing units. Just as the village elders sat {{in a circle and}} shared a traditional beverage and discussed matters, the lounge’s focal feature is its central circular banquette seating, where guests from different backgrounds can meet and converse.|$|E

25|$|In August 1614 at age twenty-one, Villiers {{caught the}} eye of James I at a hunt in Apethorpe. Opponents of the king's {{favourite}} Robert Carr saw an opportunity to usurp the Earl of Somerset and began promoting Villiers. Money was raised to purchase Villiers a new wardrobe, and intense lobbying secured his appointment as Royal Cupbearer, a position that allowed him to make conversation with the king. Villiers began to appear as a dancer in masques from 1615, in which he could exhibit his grace of movement <b>and</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> body, a recognised avenue to royal favour since the time of Elizabeth I.|$|E
25|$|We're all {{involved}} in this: our whole {{way of life}} is structured around the burning of fossil fuels.

As I recognised when I presented Life on Earth all those years ago, we are a flexible and innovative species and we have the capacity to adapt and modify our behaviour. Now we most certainly have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge we have yet faced.|$|E
25|$|The {{latter is}} well preserved, {{and is one}} of the finest Italian cloisters now extant both for size <b>and</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> detail. It is about 2,200m2, with pointed arches {{decorated}} with diaper work, supported on pairs of columns in white marble, 216 in all, which were alternately plain and decorated by bands of patterns in gold and colors, made of glass tesserae, arranged either spirally or vertically from end to end of each shaft. The marble capitals are each carved with foliage, biblical scenes and allegories, no two being alike. At one angle, a square pillared projection contains the marble fountain or monks' lavatorium, evidently the work of Muslim sculptors.|$|E
