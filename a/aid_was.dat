5|$|The {{response}} {{to requests for}} international <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> moderate. American church groups, Cuba, and Mexico collectively contributed around 2,500tons of food and medicine. The Canadian, Swedish, West German, Spanish, and Dutch Governments contributed aid amounting to 2million dollars (1988) each. No <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> sent by the United States government. The Soviet Union contributed an unknown sum. The slow {{response to}} requests for <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> contributed to by the Sandinista Government's actions, which was viewed by a few anonymous diplomats from other countries who commented to the press, as undermining the peace process championed by Óscar Arias. Those actions were the July 10 arrests of opposition activists and the closing down of independent radio stations. In addition, the government also barred foreign humanitarian groups from receiving American aid, as well as turning back a relief shipment days before the storm.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} c$35 {{million in}} damage resulted (c$ million today). About $30 million in financial <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> raised from various sources, including $18 {{million from the}} federal government, over $4 million from the British government, and $750,000 {{from the state of}} Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the severe}} {{damage caused by}} Typhoon Brian, the provincial flood control {{headquarters}} urged the Chinese Government to organize relief efforts at all levels. By October8, the Government of Hainan Island deployed two relief teams to the hardest hit areas. Additionally, 5million Renminbi in <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> supplied to the region.|$|E
50|$|One {{challenge}} {{for assessing the}} effectiveness of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> that not all <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> intended to generate economic growth. Some <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> intended for humanitarian purposes; some may simply improve {{the standard of living}} of people in developing countries.|$|R

5|$|A small Swedish {{reinforcement}} force {{arrived in}} Trondheim, but both food and ammunition were in short supply. On October 4, the Norwegian forces {{arrived at the}} city reinforced by 1,000 peasants from the surrounding countryside who had taken up arms. When hearing that <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> near, {{the population of the}} city revolted, but the uprising within Trondheim was quickly suppressed. Charles X ordered Lieutenant Colonel Erik Drakenberg to assemble a force in Jämtland and march towards Trondheim, but the relief was stopped by Norwegian peasants that had taken to the hills and defended the mountain passages.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} the Coffin family's {{desire to help}} the runaway slaves only increased. Coffin's wife, Catharine, who was also dedicated to the effort, organized a sewing society that met at their home to produce clothing {{to give to the}} runaways. She also provided meals and shelter to runaway slaves in the Coffin home. Other <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> obtained from neighbors and others sympathetic to the cause, but were unwilling take the fugitives into their homes. Through these activities Coffin was able to secure a steady supply of goods to assist in the ongoing operations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} period, the North Vietnamese were {{recovering}} from losses incurred during the Easter Offensive of 1972 by replacing personnel and modernizing their equipment. Weapons improvement {{was due to}} a new influx of Soviet and Chinese military aid. During 1973, North Vietnam received 2.8million metric tons of goods (worth $330million) from communist-bloc countries, a 50 {{percent increase over the}} previous year. In 1974 that total increased to 3.5million metric tons ($400million) (according to CIA), while the South's <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> slashed to only $965 million per year, down from $2.2 billion.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the issues of}} foreign aid and its policies. The supposed justifications of foreign <b>aid</b> <b>are</b> introduced and examined. The morality and constitutionality of the many motives for foreign <b>aid</b> <b>are</b> weighed against reason, feeling, the Constitution and the Bible. Through thorough examination of foreign <b>aid,</b> it <b>is</b> shown that foreign <b>aid</b> funds <b>are</b> often dispensed nonchalantly and without proper motive {{on the part of}} the U. S. government. More significantly, proper motive and response to foreign <b>aid</b> among taxpayers <b>is</b> hindered. Even so, some aspects of foreign <b>aid</b> <b>are</b> not justified by the Constitution.

5|$|Non-governmental organisations {{began to}} move back into the country, but the {{international}} community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime, and most international <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions among Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.|$|E
5|$|On August 24 Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller {{announced}} that her government would provide JA$225million (US$3.2million) in emergency {{assistance to the}} country's agriculture sector. This <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> targeted at the country's hardest-hit parishes. She also announced a JA$500million (US$7.1million) programme to provide grants and low-interest loans for emergency housing repairs. Temporary tarpaulins were also provided to patch roofs at no cost.|$|E
5|$|Osea was {{the second}} {{tropical}} cyclone to impact French Polynesia during the season; Cyclone Martin had impacted the islands a few weeks earlier. In {{the aftermath of the}} storm, disaster <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> delivered to the victims of Osea. President Gaston Flosse, accompanied by technicians, arrived in Maupiti to help repair the island's electrical and hydraulic systems. A Latter-Day Saint meeting house was used as an emergency shelter, though the house itself sustained minor damage from the storm. The name Osea was later retired from the South Pacific list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the fungibility {{of foreign aid}} and makes three contributions to the existing literature. Firstly, fungibility of aid at the aggregate level is reexamined on a richer panel dataset of 91 developing countries for 1980 - 2009, taking into account endogeneity of aid and autocorrelation in residuals. Results indicate that <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> strongly fungible: around 80 % is substituting rather than increasing government spending in the short run. There is also substantial heterogeneity in the sample, with aid being more fungible for countries with a low share of aid in GDP. Secondly, <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> disaggregated into bilateral and multilateral components. Despite substantial differences between both components, there are only very small indications that multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> less fungible than bilateral <b>aid</b> and estimates <b>are</b> volatile when <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> instrumented. Thirdly, this study attempts to distinguish between off- and on-budget aid at the aggregate level using the value of technical cooperation {{as a proxy for}} off-budget aid. While on-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> strongly fungible, off-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> non-fungible. In the long run, around 50 % of aid increases government expenditures, although results are not stable. High levels of fungibility (except for off-budget aid) suggest that resources spent on earmarking may be wasted and donors should rethink the way <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> distributed...|$|R

5|$|President Bush {{declared}} Louisiana {{a federal}} disaster area after the storm, making it eligible for assistance. FEMA set up three locations to apply in Mississippi and Louisiana. Applications began pouring in, 153,000 {{by the time}} of the deadline. Over $311million in <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> granted to Louisiana. A total of $50million of that money was in the form of low interest loans, and not actual grants.|$|E
5|$|SGDs {{have their}} roots in early {{electronic}} communication aids. The first such <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> a sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the patient-operated selector mechanism (POSSUM) prototyped by Reg Maling in the United Kingdom in 1960. POSSUM scanned {{through a set of}} symbols on an illuminated display. Researchers at Delft University in the Netherlands created the lightspot operated typewriter (LOT) in 1970, which made use of small movements of the head to point a small spot of light at a matrix of characters, each equipped with a photoelectric cell. Although it was commercially unsuccessful, the LOT was well received by its users.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{also sent}} diplomats to other Italian states. In August 1451, along with Venice he sent {{messages}} to Francesco Sforza, then duke of Milan, and Siena to inform them of his {{victory over the}} Turks and of the desperate need for supplies to continue combating the Ottoman armies, but no <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> received. Venice responded that she wished to see the Albanians and the Turks settle for peace, whereas Sforza's response hinged upon the excuse that his state was not financially sound and that his soldiers were not meant to help an Albanian prince. Only Ragusa offered {{a large amount of}} ducats.|$|E
30|$|Altruistic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> the {{one that}} seeks to enhance {{economic}} development. According to Lumsdaine (1993 : 38), this kind of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> the sort of assistance offered with the pure objective of {{improving the quality of}} life. Altruistic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> usually offered on soft-terms and in long-term basis. Morgenthau (1962 : 304) refers to it as ‘aid for economic development’ and Hook (1995) labels it under ‘aid welfare’. The difference between humanitarian and altruistic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> that the former is provided in emergency situations and its interventions are punctual, while the latter seeks sustained development with long-term interventions.|$|R

5|$|The {{history of}} AAC {{can be traced}} to the days of {{classical}} Rome and Greece, with the first recorded use of augmentative strategies with the deaf. The use of manual alphabets and signs was recorded in Europe from the 16th century, as was the gestural system of Hand Talk used by Native Americans to facilitate communication between different linguistic groups. The first known widely available communication <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> a letter and word-based communication board developed for, and with, F. Hall Roe, who had cerebral palsy. This communication board was distributed in the 1920s by a men's group in Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the early}} part of 1956, Cooper {{strongly}} advocated that the U.S. respect Indian nonalignment and increase economic aid to the country. In August 1956, Congress approved a financial aid package for India that included the largest sale up to that point of surplus agricultural products by the United States to any country. Cooper's persistence in requesting such <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> critical in getting the package approved, as it was opposed by many administration officials, including Under Secretary of State Herbert Hoover, Jr., Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey, and International Cooperation Administration Director John B. Hollister.|$|E
5|$|After heavy {{damage from}} Cyclone Bonita in 1996, the {{government}} of Madagascar initiated a disaster response system that was used during Gretelle; there was quick response but efforts were hampered by damaged infrastructure and disrupted transportation. The storm had cut communications in some areas, but by January29, or five days after landfall, telephone service was restored to Manakara. Following the storm, the Madagascar government coordinated the distribution of emergency rice rations and other relief items. On January27, the government launched a fundraiser on television that raised over ₣130million (FMG, $30,000 USD). The southern portion {{of the country was}} declared a disaster area. A plane of relief supplies flew from the capital Antananarivo to Manakara along the southeast coast, where trucks distributed the items to the affected areas. A radio station based out of the country criticized the slow pace of relief, citing the lack of available boats after many were destroyed. In addition, there were reports that government <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> being stolen by looters.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aid</b> <b>is</b> {{said to be}} fungible at the {{aggregate}} level if it raises government expenditures by less than the total amount. This happens when the recipient government decreases domestic revenue, decreases net borrowing, or when aid bypasses the budget. This study makes three contributions to both fungibility and fiscal response literature. First, fungibility at {{the aggregate}} level is re-examined on a bigger recent panel dataset, distinguishing between short- and longterm impact of aid. The results indicate that <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> partly fungible {{in the long run}} and highly fungible in the short run. Second, to account for aid bypassing the budget, technical cooperation is used as a proxy for off-budget <b>aid.</b> Off-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> found to be non-fungible and on-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> partly fungible. Third, fungibility of bilateral and multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> analysed: the results indicate lower fungibility of multilateral aid...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{assessing}} the effects of aid on fiscal behaviour in Indonesia. There are four main findings. First, the inflow of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> driven primarily {{by the need to}} fill the fiscal gap; that <b>is,</b> <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> demand driven. Second, although project <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> by definition intended for development expenditures, it results in an increase in routine expenditure as well. This suggests that project <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> fungible: it creates extra resources available to increase non-discretionary spending. Third, programme aid tends to increase routine expenditure but not development expenditure; thus, it mainly serves as budgetary support. Fourth, aid flows make the Government of Indonesia fiscally “lazy”. The availability of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> a disincentive to mobilize domestic revenue through a more efficient and effective taxation system.

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} the {{development}} aid literature have concluded that bilateral <b>aid</b> flows have <b>been</b> dominated by strategic objectives of major donors. Similar analysis of multilateral aid flows has determined that these allocations are more sensitive to economic need and quality of institutions and policy of the recipient country. A consensus has emerged that all bilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> strategically driven while multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> independent of these political pressures. This paper challenges these conventional notions of the different aid types by analyzing allocation decisions from U. S. bilateral and multilateral aid agencies. It finds that strategic considerations influence both bilateral and multilateral aid. Donor influence over multilateral aid allocations requires a rethinking of how strategic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> pursued. Improvements to the models of <b>aid</b> flows <b>are</b> offered, and a preliminary empirical analysis is attempted. It is found that the dynamics of strategic uses of <b>aid</b> <b>are</b> more complex that previous studies have concluded. The impact of these findings on the flows and efficacy of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> discussed. Honors Thesis, Department of Economic...|$|R
5|$|After {{the failure}} of UNOSOM in 1991-2, the US led a {{multinational}} mission—UNITAF—which included military forces to ensure <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> distributed to Somalis. The US military entered Mogadishu on December 9, 1992, and moved to quickly secure the abandoned embassy, along with the airport and port. The following day, key military staff moved into the embassy to establish headquarters for the UNITAF mission, with the main headquarters located within the chancery. The embassy complex itself was in disrepair; buildings had been stripped bare, a foot (0.3m) of debris and trash covered the floors of the chancery, and bodies were found in some areas on the premises. Personnel promptly set out cleaning the compound's living spaces and work areas {{to make room for}} the arrival and assembly area. Old warehouses were razed, and new barracks, heads and galleys were erected in their place. US Navy support elements that arrived later also imported extra materials.|$|E
5|$|Amelia {{affected}} the Texas coast {{for two days}} which caused several shipping incidents and minor damage in Corpus Christi and South Padre Island. While active, there were no deaths linked to the storm. However, the biggest impact from the storm followed its dissipation, when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the state. The state, already suffering from a previous drought, believed that the rain would help alleviate the conditions. However, the dry ground aided the flooding from the storm. The rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood, especially around the Texas Hill Country and northern Texas, leading to severe damage. Following the storm, President Jimmy Carter declared six counties in the state as federal disaster areas, allowing residents to seek aid from the government. Additional <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> brought in {{from as far away}} as New York. Overall, Amelia caused 33fatalities with an estimated $110million in damages in what then-governor Dolph Briscoe called one of the worst floods in the history of the state.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's passage, the Mauritius {{government}} opened 130shelters, {{and also}} provided 5,000rupees to each homeless family. The crop damage from Hollanda, {{in addition to}} a drought, decreased the following year's output by 22%. In response, the government provided seeds to farmers so they could replant their crops. Most of the island had their power restored by ten days after the storm. The country's prime minister issued an appeal to the European Union for 67million rupees ($3.6million 1994USD) in assistance, although later dropped it to less than half that total. The requested <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> for the restoration of phone and power utilities. The storm's severe impact on Mauritius caused a sharp drop in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the overall GDP decreased by 10%.|$|E
