5|$|Howe cabled Anderson {{expressing the}} Canadian government's {{agreement}} in principle, but requesting {{a more detailed}} <b>appraisal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cost of the proposed laboratory. Sir John Anderson replied that he envisaged a laboratory with about 30 scientists and 25 laboratory assistants, of whom 22 scientists and 6 laboratory assistants would be sent from Britain. The estimated running cost was £60,000 per annum. He agreed that the costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion-dollar war gift from Canada. The Canadians found this acceptable. Howe and Mackenzie then travelled to London to finalise arrangements for the laboratory's governance. It was agreed {{that it would be}} run by a Policy Committee consisting of Howe and MacDonald and be administered by and funded through the NRC, with research directed by a Technical Committee chaired by Halban.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{eventually}} {{resumed his}} naval career, first {{as an assistant}} to the Director of Naval Intelligence and then, in August 1906, as Flag-captain to Rear-Admiral George Egerton on HMS Victorious. He had by this time become a national hero, despite his aversion to the limelight, and the expedition was being presented to the public as a triumph. This euphoria was not conducive to objective analysis, or to thoughtful <b>appraisal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expedition's strengths and weaknesses. In particular, the glorification by Scott of man-hauling as something intrinsically more noble than other ice travel techniques led to a general distrust of methods involving ski and dogs, a mindset that was carried forward into later expeditions. This mystified seasoned ice travellers such as Fridtjof Nansen, whose advice on such matters was usually sought, but often set aside.|$|E

The building was nearly six times over budget and four years and 10 months late, compared to the original estimates of the project in 1997. Total costs rose due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks, and because the National Assembly did not have an independent cost <b>appraisal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project until December 2000, three years after the original estimate.

40|$|Background: Although <b>the</b> {{negative}} <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illness may {{be related}} to suicidal thinking and behaviours in schizophrenia, this has been insufficiently studied. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study was to analyze the relationship between schizophrenic patients 2 ̆ 7 cognitions about their illness and past suicidal behaviours. The relationship between patients 2 ̆ 7 beliefs about their illness with potential mediators of suicidal behaviours such as depressive symptoms, hopelessness and insight was also investigated. Subjects and methods: A group of 60 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to ICD- 10 criteria belonging to a followup study were assessed one year after their last psychiatric admission. Psychopathological variables were assessed by the Calgary Depression Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale and the first three items <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scale to Assess Unawareness <b>of</b> Mental Disorder. <b>The</b> <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illness were assessed by the Personal Beliefs about Illness Questionnaire. Results: Negative appraisals were associated with hopelessness and depressive symptoms. Negative expectations and stigma showed the strongest associations. Contrary to our expectations, this scale was not able to differentiate between patients with and without past suicidal behaviour. Conclusions: Negative <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illness in patients with schizophrenia seem to have psychopathological consequences such as greater hopelessness and depression. Since these psychopathological features are linked to suicidal risk, the psychotherapeutic approach counteracting negative beliefs about the illness may reduce <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> suicide...|$|R

40|$|We report {{results from}} five {{experiments}} that describe <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> emotional states on trust. We find that incidental emotions significantly influence trust in unrelated settings. Happiness and gratitude, emotions with positive valence, increase trust, and anger, an emotion with negative valence, decreases trust. Specifically, {{we find that}} emotions characterized by other-person control (anger and gratitude) and weak control appraisals (happiness) influence trust significantly more than emotions characterized by personal control (pride and guilt) or situational control (sadness).

40|$|Previous {{research}} has established that, {{in addition to}} provision of financing, venture capitalists (VCs) may add value to new ventures via different types of management support. In this paper, we propose that transaction cost economics (TCE) may complement other theoretical frameworks (e. g., agency theory, the resource-based view, knowledge-based theory, and resource dependence perspective) in explaining CEOs’ polar and ambivalent <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> benefits and costs {{of different types of}} VC support and <b>the</b> overall value <b>of</b> VC assistance. Following TCE, we approach VC-funded new ventures as hybrids of markets and hierarchies. Hence, we assume that VCs help their portfolio companies both to externalize, or learn to better operate under <b>the</b> market mode <b>of</b> governance, and internalize, or learn to better operate under <b>the</b> hierarchy mode <b>of</b> governance. We propose that VCs use external support to facilitate venture externalization and use internal support to facilitate venture internalization. Based on structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis of data from an online survey that generated 104 valid responses from CEOs of VC-funded new ventures, we establish that CEOs associate VCs’ external support positively with <b>the</b> perceived benefits <b>of</b> VC assistance and negatively with <b>the</b> perceived costs <b>of</b> VC assistance. In contrast, CEOs associate VCs’ internal support positively both with the perceived benefits and costs of VC assistance.
