5000|$|By 2003, young filmmakers in Karachi began {{experimenting with}} film and {{released}} low budget films {{to demonstrate that}} high quality content could be produced in Pakistan using limited resources. Cinema houses were declining in all major cities and a revival of cinema was being echoed throughout the media. With privatization of television stations in full swing, a new channel Filmazia began airing old Pakistani films as well as newer low budget productions. During this period Mahesh Bhatt, a celebrated Indian director, visited Pakistan looking for talent - particularly singers who could lend their voices to his upcoming films in India. His visit to Pakistan was {{to coincide with the}} third Kara Film Festival where he screened his film Paap in Karachi. Bhatt would later hire Atif Aslam for the soundtrack of his film Zeher and Pakistani actress Meera to play a lead-role in one of his films. By 2005, a gradual shift had begun whereby Karachi was replacing Lahore as the film hub of the country. Many film makers, producers, directors shifted to Karachi to avail new opportunities. In August 2007, Shoaib Mansoor directed and released Khuda Ke Liye - it became a surprise instant success at the box office and brought the middle class back to the cinemas due to its controversial theme of <b>addressing</b> <b>Pakistans</b> social problems. The film was also released internationally, including India, where it became the first Pakistani film released there after four decades.. The release of Khuda Kay Liye is seen by many as the revival of cinema in Pakistan and the cementing of Karachi as the Pakistani film and showbiz capital. Despite optimism of a solid revival, progress continued to be slow. Alongside Geo Films, the [...] "Pakistan New Cinema Movement" [...] was launched in 2009 with around 1400 members which facilitated networking to stimulate newer film productions. Several films were released after Khuda Kay Liye which saw limited success including Shaan Shahids directorial project Chup, Syed Noors Price of Honor, Iqbal Kashmiris Devdas, Son of Pakistan, Syed Faisal Bukharis Saltanat, Reema Khans Love Mein Ghum., Bhai Log and Mehreen Jabbars Ramchand Pakistani. However it was Shoaib Mansoor to the rescue again with this 2011 film Bol which brook box office records in Pakistan..|$|R

40|$|A {{close reading}} of the speeches and {{statements}} of the founding father of Pakistan, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, brings forth a striking consistency of understanding and approach towards priorities that the nation must determine to move steadily {{on the road to}} progress and development. These priorities were—in that order—education, industrial development and defence. Political historians generally present descriptive analyses of what appear to be radically different phases of the Quaid’s passage to lead the nation to its destiny—freedom. But at no point in any phase does one come across a weakening of resolve to advocate the priorities of Education, Industry and Defence—EID, for short. No better acronym of happiness would be possible for the Muslims of British India, EID being happiness and progress for them literally as well as religiously. After the adoption of the Pakistan Resolution in March 1940, the Quaid reiterated these priorities time and again. There is a noticeable accent in his speeches to specify the ramifications of these three pillars of progress. The most succinct statement of priorities came in March 1941. While <b>addressing</b> the <b>Pakistan</b> Session of Punjab Muslim Students Federation, the Quaid said “There are at least three main pillars which go to make a nation worthy of possessing a territory and running the government…… [...] One is education.... Next, no nation and no people can ever do anything very much without making themselves economically powerful in commerce, trade and industry. And lastly, when you have got that light of knowledge by means of education and when you have made yourselves strong economically and industrially, then you have got to prepare yourselves for your defence against external aggression and to maintain internal security”. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reflects}} on Pakhtun menâ��s {{perceptions of the}} conditions promoting domestic violence against women in their culture. The existing literature on domestic violence in Pakistan, {{the primary focus of}} which is the women victims of such violence, shows some staggering and skewed statistics, owing to the deeply embedded patriarchal social structure, gender-prejudiced attitudes prevailing at every level of society as well as poverty, illiteracy, a strict pattern of gender- specific roles and spaces, socio-economic dependence of women on men supported by religion. However, menâ��s views on this issue have rarely been <b>addressed</b> in <b>Pakistan</b> in general and Pakhtun society in particular. I examine how the social and cultural environment of Pakhtun society influences the construction of (violent) masculinity and gender-power relations. These create the potential for violence, specifically domestic violence against women. The research was carried out in four different locations of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Data was generated through semi-structured and in-depth interviews of 32 male respondents, eight in each of the selected areas, on the basis of three categories, i. e. ethnicity, age, and educational status of the respondents. Drawing upon my respondentsâ�� views I show that Pakhtunwali, the core of the Pakhtun social structure, is a key contributing factor offering potential for the construction of violent Pakhtun masculinity particularly through the notions of badal (revenge), gherat (self-honour or Pakhtun honour), and nang (Pakhtun pride). It also encourages a strict pattern of gender hierarchies and spatialization, which leaves women marginalized at all levels. Thus in Pakhtun society one learns to be aggressive in order to dominate and control, and one way this aggression is expressed is through violence against women. I argue that the joint family structure, the general perception of womenâ��s issues including domestic violence as a highly personal and private matter, the absence of an effective and competent criminal justice system, and lack of domestic violence laws provide the perpetrators with considerable impunity...|$|R

Proceedings of the Workshop on Pro-poor Intervention Strategies in Irrigated Agriculture in Asia, Islamabad, Pakistan, 23 - 24 April 2003. Lahore, Pakistan: International Water Management Institute (IWMI). The phenomenon of poverty is receiving the increasing attention of {{policy makers and}} institutions with an attempt to improve the living standards {{of the third world}} countries. Pakistan is no exemption to that. As the majority of third world population is concentrated in rural areas and dependent on agriculture sector for income, it becomes of special interest to dig into the root causes of poverty in these areas. A number of studies have shown that poverty is concentrated in the rural areas of Pakistan. However, a wide variation in estimates of poverty was experienced owing to various approaches and different poverty lines used by the researchers in estimating the incidence, depth, and severity of poverty. Recently, the Government of <b>Pakistan</b> <b>addressed</b> this issue by circulating the official poverty line. Poverty being a complex phenomenon, its determinants vary {{from time to time and}} across different areas.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Pakistan is a key U. S. ally {{in the effort to}} combat terrorism and violent extremism. Taliban, al Qaeda, and other terrorists have used parts of Pakistan to plan and launch attacks on Afghan, U. S., and NATO security forces in Afghanistan, as well as on Pakistani citizens and security forces in Pakistan. Enhancing the effectiveness of civilian assistance to Pakistan is one of the U. S. government's top foreign policy and national security priorities. Foreign assistance is vital to help the government of Pakistan overcome the political, economic, and security challenges that threaten Pakistan's long-term stability. Since 2002, the United States has provided over $ 18 billion in foreign assistance and reimbursements to Pakistan, about two-thirds of which has been security-related. In October 2009, Congress passed the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009, which authorizes up to $ 1. 5 billion a year for development, economic, and democratic assistance (henceforth referred to as "civilian assistance") to Pakistan for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. In the act, Congress declares that the United States requires a balanced, integrated, countrywide strategy to support Pakistan's efforts that does not disproportionately focus on security-related assistance. The act authorizes civilian assistance {{for a wide range of}} activities, including projects to build the capacity of government institutions, promote sustainable economic development, and support investment in people through education and health programs. The act also encourages, as appropriate, the use of Pakistani organizations to provide this assistance. In several reports and testimonies since 2008, GAO identified the need to improve planning, monitoring, documentation, and oversight of U. S. assistance to Pakistan. For example, in previous reports we have noted the need to increase oversight and accountability for Pakistan's reimbursement claims for Coalition Support Funds and to improve planning, performance, and monitoring documentation of U. S. development assistance to Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 requires the Department of State (State) to develop several monitoring and strategy reports for U. S. assistance to Pakistan, including the Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report and the Semi-Annual Monitoring Report. The act also directed the Comptroller General to provide: (1) a review of, and comments <b>addressing,</b> State's <b>Pakistan</b> Assistance Strategy Report; (2) an assessment of the impact of the civilian assistance on the security and stability of Pakistan; (3) a detailed description of the expenditures made by Pakistan with Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grants; and (4) recommendations relating to any additional actions the Comptroller General believes could help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of U.

40|$|This {{research}} {{has sought to}} contribute to the literature {{to the understanding of the}} factors influencing women’s career progression in higher education management through in depth, semi-structured interviews and a focus group discussion conducted with 48 women working in junior, and senior level management positions in the universities of <b>Pakistan.</b> <b>Addressing</b> the first research question to better understand current gendered based distribution of management positions in the sampled universities, a quantitative survey was conducted. The research questions 2, 3 and 4 addressed the following three areas sequentially: first, the constraints faced by participants at familial, societal, organizational and personal levels; second, the supportive factors experienced by the participants at familial, societal, organizational and personal levels; and finally, Is work-family conflict a barrier to women‘s career progression in Pakistan? The aim of the focus group discussion was to extract some further qualitative information from a group of six participants working in one of the universities and to investigate whether participants had similar experiences. For the analysis of quantitative data the advanced charting and graphing features in Microsoft Office Word and Excel were used to develop basic table, graph, and chart structures to display the frequency count. For the qualitative data the inductive coding and thematic analysis was utilized searching for patterns and themes. The analysis of quantitative data revealed the dearth of women in senior management positions. The analysis of qualitative data provided an unprecedented and comprehensive view of the complex, contradictory, and multifaceted dimensions of distinctive factors influencing women’s career progression in senior management positions. The participants – both junior and seniors – informed about the hurdles they had faced when they got appointed or when they had moved into senior roles, as well as what kinds of help and support they had received for their career progression. It was expected that knowledge based on participant’s perceptions of the difficulties and social support and the strategies they exercised for facilitating the work-family interface, hopefully, will bring their insights to a wider audience. Such knowledge would support the management of women‘s human resources and their management careers in the cultural specific context and might emerge as a strong strategy for policy makers for countering the issue of the dearth of women in senior management positions...|$|R

Crustal thickening and high-temperature, sillimanite-grade metamorphism in the southern Karakoram Mountains followed the collision and accretion of the Kohistan are during the Late Cretaceous. U-Pb ages of metamorphic monazites from sillimanite gneisses in the Hunza Valley are 63. 3 ± 0. 4 Ma, ca. 50 - 52 Ma, and 44. 0 ± 2. 0 Ma, and monazites from a kyanite-grade schist from the Baltoro region are 28. 0 ± 0. 5 Ma. Metamorphic monazites from a highly graphitic garnet + staurolite schist from the Hunza Valley yield a crystallization age of 16. 0 ± 1. 0 Ma. Sillimanite gneisses from the Dassu dome have magmatic zircons of 1855 ± 11 Ma, reflecting a Proterozoic continental crustal source, and metamorphic monazites of 5. 4 ± 0. 2 Ma. Magmatism was also sporadic; early granodiorite, monzogranite, and leucogranite dikes yield zircon, monazite, and uraninite ages of 50 - 52 Ma and 35. 0 ± 1. 0 Ma. Widespread lower crustal melting during the latest Oligocene-early Miocene culminated with emplacement of the Baltoro Plutonic Unit in the Karakoram batholith that cuts deformation fabrics in the high-grade gneisses to the south. The youngest magmatic phase dated is the 9. 3 ± 0. 2 Ma Sumayar leucogranite pluton. On the basis of detailed structural field studies combined with U-Pb geochronology, sillimanite-grade metamorphism was either a protracted event lasting as long as 20 m. y. (64 - 44 Ma) or peaked at different times within the lower crust following collision of first, the Kohistan arc, and later, the Indian plate. We also present evidence for southward propagation of peak metamorphism and postmetamorphic thrusting and folding of isograds within the past 5 m. y. Detailed geochronology shows that deformation, metamorphism, and magmatism {{in the middle and}} lower crust of the south Asian margin has been occurring within the Karakoram metamorphic complex for more than 60 m. y. Similar processes may also have affected the unplumbed depths of the south Tibetan crust...|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} {{primary education}} system in Karachi, Pakistan, {{is faced with}} many problems and dilemmas and each dilemma justifies a reason, but perhaps no problem is as grave as the dejected professional status of the government primary school teachers in Karachi. Schools are {{only as good as}} their teachers, regardless of how high their standards, how up-to-date their technology, or how innovative their programs. With a large numbers of under-educated, under-trained, under-paid and, most importantly of all, undervalued government primary school teachers in Karachi, Pakistan (Hoodbhoy, 1998; Shaikh, 1997), only a low percentage of teachers can be effective. Whether the children in Pakistan will be the enlightened and the informed citizens of tomorrow or ignorant members of society will depend on teacher knowledge, teacher education and above all teacher professionalism. If teachers do matter the most, then a series of questions result. What is being done for this section of the society that matters so much? Are efforts being taken to find out what teachers in the government primary schools need to achieve their professional goals? Are these teachers given adequate opportunities to learn, to improve and to become effective teachers? How can these teachers meet the ever increasing demands placed upon them? How will these teachers successfully lead the students into the twenty-first century? Do the primary government school teachers believe that they can successfully lead children into the twenty-first century? Are school reforms geared towards enhancing teachers' professionalism? This research that focuses on the relationships between school reforms and teacher professionalism in government primary schools in Karachi, <b>Pakistan,</b> <b>addresses</b> such questions. In this thesis, I outline some of the measures that have been taken at the government, at the non-government and at the school sector level to restructure and reform primary government schools in Pakistan. A mixed methods research approach was undertaken to investigate the relationships between these reforms and teacher professionalism. Quantitative data were collected by means of questionnaire surveys and qualitative data were collected in the selected four case sites by means of interviews and field notes. In this research it was important to investigate teacher efficacy, teacher practice, teacher leadership and collaborative efforts as the different dimensions of professionalism and the relationships between these and the school reforms for enhanced teacher professionalism. Research was required which addressed the question of "What it actually means to be a professional teacher in government primary schools in Karachi, Pakistan, and how school reforms can actually develop teacher learning for improved teacher professionalism?" 	Contrary to the detached and noncommittal attitude with which the government primary school teachers are characterized in many contexts, the teachers in this study have indicated that they are confident and capable; they can articulate and communicate ideas; they can make decisions and undertake responsibilities; they understand {{that it is important to}} collaborate and learn from one another; and they are willing to undertake leadership roles if they have the opportunities. This has strong implications for policy makers to provide teachers with the opportunities to become active and reflective professionals. It is important to regard teachers as change agents capable of generating knowledge and of making change happen, rather than as passive recipients and users of knowledge. 	The data provided by the teachers have indicated that it is possible to enhance teacher professionalism within the existing government primary school structures. While the different teachers were at different levels or stages of professionalism, it was quite clear that they had all advanced in terms of their professionalism as a consequence of reform initiatives. These changes in the teachers' levels of professionalism defined the relationships between the school reforms and teacher professionalism. In other words, the school reforms have been able to develop teacher professionalism and take it to a higher level than where it was when the reforms were initiated in the schools. Based on the analysis of the findings, this research theorizes that teacher professionalism is developed when teachers are provided with both the professional knowledge and skills to improve their capabilities, and opportunities to translate professional knowledge and skills into classroom and school activities to make the most of their capabilities. The research proposes that the strength of these relationships between school reforms and teacher professionalism depends on the dynamism with which the reform managers take teachers through the stage of involving them in developmental process, the stage of initiating professional development programmes and the stage of developing schools into collaborative cultures and establishing networks with the help of enlightened principals and hybrid support structures. Based on this proposition a number of principles have been identified for sustaining and further developing teacher professionalism. 	 	The study acknowledges that the process of developing teacher professionalism is complex and that it will be the blend of different elements in the schools, the particular school context and political will that will decide how professionalism can best be fostered in the government primary schools. However, since the principles derived from this research are based on grounded research findings and are also supported by literature and other relevant research in the area of teacher development, they may be applicable to other primary schools where similar reforms are being implemented in Pakistan and other developing countries seeking to address similar problems. Policy makers and large private organizations may benefit from the principles of developing and fostering teacher professionalism...|$|R
