5|$|In {{the first}} main event of SummerSlam wrestlers from the Raw brand competed in an Elimination Chamber match, {{in which the}} ring is {{surrounded}} by a steel structure of chain and girders. The match was contested for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H defended the title against Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels. The buildup to the match began on July 22, 2003, when during the SummerSlam press conference, the authority figure Eric Bischoff, announced that Triple H would defend the championship against Goldberg in a standard wrestling match at the event. On August 4, 2003 during a television episode of Raw, Bischoff changed the stipulations of the match to No disqualification regulations. Later during the episode, another authority figure, Steve Austin, altered Bischoff's announcement, stating that the championship would be contested in an Elimination Chamber match, with Triple H defending his title against Goldberg, Chris Jericho, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels. Six days before SummerSlam, during an episode of Raw on August 18, 2003, the rivalry among the six competitors intensified during a promotional interview segment, in which each participant in the Elimination Chamber discussed the match and taunted the other wrestlers. During the show's main event, in which Orton wrestled Goldberg, Nash interfered in the match and attacked Goldberg. Michaels then came down to the ring, but as he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> Triple H with the World Heavyweight Championship belt, Jericho ran into the ring and hit Michaels with a chair.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and {{paracetamol}} for Glynis's migraine. She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol. She drops some tablets into the glass {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she had been told that her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E

25|$|At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Center for Integrated Agricultural System's Food and Farm {{project is}} working with the region's sustainable-agriculture farmers, processors, distributors, chefs, {{planning}} commissions, and others to define the culinary identity of the region and direct the development of agrotourism. For instance, 75% of the raw-milk artisan cheese produced in Wisconsin is made in the Driftless region. This cheese is made from milk produced by cows that graze on pastures. The region is home to Organic Valley, the nation's largest organic dairy cooperative. Generally, organic dairy production fits best with a grass-based milk production system. In addition to winegrape production and wine-making, the region also is known for apple production, and a number of hard cider makers are <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the market with product. The region is historically known for grass-fed beef, and has great potential to market forest botanicals - especially mushrooms - to the 21 million people in the region, including the relatively nearby Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, and Milwaukee markets.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} match, Hulk Hogan and Shawn Michaels faced Muhammad Hassan and Daivari. Hogan and Hassan began and Hassan was {{immediately}} sent into the turnbuckles. Hogan double clotheslined both his opponents {{and then he}} and Michaels teamed up with a big double boot to Hassan's face. Michaels {{climbed to the top}} rope but missed an elbow drop. Daivari was tossed outside where Hogan bashed him. Michaels hit Daivari with a flying forearm smash and a kip up. Michaels was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> Daivari with Sweet Chin Music, but instead Hassan hit Michaels with a lead pipe. Hassan then took advantage and locked Michaels in the Camel Clutch. Michaels fought his way to his feet and dropped Hassan with an Electric Chair. Hogan then got tagged in and went for a leg drop to Daivari, but Hassan hit Hogan with a lead pipe instead. As the referee has his back turned at Hogan, Michaels hit Daivari with Sweet Chin Music allowing Hogan to get the pinfall and win the match for his team.|$|E
25|$|Many years ago, in the Enchanted Forest, a young Regina {{wishes that}} her mother Cora {{had more time to}} play. Without her mother {{watching}} her, Regina finds a magic wand and attempts to transform her doll into a real sister with whom to play, only to have the spell backfire, knocking her unconscious. Cora and Prince Henry realizes {{that the only way to}} save her is by bringing a magical family member to wake her up. Consequently, Cora visits Oz to bring back Zelena, who just used her magic to restock the logs she dropped. This angers her abusive adoptive father, who doesn't want Zelena to use her “wicked” magic. Cora immediately freezes the woodcutter as he is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> her (her adoptive mother wasn't around to protect Zelena this time), then gives Zelena the opportunity to prove that her magic can be used for good, which she accepts. As Zelena is able to wake Regina, the two are unaware of their being sisters at first, but over time become close, and quickly realize that they're related, when Zelena accidentally opens Cora's wand box, leading to Cora admitting that Regina and Zelena are sisters. Despite Regina's pleas to have Zelena in her life, Cora, believing that Zelena's presence will interfere with Regina's future of becoming the next queen, wipes both of their memories and sends Zelena back to Oz.|$|E

500|$|Conan starts {{each level}} with his default one-handed sword, and {{can pick up}} shields and other weapons to switch between three styles of attack: {{fighting}} with a one-handed weapon, a two-handed weapon, or a weapon in each hand. [...] Each style features several attacks with names like [...] "Cimmerian Charge" [...] and [...] "Black River Rage". The barbarian can change or stop his attacks at any time, creating many options in combat. When Conan lands a sequence of successive hits on his enemies, he activates his Song of Death, which increases the damage of his attacks for a short time. For defense, Conan can roll under enemy attacks or block them. If the player presses the block button just when an enemy is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the barbarian, {{an image of a}} controller button appears on the screen. Pressing the button shown will make Conan execute a gory counterattack, which instantly kills the enemy. Other methods to kill enemies include grabbing and throwing them against other objects, such as spikes and other enemies, or over cliffs.|$|E

The next day, Bart's class stops at the Krusty Burger after a field trip and Bart is shocked to discover Homer sitting at a booth alone. Homer comes clean and explains to Bart that his job interview did not go so well when his interviewer, the Rich Texan, discovered that Homer knows nothing about copper tubing. Bart convinces Homer that he should tell Marge what has happened and Homer calls her from a pay phone. But when Homer hears Marge’s happy voice he cannot bring himself to disappoint her and tell her the truth about his [...] "new" [...] job. Instead he concocts a story about him having to fly on the [...] "company" [...] jet for work and instructs Marge to meet him at the airport in an hour. Homer pays a Marine to fly him into the air, so he can tell Marge up in the air with luxury so she would not get upset. Once in the air, Marge cannot believe all the luxuries the private jet has to offer. Homer sits Marge down to tell her the truth, but just before he can, the plane endures turbulence. Homer and Marge head into the cockpit to see what the problem is, only to discover that the pilot had passed out. Homer shoves the pilot aside and takes hold of the jet’s controls. As the jet is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the ocean, Marge pulls the jet's yoke up giving the jet altitude. Marge pulls out her cell phone and calls Colby Kraus and frantically asks for his guidance. Thanks to Colby's motivation, Homer manages to land the plane safely on the ground, however, his attempt to taxi back to the terminal fails and the plane falls into the ocean. After being airlifted out of the plane, Homer explains to Marge that flying in private jets is simply too dangerous and that he plans {{to go back to work}} at the Power Plant.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{wrote that}} [...] "after an underwhelming pre-credits sequence... this sucker moved, {{and lots of}} things happened. [...] We met our four new regulars, {{squeezed}} in useful flashbacks about [...] and even found out the real reason they're on the island ... The flipside of all this business is that 'Confirmed Dead' didn't have the same emotional resonance as ' Beginning of the End'... but you clearly can't have everything in every episode." [...] Times James Poniewozik said that [...] "What amazed [...] about this episode was the economy and precision with which it introduced... {{the crew of the}} downed chopper from [...] [...] Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet {{by the end of the}} episode, I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly thought that [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] "was downright alive with fascinating new characters, mind-blowing new possibilities, and exciting new theory fodder"; however, he had heard complaints from others who received the preview screeners that they found the episode to be flawed. [...] They considered the scene where 815 is found to be cheating the flashback formula because Daniel only experiences it by watching it on television, Frank's safe landing of the helicopter to be a mystery, Naomi's flashback to be cheating Lost rules because she is dead and Ben's manipulation of Locke to be an overused storyline. [...] E!'s Kristin Dos Santos exclaimed [...] "hot damn!" [...] in response to the scene where 815 is found in the Sunda Trench. [...] She also thought that [...] "Juliet and Kate giggling at Jack's 'wink thing' was hilarious" [...] and it was [...] "awesome to see [...] again". [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard highlighted [...] "watching Dan's landing from his point of view. [...] You can feel his panic as he's free-falling through the air, looks up at his parachute, looks down to see himself <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the trees... it was amazing." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott gave [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] an 8/10, writing that it [...] "isn't a disappointing episode by any means but it definitely suffers from being a 'setup' episode for these four new characters" [...] and praising the new actors by writing that [...] "Leung does an adequate job of getting Miles' arrogant brand of confidence across while Davies presents Faraday's awkward mannerisms well. [...] Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] "Watching 'Confirmed Dead' was like watching my dream episode of Lost [...] people asked direct questions for once... this episode was all about the Freighties." [...] A day after the original broadcast, BuddyTV's Dahl claimed that [...] " [...] on an epic journey, one that has been as entertaining and engrossing as any TV series has ever been". In contrast, TV Guides Michael Ausiello of [...] said that it [...] "was thirty-one flavors of awesome... the negatives outweighed the positives". [...] He had problems with Claire's lack of grief for Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) death and Jack waiting so long to find out the freighter folk's main objective. [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] three out of five stars, calling it [...] "so-so", but commenting that [...] "the new revelations in the episode are fairly startling and provide a momentary distraction from the frustrations." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{scene in}} the episode [...] "Crisis", where Adam Knight returns and {{subsequently}} shoots Lana in an alley, resulted in Entity FX doing more special effects work on a single scene than is typically performed. To make sure the computer-generated effects matched the set the actors were filming on, Mat Beck left his office in Los Angeles and travelled to the Smallville set to work alongside John Wash and John Hahn in constructing the scene. Producer Ken Horton {{wanted to be able}} to see the bullet travelling through each of the raindrops as it made its way toward Lana. To accomplish this, the team made the digital bullet larger than normal for better visibility. While filming, a flash zoom was created that would track around Kreuk as she was running, achieving the effect of watching the bullet get fired from the gun, fly through the raindrops, and then as the camera rotates around you see the bullet just as it <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> Lana before Clark runs in and stops it.
