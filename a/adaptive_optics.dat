5|$|Natural-guide-star <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Optics</b> for Multi-purpose Instrumentation – an <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> feed, {{operating}} {{over the}} entire optical and near-infrared wavelength regions. Permanently mounted {{at one of the}} Nasmyth foci.|$|E
5|$|The {{upcoming}} {{generation of}} extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will require sophisticated <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> {{in order to}} be used to their full capability. Because the WHT has an advanced <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> system already operating, it is receiving attention from the various ELT programs. The European Southern Observatory's European-ELT (E-ELT) project has begun a programme to utilise the WHT as a test-bed for its <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> system, and will receive several nights per year for on-sky testing. The project involves construction of new optical experiments at one of the Nasmyth foci, and is called CANARY. CANARY will demonstrate the multi-object <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> (MOAO) required for the EAGLE instrument on the E-ELT.|$|E
5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E
5|$|The random {{selection}} of ninety-one {{stars in the}} Upper Scorpius association provided a sample of stars to be observed using the Near Infrared Imager and Spectrometer (NIRI) and Altitude conjugate <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Optics</b> for the Infrared (ALTAIR) <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> system at the Gemini Observatory. Among the ninety stars selected for direct imaging was the star HIP 78530, which was first imaged by the camera on May 24, 2008. This initial image revealed {{the presence of the}} same faint object within the vicinity of HIP 78530.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Juno was imaged by the Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory at {{visible and}} near-IR wavelengths, using <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics.</b> The images spanned a whole {{rotation}} period and revealed an irregular shape {{and a dark}} albedo feature, interpreted as a fresh impact site.|$|E
5|$|The first scientifically useful {{observation}} of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics,</b> was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii. Neptune is currently entering its {{spring and summer}} season and {{has been shown to}} be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. Both Hubble and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, {{the smallest of the}} Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> (AO).|$|E
5|$|Following Galileos planned {{destruction}} in Jupiter's atmosphere in September 2003, new observations of Io's volcanism came from Earth-based telescopes. In particular, <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> imaging from the Keck telescope in Hawaii and imaging from the Hubble telescope have allowed astronomers to monitor Io's active volcanoes. This imaging has allowed scientists to monitor volcanic activity on Io, {{even without a}} spacecraft in the Jovian system.|$|E
5|$|After {{the stellar}} {{parameters}} were established, the Kepler science team ran models and fits {{to ensure that}} Kepler-5's transit event was not a false positive, such as an eclipsing binary star. Once the planetary nature of Kepler-5b was established, the Kepler team searched for the planet's occultation behind its star, hoping to find the temperature on its day side. They found both, {{and were able to}} set the equilibrium temperature of the planet. The use of speckle imaging using <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> at the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California isolated the starlight of Kepler-5 from background stars.|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} using <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> in late 1997 {{and early}} 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets.|$|E
5|$|As of 2015, UCSC's faculty include 13 {{members of}} the National Academy of Sciences, 24 fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and 33 fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The young Baskin School of Engineering, UCSC's first {{professional}} school and home to the Expressive Intelligence Studio, and the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering are gaining recognition, as has the work that UCSC researchers David Haussler and Jim Kent have done on the Human Genome Project, including the widely used UCSC Genome Browser. UCSC administers the National Science Foundation's Center for <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Optics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 2010, {{long after}} the microlensing event had subsided, the science teams {{studying}} the star used the NACO <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> facility at the Very Large Telescope in Chile to determine the actual apparent magnitude of the star that microlensed its background star, hoping {{to compare it to}} the magnitude of the star measured during the microlensing event. A discrepancy was found, a discrepancy that may have been a result of either error or of a planetary body. Interpretation of follow-up observations led to the planet's confirmation. The ratio between the planet's mass and its host star's mass is well-constrained, but a large interval of uncertainty exists because the host star's mass is known within a large confidence interval that spans the mass of all red dwarf stars.|$|E
5|$|The WIYN Observatory's 3.5m {{telescope}} {{was used for}} speckle imaging on June 18, 2010; in addition, the PHARO camera on the Palomar Observatory's 5m {{telescope was}} used for its <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> capabilities. These observations, combined with observations of Kepler-10's spectrum taken from the W.M. Keck Observatory, ruled {{out the possibility that}} a nearby star's light was corrupting the observed spectrum of Kepler-10 and creating the results that had led astronomers to believe that a second planet existed in Kepler-10's orbit. All of these possibilities, with the exception of if such a star existed exactly behind or in front of Kepler-10, were effectively ruled out; even with this, the Kepler team found that if a star was indeed aligned with Kepler-10 as seen from Earth, such a star would probably not be a giant star.|$|E
5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/m³, {{is less than}} half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no direct}} {{replacement}} to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes {{do not duplicate}} Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the farther infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying {{the expense of a}} space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers may {{be close}} to solving this mystery. They noticed a large plume of gas {{extending}} at least six times its stellar radius indicating that Betelgeuse is not shedding matter evenly in all directions. The plume's presence implies that the spherical symmetry of the star's photosphere, often observed in the infrared, is not preserved in its close environment. Asymmetries on the stellar disk had been reported at different wavelengths. However, due to the refined capabilities of the NACO <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> on the VLT, these asymmetries have come into focus. The two mechanisms that could cause such asymmetrical mass loss, were large-scale convection cells or polar mass loss, possibly due to rotation. Probing deeper with ESO's AMBER, gas in the supergiant's extended atmosphere has been observed vigorously moving up and down, creating bubbles {{as large as the}} supergiant itself, leading his team to conclude that such stellar upheaval is behind the massive plume ejection observed by Kervella.|$|E
5|$|Neptune is {{not visible}} to the unaided eye {{and is the only}} planet in the Solar System found by {{mathematical}} prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} aims of {{the astronomers}} who {{designed}} the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies {{to a level of}} detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from spherical aberration when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes billions of years to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows {{a better understanding of how}} they evolve.|$|E
5|$|To {{overcome}} these challenges, researchers have employed various solutions. Astronomical interferometry, first conceived by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1868, was the seminal concept that has enabled major improvements in modern telescopy {{and led to}} the creation of the Michelson interferometer in the 1880s, and the first successful measurement of Betelgeuse. Just as human depth perception increases when two eyes instead of one perceive an object, Fizeau proposed the observation of stars through two apertures instead of one to obtain interferences that would furnish information on the star's spatial intensity distribution. The science evolved quickly and multiple-aperture interferometers are now used to capture speckled images, which are synthesized using Fourier analysis to produce a portrait of high resolution. It was this methodology that identified the hotspots on Betelgeuse in the 1990s. Other technological breakthroughs include <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics,</b> space observatories like Hipparcos, Hubble and Spitzer, and the Astronomical Multi-BEam Recombiner (AMBER), which combines the beams of three telescopes simultaneously, allowing researchers to achieve milliarcsecond spatial resolution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with active optics, which works on a longer timescale to correct the primary mirror geometry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> {{was first}} applied to flood-illumination retinal imaging to produce images of single cones {{in the living}} human eye. It has also been used in {{conjunction}} with scanning laser ophthalmoscopy to produce (also in living human eyes) the first images of retinal microvasculature and associated blood flow and retinal pigment epithelium cells in addition to single cones. Combined with optical coherence tomography, <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> has allowed the first three-dimensional images of living cone photoreceptors to be collected.|$|E
25|$|Besides its use for {{improving}} nighttime astronomical imaging and retinal imaging, <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> technology {{has also been}} used in other settings. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> is used for solar astronomy at observatories such as the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. It {{is also expected to}} play a military role by allowing ground-based and airborne laser weapons to reach and destroy targets at a distance including satellites in orbit. The Missile Defense Agency Airborne Laser program is the principal example of this.|$|E
25|$|In astronomy, <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> is a {{technique}} to measure variable image distortions and adapt a deformable mirror accordingly on a timescale of milliseconds, {{to compensate for the}} distortions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adaptive</b> <b>optics,</b> {{especially}} wavefront-coding spatial light modulators, {{are frequently}} used in optical trapping applications to multiplex and dynamically reconfigure laser foci {{that are used}} to micro-manipulate biological specimens.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the initial}} {{development}} work on <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> {{was done by the}} US military during the Cold War and was intended for use in tracking Soviet satellites.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> (AO) is a {{technology}} {{used to improve}} the performance of optical systems by reducing the effect of wavefront distortions: it aims at correcting the deformations of an incoming wavefront by deforming a mirror in order {{to compensate for the}} distortion. It is used in astronomical telescopes and laser communication systems to remove the effects of atmospheric distortion, in microscopy, optical fabrication and in retinal imaging systems to reduce optical aberrations. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> works by measuring the distortions in a wavefront and compensating for them with a device that corrects those errors such as a deformable mirror or a liquid crystal array.|$|E
25|$|Developments of <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> include {{systems with}} {{multiple}} lasers over a wider corrected field, and/or working above kiloHertz rates for good correction at visible wavelengths; these {{are currently in}} progress but not yet in routine operation as of 2015.|$|E
25|$|Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) {{deformable}} {{mirrors and}} magnetics concept deformable mirrors are currently {{the most widely}} used technology in wavefront shaping applications for <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> given their versatility, stroke, maturity of technology and the high resolution wavefront correction that they afford.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> {{was first}} envisioned by Horace W. Babcock in 1953, {{and was also}} {{considered}} in science fiction, as in Poul Anderson's novel Tau Zero (1970), {{but it did not}} come into common usage until advances in computer technology during the 1990s made the technique practical.|$|E
25|$|After {{propagation}} of a wavefront, {{parts of it}} may overlap leading to interference and preventing <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> from correcting it. Propagation of a curved wavefront always leads to amplitude variation. This needs to be considered if a good beam profile is to be achieved in laser applications.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, a {{research}} team introduced Transparent ionic conduction speaker which a 2 layers transparent conductive gel and {{a layer of}} transparent rubber in between to make high voltage and high actuation work to reproduce good sound quality. The speaker is suitable for robotics, mobile computing and <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> fields.|$|E
25|$|First methane {{brown dwarf}} verified. Gliese 229B is {{discovered}} orbiting red dwarf Gliese 229A (20 ly away) using an <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> coronagraph to sharpen {{images from the}} 60-inch (1.5m) reflecting telescope at Palomar Observatory on Southern California's Mt. Palomar; follow-up infrared spectroscopy made with their 200-inch (5m) Hale telescope shows an abundance of methane.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} perform <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> correction, {{the shape of}} the {{incoming}} wavefronts must be measured as a function of position in the telescope aperture plane. Typically the circular telescope aperture is split up into an array of pixels in a wavefront sensor, either using an array of small lenslets (a Shack–Hartmann sensor), or using a curvature or pyramid sensor which operates on images of the telescope aperture. The mean wavefront perturbation in each pixel is calculated. This pixelated map of the wavefronts is fed into the deformable mirror and used to correct the wavefront errors introduced by the atmosphere. It is not necessary for the shape or size of the astronomical object to be known– even Solar System objects which are not point-like {{can be used in a}} Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor, and time-varying structure on the surface of the Sun is commonly used for <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> at solar telescopes. The deformable mirror corrects incoming light so that the images appear sharp.|$|E
25|$|For astronomical imaging, the {{atmosphere}} prevents optimal resolution from being {{achieved in the}} visible spectrum due to the atmospheric scattering and dispersion which cause stars to twinkle. Astronomers refer to this effect as the quality of astronomical seeing. Techniques known as <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> {{have been used to}} eliminate the atmospheric disruption of images and achieve results that approach the diffraction limit.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} form of <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> is tip-tilt correction, which {{corresponds to}} correction of the tilts of the wavefront in two dimensions (equivalent to correction {{of the position}} offsets for the image). This is performed using a rapidly moving tip–tilt mirror that makes small rotations around two of its axes. A significant fraction of the aberration introduced by the atmosphere can be removed in this way.|$|E
