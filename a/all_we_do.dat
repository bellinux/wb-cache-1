500|$|Before {{showing the}} songs to the band, McKinnon and Skaff worked on them alone. When the pair {{had all of}} the song ideas, they worked on them as a full-band, with {{pre-production}} being undertaken in, as Skaff commented, [...] "a makeshift studio" [...] by Andrew Wade. Woodard commented that the band had [...] "been going in from 11am until 9pm and <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> is sit around and play." [...] Between demoing the songs, and their final forms on the album, Woodard said [...] "crazy things were happening – verses became choruses", with Chad Gilbert assisting the band with arrangements and writing. As the band thought they were getting better as songwriters, Woodard stated, [...] "it's getting more heavy and more pop." [...] One song that the band recorded was [...] "screwed up really bad and it didn't make the record", as Skaff comments, as the group recorded it at a fast pace and when McKinnon tried to [...] "sing it was like rap music. [...] And we were like 'that's not good'." [...] Asked if the band would {{use it as a}} possible B-side, Skaff said [...] "its possible [...] might use it for the next record or something like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|A bronze Roman piece c. 200 BC to 200 AD {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} in the museum – it was {{discovered}} in 1960 and is a rare item that was unearthed after over 1,800 years. Wagner bought the item from Rik Gijsen, a Netherlands-based antiquities dealer. The piece was acquired by the museum in April 2006. Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers. The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April. Arlene and George Wagner traveled the globe in search of nutcrackers for the museum: [...] "That's <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>do!</b> My husband and I have never been on a cruise. We just got back from Europe yesterday, hunting for nutcrackers. We went to the Netherlands. We attended a couple of very big European antique shows. We also had nutcrackers waiting for us to pick up – very valuable 16th and 17th century ones." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Only {{to think}} of it!" [...] said Mrs. Chipperton. [...] "After <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> for her! I don't believe she was queen more than an hour. It's the {{shortest}} reign I ever heard of." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{can easily}} believe it. Individuality runs through <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> however {{seemingly}} mechanical. But are {{the points of}} a sort that you could make clear in court {{to the satisfaction of}} a jury?' ...|$|E
6000|$|MARY. Well, I warn you. Johnny's very queer just now; he's in the [...] "lose {{the world}} to save your soul" [...] mood. It really is too bad of that girl. After <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> what most people wouldn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "What! After <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{for you in}} {{the woods}} last Winter?" [...] demanded Fred. They had found Stowell with Werner and Glutts and had rescued the little cadet from the bullies and seen him safe on his way home.|$|R
6000|$|The captain did {{not know}} what Staniford began to laugh at. [...] "Our Puritan {{ancestors}} knew just how much human nature could stand, after <b>all.</b> <b>We</b> <b>did</b> not have an uninterrupted Sabbath till the Sabbath had become much milder. Is that it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is this. Let us get up a {{newspaper}} of our own--write it all ourselves, and have <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> in it. Don't {{you think we}} can get a lot of fun out of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it is not}} simple," [...] {{said the}} earl, [...] "because {{we do not know}} which basket he is in. We know he is in one of them, but that is <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> know. You see now, I reckon, that I was right; it takes three funerals, there is no other way." ...|$|E
60|$|And so, after <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} we have lost any greater thing in not seeing the sunset from the Gardens, where half a dozen artists are always {{painting}} it, or from the quay of the Zattere, where it is splendid over and under the island church of San Giorgio in Alga.|$|E

I should have thought common gratitude, common decency, would have brought him after--after <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> for him." ...|$|R
60|$|He kept {{me there}} {{half a day}} before he gave up. After that, when Lop-Ear and I were {{reasonably}} sure of gaining the double-cave, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not retreat up the cliff to our own cave when Red-Eye came upon the scene. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> was {{to keep an eye}} on him and see that he did not cut across our line of retreat.|$|R
6000|$|... "There must be!" [...] cried Inglewood, turning {{round in}} a {{singular}} excitement--"there {{must be something}} to wake up to! <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> is preparations--your cleanliness, and my healthiness, and Warner's scientific appliances. We're always preparing for something--something that never comes off. I ventilate the house, and you sweep the house; but {{what is going to}} HAPPEN in the house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{business}}! The roofing business! Roofs for cowsheds! Oh, I don't mean I haven't {{had a lot}} of fun out of the Game; out {{of putting}} it over on the labor unions, and seeing a big check coming in, and the business increasing. But what's the use of it? You know, my business isn't distributing roofing--it's principally keeping my competitors from distributing roofing. Same with you. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> is cut each other's throats and make the public pay for it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, daughter," [...] {{said the}} Deacon, [...] "it's a pity {{we should go}} through <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{in this world and}} not learn {{anything}} by it. I hope the Lord has taught me not to worry, but just do my best and leave myself and everything else in his hands. We can't help ourselves--we can't make one hair white or black. Why should we wear our lives out fretting? If I'd a known that years ago it would a been better for us all." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Pain In My Heart - {{this was}} written {{some time ago}} not long after I lost my old man and I guess is about that. It's been slowly put {{together}} over time, {{so much so that}} most of the recording was already <b>done,</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> was add some real piano." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Handsome! Nobody {{can call}} such an {{undersized}} man handsome. He is not five foot nine. I should not {{wonder if he}} is not more than five foot eight.

3000|$|<b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> in the {{previous}} paragraphs can be repeated if we change the weak topology for a generic Hausdorff topology for a lcs (X, τ [...]).

6000|$|... "I am not sure," [...] he said. [...] "There are men in {{this country}} who seem to enjoy {{scattering}} sparks, and they are rather busy just now. It is, perhaps, not very hazardous when it is done judiciously and one knows there is only a little tinder here and there, but when one flings them broadcast it is possible that two or three may fall on powder." [...] He turned and stretched out a dainty, olive-tinted hand towards the forest. [...] "After <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know much about what goes on there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Undoubtedly; when we {{know the}} character, {{we can see it}} in the writing. The {{difficulty}} is, to see it and read it BEFORE we know it; and I have practised a little at that. There is character in <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> of course--our walk, our cough, the very wave of our hands; the only secret is, not all of us have always skill to see it. Here, however, I feel pretty sure. The curls of the g's and the tails of the y's--how full they are of wile, of low, underhand trickery!" ...|$|E
60|$|For the Lord is at hand. Close {{to all of}} us: {{watching}} <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> {{and setting}} the right value on it. He cannot mistake. He sees {{both sides of a}} matter, and all sides--a thousand sides which we cannot see. He can judge better than we. Let him judge. Why do I say, Let him judge? He has judged already, weeks, months ago, as soon as each quarrel happened: and, perhaps, he found us in the wrong as well as our neighbours; and, if so, the least said the soonest mended. Let us forgive and forget, lest we be neither forgotten nor forgiven.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he didn't, he {{came away}} with me, you know that. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> was to tie you fast and throw that pillow over your face. Then we came away and locked the door. It was only a bit of fun, to pay you back for putting me on the freight car." ...|$|R
5000|$|How can the materialistic philosophic naturalistic base {{dependency}} of Darwinism {{be brought}} into the discussion and used for our benefit? We didn't use it. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> was stay with evidence, and we got run over.

Who am I that I should complain? The great wheel of Fate rolls on like a Juggernaut, and crushes us all in turn, some soon, some late -- {{it does not matter}} when, in the end, it crushes us <b>all.</b> <b>We</b> <b>do</b> not prostrate ourselves before it like the poor Indians; we fly hither and thither -- we cry for mercy; but it is of no use, the black Fate thunders on and in its season reduces us to powder.|$|E
6000|$|Lee's army {{will be your}} {{objective}} point. Wherever Lee goes, [...] {{there you}} will go also. The only point upon which I am now in [...] doubt is, {{whether it will be}} better to cross the Rapidan above [...] or below him. Each plan presents great advantages over the [...] other with corresponding objections. By crossing above, Lee is [...] cut off from all chance of ignoring Richmond and going north on [...] a raid. But if we take this route, <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> must be done [...] whilst the rations we start with hold out. We separate from [...] Butler so that he cannot be directed how to co-operate.

6000|$|But {{some may}} ask, 'How will believing that Jesus is the Son of God help {{us more than}} believing the other? For, after <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> believe it. We all believe that Jesus is the Son of God: but as for {{overcoming}} the world, we dare not say too much of that. We fear we are letting the world overcome us; we are living too much in continual fear of the chances and changes of this mortal life. We are letting things go too much their own way. We are trying too much each {{to get what he}} can by his own selfish wits, without considering his neighbours. We are following too much the ways and fashions of the day, and doing and saying and thinking anything that comes uppermost, just because others do so round us.' ...|$|E
