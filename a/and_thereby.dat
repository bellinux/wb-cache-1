5|$|The American {{government}} saw {{the evacuation}} {{as an opportunity}} to weaken the communists by providing for <b>and</b> <b>thereby</b> winning the loyalty of the refugees to the anti-communist cause. The United States Operation Mission proposed that aside from helping to evacuate refugees to the south <b>and</b> <b>thereby</b> draining the communist population base, the Americans should provide healthcare, shelter, food and clothing in order to help the anti-communists win the fidelity of their compatriots. Another benefit of participating in the evacuation was that American personnel would be on the ground in North Vietnam, allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities.|$|E

5|$|After {{two months}} of planning, Bonaparte decided that France's naval power was not yet strong enough to confront the British Royal Navy.

5|$|Archaea are prokaryotic {{unicellular}} organisms, {{and form}} the first domain of life, in Carl Woese's three-domain system. A prokaryote {{is defined as}} having no cell nucleus or other membrane bound-organelle. Archaea share this defining feature with the bacteria {{with which they were}} once grouped. In 1990 the microbiologist Woese proposed the three-domain system that divided living things into bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, <b>and</b> <b>thereby</b> split the prokaryote domain.|$|E

5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits {{the progression of}} topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed <b>and</b> <b>thereby</b> stopping the process of replication. It may also increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E

5|$|Gastric acid acts as {{a barrier}} against {{microorganisms}} to prevent infections and {{is important for the}} digestion of food. Its low pH denatures proteins <b>and</b> <b>thereby</b> makes them susceptible to degradation by digestive enzymes such as pepsin. The low pH also activates the enzyme precursor pepsinogen into the active enzyme pepsin by self-cleavage. After leaving the stomach, the hydrochloric acid of the chyme is neutralized in the duodenum by sodium bicarbonate.|$|E
