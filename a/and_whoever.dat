5|$|In March 2010, the NFL amended {{its rules}} for postseason overtime, with the rule being {{extended}} into {{the regular season}} in March 2012. If a team scores a touchdown, or if the defense scores a safety on its first possession, it is declared the winner. If it scores a field goal on its first possession, however, it then kicks off to the opposing team, which {{has an opportunity to}} score; if the score is tied again after that possession, true sudden death rules apply <b>and</b> <b>whoever</b> scores next will win.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural Giro used a points {{system to}} {{determine}} the race winner. The organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around elapsed time after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. Another factor in the organizer's decision {{was that it would}} be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than clocking their times during each stage. The race leader was determined by adding up each rider's placing in each stage. Thus if a rider placed second in the first stage and third in the second stage he would have a total of five points, <b>and</b> <b>whoever</b> had the lowest points total was the leader. Under this system Luigi Ganna was declared the winner, but had the Giro been a time-based event he would have lost to the third-place finisher Giovanni Rossignoli by 37 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Javelins {{were often}} used as an {{effective}} hunting weapon, the strap adding enough power to take down large game.

25|$|During the 1930s, many Nationalist Party {{leaders and}} wide {{sections}} of the Afrikaner people came strongly {{under the influence of}} the Nazi movement which dominated Germany from 1933 to 1945. There were many reasons for this. Germany was the traditional enemy of Britain, <b>and</b> <b>whoever</b> opposed Britain was seen as a friend of the Nationalists. Many Nationalists, moreover, believed that the opportunity to re-establish their lost republic would come with the defeat of the British Empire in the international arena. The more belligerent Hitler became, the higher hopes rose that a new era of Afrikanerdom was about to dawn.|$|E
25|$|Beuys made {{it clear}} that he {{considered}} this song as a work of art, not the “pop” product it appears to be, which is apparent from the moment one views it. Such becomes more obvious when one looks at the lyrics, which are aimed directly at Reagan, the military complex <b>and</b> <b>whoever</b> is trying to defrost the “Cold War” to make it “hot.” The song has to be understood in the context of intense liberal and progressive frustration in 1982. Beuys warns Reagan et al. that the peace-loving masses are behind him, and that includes the Americans as well.|$|E

25|$|Owing to Siraj ud Dowla’s {{harshness}} of {{temper and}} indulgence, fear and terror had {{settled on the}} hearts of everyone {{to such an extent}} that no one among his generals of the army or the noblemen of the city was free from anxiety. Among his officers, whoever went to wait on Siraj ud Dowla despaired of life and honour, <b>and</b> <b>whoever</b> returned without being disgraced and ill-treated offered thanks to God. Siraj ud Dowla treated all the noblemen and capable generals of Alivardi Khan with ridicule and drollery, and bestowed on each some contemptuous nickname that ill-suited any of them. And whatever harsh expressions and abusive epithet came to his lips, Siraj ud Dowla uttered them unhesitatingly in the face of everyone, and no one had the boldness to breathe freely in his presence.|$|E
25|$|Papak's {{picture has}} been drawn on both Shapur's coins and later Ardashir's; {{in the picture}} of the Papak drawn on Shapur's coins, he wears a wig {{dissimilar}} to normal Parthian and local Persian shahs and only Shapur has worn a royal wig. According to royal reports, it was Papak who overthrew Gochihr and appointed Shapur instead of him. Ardashir refused to accept Shapur's appointment and removed his brother <b>and</b> <b>whoever</b> stood against him and then minted coins with his face drawn on them and Papak's behind them. Papak's picture on Ardashir-Papak coins, wears a wig similar to those of local Persian shahs in contrast to his picture in Shapur-Papak coins. According to the descriptions given on Papak's pictures on the coins, it is probable that the determining role of Ardashir depicted in leading the rebellion against the central government is the product of later historical studies. It is probable that Papak had united most of Pars under his rule by the time; since his picture exists on Ardashir's coins too.|$|E

50|$|In 1997, {{the show}} {{traveled}} to Arlington Race Course. Because for obvious reasons, the Pot O' Gold set couldn't come along, a special version of Knockout was played: the returning champion chose {{a spot on}} the arena, and the challenger got the spot directly 180 degrees from it. The bouncing cube was released, <b>and</b> <b>whoever's</b> cylinder wasn't knocked out was the winner. If it was the champion, he won another $20,000. If it was the challenger, he got the cash bonus hiding underneath the spot on the arena, up to $200,000.|$|R

500|$|On December 28, 2012, It was {{announced}} via Say Anything's Facebook page that Coby {{had left the}} band on good terms. Max Bemis stated the following in regards to seeking a new drummer [...] "Say Anything will continue on without Coby but {{we will not be}} seeking a replacement drummer to play on the records we put out, as Coby and his style of drumming is, in many senses, irreplaceable; rather we plan on having a multitude of drummers play on our material. Say Anything on record will now be identified in the same way Nine Inch Nails is, in that it’s pretty much me <b>and</b> <b>whoever</b> I choose to play with at the time. Live shows will continue to have their own identity including Jake, Jeff, Parker, Adam, <b>and</b> <b>whoever</b> plays drums for us live. The band couldn’t be further from breaking up, and as I’ve said recently, we plan on releasing music as Say Anything forever, and already have a lot in the works." ...|$|E

50|$|On January 29, 2000 {{the show}} had yet another rule change. This time, there are 25 people instead of 18 (although on the episode Kollmeyer {{mentioned}} {{there were still}} 18 contestants), and they divide amongst themselves into 5 teams of 5 each. Each team stands {{in one of the}} pinball slots 1-5, <b>and</b> <b>whoever's</b> slot gets picked gets to play the next game. Lots are drawn before each game to determine the captain for each game, and it is possible for the same team to play all three mini-games. Teams are not required to pick the same step.|$|R
500|$|On 5 May 1892, an {{election}} held at Etchmiadzin unanimously elected Khrimian {{to the position}} of Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church. According to Vartooguian, [...] "Khrimian's popularity was so overwhelming that any one opposing him would be recognized by the nation as a traitor. Khrimian was recognized as the standard of patriotism, <b>and</b> <b>whoever</b> sought {{the best interests of the}} nation could not but favor his election." [...] Vartooguian adds that the Russian imperial government was displeasing with his election as they sought to incorporate the Armenian Church under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church in an attempt to Russify the Armenian population.|$|E
500|$|The hit single [...] "Basket Case", which {{appeared}} on many singles charts worldwide, was also inspired by Armstrong's personal experiences. The song deals with Armstrong's anxiety attacks {{and feelings of}} [...] "going crazy" [...] prior to being diagnosed with a panic disorder. [...] In the third verse, [...] "Basket Case" [...] references soliciting a male prostitute; Armstrong noted that [...] "I wanted to challenge myself <b>and</b> <b>whoever</b> the listener might be. It's also {{looking at the world}} and saying, 'It's not as black and white as you think. This isn't your grandfather's prostitute – or maybe it was.'" [...] The music video was filmed in an abandoned mental institution. This is one of the band's most popular songs.|$|E
500|$|... "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)" [...] {{is one of}} its author's {{most popular}} songs, among fans and music critics, and {{features}} a series of much-praised slide-guitar solos from Harrison. The recording signalled a deliberate departure from his earlier post-Beatles work, in the scaling down of the big sound synonymous with All Things Must Pass and his other co-productions with Phil Spector over 1970–71. Aside from Harrison, the musicians on the track are Nicky Hopkins, Jim Keltner, Klaus Voormann and Gary Wright. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of his desire to be free of karma and the constant cycle of rebirth; he later described the song as [...] "a prayer and personal statement between me, the Lord, <b>and</b> <b>whoever</b> likes it".|$|E
