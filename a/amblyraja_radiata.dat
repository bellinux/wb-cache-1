Without knowing the species, we cannot with accuracy detect changes in distribution or abundance due to climate change, fisheries, diseases or any other types of impact. This thesis gives the first complete overview of chondrichthyan fishes (sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras), recorded in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. A total of 49 species were found to occur, and the most specious regions were the Bering Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea, {{also known as the}} Arctic Gateways. The Bering Strait is an effective zoogeographic barrier, separating the Pacific from the Atlantic species. In particular, skates are prone to misidentifications. Species complexes are known to occur, and the group is commonly lumped as “Skates & Rays” in fishery statistics or in scientific publications. By use of genetic methods (DNA barcoding), the skate species reported from the northern Northeast (nNE) Atlantic was investigated. A total of 12 species were found to occur in the area, and three of those were new for the region. Skates are commonly encountered in the nNE Atlantic, but ~ 95 % are the smaller-sized <b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata.</b> Larger skates may be landed and they are necessarily a mix of the remaining 11 species, some of which are considered threatened. There were strong indications of the disappearance of Leucoraja fullonica, as well as over-reporting of the critically endangered common skate complex formerly known as Dipturus batis. <b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata</b> was suspected to be cryptic due to large differences in size-at-maturity across its distributional range. However, the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) did not support this hypothesis. To further elucidate this question, a higher resolution method was applied, and 10 microsatellite markers were investigated from specimens across the North (N) Atlantic. Pairwise fixation indexes (FST) indicated that there may be three major clusters in the N Atlantic: Northwest Atlantic, Mid Atlantic (Greenland) and NE Atlantic. However, more rigorous tests revealed high physical mixing of individuals over a large geographical area. The microsatellite results did not support the hypothesis of A. radiata being cryptic. Although the population structure of A. radiata could not be fully explained, baselines for occurrence of chondrichthyan fishes are established, and a new identification guide for skates in the nNE Atlantic is provided.

40|$|Mature thorny (<b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata),</b> winter (Leucoraja ocellata), {{and smooth}} (Malacoraja senta) skates have {{declined}} to very low abundance in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (SGSL) and on the eastern Scotian Shelf (ESS). We used stage-structured state-space models to examine decadal patterns in mortality rates in these skates. Mortality at early life stages (embryos in egg cases, hatchlings, and (or) small juveniles) appeared to decrease between the 1970 s and the 2000 s. In contrast, estimated mortality rates increased for larger individuals over this period. Although potentially confounded in models with effects of any changes in juvenile growth, the estimated increases in mortality could not instead be attributed solely to changes in growth. Increases in the mortality of large individuals appeared to reflect increases in natural mortality, possibly due to predation by grey seals. Increases in natural mortality were not evident for skates on the neighbouring western Scotian Shelf, where grey seal abundance has remained lower. Even {{in the absence of}} fishing, recovery of skates is unlikely under current ecosystem conditions in the SGSL and on the ESS. 16 page(s...|$|E

40|$|This {{evaluation}} of thorny skate (<b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata)</b> represents the fourth assessment of this relatively new fishery. The stock biomass indices, following a decline to their lowest historic {{level in the}} early- 1990 s have stabilized since the mid- 1990 s. However, a change in research survey gear (in the fall of 1995) with different catch characteristics has created a discontinuity in the survey time series, thereby preventing a comparison between two periods: 1986 to 1994, and 1995 to date. The spring survey, previously used to estimate biomass and abundance, may not include {{a substantial portion of}} the population, and thus represents only the portion of the stock that occurs within the surveyed area. On average (1990 - 2002), fall survey estimates of biomass for the comparable area (NAFO Divisions 3 LNO) were 41 %. Analysis of lengths taken during research surveys have covered a consistent range since 1985, with main modes occurring at 15 - 32 cm and 65 - 83 cm in both spring and fall, the latter mode comprising mature skates.

In the alternative, AWI seeks an endangered listing for the United States DPS of the thorny skate. In addition, for the United States population, AWI seeks the designation of critical habitat as authorized by statute. The thorny skate is a “K‐selected ” species and as such is relatively long‐lived, reaches sexual maturity at a late age, and has a low fecundity. Given these life history characteristics and the species ’ limited ability to recover in response to abrupt population declines, the thorny skate is particularly vulnerable to overexploitation. Thorny skate populations throughout the northwest Atlantic have declined precipitously over the past four decades. In Canada, where the species is still fished in a directed fishery, thorny skates have suffered a dramatic population decline since the 1980 s that is conspicuously parallel to the species’ decline in United States waters.

The observer onboard collected data of catches by species, effort and position by haul and took length distribution samples of the following species: Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, Macrourus berglax, Gadus morhua, Pandalus borealis, Hippoglossoides platessoides and Sebastes spp. Biological sampling of Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, Gadus morhua, Hippoglossoides platessoides, Gadus ogac and <b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata</b> was done. Otoliths of Greenland halibut and Cod were also taken for age determination. During this {{experimental fishing}} 124 hauls were carried out with a bottom trawl gear (40 mm cod end) and 10 more hauls with a semipelagic trawl (40 mm cod end). The main catches were Greenland halibut (88 %) and Northern prawn (6 %) for the bottom trawl gear and Northern prawn (74 %) for the pelagic one. Table 1 shows the catches by species and division and Table 3 presents the effort in hours by division and their percentage by gear and Division.

40|$|Population genetic {{structure}} of the thorny skate (<b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata)</b> was surveyed in > 300 individuals sampled from Newfoundland, Iceland, Norway, the Kattegat and the central North Sea. A 290 -bp fragment of the mt cytochrome-b gene was first screened by SSCP. Sequences of SSCP haplotypes revealed 34 haplotypes, 14 of which were unique to Iceland, 3 to Newfoundland, 1 to Norway and 3 to the Kattegat. The global F ST was weak but significant. Removal of the two Kattegat locations, which were the most differentiated, resulted in no significant genetic differentiation. Haplotype diversity was high and evenly distributed across the entire Atlantic (h = 0. 8) {{with the exception of}} the North Sea (h = 0. 48). Statistical parsimony revealed a star-like genealogy with a central widespread haplotype. A subsequent nested clade analysis led to the inference of contiguous expansion with evidence for long distance dispersal between Newfoundland and Iceland. Historical demographic analysis showed that thorny skates have undergone exponential population expansion that started between 1. 1 million and 690, 000 years ago; and that the Last Glacial Maximum apparently had little effect. These results strongly differ from those of a parallel study of the thornback ray (Raja clavata) in which clear structure and former refugial areas could be identified. Although both species have similar life history traits and overlapping ranges, the continental shelf edge apparently does not present a barrier to migration in A. radiata, as it does for R. clavat...|$|E
40|$|Data for roughhead {{grenadier}} (Macrourus berglax), thorny skate (<b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata)</b> and white hake (Urophycis tenuis) from Spanish Spring survey are presented. The survey vessel changed in 2001, form the C/V Playa de Menduíña to the R/V Vizconde de Eza, so, in oder {{to maintain the}} historical series, we transformed the data for {{roughhead grenadier}} and thorny skate until that year. 1997 - 2000 data are transformed data from the C/V Playa de Menduíña and 2002 - 2005 data are original data from R/V Vizconde de Eza. In 2001, there are data from the two vessels for these two species. This year the data were updated, so a new calibration was made. The changes affect the species length distribution. The abundance and biomass were estimated for the period 1997 - 2005 for roughhead grenadier and thorny skate, and 2001 - 2005 for white hake. The length distribution was obtained and presented in numbers per haul stratified mean catches. The indices of Roughhead grenadier present no trend along the years until 2003, with an increasing {{in the last two}} years, mainly in 2004. Thorny skate indices decreased since 2001 until 2003 and increase in 2004, reaching the second highest value of the series. This year, a slight decreasing occurred, but remained in a high value. For white hake, there were great catches in 2001, and a sharp decreasing since then, broken this year with an increasing in the indices.

40|$|Three {{species of}} skates {{commonly}} {{occur in the}} southern Gulf of St. Lawrence: thorny skate <b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata,</b> winter skate Leucoraja ocellata, and smooth skate Malacoraja senta. Trends in their abundance and size are described using data from annual bottom-trawl surveys conducted each September since 1971. Biomass and the abundance of mature skates decreased over the 1971 – 2002 period, by 80 – 90 % for thorny and winter skates, {{and to a lesser}} degree for smooth skates. Abundance of juvenile thorny and smooth skates increased from the mid- 1980 s to a peak in the mid- 1990 s, and then declined in the late 1990 s. Mean length decreased by 20 – 30 % during the 1980 s {{for each of the three}} species. The increase in the abundance of juvenile skates in the 1990 s coincided with a collapse in the biomass of large-bodied demersal teleost fishes, a dramatic decline in fishing effort, a cooling of the cold intermediate layer in the southern Gulf and decreasing abundance of mature skates. The decline in the abundance of large skates may be an effect of fishing, though reported landings of skates have been low. These results for the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence contrast those observed on Georges Bank and in the North Sea, where small elasmobranch species that were not targeted by fisheries increased in biomass as the biomass of heavily exploited groundfish stocks declined.

40|$|The {{thorny skate}} (<b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata)</b> {{is a large}} species of skate that is endemic to {{the waters of the}} western north Atlantic in the Gulf of Maine. Because the biomass of thorny skates has {{recently}} declined below threshold levels mandated by the Sustainable Fisheries Act, commercial harvests from this region are prohibited. We have undertaken a comprehensive study to gain insight into the life history of this skate. The present study describes and characterizes the reproductive cycle of female and male thorny skates, based on monthly samples taken off the coast of New Hampshire, from May 2001 to May 2003. Gonadosomatic index (GSI), shell gland weight, follicle size, and egg case formation, were assessed for 48 female skates. In general, these reproductive parameters remained relatively constant throughout most of the year. However, transient but significant increases in shell gland weight and GSI were obser ved during certain months. Within the cohort of specimens sampled monthly throughout the year, a subset of females always had large preovulatory follicles present in their ovaries. With the exception of June and September specimens, egg cases undergoing various stages of development were observed in the uteri of specimens captured during all other months of the year. For males (n= 48), histological stages III through VI (SIII−SVI) of spermatogenesis, GSI, and hepatosomatic index (HSI) were examined. Although there appeared to be monthly fluctuations in spermatogenesis, GSI, and HSI, no significant differences were found. The production and maintenance of mature spermatocysts (SVI) within the testes was observed throughout the year. These findings collectively indicate that the thorny skate is reproductively active year round...|$|E
40|$|The {{contents}} of 5 061 stomach of five skate species- thorny (<b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata),</b> Arctic (A. hyperborea), spinytail (Bathyraja spinicauda), smooth (Malacoraja senta) and round skates (Rajella fyllae) obtained from Spanish Bottom Trawl Research Surveys in northwest and northeast Atlantic (NAFO, Divisions 3 NO and Div. 3 M; ICES, Div. IIb) {{in the period}} 1996 - 2005 were analyzed to study the feeding intensity and food habits. Feeding intensity was high in all skate species and areas, slightly higher in Div. IIb, showing a general trend to decrease according to the predator size increase. Importance of prey was based in weight percentage. The main prey groups for thorny and Arctic skates were Pisces and Crustacea, but the importance of each group and prey species changed with area. Pisces has {{turn out to be}} the dominant prey taxa for spinytail skate in Div. 3 NO and 3 M. Crustacea have been the dominant prey group for smooth skate. Round skate has changed its main prey group in each area, but polychaetes have been prominent in Div. 3 NO. Predation on fishing processed remnant was important for Arctic skate. Predation on several species of commercial importance was mainly relevant in Div. 3 M. Intra-specific diet overlap showed a different pattern varying with skate species and area. Inter-specific diet overlap reached its highest level in the Arctic area. Thorny skate showed a high diet overlap with the majority of the skate species studied in the NAFO Area, and round skate did not show diet overlap with other skate species in Div. 3 NO.

40|$|Between 1956 and 1995, the thornback ray, Raja clavata, {{disappeared}} from the waters along the continental coasts of the North Sea; and severely declined in most North European waters. Because of its slow growth rate, long generation time, low fecundity and no pelagic larval phase, the time of recovery is long; and thus the alarming decrease has led to concern about the sustainability of skate populations, and whether depleted areas can be naturally replenished from adjacent areas. Because tagging data suggested a small “home range” and philopatric behaviour, relatively strong population differentiation was expected. The aim of this thesis was {{to test this hypothesis}} by assessing the genetic population structure of thornback rays. There were two initial questions: What is the spatial scale and connectivity of genetically defined populations or stocks of the thornback ray, Raja clavata in the North Sea/Northern Atlantic? How well do indirect estimates of migration and connectivity, based on genetic data, correspond to direct estimates based on tagging data? The first step of this study was the development of microsatellite loci, which proved to be difficult but was finally successful. At a regional scale, in British waters, population differentiation was assessed using the five newly developed microsatellite loci and significant global population differentiation was found (FST= 0. 013 P< 0. 001). Pairwise comparisons revealed no relationship with geography or with time and locations sampled in Spring/Summer were more genetically differentiated than locations collected in Autumn/Winter. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the population genetic structure of thornback rays is temporally and spatially dynamic, which may be due to species behavior. Genetic data indicated also that migration distance is substantially larger than suggested by earlier tagging studies. Such discrepancies between tagging and genetic data are common given that tagging studies follow individuals for a maximum of 4 - 5 years (half a generation time for thornback ray), whereas population genetic studies integrate time over several generations. The main conclusions, in any case, are that dispersal capacity of thornback rays is greater than what had been previously reported. At the European scale, the population structure was assessed in Raja clavata using the microsatellite loci and a fragment of 290 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (mtDNA). Strong population differentiation was found among the Mediterranean basin (Corsica, Adriatic and Black Seas), the Azores and the European continental shelf (Britain, Gulf of Biscay and Portugal), as well as a significant isolation by distance. Depth (continental margins), the Gibraltar Strait/Almeria-Oran front and geographic distance act as barriers to gene flow. The genetic diversity distribution and the haplotype network suggested the Iberia Peninsula and the Azores were former glacial refugia, and British waters a secondary contact zone between these two refugia. Population genetic structure was also investigated in <b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata</b> across the Northern Atlantic. <b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata</b> has similar life-history traits than R. clavata, and thus using the same mtDNAmarker, patterns and degree of genetic structure were expected to be similar marker than for R. clavata. Genetic differentiation was not significant across the Northern Atlantic, i. e. at a scale of several thousand kilometers and showed that A. radiata as a higher dispersal capacity than R. clavata. The conclusions here are 1) life history type is not a priori a good predictor of dispersal capacity in Rajidae; and 2) dispersal of <b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata</b> unlike Raja clavata is not restricted by bathymetry. An important parameter for conservation is the effective population size Ne and the Ne/N ratio (N= census population size). Based on temporal samples from 1965 and 2003 - 2004, the Ne was estimated of between 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than N, showing that very few individuals mate and contribute to the next generation. For fisheries management, this low Ne and Ne/N ratio cannot be ignored and strongly suggest the need to protect adults and the mating grounds to avoid further reductions of Ne. Finally mating system of a species is also an important parameter for long term conservation and is not well known for thornback rays. We investigated the possibility that polyandry is part of the mating system in R. clavata by analyzing egg clutches of four females. A minimum of 4 to 6 fathers was necessary to explain the progeny array and thus showed that females are polyandrous. As R. clavata has a long egg-laying season, polyandry could maximize the likelihood of viable sperm being available during the egg-laying season and/or multiple paternity could ensure further fitness advantages for the females. Protecting nurseries and mating grounds are fundamental for efficient conservation in Elasmobranchs, and the low Ne and Ne/N of thornback ray support the need to protect adults and mating grounds. Juveniles and immature rays must also be protected as their morphology and size makes them vulnerable to virtually all classes of nets. The Thames Estuary is known for the high abundance of juveniles and thus constitutes one or several nurseries. Individuals seasonally migrate {{in and out of the}} Thames Esturary and the higher level of population differentiation observed among Spring/Summer populations correlates with this seasonal migration; and suggests a certain level of philopatry, related to mating or egg-laying behaviour. Flatfish fisheries take place in the same area that includes nurseries for thornback rays and the economic value of sole and other fisheries is far higher than that of skates. Thus protected area design with closure areas will be difficult in the Thames estuary. Moreover, even if one type of design proves to be efficient for thornback rays, there is a strong chance that it will not be for another species. This last remark is one of the main reasons for a recent shift from single-species based management to ecosystem based management from which thornback ray may benefit more. Efforts to establish protected areas at the ecosystem level are still difficult. In any case, it is certain that compromises will have to be found between exploitation of a single species and ecosystems management. ...|$|E
40|$|Data from EU-Spain (Instituto Español de Oceanografía) {{bottom trawl}} surveys in the NAFO Regulatory Area (2002 – 2011) were {{analyzed}} to examine {{patterns on the}} South of Grand Banks (NAFO Div. 3 NO) of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity in relation to depth. The 1160 hauls from the slope surveys spanned between 38 and 1460 m in depth. We focused on the 28 most abundant species, which made up 92. 6 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 300 m. Five assemblages were identified. Two shallow assemblages {{were found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 150 and include yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), Northern sand lance (Ammodytes dubius), moustache sculpin (Triglops murrayi), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and web sculpin (Hemitripterus americanus). Assemblage II (Shallow) includes the strata with depths between 151 and 300 m and comprises Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), American angler (Lophius americanus), wolfish (Anarichas lupus) and thorny skate (<b>Amblyraja</b> <b>radiata).</b> Assemblage III (Intermediate) contains the depth strata between 301 and 600 m. Redfish (Sebastes spp.), spotted wolfish (Anarhichas minor), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulatus), Northern wolfish (Anarhichas denticulatus), white hake (Urophycis tenuis), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and longfin hake (Phycis chesteri) were included in the intermediate assemblage. Finally, we found two deep clusters: Assemblage IV (Deep) contains the depths between 601 and 1000 m, and Assemblage V (Deep) the depth strata greater than 1001 m. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) and spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) formed Assemblage IV. Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemnitzii), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborean) and longnose chimera (Harriotta raleighana) made up the deepest assemblage. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse.

Yellowtail flounder appears to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod and American plaice that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the fishing effort in the deep waters of the Grand Banks, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|E
