5|$|When a baserunner is able {{to advance}} after a pitch is not caught or {{controlled}} by the catcher, the official scorer must determine whether the advance was due to <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch or a passed ball. The pitch is never {{considered to be an}} error. If a pitch is thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to the strike zone that a catcher is not able to catch or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can advance, the advance is ruled to have occurred by <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch. Any such pitch which strikes the ground before it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch. However, a pitch is not <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch merely because it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that the catcher {{should have been able to}} control the pitch and prevent an advance with ordinary effort, then the catcher is charged with a passed ball on the advance.|$|E

5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery between its headwaters and Reservoir Road. Between Reservoir Road and {{the mouth of the}} creek, it {{is considered}} to be a Coldwater Fishery. The upper reaches of the creek, between its headwaters and a point slightly downstream of where it enters Schuylkill County are considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class <b>A</b> <b>Wild</b> Trout Waters and the rest of the creek's length is considered to be Approved Trout Waters. The upper reaches of the creek were Class <b>A</b> <b>Wild</b> Trout Waters in 1976 before becoming Class D Wild Trout Waters in 1984. This change was due to acid mine drainage and sediment buildup. However, the creek rebounded to Class <b>A</b> <b>Wild</b> Trout Waters by 1997. The creek is considered to be Class D Wild Trout Waters between T431 and T435. The tributary Trexler Run is also considered to be Class <b>A</b> <b>Wild</b> Trout Waters throughout its length.|$|E

5|$|One {{exception}} in this rule {{occurs when the}} defense makes at least one out and attempts to complete a double play or triple play. An error is not charged in that situation if <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> throw allows the runner to reach safely. If <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> throw allows the runner to advance an additional base, an error may then be charged for the additional advance. However, if an accurate throw is made in time to complete a double play or triple play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, an error may be charged.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have lifespans {{averaging}} 25–30 years. Females usually live longer, as males tend {{to fight}} and often die before reaching maturity. The longest recorded lifespans include 43 years for <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> female ringed seal and 46 years for <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> female grey seal. The age at which a pinniped sexually matures can vary from 2–12 years depending on the species. Females typically mature earlier than males.|$|E

5|$|The {{drainage}} basin of Spring Brook is {{designated as a}} High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its headwaters downstream to the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 476). From that point downstream to its mouth, the {{drainage basin}} of the stream is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in Spring Brook from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. A 2.4-mile (4-kilometer) section of the stream from the Watres Dam downstream to the Nesbitt Reservoir is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class <b>A</b> <b>Wild</b> Trout Waters for both brook trout and brown trout. The tributaries Green Run and Panther Creek are Class <b>A</b> <b>Wild</b> Trout Waters for brook trout {{and part of the}} tributary Rattlesnake Creek is Class <b>A</b> <b>Wild</b> Trout Waters for both brook trout and brown trout.|$|E

5|$|The tie-breaker {{game was}} {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} win–loss records of 91–71 and thus tied for the second Wild Card position in the AL. The Rangers were awarded home field for the game, as they won the regular season series against the Rays, 4–3. The game was televised on TBS. It was the fourth tie-breaker in MLB history for <b>a</b> <b>Wild</b> Card spot, although {{it was the first}} since MLB adopted its current format of two Wild Card teams playing in <b>a</b> <b>Wild</b> Card Game in 2012. The tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics.|$|E
