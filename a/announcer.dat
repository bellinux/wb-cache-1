40|$|This study {{analyzed}} the borrowing of some English words which {{is done by}} the <b>announcers</b> during the presentation of some Entertainment Programmes in EBS Fm Radio Station. Using a tape recorder and a diary, the writer recorded the conversation of the five <b>announcers</b> while they were presenting some programme, then classified the <b>announcers</b> based on the programmes that they handled. After that the English borrowed words were underlined and analyzed one by one. The data analyzed was divided based on the kinds of programmes; entertainment programme and entertainment information. It was found that the words which were often borrowed by the <b>announcers</b> were the English words which are familiar for them such as : single,request, on time, session, guys and gals, stay tune, one o one point twenty five, etc. Those words were said by the five <b>announcers</b> almost all the time and it seems it has become a commitment for them in presenting some programmes. The main reason that made the <b>announcers</b> under study borrowed some English words is their habit in speaking English in their school and in their office which unconciously made them borrow some English words. Besides, there was another factor that made the <b>announcers</b> borrow some English words, that is the condition of the <b>announcers</b> who are bilingual. In one side, they have to use Indonesian in presenting radio programmes and in the other side there is a demand to be able to speak English for Fm Radio Station's <b>announcers.</b> That demand made them use some English words immediately. This study only {{analyzed the}} English words which were often borrowed by the <b>announcers</b> and analyzed the factors that made the <b>announcers</b> borrow some English words in presenting some Indonesian Programmes in Radio Station. There are many shortcomings in terms of scope, instruments and technique of data analysis. Therefore it is suggested : a. Future Research of borrowing could be emphasised on other languages beside English, and on different object of study such as : borrowing some Javanese words in Indonesian or borrowing some Chinese words in Indonesian,etc. b. In borrowing the English. words the <b>announcers</b> should be able to combine those English words into Indonesian in good terms...|$|R
