5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments. This {{is based on the assumption}} that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E

5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> use is the Antikythera mechanism. In {{this case}} {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device.

5|$|In {{the north}} {{transept}} is Wells Cathedral clock, <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> clock from about 1325, {{believed to be}} the work of Peter Lightfoot, a monk of Glastonbury. Its mechanism, dated to between 1386 and 1392, was replaced in the 19th century, and the original mechanism moved to the Science Museum in London, where it continues to operate. It is the second-oldest surviving clock in England, after the Salisbury cathedral clock.|$|E

5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural {{features in the}} landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along {{the path of the}} sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde's Sun Temple is thought to have been <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> observatory.|$|E
5|$|The episode's title {{refers to}} <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> {{alignment}} of three celestial objects, usually the sun, the Earth, and a moon or planet. Mulder and Scully's {{behavior in the}} episode was written specifically by Carter to alert the show's audience that Mulder and Scully would not become a romantic partnership. In addition, the episode contained various fan in-jokes, such as Scully getting upset because Mulder is always the driver, which was inspired by nitpicking from fans.|$|E
5|$|The weak {{interaction}} affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, {{as well as}} the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact through gravity and the {{weak interaction}} only, and neutrinos were the original reason for the name weak force. The weak interaction does not produce bound states (nor does it involve binding energy) – something that gravity does on <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> scale, that the electromagnetic force does at the atomic level, and that the strong nuclear force does inside nuclei.|$|E

5|$|There are variant glyph forms {{which contain}} minor {{alterations}} or additions. Dietrich posited that these variants represent the movement, position, {{and significance of}} astronomical bodies. A variant form might state whether a star is rising, culminating or setting; {{or whether it is}} used for navigation or for calendrical/time-keeping purposes. In particular, doubling of a feature may refer to the culmination of <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> body in the sky.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>astronomical</b> text {{recovered}} from Tomb no.3 in Mawangdui contains images {{and descriptions of}} 29 different comets. The descriptions often include the comet's name, notes about its apparition, and its associated portent, usually military, but lack detailed dates of the comets' sightings. This text can be solidly dated as being prior to 168 BC, the date assigned to the tomb. It {{may be associated with}} a similar astronomical text from the same tomb, which details planetary motions for the seventy years ending 177 BC.|$|E
5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, <b>An</b> <b>Astronomical</b> Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E

5|$|He {{supported}} {{the development of}} the sciences, particularly cartography; he hired a personal cartographer (Karol de Perthees) even before his election as king. A plan he initiated to map the entire territory of the Commonwealth, however, was never finished. At the Royal Castle in Warsaw, he organized <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> observatory and supported astronomers Jan Śniadecki and Marcin Odlanicki Poczobutt. He also sponsored historical studies, including the collection, cataloging and copying of historical manuscripts. He encouraged publications of biographies of famous Polish historical figures, and sponsored their paintings and sculptures.|$|E
5|$|Janet (stylized as janet.) is {{the fifth}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson, released on May 18, 1993, by Virgin Records America. Prior to its release, Jackson {{was at the center}} of a high-profile bidding war over her recording contract. In 1991, her original label A sought to renew her contract, while others, such as Atlantic, Capitol, and Virgin all vied to sign her. After meeting with Virgin owner Richard Branson, she signed with the label. The contract was worth <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> $40 million dollars, making her the world's then-highest paid musical act.|$|E
5|$|To {{test this}} idea he {{surveyed}} hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but {{he planned to}} show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing that there was <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> intent to the orientation of {{at least some of}} the alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two solstices, the two equinoxes and four cross-quarter days, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar. While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Columbia {{scientists}} have been credited with about 175 new inventions in the health sciences each year. More than 30 pharmaceutical products based on discoveries and inventions made at Columbia are on the market today. These include Remicade (for arthritis), Reopro (for blood clot complications), Xalatan (for glaucoma), Benefix, Latanoprost (a glaucoma treatment), shoulder prosthesis, homocysteine (testing for cardiovascular disease), and Zolinza (for cancer therapy). Columbia Technology Ventures (formerly Science and Technology Ventures), , manages some 600 patents and more than 250 active license agreements. Patent-related deals earned Columbia more than $230million in the 2006 fiscal year, according to the university, more than any university in the world. Columbia owns many unique research facilities, such as the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information dedicated to telecommunications and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> observatory affiliated with NASA.|$|E
5|$|German ethnologist Thomas Barthel, {{who first}} {{published}} the rongorongo corpus, identified three {{lines on the}} recto (side a) of tablet C, also known as Mamari, as a lunar calendar. Guy proposed {{that it was more}} precisely <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> rule for whether one or two intercalary nights should be inserted into the 28-night Rapanui month to keep it in sync with the phases of the moon, and if one night, whether this should come before or after the full moon. Berthin and Berthin propose that it is the text which follows the identified calendar which shows where the intercalary nights should appear. The Mamari calendar is the only example of rongorongo whose function is currently accepted as being understood, though it cannot actually be read.|$|E
5|$|In 1614, German {{astronomer}} Johannes Kepler {{determined that}} {{a series of three}} conjunctions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn occurred in the year 7 BC. He argued (incorrectly) that a planetary conjunction could create a nova, which he linked to the Star of Bethlehem. Modern calculations show that there was a gap of nearly a degree (approximately twice a diameter of the moon) between the planets, so these conjunctions were not visually impressive. An ancient almanac has been found in Babylon which covers the events of this period, but does not indicate that the conjunctions were of any special interest. In the 20th century, Prof. Karlis Kaufmanis, an astronomer, argued that this was <b>an</b> <b>astronomical</b> event where Jupiter and Saturn were in a triple conjunction in the constellation Pisces. Archaeologist and Assyriologist Simo Parpola has also suggested this explanation.|$|E
