50|$|<b>A</b> closed pond <b>loop</b> is {{not common}} because {{it depends on}} {{proximity}} to a body of water, where <b>an</b> open <b>loop</b> system is usually preferable. <b>A</b> pond <b>loop</b> may be advantageous where poor water quality precludes <b>an</b> open <b>loop,</b> or where the system heat load is small. <b>A</b> pond <b>loop</b> consists of coils of pipe similar to <b>a</b> slinky <b>loop</b> attached to <b>a</b> frame and located {{at the bottom of}} an appropriately sized pond or water source.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the Swiss company Klarer Freizeitanlagen AG begun {{working on}} a safe design for <b>a</b> <b>looping</b> water slide.

This ride does not feature <b>a</b> vertical <b>loop,</b> instead using <b>an</b> inclined <b>loop,</b> basically <b>a</b> vertical <b>loop</b> tilted at <b>an</b> angle, which puts less force on the rider.|$|R

5|$|August 30, 1999– Hurricane Dennis {{parallels}} the state offshore, and {{five days later}} it executes <b>a</b> <b>loop</b> and makes landfall along Cape Lookout National Seashore as a strong tropical storm. The hurricane drops heavy rainfall peaking at 19.9inches (506mm) in Ocracoke, while its extended duration offshore causes localized severe beach erosion. The rainfall causes flooding along several rivers, which {{is compounded by the}} effects of Hurricane Floyd just weeks later. Damage in the state amounts to over $50million.|$|E
