25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>things</b> in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{sequence}} of [...] "Jame Raho" [...] establishes {{the characters of}} the four members of Ishaan's family; for example, the father is hardworking and responsible, and Yohaan is an [...] "ideal son" [...] who does <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>things.</b> A robotic style of music overlaps most of the sequence—this is mirrored by the machine-like morning routines of the mother, father, and Yohaan—but changes for Ishaan's portion to imply that he {{is different from the}} rest. This concept is furthered by speed ramping and having the camera sway with the music to create a distinct style. The twilight scenes of [...] "Maa" [...] were a particular issue for the production crew. Because the specific lighting only lasted ten to fifteen minutes a day, the scenes took nearly ten evenings to film. Production at one time considered having a child singing, but ultimately deemed it too over the top and felt it would connect to more people if sung by an adult. Shankar initially performed the song as a sample—they planned to replace him with another singer—but production eventually decided that his rendition was best.|$|E

40|$|In an {{era where}} {{ubiquitous}} systems will be mainstream, users will take a more passive role and these systems {{will have to make}} smart decisions on behalf of their users. Automating these decisions in a continuously evolving dynamic context can be challenging. First of <b>all,</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do usually depends on the circumstances and context at hand. What might be a good decision today, could be a bad one tomorrow. Secondly, the system should be made aware of the impact of its decisions over time so that it can learn from its mistakes as humans do. In this paper, we formulate a technique for decision support systems to mitigate runtime uncertainty in the observed context, and demonstrate our context-driven probabilistic framework for ubiquitous systems that addresses the above mentioned challenges. Our framework incorporates end-to-end Quality of Context (QoC) as a key ingredient to make well-informed decisions. It leverages Dynamic Decision Networks (DDN) to deal with the presence of uncertainty and the partial observability of context information, as well as the temporal effects of the decisions. Our experiments with the framework demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and potential benefits to automatically make the best decision {{in the presence of a}} changing environment. status: publishe...|$|R

In public relations, there is a budget for the activities considering public benefits instead of advertisement expenses, it is targeted to be news by activities having the potential positive news value instead of purchasing advertising time or space from media. The one of activities of Public relations which helps to organizations for executing their social responsibilities is sponsorship operations.

Gamble's operation, The Center for Endangered Cats (CEC), was located in Duxbury, Minnesota, only a few miles from TWS. The business side of CEC—providing trained wild animals for movies, TV, and public appearances—was on the decline after Gamble and her business partner, Craig Wagner, split in 2004; Gamble filed for bankruptcy shortly afterward. Rumors were circulating in the area that her collection of exotic cats were near starvation—including three Bengal tigers, the largest of which was a male named Tango that was later determined to be over 100 lb underweight—and Gamble had been forced to seek out roadkill to feed her cats. When Thies learned that Gamble had been mauled and partially eaten by Tango (who had to be put down due to his extreme aggression), she offered to take in Gamble's remaining two tigers, and discovered that both of them were near starvation as well, with damaged and rotting teeth due to poor quality food and general malnutrition, along with high human aggression levels due to their state of starvation. Thies was able to return both cats to health, and both of their demeanors improved as well. Thies later learned that just weeks before her death, Gamble had reportedly told a friend that she was seriously considering contacting TWS and asking them to take all of her cats.
