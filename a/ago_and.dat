40|$|RNA {{interference}} occurs by {{two main}} processes: mRNA site-specific cleavage and non-cleavage-based mRNA degradation or translational repression.

It has been observed that in mammalian tissues, expression of <b>Ago</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Ago</b> 4 is dramatically lower compared with Ago 1; however, an optimization of the <b>Ago</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Ago</b> 4 coding sequences to include only the most common codon at each amino acid position was able to augment the expression of <b>Ago</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Ago</b> 4 to levels {{comparable to that of}} <b>Ago</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Ago</b> 2.

Depletion of AGO 1, the essential factor for miRNA biogenesis, led to an increased transcriptional rate of the transgenes.

40|$|Argonaute (Ago) protein, {{the central}} {{component}} of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, plays important roles in host innate antiviral immunity. Most organisms harbor {{a large number of}} different <b>Ago</b> proteins <b>and</b> isoforms; however, the roles of Ago isoforms in immune defense against pathogens remain unclear. In the present study, three Argonaute- 1 (Ago 1) isoforms, termed Ago 1 A, <b>Ago</b> 1 B, <b>and</b> <b>Ago</b> 1 C, were found in Marsupenaeus japonicus shrimp. Quantitative real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) revealed that isoforms <b>Ago</b> 1 A <b>and</b> <b>Ago</b> 1 B containing an insertion sequence in the PIWI domain, were significantly up-regulated in lymphoid organ and hemolymph, and also upon white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge, indicating the involvement of <b>Ago</b> 1 A <b>and</b> <b>Ago</b> 1 B in antiviral immunity. The results showed that silencing of Ago 1 A with a sequence-specific siRNA led to a significant increase of WSSV loads. It was revealed that knockdown of Ago 1 B mRNA by 37 – 70 % resulted in higher virus loads in shrimp. However, upon silencing Ago 1 B by more than 85 %, a two-fold increase in Ago 1 A mRNA was observed but viral load was the same as untreated controls challenged with WSSV, suggesting that the simultaneous up-regulation of Ago 1 A might compensate for the loss of Ago 1 B. These data indicated that Ago 1 A played more important roles in the antiviral immune response than Ago 1 B. The simultaneous inhibition of <b>Ago</b> 1 A <b>and</b> <b>Ago</b> 1 B resulted in a greater increase in viral loads than Ago 1 A or Ago 1 B alone, indicating that <b>Ago</b> 1 A <b>and</b> <b>Ago</b> 1 B isoforms were involved in shrimp antiviral immunity.

40|$|Genetic {{studies of}} Drosophila melanogaster have {{provided}} a paradigm for RNA interference (RNAi) in arthropods, in which the microRNA and antiviral pathways are each mediated by a single Argonaute (<b>Ago</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Ago</b> 2) <b>and</b> germline suppression of transposable elements is mediated by a trio of Piwi-subfamily Argonaute proteins (<b>Ago</b> 3, Aub, <b>and</b> Piwi). Without a suitable evolutionary context, deviations from this {{can be interpreted as}} derived or idiosyncratic. Here we analyze the evolution of Argonaute genes across the genomes and transcriptomes of 86 Dipteran species, showing that variation in copy number can occur rapidly, and that there is constant flux in some RNAi mechanisms. The lability of the RNAi pathways is illustrated by the divergence of Aub and Piwi (182 - 156 Ma), independent origins of multiple Piwi-family genes in Aedes mosquitoes (less than 25 Ma), and the recent duplications of <b>Ago</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>Ago</b> 3 in the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans. In each case the tissue specificity of these genes has altered, suggesting functional divergence or innovation, and consistent with the action of dynamic selection pressures across the Argonaute gene family. We find there are large differences in evolutionary rates and gene turnover between pathways, and that paralogs of Ago 2, <b>Ago</b> 3, <b>and</b> Piwi/Aub show contrasting rates of evolution after duplication.
