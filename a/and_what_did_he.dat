2500|$|Senator Obama's {{speech on}} Tuesday was a {{brilliant}} effort to deflect attention away from what remains the core issue: what did Obama hear, when did he hear it, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> do about it? The answers, {{as best we can}} tell at this stage, is that Obama heard some very harsh things said from the pulpit of Trinity United Church of Christ; that Obama heard them said {{a long time ago and}} probably repeatedly; and that he did little or nothing about it. This from a man who tells us at almost every stop along the campaign trail that he has the [...] "judgment to lead." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "When did Orpin {{speak to}} him, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> say?" [...] asked Considine, whose own ideas as to Christianity were {{by no means}} fixed or clear.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was right. That {{was very}} right. I'm so glad of that. But who would doubt {{that you would}} show a proper spirit? <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{what did}} he fight with there [...] But sidelong and {{spitting}} and helpless shadows of the dim air? [...] <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> carry away but straw and broken delf? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I do mean it," [...] {{reiterated the}} trader. [...] "Would you believe it, {{there was one}} whaler put in here, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> but go and invite a lot o' free blacks aboard to have a blow-out; and no sooner <b>did</b> <b>he</b> get them down into the hold then he shut down the hatches, sailed away, and sold 'em every one." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the mention}} of hay, Peter Rabbit sat bolt upright {{and his eyes were}} wide open with astonishment. [...] "Did you say hay?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Where under the sun <b>does</b> <b>he</b> get hay way up there, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> want of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is enough, my dear brother, {{that you}} say we should,' {{returned}} the other. 'When you say that, no further inquiries are needed. He SHALL be assisted. What are his necessities, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> require? Where is Tim Linkinwater? Let us have him here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} you before why I am here," [...] I answered. [...] "I will not be put off any longer. Who was that man, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> want with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said Elizabeth, {{her eyes}} beaming with pleasure; 'I {{am sure that}} was very kind of you. And how did he look, poor little fellow, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> say, and was not he delighted to see you?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> live on? Water-cresses, perhaps; {{or perhaps}} water- gruel, and water-milk; too many land-babies do so likewise. But {{we do not}} know what one-tenth of the water-things eat; so we are not {{answerable}} for the water-babies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Trash! But {{the word}} from him in such a letter is simply an {{additional}} insult. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> know about this woman who has come back? He vouches for her, but what can he know of her? Just what she tells him. He is simply a fool." ...|$|R

6000|$|Queer are {{the ways}} of a man I know: [...] He comes and stands [...] In a careworn craze, [...] And looks at the sands [...] And the seaward haze, [...] With moveless hands [...] And face and gaze, [...] Then turns to go [...] . <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> see when he gazes so? ...|$|R
60|$|And he {{came and}} made himself at home in her little home. When he was there, moving in his own quiet way, {{she felt as if}} the whole great law of sacrifice, by which she had elected to live, were annulled. He annulled by his very {{presence}} the laws of her life. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> substitute? Ah, against that question she hardened herself in recoil.|$|E
60|$|This {{time it was}} by a {{voice from}} below--a voice calling him--Slinn's voice. How had the {{crippled}} man got here so soon, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> want? He hurriedly laid aside the pick, which, in his first impulse, he had taken {{to the door of}} the loft with him, and descended the stairs. The old man was standing at the door of his office awaiting him.|$|E
6000|$|I wore a fur great-coat at that time, {{and before}} we were well clear of the wharf, he {{questioned}} me concerning it, and its price, and where I bought it, and when, and what fur it was, and what it weighed, and what it cost. Then he took notice of my watch, and asked me what THAT cost, and {{whether it was a}} French watch, and where I got it, and how I got it, and whether I bought it or had it given me, and how it went, and where the key-hole was, and when I wound it, every night or every morning, and whether I ever forgot to wind it at all, and if I did, what then? Where had I been to last, and where was I going next, and where was I going after that, and had I seen the President, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> say, and what did I say, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> say when I had said that? Eh? Lor now! do tell! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well,--no,--you didn't; {{but they}} <b>do,</b> you know. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> a country gentleman know, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> <b>What's</b> {{the country the}} better of him? He 'unts, and he shoots, and he goes to bed with his skin full of wine, and then {{he gets up and}} he 'unts and he shoots again, and 'as his skin full once more. That's about all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, despised," [...] nodded Killian, {{filling a}} long pipe, [...] "and, to {{my way of}} thinking, justly despised. Here {{is a man with}} great opportunities, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> with them? <b>He</b> hunts, and he dresses very prettily--which is a thing to be ashamed of in a man--and he acts plays; and if <b>he</b> <b>does</b> aught else, the news of it has not come here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen to this," [...] I went on, {{reading from}} Benjamin's notes. [...] "What did Dexter mean when he said, 'Number Nine, Caldershaws. Ask for Dandie. You shan't have the Diary. A secret in your ear. The Diary will hang him?' How came Dexter {{to know what}} was in my husband's Diary? <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> mean by 'Number Nine, Caldershaws,' and the rest of it? Facts again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But the Devil {{has reached}} our cliffs so white, [...] <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> there, I pray? [...] If {{his eyes were}} good, he but saw by night [...] What we see every day; [...] But he made a tour and kept a journal [...] Of all the wondrous sights nocturnal, [...] And he sold it in shares to the Men of the Row, [...] Who bid pretty well--but they cheated him, though! [...] 90 ...|$|E
60|$|Another thing puzzled Marston. Don Felix {{had known}} the negroes and had, moreover, negro blood in his veins, but the trade had not {{extended}} until he was dead. It was strange the efforts of a white man and a stranger had led to the sudden extension. Harry had obviously qualities and knowledge that had not marked the other. But what were the qualities, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> know? Although Marston sometimes brooded over this, he saw no light.|$|E
6000|$|To go {{back now}} to Bill. He {{was out in the}} garden one day, and he took a look at the well, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> see but the water at the top was blood, and what was {{underneath}} was honey. So he went into the house again, and he said to his mother, [...] "I will never eat a second meal at the same table, or sleep a second night in the same bed, till I know what is happening to Jack." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It isn't {{much use}} {{fighting}} against nature, I guess," [...] she thought grimly. [...] "I'm beat. He {{must have thought}} something of her, after all, when he sent her that teapot <b>and</b> letter. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> mean about the 'day they had such a good time'? Well, it just means that she's been to see him before, sometime, I suppose, and kept me in ignorance of it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no. But {{everybody}} else was noticing you; and it was odd he didn't. There, 'tis like him. Rich <b>and</b> gentlemanly, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> care?" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} my whole {{acquaintance}} with him passed like lightning through my mind, till I asked myself {{why he had}} come here, to London, to do this thing?--why would not Liverpool have answered? <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> want of me? But, every way, his conduct was unaccountable. From the hour he had accosted me on board the ship, his manner seemed gradually changed; and from the moment we had sprung into the cab, he had seemed almost another person from what he had seemed before.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does he mean}} by that? <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> mean {{afterward}} when he overtook old Bashwood in the drive, {{by telling}} him to gratify his curiosity? Does this hateful Pedgift actually suppose there is any chance--? Ridiculous! Why, I have only {{to look at the}} feeble old creature, and he daren't lift his little finger unless I tell him. He try to pry into my past life, indeed! Why, people with ten times his brains, and a hundred times his courage, have tried--and have left off as wise as they began.|$|E
6000|$|... "The gin-block {{missed his}} head by an inch," [...] {{went on the}} mate impressively. [...] "I wasn't three feet from him. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> do? Did he shout, or jump, or even look aloft {{to see if the}} yard wasn't coming down too about our ears in a dozen pieces? It's a marvel it didn't. No, he just stopped short--no wonder; he must have felt the wind of that iron gin-block on his face--looked down at it, there, lying close to his foot--and went on again. I believe he didn't even blink. It isn't natural. The man is stupefied." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 2GB {{current affairs}} {{director}} Jason Morrison said [...] "for him every news bulletin was opening night. He {{was the most}} unlikely star at the station. He never really understood {{how many people were}} aware of who <b>he</b> was <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> <b>He</b> set the standard of the way news was presented." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Worse than that," [...] said Bryce. [...] "You see, I'd made {{a bargain}} {{with him to}} buy the horse for a hundred and twenty--a {{swinging}} price, but I always liked the horse. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> but go and stake him--fly at a hedge with stakes in it, atop of a bank with a ditch before it. The horse had been dead a pretty good while when he was found. So he hasn't been home since, has he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{had made}} up his mind. Curiosity is the great motive power of hatred <b>and</b> love. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> expect to find? He could not have told anybody--not even himself.|$|R
