5|$|After Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers won {{the award}} seven times within eight years, Lady Byng was so {{impressed}} that {{she gave him the}} original trophy to keep. Lady Byng then donated a second trophy in 1935–36. When Lady Byng died in 1949, the NHL presented another trophy <b>and</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> official name to the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. In 1962, the original trophy was destroyed in a fire at Boucher's home.|$|E

5|$|After a {{new term}} of {{negotiations}} between the parties, IUPAC decided to allow the name seaborgium for element 106 <b>and</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> name of element 102 to flerovium after Georgy Flerov following the recognition by the 1993 report that the element had been first convincingly synthesized in Dubna. However, this compromise was also rejected by the American scientists and the decision was retracted. The name flerovium was later used for element 114.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{voted in}} the United Nations condemning the human rights {{violations}} in Cuba, but refused to send military forces to Afghanistan and Iraq. Still, Duhalde proposed to send peacekeeping troops, and strongly criticized the regime of Saddam Hussein and international terrorism. Duhalde increased his criticism of the United States during {{the final years of}} his government, <b>and</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> vote in relation to Cuba to an abstention. Those changes were motivated by the upcoming 2003 elections. Menem, who was running for a third term as president, supported the vote condemning Cuba and the military aid to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Empress was {{the largest}} chili parlor chain in Cincinnati until 1949, when a former Empress {{employee}} and Greek immigrant, Nicholas Lambrinides, started Skyline Chili. In 1965, four brothers named Daoud, immigrants from Jordan, bought a restaurant called Hamburger Heaven from a former Empress employee, noticed the Cincinnati chili was outselling the hamburgers on their menu, <b>and</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> restaurant's name to Gold Star Chili. As of 2015 Skyline (over 130 locations) and Gold Star (89 locations) were the largest Cincinnati chili parlor chains, while Empress had only two remaining locations, down from over a dozen during the chain's most successful period.|$|E

5|$|Geology is {{the science}} and study of the solid and liquid matter that {{constitutes}} the Earth.

Market research showed that women did not want girdles advertised on television—girdles were seen as armor against sex, while bras provided a means of attraction.|$|E

The promo-CD caught {{the interest of}} British Cacophonous Records, {{one of the biggest}} labels with experience in the black metal style and helped established groups such as Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir start their career. Cacophonous signed a record deal for 2 albums with Antestor. In 1998, Cacophonous released Kongsblod under a different name, The Return of the Black Death, <b>and</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> original cover art of a famous Norwegian painting to artwork by Joe Petagno, a well-known American heavy metal cover art creator.|$|E
5|$|Maibaum kept {{on making}} rewrites as filming progressed. Red Grant {{was added to}} the Istanbul scenes just prior to the film crew's trip to Turkey—a change that brought more focus to the SPECTRE plot, as Grant started saving Bond's life there (a late change during {{shooting}} involved Grant killing the bespectacled spy at Hagia Sophia instead of Bond, who ends up just finding the man dead). For {{the last quarter of the}} movie, Maibaum added two chase scenes, with a helicopter and speedboats, <b>and</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> location of Bond and Klebb's battle from Paris to Venice.|$|E
5|$|Most Armenian {{geographical}} names {{were in the}} eastern provinces of the Ottoman empire. Villages, settlements, or towns that contain the suffix -kert, meaning built or built by (i.e. Manavazkert (today Malazgirt), Norakert, Dikranagert, Noyakert), -shen, meaning village (i.e. Aratashen, Pemzashen, Norashen), and -van, meaning town (i.e. Charentsavan, Nakhichevan, Tatvan), signify an Armenian name. Throughout Ottoman history, Turkish and Kurdish tribesmen have settled into Armenian villages <b>and</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> native Armenian names (i.e. the Armenian Norashen was changed to Norşin). This was especially true after the Armenian genocide, when much of eastern Turkey was depopulated of its Armenian population.|$|E

5|$|New classicals {{broke with}} Keynesian {{economic}} theory completely while monetarists had built on Keynesian ideas. Despite discarding Keynesian theory, new classical economists did share the Keynesian focus on explaining short-run fluctuations. New classicals replaced monetarists {{as the primary}} opponents to Keynesianism <b>and</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> primary debate in macroeconomics from whether to look at short-run fluctuations to whether macroeconomic models should be grounded in microeconomic theories. Like monetarism, new classical economics was rooted at the University of Chicago, principally with Robert Lucas.

Three days later, Rousseau {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Alexandra. One week after Alex's birth, Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) came and took Alex from Rousseau. Ben told Rousseau that the child would be safe with them, and that she was lucky for being left alive. Before leaving, Ben tells her that if she hears whispers, she should run the other way. After this, Rousseau began setting traps in the jungle with the hope of catching one of the people responsible for Alex's kidnapping.|$|E
5|$|Since 1908, the club's home colours {{have been}} blue and white, {{leading to a}} {{nickname}} of The Bluebirds, {{with the exception of}} a period between 2012 and 2015 when the club's owner, Vincent Tan, rebranded the club <b>and</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> home colours to red. They reverted to their traditional blue in January 2015. Cardiff play their home games at the Cardiff City Stadium, after moving from Ninian Park in 2009, and have long-standing rivalries with nearby clubs Swansea City, known as the South Wales derby, and Bristol City, known as the Severnside derby.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, <b>and</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> subject.|$|E
5|$|The Seventeenth Amendment {{altered the}} process for electing United States Senators <b>and</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> way {{vacancies}} would be filled. Under the original constitutional provision, state legislatures filled vacancies when a Senator left office {{before the end of}} the term; the Seventeenth Amendment provides that state legislatures can grant governors the right to make temporary appointments, which last until a special election is provided to fill the seat. The power to call such an election can also be granted to the governor. It also had an immediate and dramatic impact on the political composition of the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} situation deteriorated further as Radić {{was assassinated in}} the National Assembly in 1928, leading to the dictatorship of King Alexander in January 1929. The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitarian constitution, <b>and</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> name {{of the country to}} Yugoslavia. The HSS, now led by Vladko Maček, continued to advocate federalisation of Yugoslavia, resulting in the Cvetković–Maček Agreement of August 1939 and the autonomous Banovina of Croatia. The Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed Ban.|$|E
