40|$|When a small {{positively}} biased electrode is {{immersed in}} plasma {{it leads to}} intense ionization around the small electrode and are {{sometimes referred to as}} fireballs. The intense ionization leads to higher plasma density in the bulk plasma at lower operating pressures. The fireballs are unstable and they expand and collapse at a frequency which is related to the variation in the sheath electric field adjacent to the anode. In this paper we present the properties of the fireball plasma of a DC anomalous glow discharge consisting of multiple parallel plate cathodes and a small anode. The region around the <b>anode</b> <b>glow</b> shows a steep rise in density and the electron temperature. The glow around the constricted anode fluctuates at frequency range of 250 400 KHz. The oscillations are attributed due to the instability of the <b>anode</b> <b>glow</b> and are found to be dependent on the applied power, pressure and the separation between the cathode plates. The reason for the observed non-linear behaviour of the discharge current is attributed to the ionization mechanism at the anode sheath. 1...|$|E

40|$|Oxygen can be {{extracted}} from carbon dioxide via thermal dissociation at elevated temperatures. However, temperatures {{in excess of}} 1000 K are needed to effect significant levels of dissociation. The experiments reported here have examined the feasibility of using a glow-discharge in low-pressure carbon dioxide to produce increased atomic oxygen yields at lower temperatures (on the order of 800 K). The experiments have shown that when silver membranes are used simultaneously as <b>anodes</b> for the <b>glow</b> discharge and as permeable membranes for oxygen separation, oxygen yields which are comparable to the permeation rates for pure oxygen, can be produced. Since the silver membrane can be employed as the electrode interface between Mars atmosphere and a stabilized-zirconia electrochemical pump, glow-discharge enhancement {{can be considered as}} a complementary technology which can be used with the zirconia-based oxygen extraction systems described previously by others. Not only can glow-discharge be used to increase oxygen yields at lowered temperatures, {{but it can also be}} considered as a possible way to avoid filtration and compression of Mars atmosphere, since the glow-discharge can be sustained in Mars ambient pressures...|$|R

40|$|Collective {{motion of}} ions in one {{dimensional}} system {{described by the}} velocity-coordinate phase space is simulated by the convective scheme, combining the kinetic equation with the Poisson equation. The system has an asymmetric concave electric potential, i. e. <b>anode</b> <b>glow</b> mode, in a stationary state, and in which ion current leaks through cathode. Also, spatially uniform ion source is added to maintain the potential. Equidistant spectral lines with respect to harmonics of fundamental mode of ion acoustic wave are observed and they have two local peaks at low and high frequency components. If dissipation is introduced, the lowest frequency mode becomes dominant. From theoretical analysis examined by the dispersion relation derived from a characteristic equation, the instability {{is found to be}} caused by asymmetry of the system such as flow velocity and sheath width.

40|$|Plasma is {{a complex}} medium in which chaotic states were often observed. In most of the cases, these chaotic states appear in plasma {{as a result of}} intermittency {{scenario}} [1] or Feigenbaum scenario (cascade of period doubling bifurcations) [2] of transition to chaos. Here we report on experimental results that emphasize a more complex route to chaos in plasma, in which a Feigenbaum scenario develops simultaneously with a cascade of spatial period-doubling bifurcation, in connection with the development of a multiple double layer structure in chaotic dynamic state. Because the temporal and spatial period-doubling bifurcations simultaneously appear, we can speak about a new scenario of transition to chaos by a cascade of spatio-temporal period-doubling bifurcations route to chaos. Multiple double layers are complex nonlinear potential structures in plasma consisting of two or more concentric double layers attached to the <b>anode</b> of a <b>glow</b> discharge [3], or to a positively biased electrode immersed in plasma [4]. The axial profile of the plasma potential has a stair step shape, with potential jumps close to the ionization potential of the used gas.

The experiments {{were carried out}} {{under the influence of}} pressure and filament cathode current on voltage – current characteristics of glow discharge and its breakdown voltage. Plasma parameters have been measured and obtained using single probe method at fixed discharge current (Id= 1. 88 mA) and hollow anode diameter. A computer MATLAB program is performed for this purpose. It was shown that the discharge voltage – current characteristics curve has a positive resistance and represents an abnormal glow region at pressure (0. 04 and 0. 06) mbar for different filament current. The breakdown voltage increases as the filament current is increased. In different pressure, electron temperature shows different behavior with increasing filament current. Electron density varies nearly inversely with the filament current, but it is increase due to increase of pressure from (1 to 3 mbar), then tends to decrease for the higher pressure.

From the ridge plots, we have identified the presence of nonlinearity and degree of chaoticity. Using the {{wavelet transform}} modulus maxima technique we have obtained the multi-fractal spectrum for the fluctuations at different discharge voltages and the spectrum was observed to become a monofractal for periodic signals.

40|$|A direct-current-driven {{plasma jet}} is {{developed}} by applying a {{longitudinal electric field}} on the flowing argon at ambient air. This plasma shows a torch shape with its cross-section increased from the anode to the cathode. Comparison with its counterparts indicates that the gas flow {{plays a key role}} in variation of the plasma structure and contributes much to enlarging the plasma volume. It is also found that the circular hollow metal base promotes generation of plasma with a high-power volume density in a limited space. The optical emission spectroscopy (OES) diagnosis indicates that the plasma comprises many reactive species, such as OH, O, excited N- 2, and Ar metastables. Examination of the rotational and vibrational temperature indicates that the plasma is under nonequilibrium condition and the excited species OH(A (2) Sigma(+)), O(P- 5), and N- 2 (C (3) Pi(u)) are partly generated by energy transfer from argon metastables. The spatially resolved OES of plasma reveals that the negative glow, Faraday dark space, and positive column are distributed across the gas gap. The absence of the <b>anode</b> <b>glow</b> is attributed to the fact that many electrons in the vicinity of the anode follow ions into the positive column due to the ambipolar diffusion in the flowing gas...|$|E
40|$|Equilibrium {{states of}} anodic double layers that form near a {{positively}} biased disk-shaped electrode {{immersed in a}} partially ionized plasma are studied experimentally using electrostatic probes. When the potential drop from the electrode to the plasma {{is less than a}} critical value, φc, an <b>anode</b> <b>glow</b> is observed where a double layer potential drop is within a few millimeters of the electrode surface. For larger biases an anode spot forms where the double layer potential drop is centimeters from the electrode and the intervening region is a plasma more luminous than the bulk plasma. A theoretical model is developed which predicts that φc ∝ 1 /P + C, where P is the neutral pressure and C is a constant, and it predicts hysteresis in the current–voltage characteristic at the electrode; both effects are observed experimentally. The model also provides an estimate for the distance between the electrode and double layer potential drop that agrees with the measurements. Near small electrodes, anode spots are observed to be ‘fireballs, ’ which are spherical in shape. Near larger electrodes ‘firerods ’ are found instead, which have a cylindrical shape. It is shown that firerods are required by global current balance because they have a smaller effective electron collecting area than fireballs. Experiments also confirm that global nonambipolar flow (Baalrud S D et al 2007 Phys. Plasmas 14 042109) accompanies firerods. In this case all electrons are lost through the firerod to the electrode, while all positive ions are lost to the other plasma boundaries.

40|$|The plasma {{generated}} {{around the}} <b>anode</b> during contact <b>glow</b> discharge electrolysis (CGDE) {{is a rich}} source of hydroxyl (OH) radicals that can efficiently degrade organic contaminants in aqueous solutions. The degradation of textile azo dyestuffs, Reactive Yellow 176 (Y 3 RS), Reactive Red 239 (R 3 BS) and Reactive Black 5 (B 5), by anodic CGDE was investigated in the presence of chloride (Cl−) ions. The degradation kinetics of the dyes was dependent on the concentration of Cl− ions and on the respective dye being treated. R 3 BS degradation was inhibited by Cl− ions in the range of 0 – 0. 01 M. When the Cl− ion concentration was less than 0. 02 M, the dyes followed pseudo first-order degradation kinetics. For concentrations greater than 0. 02 M, the degradation of Y 3 RS and B 5 was significantly enhanced compared to the degradation of R 3 BS and deviated from first-order reaction kinetics. The presence of Cl− ions (0. 03 M) did not appear to improve dye mineralization but resulted in the formation of adsorbable organic halogens (AOX). The results indicated that the AOX could be abated with prolonged electrolytic treatment.

40|$|Interplay of {{transition}} of floating potential fluctuations in a glow discharge plasma in the toroidal vacuum vessel of SINP tokamak has been observed. With {{variation in the}} strength of the vertical and toroidal magnetic fields, regular and inverted relaxation oscillations as well as sinusoidal oscillations are observed with the slow and fast time scale of the relaxation oscillations reversing their nature at a high value of vertical magnetic field strength. However for small value of toroidal magnetic field the transitions follow relaxation → chaotic oscillations with the chaotic nature prevailing at higher values of toroidal magnetic field. Evolution of associated anode fireball dynamics under the action of increasing vertical, toroidal as well as increasing vertical field at a fixed toroidal field (mixed field) of different strength has been studied. Estimation of phase coherence index for each case has been carried out to examine the evidence of finite nonlinear interaction. A comprehensive study of the dynamics of the fireball is found {{to be associated with the}} values of phase coherence index. The index is found to take maximum values for the case of toroidal, mixed field when there is an existence of power/energy concentration in a large region of frequency band. A detailed study of the scaling region using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) by estimating the scaling exponent has been carried out for increasing values of discharge voltage, vertical, toroidal as well as the mixed field (toroidal plus vertical). A persistence long range behaviour associated with the nature of the <b>anode</b> <b>glow</b> has been investigated in case of higher values of toroidal, mixed field whereas increasing DV, vertical magnetic field leads to a perfectly correlated dynamics with values of scaling exponent greater than unityComment: 19 pages, 17 figures and 1 tabl...|$|E

Dust is initially on a tray beneath the anode, and becomes trapped in the <b>anode</b> <b>glow</b> naturally with high discharge current. A secondary cloud can be made at a different location using a biased mesh. I make experimental observations {{of the dynamics of}} the secondary cloud as well as the unique interaction of the dust with a wire loop near the anode. First, I describe the interaction of the secondary cloud with a wire when it the cloud is released to flow back to the primary cloud. A detached bow shock is observed as the cloud encounters an obstacle, and an elongated teardrop shaped void is formed downstream of the obstacle. Second, a continuous flow is set up using at biased ring. The potentials of the ring and anode create a converging-diverging electrostatic potential structure which accelerates dust particles into a thin stream in the diverging section. The interaction of this stream and a wire obstacle is described. Finally, the potentials of the mesh and anode are suddenly switched to float simultaneously to observe the secondary cloud expansion in the afterglow plasma. The rate of expansion is shown to depend inversely on the background pressure in the range of 100 - 200 mTorr.
