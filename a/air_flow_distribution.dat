The conducted research is aimed at determining <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distribution</b> at two levels and channels of the multichannel cyclone. The multifunctional meter Testo- 400 and the dynamic Pitot tube have been used form easuring air flow rates in the channels. The obtained {{results show that the}} equal volume of air gets into two levels installed inside the cyclone, and rates are distributed equally in the channels of these levels. The maximum air flow rate is recorded in the first channel and occurs when half-rings are set in such positions so that 75 % of air flow returns to the previous channel. The biggest aerodynamic resistance is 1660 Pa and has been recorded in the cyclone having eight channels under <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distribution</b> ratio 75 / 25. The highest air purification efficiency has been observed in the two-level six-channel cyclone under <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distribution</b> ratio 75 / 25.

40|$|As more {{raw sugar}} {{factories}} {{become involved in}} the manufacture of by-products and cogeneration, bagasse is becoming an increasingly valuable commodity. However, in most factories, most of the bagasse produced is used to generate steam in relatively old and inefficient boilers. Efficient bagasse fired boilers are a high capital cost item and the cost of supplying the steam required to run a sugar factory by other means is prohibitive. For many factories a more realistic way to reduce bagasse consumption is to increase the efficiency of existing boilers. The Farleigh No. 3 boiler is a relatively old low efficiency boiler. Like many in the industry, the performance of this boiler has been adversely affected by uneven gas and <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distributions</b> and <b>air</b> heater leaks. The combustion performance and efficiency of this boiler have been significantly improved by making the gas and <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distributions</b> through the boiler more uniform and repairing the air heater.

Investigation of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distribution</b> is important to understand convective flow distribution and to control the flow to achieve its effective distribution for human comfort condition. The flow inside a building may be characterized by separation, reattachment, recirculation zone and circulation bubble.

40|$|Today, the {{prevention}} and treatment of voice disorders is an ever-increasing health concern. Since many occupations rely on verbal communication, vocal health is necessary just to maintain one’s livelihood. Commonly applied models to study vocal fold vibrations and <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distributions</b> are self sustained physical models of the larynx composed of artificial silicone vocal folds. Choosing appropriate mechanical parameters for these vocal fold models while considering simplifications due to manufacturing restrictions is difficult but crucial for achieving realistic behavior. In the present work, a combination of experimental and numerical approaches to compute material parameters for synthetic vocal fold models is presented. The material parameters are derived from deformation behaviors of excised human larynges. The resulting deformations are used as reference displacements for a tracking functional to be optimized. Material optimization was applied to three-dimensional vocal fold models based on isotropic and transverse-isotropic material laws, considering both a layered model with homogeneous material properties on each layer and an inhomogeneous model. The best results exhibited a transversal-isotropic inhomogeneous (i. e., not producible) model. For the homogeneous model (three layers), the transversal-isotropic material parameters were also computed for each layer yielding deformations similar to the measured human vocal fold deformations...|$|R
