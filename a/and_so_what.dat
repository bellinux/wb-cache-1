25|$|Few {{details of}} cricket matches in the 17th and early 18th centuries have survived <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>what</b> {{is known about}} Bedle's career has been pieced {{together}} by historical analysis as contemporary newspaper reports rarely mentioned a player by name. The reason for this lack of surviving data is that {{freedom of the press}} was not allowed in England until 1696, when Bedle was 16, and the infant newspaper industry gradually introduced coverage of sporting events, though for many years their emphasis was on betting rather than on the matches themselves. During Bedle's career, cricket reports were not only brief but few and far between.|$|E
25|$|It was at Southern, in {{the same}} year he joined the station, that Hargreaves made his screen debut with the series Gone Fishing – <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> had {{previously}} been a pastime became the focus of his wider reputation. He recounted how on his first broadcast, sitting in the studio, apprehensive at the thought of being about to talk live to a potential audience of millions, his director had reminded him that although that vast audience might be statistically daunting, it was more likely to be two or three people and perhaps a dog sitting in their front room. He aimed at conversing with such an audience {{for the rest of his}} career. The director of nearly all of Hargreaves' programmes at Southern Television was George Egan who, with cameraman Stan Bréhaut, became the third ingredient of a most creative outdoor team.|$|E

2500|$|When the Romantics emerged {{at the end}} of the 18th century, {{they were}} not {{assuming}} a radically new invention of the subjective self themselves, but merely formalizing what had gone before. [...] Similarly, the later 18th century saw a ballad revival, with Thomas Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry. The relics were not always very ancient, as many of the ballads dated from only the 17th century (e.g. the Bagford Ballads or The Dragon of Wantley in the Percy Folio), <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>what</b> began as an antiquarian movement soon became a folk movement. [...] When this folk-inspired impulse combined with the solitary and individualistic impulse of the Churchyard Poets, Romanticism was nearly inevitable.|$|E
2500|$|Perry {{stated that}} his foreign aid budget would start at $0 for all countries, {{including}} Israel. Bachmann and Santorum criticised him for suggesting that Pakistan should get no aid at all, with Santorum saying [...] "we can't be indecisive about whether Pakistan is our friend. They must be our friend, {{and we must}} engage them as friends". Bachmann drew raised eyebrows for her claim that China's economy was growing because of its lack of a social safety net, saying [...] "If you look at China, they don't have food stamps. They don't have the modern welfare state, and China's growing... <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>what</b> I would {{do is look at}} the programs that LBJ gave us with the Great Society and they'd be gone." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band's line-up had {{undergone}} a number of changes; however, the original three members had reunited. For a year, Erik [...] "Smelly" [...] Sandin left the band {{and was replaced by}} Scott Sellers, and later by Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident. [...] In 1986, the band released the extended play So What If We're on Mystic!. Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the extended play The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This, attacking the PMRC's campaign for music censorship. The original cover was an edited S&M photo; the cover for the re-released version was changed to a photo of Eric Melvin. Prior to the release of Liberal Animation, a compilation of 14 early NOFX songs was released on Mystic Records. The album was self-titled, and featured the songs from the NOFX <b>and</b> <b>So</b> <b>What</b> If We're on Mystic! extended plays. The album is quite rare and only printed around 1,000 copies. The price of the album ranges from $80–$300. The album's cover was a redesigned version of the cover from the NOFX extended play.|$|E

2500|$|In candid {{remarks to}} high-value donors at a {{secretly}} recorded May 2012 private fundraiser, Romney {{said of the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [...] "I look [...] at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political [...] purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel, and [...] these thorny issues, and I say, 'There's just no way.' <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>what</b> you do [...] is you say, 'You move things along the best way you can.' You hope for some degree [...] of stability, but you recognize {{that this is going}} to remain an unsolved [...] problem. We live with that in China and Taiwan. All right, we have a [...] potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick [...] the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something [...] will happen and resolve it." [...] He also noted that he had recently received a call from a former U.S. Secretary of State who had suggested that there might be a prospect for accord after the Palestinian elections. Romney made clear in his remarks at the fundraiser that he was opposed to the U.S. exerting any pressure on Israel to help reach a compromise: [...] "The idea of pushing on the Israelis to give something up to [...] get the Palestinians to act is the worst idea in the world." ...|$|E

She told the Guardian [...] "I walked into the newsroom {{and there was an}} eyewitness account making allegations [...] and analysis, if you can call it, from our correspondent in the studio.

[...] She also noted that [...] "There is bias against Russia but you don’t counter wrong by doing even more wrong" [...] and stated [...] "I have always said it's better to have RT than to not have that perspective, but actually with a story like this and the way they misreport it, it's quite dangerous, I don’t want to be party to it." [...] In follow-up interview she said [...] "In Ukraine, you’re taking a very small part of a much wider story, totally omitted the context of the story, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>what</b> you wind up with on air is outright misinformation."
