5|$|Insects {{are mostly}} soft bodied, fragile and almost defenseless {{compared}} to other, larger lifeforms. The immature stages are small, move slowly or are immobile, and so <b>all</b> <b>stages</b> {{are exposed to}} predation and parasitism. Insects then {{have a variety of}} defense strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids. These include camouflage, mimicry, toxicity and active defense.|$|E
5|$|Lepidopterans {{are soft}} bodied, fragile and almost defenseless while the {{immature}} stages move slowly or are immobile, hence <b>all</b> <b>stages</b> {{are exposed to}} predation by birds, small mammals, lizards, amphibians, invertebrate predators (notably parasitoid and parasitic wasps and flies) as well as fungi and bacteria. To combat this, Lepidoptera have developed a number of strategies for defense and protection which include camouflage, aposematism, mimicry, {{and the development of}} threat patterns and displays.|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the banks}} of the Mississippi River on the second Chickasaw Bluff, the {{topology}} of Randolph provided for an ideal harbor for steamboats and flatboats at <b>all</b> <b>stages</b> of the river. Randolph became the center of steamboat commerce in Tennessee and an important cotton shipping point in the 1830s.

5|$|Over 1000 specimens, {{representing}} organisms of <b>all</b> <b>stages</b> of maturity, {{have now}} {{been found in the}} White Sea area at the bottom of fine-grained sandstone layers.

5|$|P. rebeli pupae prey {{upon their}} broodmates, while {{producing}} sugar-rich secretions which worker ants imbibe. In one experiment, P. rebeli specimens which consumed ant larvae developed {{more quickly than}} those who did not. However, despite their nourishing offering to the community, they invariably imposed a net loss in the survival rates of workers and broodmates, demonstrating that the species is parasitic (rather than mutualistic) at <b>all</b> <b>stages</b> in its host colony.|$|E
5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders were awarded points for finishing {{in the top}} ten in a stage. Unlike in the points classification in the Tour de France, the winners of <b>all</b> <b>stages</b> were awarded {{the same number of}} points. Points were also won in intermediate sprints; three points for crossing the sprint line first, two points for second place, and one for third. The leader of the points classification was awarded a green jersey.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 10 in a stage. For <b>all</b> <b>stages,</b> the win earned 15points, second place earned 12points, third 10, fourth 8, fifth 6, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 10th. Points towards the classification could also be achieved {{at each of the}} intermediate sprints; these points were given to the top three riders through the line with 5points for first, 3 for second, and 1 point for third.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Weimar, but the composition history is complicated {{and not at}} <b>all</b> <b>stages</b> certain. Findings by Martin Petzoldt suggest that the cantata began with the later movements 2–6 and 9, most of them on biblical text, performed at a memorial service of Aemilia Maria Haress, {{the wife of a}} former prime-minister of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, at the church St. Peter und Paul in Weimar on 8 October 1713. Bach may then have expanded it and presented it for his application in December 1713 at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. The performance material of this event, the only surviving source, shows on the title page the designation , indicating that the cantata with its general readings and texts is suitable for any occasion.|$|E
5|$|First, the {{assigned}} herald develops a written description based on {{consultation with the}} petitioner. The petitioner then signs a contract with an artist at the authority to create the design. The Fraser Herald, serving as the CHA's principal artist, must review the design. At <b>all</b> <b>stages</b> the documents {{must be approved by}} both the petitioner and the Chief Herald. The final step is to prepare the letters patent, the official notice of an award of arms, which includes a drawing of the armorial bearings and the accompanying legal text and explanation of the symbolism of the bearings. Under Canadian bilingualism laws, letters patent are written in both English and French, though the petitioner may choose which language will be placed in the left column of the document.|$|E

5|$|On 1 February 1846 {{education}} became effectively compulsory {{till the}} age of 14. In 1847, elementary schooling was changed to the British model, schools were opened in every village and education was made free of charge. In 1878, the mode of language education delivery changed following the publication of two reports on the matter. Italian language education was replaced by instruction in the English language, {{and the use of}} Maltese was encouraged in the primary years. However, English was the language in which education was delivered at <b>all</b> <b>stages</b> of education following primary school. Debate continued until the 1930s over which language should be used in Maltese education - Italian or English.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Estuary {{has one of}} {{the highest}} tidal ranges in the world, up to , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range, and the {{underlying}} geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The tidal range means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide and the landing stage at the end of the pier has several levels to allow boats to dock at <b>all</b> <b>stages</b> of the tide.|$|E

The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was {{the vehicle for}} the incorporation {{of all of the}} foregoing rights (with the exception of the Grand Jury Clause, the Vicinage Clause, and maybe the Excessive Bail Clause) to apply in state criminal proceedings. Due process is also the catchall vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness, even if the infirmities of a given prosecution do not neatly sound in another enumerated provision.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at <b>all</b> <b>stages</b> of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the season finales, fights on The Ultimate Fighter are sanctioned by the Nevada Athletic Commission as exhibition matches and do not count for or against a fighter's professional record. This is done to keep the results from going public before the air date. However, going into the semi-final stage of each series, fights are scheduled for the full professional three rounds, as opposed to two rounds (with the possibility of a sudden victory round) for <b>all</b> <b>stages</b> prior. Though officially exhibition fights, the UFC chooses to record the results of semi-final matchups. For example, the seventh season winner Amir Sadollah has one more win on his UFC record than on his official record due to his victory in his season's semi-final round.|$|E
