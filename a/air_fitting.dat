6000|$|After the {{recognition}} of his power in 1786, the record of his preserved letters shews, for the ten years of his literary life, several fluctuations which admit of easy explanation. Commencing with 1787, the numbers are:--78, 92, 54, 33, 44, 31, 66, 30, 27, 24. The first of these years was totally severed from rural occupations, or business of any kind, if we except {{the publication of the}} first Edinburgh edition of his poems. It was a complete holiday year to him. He was either resident in Edinburgh, studying men and manners, or touring about the country, visiting those places which history, song, or scenery had made famous. Wherever he was, his fame brought him the acquaintance of a great many new people. His leisure and the novelty of his situation afforded him both opportunity and subject for an extensive correspondence. For {{a large part of the}} next year, 1788, he was similarly circumstanced, and the number of his letters was exceptionally increased by his entanglement with Mrs. M'Lehose. To her alone, in less than three months of this year, he wrote at least thirty-six letters,--considerably over one-third of the entire epistolary produce of the year. In 1789 we find the number of his letters fall to fifty-four. This was, perhaps, the happiest year of his life. He was now comfortably established as a farmer in a home of his own, busied with healthy rural work, and finding in the happy fireside clime which he was making for wife and weans [...] "the true pathos and sublime" [...] of human duty. He has still, however, time and inclination to write on the average one letter a week. For each of the next three years the average number is thirty-six.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a methodology {{for the development}} of a novel tool for rapid assessment of Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ) in office buildings in the UK. The tool uses design, measured, calculated and surveyed data as input for IEQ calculations. The development of such a tool has become a necessity especially in the developed world where legally binding targets for Green House Gas (GHG) emissions have been agreed and where buildings are required by law to display energy performance certification. The novelty of this tool is that it addresses the need to present an indoor environment performance rating that can be presented alongside energy performance certification since the energy performance of office buildings depends significantly on the criteria used for the indoor environment. The tool, called the IEQAT (Indoor Environment Quality Assessment Tool), is based on the IEQ model which was developed from literature review. The IEQ model is based on the IEQ index which was derived from contributing factors or sub indices that include Thermal Comfort, Indoor Air quality (IAQ), Acoustic Comfort and Lighting. The model was tested by studying the responses of occupants of three office buildings in the UK. Their subjective responses which were collected via a questionnaire were compared against model simulation results which were calculated using physical measurements of IEQ variables such as air temperature, illuminance (lux), background noise levels (dBA), relative humidity, carbon dioxide concentration (ppm), and <b>air</b> velocity. By <b>fitting</b> a multivariate regression model to questionnaire data, a weighted ranking of parameters affecting IEQ was produced and new provisional weightings for the IEQ model, which is more relevant to the UK situation, were derived.

This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} historic preservation and public memory of America???s Nike air defense missile program. To defend against nuclear attacks delivered by Soviet bombers in the 1950 s, 60 s, and 70 s the United States constructed a massive air defense network, the largest peacetime dispersion of America???s military might into its communities. The 275 Nike sites built in 29 states are one highly representative example of these defenses and constitute the world???s first missile base network, predating not only all other air defense missile networks but also all offensive nuclear missile bases. Despite its tremendous significance, historic preservation and public memory of America???s Nike air defense missile system is extremely limited. The dominance of deterrence, lack of trauma associated with Nike sites, and difficulty <b>fitting</b> <b>air</b> defense into traditional narratives of the Cold War provide a poor foundation for public memory. While the many extant Nike sites vi generally retain their integrity, or {{ability to communicate}} their historical significance, numerous pitfalls hamper Nike preservation efforts, even the five Nike sites listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Considered {{in the context of}} a complex, contradictory Cold War, Nike sites are the quintessential Cold War site. Additionally, Nike sites highlight the way public memory and preservation fuel and feed off of each other. Given the current state of historic preservation and public memory of Nike sites, a three-pronged strategy of interpretation, focused preservation, and a series of markers is the best way to commemorate and educate Americans about the importance once assigned to air defense against nuclear weapons: a menace that continues to threaten our world.

40|$|Albedo is {{of great}} {{importance}} in the surface energy balance. It affects surface skin temperature which in turn affects the atmospheric stratification and {{the temperature in the}} snow. For the snow, this affects the melting process and the snow mass balance. The snow metamorphosis may in turn affect the albedo to some degree and especially the timing of glacier surface exposure {{is of great}} importance. There is mainly a decrease in the albedo as the snow is aging after a snowfall. On longer time scale the summer melt increases the concentration of impurities and growth of algae further decreasing the albedo. In this report simulations with the atmospheric model WRF are presented and analysed. First, the sensitivity and effect on albedo of changing snow grain shape in a high-order snow scheme is investigated. Second, the effect on snow and <b>air</b> temperature of <b>fitting</b> the albedo in a lower-order snow scheme to observations is studied. The observations include in-situ measurements at three sites on Svalbard glaciers with different surface mass balance properties as well as remote sensing data from MODIS satellite observations. It is shown that different MODIS products give different albedos at the sites. The 1 -day albedo was an average closer to the in-situ observations except on Lomonosovfonna where the 16 -day albedo was closer. The effect of grain shape on albedo is small but still significant on 2 -m air temperature and snow temperature. It is not evident if an albedo treatment based on spherical snow grains or non-spherical grains (an optimized habit combination; OHC) results in better agreement with observations. In the higher-order scheme the surface snow is heated by penetrating short wave radiation that is absorbed by the snow. This is probably why the summer snow temperature is much higher in this scheme and why the lower-order snow scheme requires a high snow thermal conductivity to account for the sub-surface heating in the summer. Further work is required to capture the effect of snow aging on the albedo...|$|R
