Sports facilities, {{services}} and equipment, professional competence of the instructors, teachers and coaches {{with the requirements}} {{and needs of the}} population have become <b>an</b> <b>important</b> and <b>current</b> research <b>theme.</b> The research purpose is to obtain data at the following categories: motivation and satisfaction received from a sporting activity, quality of service and identify the benefits achieved. Methods. The method has been applied in the form of sociological survey questionnaire applied directly to high school or university students, or through the Internet. Results. Responses to questions were entered into SPSS, and was calculated the arithmetic average, median, mode and deviations from central tendencies, univariate analysis. Conclusions. Reasons to practice sports by subjects interviewed are: health, fitness, hedonic aspects and aesthetic aspirations. The time given movement is {{about an hour and a}} half. Team games are appreciated. The deployment conditions of sports activity are unsatisfactory. Advertising and quality of services, athlete’s recovery and the ambience of sporting bases may influence the attitude for those who do not want to sweat for healthy life...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{has long}} been a theme open for debate within the {{mathematics}} education community and has been reflected in the work of ICMI even prior to the first ICME (Lyon, 1969). More recently, information and communication technology (ICT) has played an increasing role in the events organized by ICMI. Debates around ICT have brought to light the fact that other resources and technologies have been introduced over the last 100 years. This Working Group deals with how artefacts and materials (e. g. paper and pencil, memorisation and calculators, Dienes blocks, mathematical machines, computers, software and digital learning objects etc.) have been used over the 100 years of ICMI's history. The integration of tools and technologies is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> and <b>current</b> <b>theme</b> today. Research in learning with technological tools has been showing much promise with respect to their use in the generation of learning environments where students have richer opportunities to construct mathematical meanings, to explore and experiment with mathematical ideas and to express these using a wealth of representations. However, actual use of these tools in real school environments is still very sparse despite the abundance of governmental funding and interest. The changes in classroom practices involved in the use of technology seem to pose a real challenge to administrators, curriculum designers, teachers and students. It must be emphasized, however, that a deeper understanding of ICT may be reached only if viewed from an historical perspective. Euclid's Elements may be considered a modelling theory of geometrical drawing by means of ruler and compasses. The ancient abacus (in Roman area {{as well as in the}} far East) and the other devices used in pre-Columbian America can be seen as the roots of the modern positional system of number representation. More recently, the development of perspective drawing in Europe by means of instruments used in artists studios, has laid the foundations for modern development of projective geometry. Attention to these kinds of instruments has been held by the first president of ICMI, Felix Klein, who established a subject for university education of teachers (named Elementary mathematics from an advanced standpoint) where the use of ancient instruments was put in the perspective of the advances of mathematics of the 18 th and 19 th century. The present technologies (ICT) are, in some respects, the heirs of this long tradition. A widespread misunderstanding is that, due to their effectiveness, they may replace the old instruments: why use abaci when pocket calculators are available? Why refer to ruler and compass construction when powerful software is available? From time to time, in ICMI Studies, the issue of ancient and new instruments has been raised (ICMI Study on History e. g.). In national curricula (e. g. Italy), the integration of ancient and ICT technologies has been raised. Research has been presented at different ICME's that integrates artefacts and "computer artefacts". More recently, there has been an increase in research that includes digital objects, which opens up new possibilities for merging objects and "regular software" in virtual objects such as applets and video-stories. Questions such as the following may be addressed: Is it different to use the graphing calculator or a function software in the classroom? What kind of change does the Internet bring to mathematics education? Do new technologies transform old ones or erase them? What is the relation between human thinking and the tools that have been developed throughout our history? How is the very notion of body affected by artefacts in general, and by computer technology in particular? Are representations of a given mathematics concept being transformed by the different technology we have experienced in these 100 years of ICMI? Is knowledge a product of units of humans-with-media as proposed by some authors? Has the notion of a problem in the mathematical classroom been affected by different technology? How has the classroom been affected by the Internet? Are teachers in a new "risk zone" as they need to deal with new uncertainties due to the availability of information and communication technology...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of different methodologies and {{simplification of procedures}} is surely {{one of the most}} <b>important</b> <b>current</b> <b>themes</b> in survey techniques for researching cultural heritage, especially for architectural heritage.  The traditional methods for the metric survey of an architectural building (including micro geodesy and the stereophotogrammetric survey) are currently being consolidated. However, in the field of the architectural, artistic and archaeological survey, new technologies are now available and this knowledge needs to be more widely used, especially where the heritage is greater and so maintenance is as necessary as it is onerous. This report proposes some operative considerations, which derive from experience developed using the most modern technologies available, in order to compare and discuss the achievable accuracies (even if they are not always strictly necessary) and the operating modalities, especially for architectural surveys. So, the aim of this report is to verify that the simplification of procedures and cheaper solutions do not bring variations to the necessary metric precision or expert photointerpretation analysis. However, it is clear that, without considering the purposes and objectives of the survey, it would not be correct to appraise the survey methods and to classify those using reliability and accuracy criteria. In fact, the objective of a survey determines which tool will be used, according to the requests of the survey client to the survey expert...|$|R

Modern universities have also attempted to emulate Christian monasticism. Even in the Americas, universities are built in the gothic style of twelfth century monasteries.

In this paper, we propose representing human actions using spatio-temporal motion trajectories. In the proposed approach, each trajectory consists of one motion channel corresponding to the evolution of the 3 D position of all joint coordinates within frames of action sequence. Action recognition is achieved through a shape trajectory representation that is learnt by a K-NN classifier, which takes benefit from Riemannian geometry in an open curve shape space. Experiments on the MSR Action 3 D and UTKinect human action datasets show that, in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach obtains promising results that show the potential of our approach...|$|R
