500|$|On September 22, 2007, the FBI {{opened an}} {{investigation}} of a white supremacist website that listed the addresses of five of the Jena Six and the telephone numbers {{of some of their}} families [...] "in case <b>anyone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> deliver justice". An FBI spokeswoman said the agency believed that the website [...] "essentially called for their lynching". Civil rights advocate Al Sharpton has said that some of the families have continuously received threatening and harassing phone calls.|$|E

500|$|More dubiously, the Daddies {{have also}} {{retained}} a particular pop cultural legacy for their provocative and often contentious band name which has persisted beyond the initial controversies that pegged the band's early years. The Daddies frequently appear on {{lists of the}} worst band names of all time, including those by Pitchfork, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the Toronto Sun and VH1, who called it [...] "quite possibly the most offensive band name ever, {{made all the more}} ridiculous by the fact that these outwardly bragging virgin-sexers had a completely innocuous mainstream hit song". A 2009 issue of Blender magazine placed the Daddies third with Limp Bizkit in a bracket chart of the worst band names, with comedian Steve Bodow commenting [...] "Because 'Virgin-Fuckin' Date Rapists' was taken" [...] and Eugene Mirman concurring [...] "it's a horrible name". In 2013, Rolling Stone included the Daddies on their list of [...] "The Thirteen Dumbest Band Names in Rock History", dwelling on the potentially incestuous interpretation as [...] "the last thing <b>anyone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> visualize while listening to music".|$|E

500|$|Steve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist {{and primary}} songwriter, {{has stated that}} his {{influences}} include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, Thin Lizzy, UFO and Wishbone Ash. In 2010 Harris stated, [...] "I think if <b>anyone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, {{all they have to}} do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it." [...] In 2004, Harris explained that the band's [...] "heaviness" [...] was inspired by [...] "Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in." [...] On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as [...] "more like a rhythm guitar," [...] cited as responsible for the band's galloping style, heard in such songs as [...] "The Trooper" [...] and [...] "Run to the Hills." ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} race, Oxford's bow man, Alex Woods, {{collapsed}} and lost consciousness. [...] After receiving treatment {{on the bank}} of the river, he was taken to Charing Cross Hospital, where he made a complete recovery. [...] Oxford's coach Sean Bowden suggested that the loss of one of Oxford's blades had driven Woods to push himself [...] "beyond his limits". [...] As a result of the disruption and the concern for Woods' condition, the traditional award ceremony was cancelled. [...] Woods later apologised to the Cambridge crew and coach for his collapse that [...] "prevented their celebrations" [...] while thanking them for their [...] "sportsmanlike behaviour". Cambridge boat club president Nelson said [...] "I feel bad. Finishing the race there was a lot of raw emotion and some of the celebrations seem pathetic in retrospect" [...] while his coach Steve Trapmore commented [...] "it's not the way <b>anyone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> take away the win". [...] Oxford cox Zoe de Toledo made a request that the race be re-rowed as a result of the broken blade, but the appeal was dismissed by umpire Garrett, who said [...] "I listened to Oxford’s complaint but I explained I did not see the clash as being the reason for the eventual result".|$|E

2500|$|The {{prospective}} design, although yet to fly, {{was mentioned}} at a February 1914 {{meeting of the}} Royal Aeronautical Society by Brigadier General David Henderson, who said:"If <b>anyone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> know which country has the fastest aeroplane in the world-it is Great Britain". [...] The S.E.4 was first flown in June 1914, demonstrating performance every bit as good as hoped, with a maximum speed of 135mph (217km/h), making it the fastest aircraft in the world. [...] The novel mounting of the mainwheels proved unstable during taxiing, {{and was replaced by}} more conventional V-struts. The engine was prone to overheating, so the propeller spinner had an opening cut into it and a fan installed inside the spinner to help cool the engine.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout history {{many have}} {{understood}} Jesus of Nazareth {{to have been}} a pacifist, drawing on his Sermon on the Mount. In the sermon Jesus stated that one should [...] "not resist an evildoer" [...] and promoted his turn the other cheek philosophy. [...] "If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if <b>anyone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well... Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you." [...] The New Testament story is of Jesus, besides preaching these words, surrendering himself freely to an enemy intent on having him killed and proscribing his followers from defending him.|$|E

[...] O'Day said that though she is pursuing her own career as a solo artist, she would never turn down the chance to get onstage with her former bandmates. [...] "I have so much respect for that situation, if there was ever interest in me coming back ... and making music with the girls, I would never say no to something like that," [...] she said.

2500|$|... 3But I {{want you}} {{to realize that the}} head of every man is Christ, {{and the head of the}} woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. 4Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. 5But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head {{uncovered}} dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved. 6For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head. 7 A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. 8For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; 9 neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 10It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels. 11Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 12For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. 13Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 14Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 15but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. 16If <b>anyone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God." ...|$|E
