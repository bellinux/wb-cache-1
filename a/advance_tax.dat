On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism. The move led to widespread protests throughout the country, including one by opposition parties, which stalled the winter session of parliament.

40|$|Summary by Sue UnsworthContrary {{to common}} assumptions, governments of African anglophone {{countries}} {{have long been}} relatively successful in collecting tax – {{taking into account the}} revenue potential of their economies. Major tax reforms have been undertaken over the past two decades. They have been prompted by the need for new revenue sources to compensate for steep reductions in tariffs, and promoted by international donors. Reforms have included: i) The widespread introduction of VAT; ii) The adoption of <b>advanced</b> <b>tax</b> administration reforms based on low cost ICTs, including the establishment of large taxpayer units, greater use of self-assessment coupled with better verifi cation, and measures to make tax paying easier and less contentious for taxpayers; iii) The creation of semi-autonomous revenue authorities (SARAs), with the intention of freeing them from bureaucratic straitjackets and political interference. In practice, however, while SARAs have routine operational and managerial autonomy, politicians can still intervene in detail. DfID, NORAD...|$|R
