5|$|By {{allowing}} u to vary {{over all}} possible integers, an infinite family of solutions {{can be generated}} from a single solution (x1,y1). If the solutions are required to be positive integers (x>0,y>0), only {{a finite number of}} solutions may be possible. This restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions; this is impossible for a system of linear equations when the solutions can be <b>any</b> <b>real</b> number (see Underdetermined system).|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton had {{considered}} the {{effect in the}} Principia, but pessimistically thought that <b>any</b> <b>real</b> mountain would produce too small a deflection to measure. Gravitational effects, he wrote, were only discernible on the planetary scale. Newton's pessimism was unfounded: although his calculations had suggested a deviation of less than 2minutes of arc (for an idealised three-mile high mountain), this angle, though very slight, was within the theoretical capability of instruments of his day.|$|E

5|$|Christopher Landsea {{noted that}} the efforts to reanalyze the Atlantic {{hurricane}} database {{will not be able}} to recover observations of open ocean tropical cyclones that were just never taken. Researchers cannot assume that the Atlantic tropical cyclone database presents a complete depiction of frequency of events before the advent of satellite imagery in the mid-1960s. Moreover, newly available advanced tools and techniques are also contributing toward monitoring about one additional Atlantic tropical cyclone per year since 2002. Thus large, long-term 'trends' in tropical cyclone frequency are primarily manifestations of increased monitoring capabilities and likely not related to <b>any</b> <b>real</b> change in the climate in which they develop.|$|E
5|$|Efforts made {{by local}} {{authorities}} in the Cluj-Napoca district {{at the end of}} the 1990s to reform the protection of children's rights and assistance for street children proved insufficient due to lack of funding, incoherent policies and the absence of <b>any</b> <b>real</b> collaboration between the actors involved (Child Rights Protection Directorate, Social Assistance Service within the District Directorate for Labour and Social Protection, Minors Receiving Centre, Guardian Authority within the City Hall, Police). There are numerous street children, whose poverty and lack of documented identity brings them into constant conflict with local law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|Following the Council of Trent (1563), Pope Pius V (1566–1572) drew up {{the terms}} {{for the office}} of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State, who was to handle the {{temporal}} affairs of the Papal States and the foreign relations of the Holy See. After abortively attempting to divide the duties of the Superintendent between four non-familial cardinals, Pius V acceded to the urgings of the College of Cardinals and his Spanish ambassador, and appointed his grandnephew, Michele Bonelli, as Superintendent, demarcating his duties with a papal bull of March 14, 1566. However, Pius V relentlessly avoided delegating <b>any</b> <b>real</b> autonomous power to Bonelli.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Bonnie was a {{long-lived}} {{storm in}} the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. It {{was the third}} tropical storm (including the April subtropical storm) and second hurricane of the 1992 season. Bonnie formed at high latitudes in the central Atlantic on September 17. Devoid of <b>any</b> <b>real</b> steering currents for much of its lifespan, it was nearly stationary for over {{a week in the}} central Atlantic Ocean. On September 27, it began to slowly track east and northeast towards the Azores. Just before becoming extratropical, it affected the Azores on September 30, although no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Æthelberht's life or reign, as very few East Anglian records have survived from this period. Mediaeval chroniclers have {{provided}} dubious accounts of his life, {{in the absence of}} <b>any</b> <b>real</b> details. According to Richard of Cirencester, writing in the fifteenth century, Æthelberht's parents were Æthelred I of East Anglia and Leofrana of Mercia. Richard narrates in detail a story of Æthelberht's piety, election as king and wise rule. Urged to marry against his will, he apparently agreed to wed Eadburh, the daughter of Offa of Mercia, and set out to visit her, despite his mother's forebodings and his experiences of terrifying events (an earthquake, a solar eclipse and a vision).|$|E
5|$|On 3 or 4January 1644, {{the five}} leading dissenting brethren signalled {{a break with}} the rest of the Assembly when they {{published}} An Apologeticall Narration, a polemical pamphlet appealing to Parliament. It argued that the congregational system was more amenable to state control of religious matters than that of the presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain <b>any</b> <b>real</b> power except to withdraw fellowship from aberrant congregations. By 17January, the majority of the Assembly had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system similar to that of the Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they could eventually be reconciled. It was hoped that by avoiding asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right, the congregationalists could be accommodated.|$|E
