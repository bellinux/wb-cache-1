5000|$|The {{wireless}} network is after all {{confined to a}} small geographical area.

Thus the exposure is low with <b>an</b> open <b>wireless</b> access point, and the risks with having <b>an</b> open <b>wireless</b> network are small.

5|$|Snapdragon is a {{suite of}} {{system on a chip}} (SoC) {{semiconductor}} products designed and marketed by Qualcomm for mobile devices. The Snapdragon central processing unit (CPU) uses the ARM RISC instruction set, and a single SoC may include multiple CPU cores, a graphics processing unit (GPU), <b>a</b> <b>wireless</b> modem, and other software and hardware to support a smartphone's global positioning system (GPS), camera, gesture recognition and video. Snapdragon semiconductors are embedded in devices of various systems, including Android and Windows Phone devices. They are also used for netbooks, in cars, wearable devices and other devices.|$|E
5|$|Adoption of Snapdragon {{contributed to}} Qualcomm's {{transition}} from <b>a</b> <b>wireless</b> modem company {{to one that}} also produces {{a wider range of}} hardware and software for mobile devices. In July 2011 Qualcomm acquired certain assets from GestureTek in order to incorporate its gesture recognition intellectual property into Snapdragon SoCs. In mid-2012 Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon software development kit (SDK) for Android devices at the Uplinq developer conference. The SDK includes tools for facial recognition, gesture recognition, noise cancellation and audio recording. That November Qualcomm acquired some assets from EPOS Development in order to integrate its stylus and gesture recognition technology into Snapdragon products. It also collaborated with Microsoft to optimize Windows Phone 8 for Snapdragon semiconductors.|$|E

5|$|In Lightning Returns, Hope {{resides in}} a special base {{constructed}} within the new Cocoon called the Ark, communicating with Lightning via <b>a</b> <b>wireless</b> com-link. Hope is returned to his 14-year-old image and stripped of his emotions by Bhunivelze, but retains his memories from the past two games. He is instrumental in keeping the world going, for as Lightning completes quests and fulfills missions, he uses energy generated from those acts to prolong the world's life. On the final day, Hope reveals that he acted as Bhunivelze's eyes and ears, and will now be disposed of. Bhunivelze then uses Hope as an avatar, speaking with Lightning and capturing her allies. During the final battle Lightning frees him from Bhunivelze's control, then Hope aids her in defeating Bhunivelze for good.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{different}} {{data collection}} mechanisms {{are used by}} different transport operators, depending {{on the nature of}} their business. The MTR equips its stations with local area networks that connect the components that deal with Octopus cards—turnstiles, Add Value Machines, value-checking machines and customer service terminals. Transactions from these stations are relayed to the MTR's Kowloon Bay headquarters through a frame relay wide area network, and hence onwards to the central clearing house system (CCHS) for clearing. Similar arrangements are in place for retailers such as 7-Eleven. Handheld devices are used to scan offline mobile readers, including those installed on minibuses. Buses either use handheld devices or <b>a</b> <b>wireless</b> system, depending on operator.|$|E
5|$|Madras {{was linked}} {{to the rest of the}} world through {{telegraphs}} in 1853 and a civilian telegraph service was introduced on 1 February 1855.

The Colombo-Talaimannar telegraph line established in 1858, was extended to Madras in 1882, thereby connecting the city with Ceylon. Telephones were introduced in the presidency in 1881 and on 19 November 1881, the first telephone exchange with 17 connections was established at Errabalu Street in Madras. <b>A</b> <b>wireless</b> telgraphy service was established between Madras and Port Blair in 1920 and in 1936, the Indo-Burma radio telephone service was established between Madras and Rangoon.|$|E
