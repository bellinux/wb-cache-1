40|$|Abstract. A tournament Tn is an {{orientation}} {{of a complete}} graph on n vertices. A king in a tournament is a vertex from which every other vertex is reachable by a path of length at most 2. <b>A</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence <b>of</b> kings in a tournament Tn is an ordered list of its vertices u 1,u 2, [...] .,un such that ui dominates ui+ 1 (ui → ui+ 1) and ui is a king in the subtournament induced by {uj: i ≤ j ≤ n} for each i = 1, 2, [...] .,n− 1. In particular, if Tn is transitive, searching for <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence <b>of</b> kings in Tn is equivalent to <b>sorting</b> <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> n numbers. In this paper, we try to find <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence <b>of</b> kings in a general tournament by asking the following type of binary question: “What is {{the orientation of the}} edge between two specified vertices u, v? ” The cost for finding <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence <b>of</b> kings is the minimum number of binary questions asked in order to guarantee the finding <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence <b>of</b> kings. Using an adversary argument proposed in this paper, we show that the cost for finding <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence <b>of</b> kings in Tn is Θ(n 3 / 2) in the worst case, thus settling the order of magnitude of this question. We also showthat the cost for finding a king in Tn is Ω(n 4 / 3) and O(n 3 / 2) inthe worst case. Finally, we show a connection between <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence <b>of</b> kings and a median order in a tournament...|$|R
