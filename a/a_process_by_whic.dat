40|$|If we {{can ever}} hope to {{understand}} the non-seismic signals that the Earth sends out before major earthquakes, {{we need to understand}} the physics of rocks under increased levels of stress. In particular we need to understand the generation of electrical currents in the ground. We have begun to study how electrical conductivity of igneous rocks changes under stress and what types of charge carriers are involved. We show that quartz-rich granite and quartz-free anorthosite both generate electronic charge carriers when subjected to stress. The charge carriers are positive holes (p-holes), i. e., defect electrons on the oxygen anion sublattice. They spread out of the stressed rock volume, the “source volume”, into the surrounding unstressed rocks. Time-varying ground currents are required to generate pre-earth-quake local magnetic field anomalies and low-frequency electromagnetic emissions. We posit that stress-induced activation of p-hole charge carriers and their outflow from the source volume is the basic <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>whic...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} price {{discovery}} process of {{initial public offerings}} ~IPOs! using a unique dataset. The first quote entered by the lead underwriter in the five-minute preopening window explains {{a large proportion of}} initial returns even for hot IPOs. Significant learning and price discovery continues to take place during these five minutes with hundreds of quotes being entered. The lead underwriter observes the quoting behavior of other market makers, particularly the wholesalers, and accordingly revises his own quotes. There is a strong positive relationship between initial returns and the time of day when trading starts in an IPO. RESEARCHERS HAVE DOCUMENTED AND TRIED to explain why IPOs jump up in price initially but then perform poorly in the long run. 1 Schultz and Zaman ~ 1994 ! and Barry and Jennings ~ 1992 ! report that almost the entire initial return is reflected in the very first trade price. However, researchers have not examined how the price changes from the offer price to the price of the first trade.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{integrate}} research on organizational socialization tactics and newcomer proactive tactics. Based on the work term experiences of a sample of co-op management students, the results indicate that organizational socialization tactics are positively related to newcomer proactive tactics (feedback seeking, information seeking, networking, boss relationship building, general socializing, and job change negotiation). Of the socialization tactics, the context and social dimensions were related to some of the proactive tactics while the content dimension was not related to any of them. The results also indicated that newcomer proactive tactics partially mediate the relationship between organizational socialization tactics and socialization outcomes. When individuals join organizations, they must learn to understand and make sense of their new surroundings (Louis, 1980). This is required when newcomers join an organization and also when individuals cross an organizational boundary when for example they are promoted or change departments (Major & Kozlowski, 1997). The method by which this sensemaking occurs is known as organizational socialization. Organizational socialization is the <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>whic...</b>|$|R
40|$|Anoxygenic {{photosynthesis}} {{based on}} Fe(II) {{is thought to}} be one of the most ancient forms of metabolism and is hypothesized to represent a transition step in the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. However, little is known about the molecular basis of this process because, until recently (Y. Jiao and D. K. Newman, J. Bacteriol. 189 : 1765 – 1773, 2007), most phototrophic Fe(II) -oxidizing bacteria have been genetically intractable. In this study, we circumvented this problem by taking a heterologous-complementation approach to identify a three-gene operon (the foxEYZ operon) from Rhodobacter sp. strain SW 2 that confers enhanced light-dependent Fe(II) oxidation activity when expressed in its genetically tractable relative Rhodobacter capsulatus SB 1003. The first gene in this operon, foxE, encodes a c-type cytochrome with no significant similarity to other known proteins. Expression of foxE alone confers significant light-dependent Fe(II) oxidation activity on SB 1003, but maximal activity is achieved when foxE is expressed with the two downstream genes foxY and foxZ. In SW 2, the foxE and foxY genes are cotranscribed in the presence of Fe(II) and/or hydrogen, with foxZ being transcribed only in the presence of Fe(II). Sequence analysis predicts that foxY encodes a protein containing the redox cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone and that foxZ encodes a protein with a transport function. Future biochemical studies will permit the localization and function of the Fox proteins in SW 2 to be determined. Oxygenic photosynthesis, the biological <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>whic...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the promise of and {{barriers}} to pathways through high school to college that combine the college-preparatory curriculum with career-related learning. Whether high school vocational and academic coursework should be separated or combined has long been debated in the U. S. Federal legislation in the 1990 s encouraged states and localities to “integrate ” academic and vocational education. While an integrated curriculum that prepares students for both college and careers {{is not a new}} idea, it continues to have logical appeal as part of a strategy that would make college an option for greater numbers of students. This paper will discuss the potential benefits, and the barriers to achieving them, and possible strategies for moving forward. In the first section of this paper, we explain why blending academic coursework with career-technical education (CTE) is one key element in a strategy that would aim to make college an option for greater numbers of high school students. This is one among several possible kinds of pathways that could serve that purpose. In the second section, we briefly review the research on combining academic coursework with CTE in high schools. Getting clear-cut research results has been difficult because most studies {{have not been able to}} determine whether apparent effects are due to particular programs or to selection of particular kinds of students into those programs. In California, the high school courses required for admission to public universities are spelled out in a list known as “a through g. ” In order for a California student to count a course as fulfilling an a-g requirement, that course, in that particular high school, must have been approved by the University of California (UC).
