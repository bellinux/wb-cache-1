5|$|Ballo's father wrote a {{book about}} his daughter's death, and refrained from {{interviews}} with the press until the book was published in 2009. Titled Kaja: 1988–2008, the book became a bestseller in Norway. It reached second place on the bestseller list of the Bestseller Association in Norway for general literature, in May 2009. The author stated he wrote the book as an expository method to both process his grief, inform his family about the controversy, and educate the public <b>about</b> <b>suicide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Falle had no role models. She {{began writing}} poetry <b>about</b> <b>suicide</b> and wearing black clothing. She acted out by {{stealing}} cars and using drugs recreationally. She {{started out with}} soft drugs and {{then moved on to}} using psychedelic mushrooms and LSD. Her associates in these criminal activities, who came from similarly dysfunctional backgrounds, provided her with a sense of belonging that she no longer found at home. Falle's mother had a series of boyfriends who abused her and made the house unsafe, so Falle ran away from home. She slept at friends' houses, on their couches and in tents in their backyards, concealing her presence from her friends' parents.|$|E
5|$|When Brion sent a {{bill for}} the {{abandoned}} sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith {{sent a message to}} the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell of Goldenboy. McConnell told Spin that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk <b>about</b> <b>suicide,</b> and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips and Scott McPherson of Sense Field played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.|$|E

It discusses the possibility of imitative suicides after publications in press (syndrome of Werther) and the increase of suicides after TV special reports. The reviewed articles analyze the data obtained in Internet survey of the visitors of prosuicidal web-sites. Alongside with other findings in foreign sources they register the impact of mass-media reports <b>about</b> <b>suicides</b> on young people subjected to external influences. The World Health Organization recommends a more balanced approach to news coverage of suicidal accidents by mass-media...|$|R

5|$|In 1871, {{following}} Prussia's victories, the German {{states were}} united into the German Empire, with William as the Emperor and Frederick as heir-apparent {{to the new}} German monarchy. Although William thought {{the day when he}} became Emperor the saddest of his life, Frederick was excited to be witness to a great day in German history. Bismarck, now Chancellor, disliked Frederick and distrusted the liberal attitudes of the Crown Prince and Princess. Often at odds with his father's and Bismarck's policies and actions, Frederick sided with the country's liberals in their opposition to the expansion of the empire's army. The Crown Prince also became involved in many public works projects, such as the establishment of schools and churches in the area of Bornstedt near Potsdam. To assist his father's effort to turn Berlin, the capital city, into a great cultural centre, he was appointed Protector of Public Museums; it was largely due to Frederick that considerable artistic collections were acquired, housed in Berlin's new Kaiser Friedrich Museum (later known as the Bode Museum) after his death. In 1878, when his father was incapacitated by injury from an assassination attempt, Frederick briefly took over his tasks but was soon relegated to the sidelines once again. His lack of influence affected him deeply, even causing him to think <b>about</b> <b>suicide.</b>|$|E

25|$|Olanzapine is used therapeutically {{to treat}} serious mental illness.

After the discovery of a letter written by Impastato several months before his death, authorities started talking <b>about</b> <b>suicide.</b> Thanks to the efforts of his brother Giovanni Impastato, his mother Felicia Bartolotta Impastato (who publicly broke relations with their mafia relatives), his fellow activists, and the Centro siciliano di documentazione (founded in Palermo in 1977; Giuseppe Impastato's name was added to its masthead in 1980), the Mafia's responsibility for the crime would be identified after a struggle of many years.|$|E

25|$|He {{returned}} to his family in Vienna on 25 August 1919, by all accounts physically and mentally spent. He apparently talked incessantly <b>about</b> <b>suicide,</b> terrifying his sisters and brother Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and {{to get rid of}} his fortune. In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 Kronen a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizable portfolio of investments in the United States and the Netherlands. He divided it among his siblings, except for Margarete, insisting that it not be held in trust for him. His family saw him as ill, and acquiesced.|$|E
25|$|Born in London, Anthony {{attended}} Harrow School {{as a free}} day pupil {{for three}} years {{from the age of}} seven because his father's farm, acquired for that reason, lay in that neighbourhood. After a spell at a private school at Sunbury, he followed his father and two older brothers to Winchester College, where he remained for three years. He returned to Harrow as a day-boy to reduce the cost of his education. Trollope had some very miserable experiences at these two public schools. They ranked as two of the most élite schools in England, but Trollope had no money and no friends, and was bullied a great deal. At the age of twelve, he fantasised <b>about</b> <b>suicide.</b> However, he also daydreamed, constructing elaborate imaginary worlds.|$|E
25|$|Noske, {{depressed}} {{enough by}} the disloyalty {{of the military}} to speak <b>about</b> <b>suicide</b> to an aide, reported to the cabinet at 4:00 am. At a confused meeting at the Reichskanzlei, the undefended cabinet took two decisions: to flee the city and to issue a call for a general strike. These were not unanimous, the Vice-Chancellor Eugen Schiffer {{and some of the}} other non-SPD ministers refused to leave the city, to preserve the opportunity to negotiate with the putschists. Only Ebert and the SPD ministers signed the call for a general strike. At 6:15 am they had to interrupt the meeting and flee. Within ten minutes of their departure, the Marinebrigade reached the Brandenburger Tor, where it was met by Lüttwitz, Ludendorff, Kapp and their followers. Shortly thereafter, Kapp's men moved into the Reichskanzlei. Supported by a battalion of regular Reichswehr, they occupied the government quarter.|$|E

[...] VanDerWerff, referring to the third member of that romantic triangle, wrote that one of the two [...] "tertiary characters" [...] he responded to most was [...] "Shane, who didn’t say anything but gave good cry-face". VanDerWerff's other character was Karofsky, and Michael Slezak of TVLine characterized his scene with Kurt as [...] "electric, with Kurt tenderly giving the 'just friends' speech to Dave". Lynch thought the plot of having Karofsky be Kurt's secret admirer was [...] "vaguely stalker-ish on Karofsky's part, and contrived {{on the part of the}} show", and Canning accurately predicted that after Karofsky had been seen by his classmate, it would [...] "just be an episode or two before Karofsky gets bullied into thinking <b>about</b> <b>suicide,</b> if not actually taking his own life".|$|E
