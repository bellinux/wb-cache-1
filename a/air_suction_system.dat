This study aimed to identify and quantify {{the extent of the}} problems using 25 DCUs, methodically eliminate these problems and develop an efficient approach for reliable, effective, automated disinfection. MethodsDCU <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> residual contamination by environmental and human-derived bacteria was evaluated by microbiological culture following standard aspiration disinfection with a quaternary ammonium disinfectant or alternatively, a novel flooding approach to disinfection. Disinfection of multicomponent suction handpieces, assembled and disassembled, was also studied. A prototype manual and a novel automated <b>Suction</b> Tube Cleaning <b>System</b> (STCS) were developed and tested, as were novel single component suction handpieces. ResultsStandard aspiration disinfection consistently failed to decontaminate DCU <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> effectively. Semi-confluent bacterial growth (101 – 500 colony forming units (CFU) per culture plate) was recovered from up to 60 % of suction filter housings and from up to 19 % of high and 37 % of low volume suction hoses. Manual and automated flood disinfection of DCU <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> reduced this dramatically (ranges for filter cage and high and low volume hoses of 0 – 22, 0 – 16 and 0 – 14 CFU/plate, respectively) (P< 0. 0001). Multicomponent suction handpieces could not be adequately disinfected without prior removal and disassembly. Novel single component handpieces, allowed their effective disinfection in situ using the STCS, which virtually eliminated contamination from the entire <b>suction</b> <b>system.</b> ConclusionFlood disinfection of DCU <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> and single component handpieces radically improves disinfection efficacy and considerably reduces potential cross-infection and cross-contamination risks. Clinical significanceDCU <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> become heavily contaminated during use. Conventional disinfection does not adequately control this.

The application of Fluent with the split-middle method under the identical operation mode is expected to optimize the spread angle.

As a result, the air speed might increase. The wind tunnel test employed in this research offers the solid evidences to support this hypothesis.

The authors investigated an "intelligent" remote controlled automatic <b>suction</b> <b>system.</b> A <b>suction</b> cannula with an optic sensor at its tip was connected to a special closed cardiotomy reservoir. Contact with blood immediately generated a reservoir vacuum from 0 to - 100 mmHg, permitting aspiration until the blood was no longer detected (automatic shut off). Blood trauma was evaluated in a bovine model, comparing the automatic <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> vs standard continuous aspiration (control) adjusted to - 100 mmHg. After full systemic heparinization, five calves (weight, 62. 5 +/- 4. 4 kg) for the automatic <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> group, and four (weight, 62. 8 +/- 5. 1 kg) for the control group, were equipped with a jugular cannula connected via a roller pump to the cardiotomy reservoir. Through a small thoracotomy, a standardized hole was created in the right atrium, allowing for a blood loss of approximately 400 ml/min. The suction cannula was placed into the chest cavity in a fixed position. Blood samples were drawn at regular intervals for cell count and chemistry. Lactate dehydrogenase values, for the automatic <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> and the control groups, respectively, expressed as percent of baseline value, were 88 +/- 14 vs 116 +/- 22 after 1 hr; 94 +/- 16 vs 123 +/- 23 after 2 hr; and 97 +/- 19 vs 140 +/- 48 after 3 hr (p < 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Bacterial {{contamination}} of endoscopy suites is of concern; however studies evaluating bacterial aerosols are lacking. We aimed {{to determine the}} effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>suctioning</b> during removal of biopsy forceps in reducing bacterial air contamination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective single-blinded trial involving 50 patients who were undergoing elective nontherapeutic colonoscopy. During colonoscopy, endoscopists removed the biopsy forceps first without and then with suctioning following contact with the sigmoid mucosa. A total of 50 L of air was collected continuously for 30 seconds at 30 -cm distance from the biopsy channel valve of the colonoscope, with time starting at forceps removal. Airborne bacteria were collected by an impactor air sampler (MAS- 100). Standard Petri dishes with CNA blood agar were used to culture Gram-positive bacteria. Main outcome measure was the bacterial load in endoscopy room air. RESULTS: At {{the beginning and end}} of the daily colonoscopy program, the median (and interquartile [IQR] range) bioaerosol burden was 4 colony forming units (CFU) /m (3) (IQR 3 - 6) and 16 CFU/m (3) (IQR 13 - 18), respectively. <b>Air</b> <b>suctioning</b> during removal of the biopsy forceps reduced the bioaerosol burden from a median of 14 CFU/m (3) (IQR 11 - 29) to a median of 7 CFU/m (3) (IQR 4 - 16) (P = 0. 0001). Predominantly enterococci were identified on the agar plates.

40|$|During {{mechanical}} ventilation, {{patients are}} connected to the ventilator by an endotracheal tube. The tube needs to be cleaned from mucus by suction, which can cause negative effects such as lung collapse, hypoxemia and desaturation. These can be avoided by preoxygenation, change of ventilator settings, use of closed <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> and recruitment manoeuvres. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effects of endotracheal suction during different ventilator settings and by different suction methods. A method to reverse side effects was investigated. In anaesthetized pigs, the effect of suction during volume and pressure-controlled ventilation was investigated, and the effect of different <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> and catheter sizes were compared. Suction efficacy was investigated in a bench study. The effect of recruitment manoeuvre added after suction, i. e. post-suction recruitment manoeuvre was evaluated. Endotracheal suction causes lung volume loss leading to impaired gas exchange, an effect that is more severe in pressure-controlled ventilation than in volume-controlled ventilation. When 14 French suction catheters were used more side effects were found compared to 12 French catheters, but no difference was found between open and closed <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> in pressure-controlled ventilation. Open <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> was more effective to remove mucus compared to closed system. Post-suction recruitment manoeuvre restored the side effects after the first recruitment when it was applied directly after suction. In conclusion, open endotracheal suction causes impairment in gas exchange and lung mechanics, and more so in pressure-controlled than in volume-controlled mode. These changes can be minimized if smaller suction catheters are used. A post-suction recruitment manoeuvre applied directly after suction restores lung function. It is obvious that the recruitment manoeuvre should be added directly after suction, because if the manoeuvre is delayed and the lung is collapsed and left collapsed, it will be more difficult to recruit the lung...|$|R

The aim {{of this paper is}} to give an overview of the literature and to present our experience with the MECC-smart <b>suction</b> <b>system.</b> METHODS AND RESULTS: At our institution, 1799 patients underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, 1372 with a MECC-smart <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> and 427 with CECC. All in-hospital data were assessed and the results were compared between the 2 groups. Patient characteristics and the distribution of EuroSCORE risk profile in our collective were similar between both groups. Average age in the MECC collective was 67. 5 +/- 11. 4 years and average EuroSCORE was 5. 0 +/- 1. 5. Average number of distal anastomoses was similar to the average number encountered in patients undergoing CABG surgery with CECC (3. 3 +/- 1. 0 for MECC versus 3. 2 +/- 1. 1 for CECC; P = ns). Myocardial protection is superior in MECC patients with lower postoperative maximal cTnI values (11. 0 +/- 10. 8 micromol/L for MECC versus 24. 7 +/- 25. 3 micromol/L for CECC; P <. 05).
