It was only briefly fashionable in France, where a padded roll or French farthingale (called in England <b>a</b> <b>bum</b> roll) held the skirts out in a rounded shape at the waist, falling in soft folds to the floor. In England, the Spanish farthingale was worn through the 1570s, and was gradually replaced by the French farthingale. By the 1590s, skirts were pinned to wide wheel farthingales to achieve a drum shape.|$|E

500|$|The musical King Kong, {{sponsored}} by the Union of South African Artists, is described as the ultimate achievement and final flowering of Sophiatown multi-racial cultural exploits in the 1950s. King Kong was a Sophiatown legend who gained popularity as a famous boxer, notorious extrovert, <b>a</b> <b>bum</b> and a brawler. The King Kong musical depicted the street life, the illicit shebeens, the violence, and something approximating {{the music of the}} township: jazz, penny whistles and the work songs of the black miners. When King Kong premiered in Johannesburg, [...] Miriam Makeba the vocalist of the [...] Manhattan Brothers, played in the female lead role. The musical later went to London's West End for two years.|$|E

500|$|Grant {{retired from}} the screen at 62, when his {{daughter}} Jennifer was born, to focus on bringing her up {{and to provide a}} sense of permanency and stability in her life. He had become increasingly disillusioned with cinema in the 1960s, rarely finding a script that he approved of. He remarked: [...] "I could have gone on acting and playing a grandfather or <b>a</b> <b>bum,</b> but I discovered more important things in life". Grant knew after he had made Charade that the [...] "Golden Age" [...] of Hollywood was now over. He expressed little interest in making a career comeback, and continued to respond to invites or mention of it with [...] "fat chance". He did, however, briefly appear in the video documentary for Elvis's 1970 Las Vegas concert , in the audience.

The Rolling Stone staff rated Mediocre four stars, and Rolling Stones average viewer rating is {{four and a}} half stars. Mark Kemp, a music {{journalist}} from Rolling Stone, called Mediocre one of the strongest debuts from a female singer-songwriter since Norah Jones' Come Away with Me, exclaiming [...] "There's sultry torch songs, folky ballads, smart rock — and not <b>a</b> <b>bum</b> track among them." [...] Ron Bronson, a music journalist from the website SoMinty, awarded Mediocre five stars. He describes Sariñana's voice on Mediocre as being [...] "something along the lines of Nellie McKay meets countryman Julieta Venegas meets Sia. [...] original, in other words. Very original.... If you have any real desire to listen to music en español, you'll be [...] to find a better singer on the indie scene these days. Ximena has got chops, folks." [...] Ernesto Sánchez of People en Español labeled Mediocre [...] "one of the most promising Latin Music albums of [...] ".

Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, [...] "It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere {{in the midst of all}} the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain."

[...] Although part-silver Kennedy half dollars were struck in 1970, they were only for collectors and were not put aside for assay. Commissioners could instead test 21,975 dimes and 11,098 quarters, all made from copper-nickel clad, though as the Associated Press, reporting on the 1973 Assay Commission, put it, [...] "a discovery of <b>a</b> <b>bum</b> coin hasn't occurred in years." [...] Only one in every 100,000 clad or silver-clad pieces was put aside for the Assay Commission, and only one in every 200,000 dimes.

[...] Numismatist Charles Logan, in his 1979 article about the impending end of the Assay Commission, stated that this incident pointed out [...] "the basic problem with the annual trial.

During the chorus, she pleads to her mother not to worry in lines such as [...] "But mama I'm in love with a criminal" [...] and [...] "Mama please don't cry / I will be alright." [...] Andrew Leahey of The Washington Times and Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly {{compared}} the lyrics to those of Madonna's [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986), while David Bunachan compared them to Coolio's [...] "Mama I'm in Love Wit' a Gangsta" [...] (1994).

Keith Caufield noted that they were an unintentional nod to Supertramp's [...] "The Logical Song" [...] (1979). Thompson stated that Spears's vocals are less processed than {{on the rest of the}} album, while according to Amy Sciarretto they are [...] "heavily auto-tuned and studio-treated, [...] she delivers her lines in a monotone, robotic fashion." ...|$|E

[...] Brandle commended the show for being [...] "all slick, clean fun". Erica Futterman (Rolling Stone) wrote in a title for the concert at the Beacon Theatre in New York, [...] "U.K. boy band relies on vocal prowess and charisma to keep fan base loyal."

Jane Stevenson (Canoe.ca) maintained that the show at the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre in Toronto had [...] "none of that choreographed dance move nonsense", and complimented the [...] "naturally, classy, low-key" [...] production. Melody Lau (National Post) {{reviewed the}} same concert. Lau opined, [...] "It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere {{in the midst of all}} the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain." [...] Lau additionally noted One Direction's lack of original material to perform, [...] "the group falls back on a handful of covers to fill in their set, including Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody", Gym Class Heroes' [...] "Stereo Hearts" [...] and, surprisingly, Natalie Imbruglia's [...] "Torn". Not straying too far away from the originals, the mid-show medley definitely felt like the boys randomly belting out songs for the sake of filler but girls didn't mind." ...|$|E

Jon Pareles of The New York Times described the clothes as mainly silvery, ranging from miniskirts to formal dresses, flesh-toned bodysuit to bikini to negligee. Pareles further noted that [...] "The wardrobe entices men, but it's also a means of self-assertion". J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post described the costumes during the show as [...] "spangly". Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the costumes saying that [...] "every one [...] fabulously glamorous, most of them tailored to highlight the singer's ample cleavage {{and a pair of}} legs to rival Tina Turner's. At one point, when the legs were concealed by a long scarlet gown, wind blew from underneath to expose them." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe praised the floor-length gown but disliked the tinfoil mini worn by Knowles. Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of The Nation praised Knowles' look, saying that she was like a [...] "glittering goddess in a revealing outfit". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter also echoed her statements, [...] "to say that Beyonce looks terrific is probably redundant. Her fashion parade of form-fitting, eye-catching costumes -- most notably a belly dancer's get-up in which she demonstrated some hip-shaking moves that indicated Shakira better watch her back -- provided ample opportunities for shameless leering." [...] John Aizlewood of the Daily Mail described the fashion as [...] "majestic". Gordon Smart from the newspaper The Sun praised the [...] "sexy costumes" [...] like the silvery dresses worn by Knowles and added that [...] "her audiences certainly haven't had <b>a</b> <b>bum</b> deal".

[...] Irish Independents Eamon Sweeney noted that Knowles looked [...] "absolutely stunning" [...] and added, [...] "I have to confess that the sight of Beyoncé ripping off a short cocktail dress to reveal a barely there bodysuit will linger in my memory for years to come." [...] A writer of The StarPhoenix wrote that Knowles looked like a [...] "silver-clad siren rose" [...] further saying that [...] "it was almost surreal to see the woman who frequents the covers of fashion magazines in the same room".
