50|$|Chlorphentermine acts as {{a highly}} {{selective}} serotonin releasing agent (SRA). It is not a psychostimulant and {{has little or no}} abuse potential, but is classed as a Schedule III drug in the USA due mainly to its similarity to other appetite suppressants such as diethylpropion which have been more widely abused. It is no longer used due mainly to safety concerns, as it has a serotonergic effects profile similar to other withdrawn appetite suppressants such as fenfluramine and <b>aminorex</b> which were found to cause pulmonary hypertension and cardiac fibrosis following prolonged use.|$|E
50|$|Amphetamines like MDMA, MDEA, MDA, and MBDB, {{among other}} {{relatives}} (see MDxx), are recreational drugs termed entactogens. They act as serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agents (SNDRAs) and also agonize serotonin receptors {{such as those}} in the 5-HT2 subfamily. Fenfluramine, chlorphentermine, and <b>aminorex,</b> which are also amphetamines and relatives, were formerly used as appetite suppressants but were discontinued due to concerns of cardiac valvulopathy. This side effect has been attributed to their additional action of potent agonism of the 5-HT2B receptor.

50|$|Epidemics {{of fatal}} {{pulmonary}} hypertension and heart valve damage associated with pharmaceutical anorectic agents {{have led to}} the withdrawal of products from the market. This was the case with <b>aminorex</b> in the 1960s, and again in the 1990s with fenfluramine (see: Fen-phen). Likewise, association of the related appetite suppressant phenylpropanolamine with hemorrhagic stroke led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request its withdrawal from the market in the United States in 2000, and similar concerns regarding ephedrine resulted in an FDA ban on its inclusion in dietary supplements in 2004. A Federal judge later overturned this ban in 2005 during a challenge by supplement maker Nutraceuticals. It is also debatable as to whether the ephedrine ban {{had more to do with}} its use as a precursor in methamphetamine manufacture rather than health concerns with the ingredient as such.|$|E
5000|$|The {{results of}} animal {{experiments}} conducted with this drug {{suggest that it}} has an abuse liability similar to cocaine and amphetamine. One study found that, [...] "stimulus properties of racemic cis, racemic trans, and all four individual optical isomers of 4-methylaminorex were examined in rats trained to discriminate 1 mg/kg of S(+)amphetamine sulfate from saline.

A second study in which rats trained to discriminate either 0.75 mg/kg S(+)-amphetamine or 1.5 mg/kg fenfluramine from saline generalized to <b>aminorex</b> as amphetamine stimulus but not to fenfluramine. Rats trained to discriminate 8 mg/kg cocaine from saline generalized 4-methylaminorex to cocaine-stimulus. The reinforcing effects of cis-4-methylaminorex were determined in two models of intravenous drug self-administration in primates. Vehicle or 4-methylaminorex doses were substituted for cocaine. One of the two different doses of 4-methylaminorex maintained self-administration behavior above vehicle control levels.|$|E
5000|$|Fenfluramine as {{a single}} drug was first {{introduced}} in the 1970s, but was not popular because it only temporarily reduced weight. A 1984 study found a weight loss of 7.5 kg on average in 24 weeks, as compared to 4.4 kg under placebo. It sold modestly until the 1990s, when it was combined with phentermine and heavily marketed. A similar drug, <b>aminorex,</b> had caused severe lung damage and [...] "provided reason to worry that similar drugs ... could {{increase the risk of}} a rare but often fatal lung disease, pulmonary hypertension." [...] In 1994, Wyeth official Fred Wilson expressed concerns about fenfluramine's labeling containing only four cases of pulmonary hypertension when a total of 41 had been observed, but no action was taken until 1996. In 1995, Wyeth introduced dexfenfluramine (the dextro isomer, marketed as Redux), which it hoped would cause fewer adverse effects. However, the medical officer of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Leo Lutwak, insisted upon a black box warning of pulmonary hypertension risks. After Lutwak refused to approve the drug, the FDA management had someone else sign it and approved the drug with no black box warning for marketing in 1996. European regulators required a major warning of pulmonary hypertension risks.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aminorex</b> is a cyclic phenylisopropylamine {{that has}} been marketed as an anorectic. Despite obvious {{pharmacological}} similarities to the amphetamines, {{little is known about}} its liability for abuse. In the present study, one group of rhesus monkeys (n = 3) was prepared with intravenous catheters and allowed to self-administer either methohexital or saline in daily experimental sessions. When methohexital and saline self-administration were stable and clearly different, various doses of <b>aminorex</b> (0. 001 - 0. 1 mg/kg/injection) were made available for self-administration. <b>Aminorex</b> maintained self-administration above that maintained by saline and slightly lower than that maintained by methohexital in all monkeys. The discriminative stimulus effects of <b>aminorex</b> were evaluated in rhesus monkeys trained to discriminate d-amphetamine (n = 3) or pentobarbital (n = 4) from saline. <b>Aminorex</b> substituted completely for d-amphetamine as a discriminative stimulus but engendered little or no pentobarbital-appropriate responding. <b>Aminorex</b> stimulated locomotor activity in mice and exacerbated the withdrawal syndrome in rats that were dependent upon pentobarbital. These findings indicate that <b>aminorex</b> is a psychomotor stimulant that would be predicted to have significant d-amphetamine-like abuse liability in humans...|$|E
40|$|<b>Aminorex</b> (2 -amino- 5 -phenyl- 2 -oxazoline) is an appetite-suppressing drug {{which was}} {{available}} in Switzerland from November 1965 to October 1968.

40|$|Reports of {{pulmonary}} hypertension in obese women {{treated with the}} appetite suppressant <b>aminorex</b> (Menocil) prompted this study using the calf as a model because of its very reactive pulmonary vascular bed.

Four other calves were similarly treated with the related sympathomimetic drug amphetamine in the same dose, and four calves served as controls. The acute effects of both these drugs were {{a significant increase in}} systemic arterial pressure and resistance with no change in pulmonary haemodynamics. The chronic effect of one month's treatment was to leave both systemic and pulmonary haemodynamics unchanged, and there was no depletion in endogenous catecholamines as measured by the tyramine test. In addition, the reactivity of the pulmonary vascular bed to hypoxia remained unaltered.

40|$|AbstractPsychostimulants such as {{amphetamine}} {{and cocaine}} are illicitly used drugs that act on neurotransmitter transporters for dopamine, serotonin or norepinephrine. These drugs can by themselves already cause severe neurotoxicity. However, an additional health threat arises from adulterant substances which {{are added to}} the illicit compound without declaration. One of the most frequently added adulterants in street drugs sold as cocaine is the anthelmintic drug levamisole. We tested the effects of levamisole on neurotransmitter transporters heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells. Levamisole was 100 and 300 -fold less potent than cocaine in blocking norepinephrine and dopamine uptake, and had only very low affinity for the serotonin transporter. In addition, levamisole did not trigger any appreciable substrate efflux. Because levamisole and cocaine are frequently co-administered, we searched for possible allosteric effects; at 30 μM, a concentration at which levamisole displayed already mild effects on norepinephrine transport it did not enhance the inhibitory action of cocaine. Levamisole is metabolized to <b>aminorex,</b> a formerly marketed anorectic drug, which is classified as an amphetamine-like substance. We examined the uptake-inhibitory and efflux-eliciting properties of <b>aminorex</b> and found it to exert strong effects on all three neurotransmitter transporters {{in a manner similar to}} amphetamine. We therefore conclude that while the adulterant levamisole itself has only moderate effects on neurotransmitter transporters, its metabolite <b>aminorex</b> may exert distinct psychostimulant effects by itself. Given that the half-time of levamisole and <b>aminorex</b> exceeds that of cocaine, it may be safe to conclude that after the cocaine effect “fades out” the levamisole/aminorex effect “kicks in”...|$|E
40|$|During {{the second}} half of 2013, a total of 26 deaths {{involving}} para-methyl- 4 -methylaminorex (4, 4 '-DMAR) were reported to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. While <b>aminorex</b> and 4 -methylaminorex (4 -MAR) are known psychostimulants, nothing is known about the comparatively new para-methyl analog. Analytical characterization of two independent samples obtained from online vendors confirmed the presence of the (±) -cis isomer that also appeared to be associated with at least 18 of the 26 deaths. Extensive characterizations included crystal structure analysis, single, tandem, and high-resolution mass spectrometry, liquid and gas chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. For the work described here, both the (±) -cis and (±) -trans racemates were also synthesized, confirming that the differentiation between these two forms was straight-forward. Monoamine transporter activity was studied using rat brain synaptosomes which included the comparison with d-amphetamine, <b>aminorex</b> and (±) -cis- 4 -MAR. (±) -cis- 4, 4 '-DMAR was a potent, efficacious substrate-type releaser at transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin with EC 50 values of 8. 6 [*]±[*] 1. 1 nM (DAT), 26. 9 [*]±[*] 5. 9 nM (NET) and 18. 5 [*]±[*] 2. 8 nM (SERT), respectively. The potency of (±) -cis- 4, 4 ′-DMAR at DAT and NET rivalled that of other psychomotor stimulant drugs like d-amphetamine and <b>aminorex.</b> However, (±) -cis- 4, 4 ′-DMAR had much more potent actions at SERT and activity at SERT varied more than 100 -fold across the four drugs.

40|$|Abstract. Obesity is a {{well-established}} {{risk factor for}} hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, orthopedic disorders, and certain cancers. Despite this risk, the prevalence of obesity continues to increase worldwide, {{and there is a}} growing demand for safe and effective antiobesity drugs. Previous antiobesity drugs or anorexigens, particularly centrally acting agents, have poor safety records. Life-threatening safety issues led to the withdrawal of <b>aminorex</b> in 1968, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine in 1997, and phenylpropanolamine in 2000. Many of the safety issues, such as valvulopathy with fenfluramine and pulmonary arterial hypertension with <b>aminorex,</b> were initially not predicted by routine preclinical toxicology studies. To date, there are no validated animal models or preclinical and/or toxicologic screens to accurately predict anorexigen-induced valvulopathy and pulmonary arterial hypertension in humans. This review covers the current state of antiobesity drugs and their safety concerns, and highlights new therapeutic targets and scientific advances toward the development of appropriate animal models by using novel techniques that will aid in understanding pathogenesis and pathophysiology of anorexigen-related safety issues. Key words: Antiobesity drugs; pulmonary arterial hypertension; safety issues; valvulopathy. Obesity is now widely accepted as a multifacto...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, the {{published}} reports on primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) were confined to clinical pathological correlations. In the 1950 s the physiological aspects began to be reported followed by epidemiologic studies triggered by an epidemic of PPH due to the ingestion of an appetite suppressant, <b>aminorex</b> fumarate. The epidemic prompted a series of meetings of the World Health Organization, which led, in turn, to the creation of the U. S. Registry of Primary Pulmonary Hypertension, standardization of nomenclature, and an etiologic classification of all types of pulmonary hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{established}} that fenfluramine, D-fenfluramine, and <b>aminorex,</b> but not other appetite suppressants, {{increase the risk}} of primary pulmonary hypertension (PH). One current hypothesis suggests that fenfluramine-like medications may act through interactions with the serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine [5 -HT]) transporter (5 -HTT) located on pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and responsible for the mitogenic action of 5 -HT. Anorexigens may contribute to PH by boosting 5 -HT levels in the bloodstream, directly stimulating smooth muscle cell growth, or altering 5 -HTT expression. We suggest that individuals with a high basal level of 5 -HTT expression related to the presence of the long 5 -HTT gene promoter variant may be particularly susceptible to {{one or more of these}} potential mechanisms of appetite-suppressant-related PH. </p...|$|E
40|$|Enantiomeric {{profiling}} of chiral pharmacologically active compounds (PACs) in {{the environment}} has hardly been investigated. This manuscript describes, for the first time, a multi-residue enantioselective method {{for the analysis of}} human and veterinary chiral PACs and their main metabolites from different therapeutic groups in complex environmental samples such as wastewater and river water. Several analytes targeted in this paper have not been analysed {{in the environment}} at enantiomeric level before. These are <b>aminorex,</b> carboxyibuprofen, carprofen, cephalexin, 3 -N-dechloroethylifosfamide, 10, 11 -dihydro- 10 -hydroxycarbamazepine, dihydroketoprofen, fenoprofen, fexofenadine, flurbiprofen, 2 -hydroxyibuprofen, ifosfamide, indoprofen, mandelic acid, 2 -phenylpropionic acid, praziquantel and tetramisole. The method is based on chiral liquid chromatography utilising a chiral α 1 -acid glycoprotein column and tandem mass spectrometry detection. Excellent chromatographic separation of enantiomers (Rs≥ 1. 0) was achieved for chloramphenicol, fexofenadine, ifosfamide, naproxen, tetramisole, ibuprofen and their metabolites: <b>aminorex</b> and dihydroketoprofen (three of four enantiomers), and partial separation (Rs = 0. 7 – 1. 0) was achieved for ketoprofen, praziquantel and the following metabolites: 3 -N-dechloroethylifosfamide and 10, 11 -dihydro- 10 -hydroxycarbamazepine. The overall performance of the method was satisfactory for most of the compounds targeted. Method detection limits were at low nanogram per litre for surface water and effluent wastewater. Method intra-day precision was on average under 20 % and sample pre-concentration using solid phase extraction yielded recoveries > 70 % for most of the analytes. This novel, selective and sensitive method has been applied for the quantification of chiral PACs in surface water and effluent wastewater providing excellent enantioresolution of multicomponent mixtures in complex environmental samples. It will help with better understanding of the role of individual enantiomers in the environment and will enable more accurate environmental risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, obesity has been {{identified}} as an important driver of morbidity and mortality in the western countries. As a result, pharmacological approaches have been developed to fight obesity, including amphetamine-like drugs acting through a central appetite-suppressant effect. These compounds knew a significant marketing and sales success as early as the years 1960. Very soon after market access, caution has been raised on a potential risk for the cardiovascular system with the use of <b>aminorex,</b> leading to a first outbreak of "primary pulmonary hypertension" (PPH) in the European countries were it was available. A decade later, convincing epidemiological evidence accumulated supporting that both fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine were definite risk factor for the development of PPH, now called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In addition, these drugs appeared to be responsible for severe mitral and aortic regurgitations similar to carcinoid syndrome leading to surgery or death. Similar to <b>aminorex,</b> the cases of anorectic-drug induced complications abated after market withdrawal. Despite these serious warnings, the story repeated itself recently when a chemically similar compound called benfluorex, licensed to treat resistant diabetes and dyslipidemia, has been suspected to be responsible for almost identical cardiovascular complications. This is explained in a large part by the effect of norfenfluramine, the active metabolite of benfluorex, through it's high affinity for the serotonin receptor 5 -HT 2 B responsible for the fenfluramine-induced valvular heart diseases. Curiously, benfluorex has only been withdrawn from the French market after more than 20 years of access and six years after the first publication of suspected cases. A good decision? Very likely. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the epidemiological and physiopathological evidence linking fenfluramine-derived drugs to cardiovascular complications, and to discuss the currently available data on benfluorex.

40|$|Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} {{arterial hypertension}} (IPAH) {{used to be called}} primary pulmonary hypertension. Both terms indicate that we do not yet fully understand the aetiology of the disease.

Although they are no longer prescribed, it is important to study them to gain an understanding of IPAH and to ensure that new drugs do not have the potential to cause pulmonary hypertension.

40|$|The {{serotonin}} {{hypothesis of}} {{pulmonary arterial hypertension}} (PAH) arose after an outbreak of PAH in patients taking the anorexigenic drugs <b>aminorex</b> and dexfenfluramine. Both of these drugs are serotonin transporter (SERT) substrates and indirect serotinergic agonists. There is now a wealth of evidence to support a role for serotonin in the pathobiology of PAH. Synthesis of serotonin can occur in pulmonary artery endothelial cells by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH 1). Serotonin then acts at the 5 -HT 1 B receptor and the SERT to mediate constriction and proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Downstream signalling molecules which {{play a role in}} serotonin-induced constriction and proliferation include reactive oxygen species (ROS), Rho-kinase (ROCK) p 38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). There is also evidence to suggest that serotonin may interact with the bone morphogenetic receptor type II (BMPRII) to provide a ‘second hit’ risk factor for PAH...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) {{is characterized by}} a sustained and progressive elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular remodelling leading to right heart failure and death. Prognosis is poor and novel therapeutic approaches are needed. The serotonin hypothesis of PAH originated in the 1960 s after an outbreak of the disease was reported among patients taking the anorexigenic drugs <b>aminorex</b> and fenfluramine. These are indirect serotinergic agonists and serotonin transporter substrates. Since then many advances have been made in our understanding of the role of serotonin in the pathobiology of PAH. The rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of serotonin is tryprophan hydroxylase (Tph). Serotonin is synthesized, through Tph 1, in the endothelial cells of the pulmonary artery and can then act on underlying pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and pulmonary arterial fibroblasts in a paracrine fashion causing constriction and remodelling. These effects of serotonin can be mediated through both the serotonin transporter and serotonin receptors. This review will discuss our current understanding of ‘the serotonin hypothesis' of PAH and highlight possible therapeutic targets within the serotonin system...|$|E
