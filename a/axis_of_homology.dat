A distinction can be drawn between the modern evolutio-nary concept <b>of</b> <b>homology,</b> indicating a common evolutionary origin of morphological traits, genes or proteins and pre-Darwinian concepts <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> (here termed 'classical homology') indicating a common embryonic origin or set of topographical relations shared by morphological traits. 2. Criteria <b>of</b> classical <b>homology</b> are empirically testable. 3. Classical homologies are very useful for the "elucida-tion of taxonomies". 4. The evolutionary concept <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> is not a criterion for classification. This kind <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> is established after taxonomies are "elucidated".

In this study, we compared the frequency of gene targeting with various lengths <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> and found a dramatic increase in targeting with an increase in homology from 1. 3 to 6. 8 kb. We examined in detail the relationship between the length <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> and the gene-targeting frequency for replacement vectors and found that a critical length <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> is needed for targeting. Adding greater lengths <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> to this critical length has less of an effect on the targeting frequency.

40|$|Abstract Homology {{is among}} the most {{important}} comparative concepts in biol-ogy. Today, the evolutionary reinterpretation <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> is usually conceived of as the most important event {{in the development of the}} concept. This paradigmatic turning point, however important for the historical explanation of life, is not of crucial importance for the development of the concept <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> itself. In the broadest sense, homology can be understood as sameness in reference to the uni-versal guarantor so that in this sense the different concepts <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> show a certain kind of ‘‘metahomology’’. This holds in the old morphological conception, as well as in the evolutionary usage <b>of</b> <b>homology.</b> Depending on what is (or was) taken as a guarantor, different types <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> may be distinguished (as ideal-istic, historical, developmental etc.). This study represents a historical overview of the development <b>of</b> the <b>homology</b> concept followed by some clues on how to navigate the pluralistic terminology of modern approaches to homology...|$|R

40|$|We report {{experiments}} {{designed to}} test homology dependence for gene conversion between duplicated chromosomal sequences in cultured mammalian cells. The experimental system {{is such that}} gene conversion events not associated with reciprocal exchange are recoverable. For this study four plasmids were constructed. Each contains a different duplication of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV tk) gene sequence. In particular, the interacting sequences share different lengths <b>of</b> <b>homology.</b> Our results indicate that for shared homologies between 295 base pairs (bp) and 1. 8 kilobase pairs (kbp) in length, conversion is efficient with the rate being directly proportional to the extent <b>of</b> <b>homology.</b> In contrast, conversion with either 200 bp or 95 bp <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> is inefficient, and the rate is reduced at least seven- or 100 -fold, respectively, relative to that observed with 295 bp <b>of</b> <b>homology.</b> These {{results are consistent with}} the notion that greater than 200 bp <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> are required for efficient gene conversion between repeated chromosomal sequences in mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|Homology is a {{biological}} sameness relation that is purported {{to hold in}} the face of changes in form, composition, and function.

40|$|Abstract. Homology is {{a natural}} kind term and a precise account <b>of</b> what <b>homology</b> is has {{to come out of}} {{theories}} about the role of homologues in evolution and development. Definitions <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> are discussed with respect to the question as to whether they are able to give a non-circular account of the correspondence or sameness referred to by homology. It is argued that standard accounts tie homology to operational criteria or specific research projects, but are not yet able to offer a concept <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> that does not presuppose a version <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> or a comparable notion of sameness. This is the case for phylogenetic definitions that trace structures back to the common ancestor as well as for developmental approaches such as Wagner’s biological homology concept. In contrast, molecular homology is able to offer a definition <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> in genes and proteins that explicates homology by reference to more basic notions. Molecular correspondence originates by means of specific features of causal processes. It is speculated that further understanding of morphogenesis might enable biologists to give a theoretically deeper definition <b>of</b> <b>homology</b> along similar lines: an account which makes reference to the concrete mechanisms that operate in organisms...|$|R
