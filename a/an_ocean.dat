5|$|Researchers {{believe that}} much of the low {{northern}} plains of the planet were covered with <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> hundreds of meters deep, though this remains controversial. In March 2015, scientists stated that such <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> might have been the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean. This finding was derived from the ratio of water to deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth. The amount of Martian deuterium is eight times the amount that exists on Earth, suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the Curiosity rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in Gale Crater, though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of <b>an</b> <b>ocean.</b> Other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed, and point out that Martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water.|$|E

5|$|Callisto's {{battered}} surface lies {{on top of}} a cold, stiff, and icy lithosphere that {{is between}} 80 and 150km thick. A salty ocean 150200km deep may lie beneath the crust, indicated by studies of the magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was found that Callisto responds to Jupiter's varying background magnetic field like a perfectly conducting sphere; that is, the field cannot penetrate inside Callisto, suggesting a layer of highly conductive fluid within it with a thickness of at least 10km. The existence of <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> is more likely if water contains a small amount of ammonia or other antifreeze, up to 5% by weight. In this case the water+ice layer can be as thick as 250300km. Failing <b>an</b> <b>ocean,</b> the icy lithosphere may be somewhat thicker, up to about 300km.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be caused by <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> of molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and solid rock.|$|E

5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen. Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than 300 kilometres. The likely presence of <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> within Callisto indicates that it can or could harbour life. However, this is less likely than on nearby Europa. Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|During the Paleozoic era, {{the western}} part of what would become North America was near the equator and on a passive margin. The Cambrian Explosion of life took place over about 15million years {{in this part of the}} world. Climate was warm and invertebrates, such as the trilobites, were abundant. <b>An</b> <b>ocean</b> started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550million years ago.

Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them want to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from succumbing to the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, NASA {{scientists}} first {{suspected that}} Ganymede has <b>a</b> thick <b>ocean</b> between {{two layers of}} ice, one {{on the surface and}} one beneath <b>a</b> liquid <b>ocean</b> and atop the rocky mantle. In the 1990s, NASA's Galileo mission flew by Ganymede, confirming the moon's sub-surface ocean. An analysis published in 2014, taking into account the realistic thermodynamics for water and effects of salt, suggests that Ganymede might have a stack of several ocean layers separated by different phases of ice, with the lowest liquid layer adjacent to the rocky mantle. Water–rock contact may be an important factor in the origin of life. The analysis also notes that the extreme depths involved (~800km to the rocky [...] "seafloor") mean that temperatures at the bottom of <b>a</b> convective (adiabatic) <b>ocean</b> can be up to 40 K higher than those at the ice–water interface. In March 2015, scientists reported that measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope of how the aurorae moved over Ganymede's surface suggest it has <b>a</b> subsurface <b>ocean.</b> <b>A</b> large salt-water <b>ocean</b> affects Ganymede's magnetic field, and consequently, its aurora.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "large, ancient Mediterranean Sea" [...] {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Austrian palaeontologist Melchior Neumayr in 1883. [...] Studying {{the distribution of}} Jurassic faunas, he concluded that <b>an</b> equatorial <b>ocean</b> stretching from India to Central America must have separated a large continent in the northern hemisphere from one in the southern hemisphere. Austrian geologist Eduard Suess named this Mesozoic <b>ocean</b> the Tethys, <b>a</b> mythical <b>ocean</b> which separated <b>a</b> mythical continent - Gondwanaland, home of the tongue-shaped flora - from a boreal continent. German geophysicist Alfred Wegener, in contrast, developed a concept of a single, global continent - the supercontinent Pangea - which, in his view, left no room for <b>an</b> equatorial <b>ocean.</b> <b>A</b> wedge-shaped, east-facing Tethys within Pangea was, nevertheless, proposed by Australian geologist Samuel Warren Carey in 1958. This ocean was later identified as <b>a</b> succession of <b>oceans</b> separated by north-migrating terranes or continental blocks, {{one of which was}} Cimmeria.|$|R

Babcock then undertook <b>an</b> <b>ocean</b> voyage to England and, in Liverpool, he was stationed with the 26th Reserve and sent to Bexhill-on-Sea where he trained with about 1,300 others, about a third of whom were veterans from battles in France.|$|E
