Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that [...] "some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes." [...] Bennett concluded that the film is [...] "neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation." [...] Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the [...] "rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute." [...] Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as [...] "emancipation orgasms" [...] and stated that [...] "it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 that they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to screw their way across the Red Sea. Fucking will not set you free. If fucking freed, black people would have celebrated the millennium 400 years ago." ...|$|E

In addition to that, what we're planning on doing is taking advantage of the overall memory footprint. In Disney Infinity there were certain platforms that were constrained by the amount of RAM, so people couldn't truly build the toy box of their dreams. We've optimized the engine to allow the last-gen, PS3 and 360, to still build compelling Toy Box levels, but with Xbox One and PS4, the sky's the limit."

5000|$|Hole Punch - In {{creeks and}} rivers paddlers {{sometimes}} need to force their boat through a crashing wave or hole. To punch {{through a hole}} the paddler generally tries to find the weakest part in it, or where a seam is evident and they will paddle {{as hard as they}} can towards it. The crucial moment is when the boat is just about, and beginning to hit the hole. At this moment the paddler must keep one blade deep in the water, with their upper hand held high, while they 'punch' it into the wave keeping the active blade in the water. This is because in holes water on the surface is going upstream and water under the surface is flowing down stream. The boater needs to pull on the water beneath the surface if they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to continue down stream without getting stuck in the hole.|$|E

50|$|It is {{believed}} that up to 40% of landfill space is filled with construction waste material. The primary responsibility in selecting materials for the library is to contribute as little waste as possible. Another responsibility is to choose materials that can be produced without causing too much damage to the natural environment. In order to fulfill the first responsibility, post-industrial and post-consumer recycled materials are being used. When purchasing materials claiming to be made from recycled goods {{it is important to}} investigate what their claims mean. It is a common marketing practice to exaggerate how green a product is by using misleading statements. Also, materials should be chosen that <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to be reused or recycled 50-100 years down the road when the library building has reached the end of its useful life (Tseng, 2007).
