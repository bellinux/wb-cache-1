5|$|After plans by WWF {{writers to}} turn the Ultimate Warrior against Savage were {{scrapped}} due to the Warrior's refusal to turn heel, the two were scheduled to face Flair and Ramon at Survivor Series 1992. However, as the Warrior quit the promotion on November 21, his spot was surprisingly offered to Mr. Perfect, who <b>accepted</b> <b>it</b> in spite of Flair, thereby turning face and initiating a feud with Flair which culminated in Flair leaving the WWF in January 1993.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{provided}} many of {{the foundational}} documents for reformed churches, including documents on the catechism, the liturgy, and church governance. He also produced several confessions of faith in order to unite the churches. In 1559, he drafted the French confession of faith, the Gallic Confession, and the synod in Paris <b>accepted</b> <b>it</b> with few changes. The Belgic Confession of 1561, a Dutch confession of faith, was partly based on the Gallic Confession.|$|E

A National Liberal government would repeal the agreement in 1886.|$|E

John Turturro was approached to portray John Laroche. Cooper strongly considered turning down Laroche, but <b>accepted</b> <b>it</b> after his wife urged him to. Albert Finney, Christopher Plummer, Terence Stamp and Michael Caine were considered for the role of Robert McKee, but McKee personally suggested Brian Cox to filmmakers.|$|E

Jobs, who had recently been fired from Apple Computer, paid $5million to George Lucas for technology rights and put them and $5million cash as capital into the company, and joined the board of directors as chairman.|$|E

5|$|After the Khmer Republic {{fell to the}} Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, a {{new regime}} under its charge, Democratic Kampuchea, was formed. Sihanouk was {{appointed}} as its Head of State, a ceremonial position. In September 1975, Sihanouk briefly returned to Cambodia to inter the ashes of his mother, before going abroad again to lobby for diplomatic recognition of Democratic Kampuchea. He returned on 31December 1975 and presided over a meeting to endorse the constitution of Democratic Kampuchea. In February 1976 Khieu Samphan took him on a tour across the Cambodian countryside. Sihanouk {{was shocked to see}} the use of forced labour and population displacement carried out by the Khmer Rouge government, known as the Angkar. Following the tour, Sihanouk decided to resign as the Head of State. The Angkar initially rejected his resignation request, though they subsequently <b>accepted</b> <b>it</b> in mid-April 1976, retroactively backdating it to 2April 1976.|$|E
5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the job. When he <b>accepted</b> <b>it,</b> Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E

This study is a qualitative investigation of adherence to “maternal love” that was treated as a quantitative concept, for example, high, middle and low. The results showed six types of adherence to “maternal love” (Women who accept adherence to “maternal love, <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> but are unable to do so, <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> to themselves, <b>accept</b> part of <b>it</b> and refuse the other part, refuse but practice it, and refuse it) were identified. Four types of them (Women who <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> but are unable to do so, <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> to themselves, <b>accept</b> part of <b>it</b> and refuse the other part, and refuse but practice it) were seemed to be middle group of adherence to “maternal love”, but their narratives were very different. So, it is necessary to investigate not only quantitatively but also qualitatively of adherence to “maternal love”. Then, it must have a qualitative research including mothers’ life-event and life perspectives...|$|R
5|$|At the time, the island's {{population}} {{consisted of}} about two hundred former pirates and several hundred fugitives who had escaped from nearby Spanish colonies. Rogers organised a government, granted the King's Pardon to those former pirates on the island {{who had not yet}} <b>accepted</b> <b>it,</b> and started to rebuild the island's fortifications, which had fallen into decrepitude under pirate domination. However, less than a month into his residence on New Providence, Rogers was faced with a double threat: Vane wrote, threatening to join with Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard) to retake the island, and Rogers learned that the Spanish also planned to drive the British out of the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|David told Scott-James {{that she}} planned to publish the {{articles}} as a book, and was allowed to retain the copyright by the magazine. Even before all the articles had been published, she had assembled them into a typescript volume called A Book of Mediterranean Food; many of the recipes ignored the restrictions of rationing in favour of authenticity, and several cases the ingredients were not available in British shops. David submitted her manuscript {{to a series of}} publishers, all of whom turned it down. One of them explained that a collection of unconnected recipes needed linking text. David took this advice, but conscious of her inexperience as a writer she kept her own prose short and quoted extensively from established authors whose views on the Mediterranean might carry more weight. She submitted the revised typescript to John Lehmann, a publisher more associated with poetry than cookery; he <b>accepted</b> <b>it</b> and agreed to an advance payment of £100. A Book of Mediterranean Food was published in June 1950.|$|E
5|$|Delays in {{shipping}} Spitfires to Australia disrupted No.1 Wing's formation. In late June 1942 the British Government diverted all but six of {{the initial}} 48 aircraft to Egypt to reinforce the three RAF Spitfire squadrons there after the German victory in the Battle of Gazala; most of these aircraft were allocated to No. 92 Squadron RAF with the remainder forming a reserve to replace future losses. The Australian Government protested against this action, but reluctantly <b>accepted</b> <b>it</b> after Churchill refused to counteract the diversion. During the same period, {{the men of the}} three Spitfire squadrons sailed from Liverpool on board the MV Stirling Castle on 21June and disembarked at Melbourne with the six remaining Spitfires on 13August. A shipment of 43 Spitfires left England on 4 August and arrived in Australia in late October, and further deliveries continued to be made until June 1945.|$|E

5|$|During Warwick's exile, King Edward {{stripped}} Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, {{making him}} Marquis of Montagu instead. John Neville {{appears to have}} seen this as a reduction in rank, and <b>accepted</b> <b>it</b> with poor grace. He seems particularly to have complained {{about the lack of}} landed estate that his new marquisate brought with it, calling it a 'pie's nest'. When the Earl of Warwick and Clarence returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops to repress in the king's name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at Olney, Buckinghamshire; the king, with his other brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled into exile in Burgundy.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale about}} a rabbit named Peter {{she had written}} for a child in 1893, and {{prepared}} a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer, she published the book {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and <b>accepted</b> <b>it</b> following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour the pen and ink illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E
5|$|In the 2004 U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign, McCain {{was once again}} frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time {{as part of the}} Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry. McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have <b>accepted</b> <b>it</b> if he had. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, he defended Kerry's Vietnam War record. By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55percent to 19percent) of any national politician; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.|$|E

5|$|Jones was {{selected}} by the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) with the second pick in the 1946 NFL Draft, but did not sign with the team as he pondered returning to LSU to finish his studies. When the Miami Seahawks of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) offered him a $12,000 contract, however, he <b>accepted</b> <b>it</b> and joined the team. The Seahawks won just three games in 1946, the AAFC's first season of play, and Jones was traded along with two other players to the Brooklyn Dodgers, another AAFC team, in December. The Seahawks, meanwhile, folded and were moved to Baltimore after the season because of poor attendance and shaky finances. Jones played sparingly for the Dodgers {{in the last three}} games of the 1946 season, rushing for 62 yards on 19 carries.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May the {{conclave}} unanimously elected Orsini as Pope. He had {{not been}} seen as a serious candidate in past conclaves because he did not have political experience. Orsini was 75 at the time, and it took the cardinals two days to convince him to accept his election. He was recorded to have spent the night before his election sleepless and in tears. Even when the cardinals had taken him into the Sistine Chapel for the formal vote to elect him pope after they had been convinced he would accept, he was still unwilling to accept his own election. Ultimately, he only <b>accepted</b> <b>it</b> after being convinced of it by Agustín Pipia the Master of the Dominican Order, of which he was a member. Upon accepting his election, he attempted to take the name Benedict XIV, which would have recognized Antipope Benedict XIII, the last Avignon Pope during the Western Schism. Lawyers from the Roman Curia eventually persuaded Orisini to take the name Benedict XIII.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 1762, {{as part of}} the Treaty of Fontainebleau, France ceded {{the portion}} of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to Spain.

Although the Louisiana colony was a financial liability, King Carlos III of Spain reluctantly <b>accepted</b> <b>it,</b> as that meant France was finally ceding its claim to Texas. At the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763, Great Britain recognized Spain's right to the lands west of the Mississippi. Great Britain received the remainder of France's North American territories, and Spain exchanged some of their holdings in Florida for Havana.|$|E
