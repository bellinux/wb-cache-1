500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get in that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't give a shit what the critics said. People are gonna like what they like, but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect that I {{have the right to do}} what I do. Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David Fury, while being directed by [...] veteran, Jeff Hunt. It was Hunt's third series credit (his other two being [...] "The Man from the Other Side" [...] and [...] "The Box"). Leading up to the episode's broadcast, executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked {{in a conference call}} with journalists that it was a [...] "game-changer" [...] because [...] "our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the über-plot of the season’s bad guy, David Robert Jones." [...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always said you would find out about the Observers this season <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> investigate them a lot more. We’re excited about it all. That’s a highlight– the Observers are a highlight. For us to constantly break what you know and reset and have people go, 'Wow, I didn’t see that coming!' That’s why we {{get up in the morning}} is to take people along for the ride. We’re excited about what’s coming up, too." ...|$|E

500|$|Cannon first {{played for}} the LSU varsity {{football}} team as a sophomore in 1957 under coach Paul Dietzel. He played in the halfback position and shared the backfield with Jim Taylor, who was selected as an All-American that year. He also played defensive back and was the team's primary punter. He quickly emerged as a star, scoring twice in early season victories over Alabama and Texas Tech. The Alabama game was the most prolific rushing game of Cannon's college career; he amassed 140 yards with eight carries. Against the Red Raiders, Cannon had five punts for a 40-yard average, completed two of four passes for 31 yards, caught a 59-yard pass for a touchdown, carried thirteen times for 36 yards, and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon recalled that Texas Tech's focus was solely on Taylor. [...] "They were just wearing Jimmy out", he said. [...] "Of course, they weren't looking for me. They just beat the devil out of Jimmy. With them focusing on Jimmy, I had a great game." [...] Over half a century later, former Red Raiders standout Jack Henry recalled of Cannon:"We kicked off. And that damn Billy Cannon. Jim Henderson and I were running down in our lanes and got down there, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hit him high and low. We were going to knock {{the hell out of}} him... We hit ourselves. Ran into each other. He made a 100-yard touchdown. You don't forget that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although not a {{tropical}} cyclone, the storm brought back memories of Cyclone Aila, which killed 155 {{people in the}} same area in May 2009. One eyewitness described the storm: [...] "It was all dark. I thought {{it was the end of}} the world <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die." [...] Locals received no warning of the impending storm, and were mostly sleeping when the storm hit, increasing the casualties. Out-dated equipment with limited capabilities was blamed for the lack of warnings.|$|E

[...] "We were living solely off of Owsley's good graces at that time. ... trip was he wanted to design equipment for us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to be in sort of a lab situation for him to do it," [...] said Garcia.|$|E
2500|$|Funspot {{was named}} [...] "World's Largest Arcade" [...] by Guinness World Records in 2008. The American Classic Arcade Museum alone {{has more than}} 300 pre-1988 video games and pinball machines. In 2009, the outdoor minigolf course was almost torn out, and a {{restaurant}} put in its place, but it was saved due to its historical value. Bob Lawton said, [...] "When we opened it in 1964, {{we were the only}} ones in the Lakes Region that had minigolf, but then several opened up. Last year, we decided we wouldn't close it <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep it. It's historic; the buildings are fantastic." [...] There is currently an empty lot next to the outdoor minigolf course where Funspot has been talking to hotel chains such as Best Western, Hilton, and Marriott, about the possibility of building a hotel.|$|E

In response, Kool A.D. tweeted that {{he had left the}} band two months prior but had been keeping his departure under wraps. The breakup came after they had signed a record deal and were to release a [...] "proper album", followed by a tour. Dapwell told Spin, “We had a plan to break up around May. We had just signed this record deal <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> put out one proper album and then go on a farewell tour, release a proper breaking up statement that could have been really funny, maybe a weird, stupid video.

What a perfect time for us to say we are going to save your entire country, we are going to lend you billions of dollars and shore up your economy, but you know what, since that meeting with President Clinton we now have on record over 3,000 murders and fugitives down there and {{we do not know how}} many kids".|$|E

60|$|We {{returned}} to Middelburg by {{an entirely different}} route from that by which we came. Leaving {{the valley of the}} Olifants to our right, we trekked along the high-veldt, and thus avoided all the fever country. Roughly speaking, we had about 120 miles of country to get over to reach Middelburg, and we determined to do this in three days and two nights, so as {{to get in on the}} Saturday night, as we were much pressed for time. Now, according to English ideas, it is no great thing to travel 120 miles in three days; but it is six days' journey in an ox-waggon over bad country, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it in half that time by doubling the speed.|$|E
