From a simulation study on how cosine effect varies with latitude, declination <b>angle,</b> <b>hour</b> angle, and tan μ (the ratio of the receiver height and the distance from mirror position to the receiver position for the receiver/mirror configuration of the CL system), {{it was found that}} the cosine factor of CL system increases with an increase in the latitude. The higher cosine factor with around 0. 95 in winter months is obtained by CL system even at high latitudes. The CL system can eliminate the end loss and increase the optical efficiency compared to Trough and LFR (Linear Fresnel Reflector system). This seems to solve the problems in the concentration systems of Trough and LFR; the lower concentration efficiency (lower cosine factor) in the winter months. In addition, a higher temperature around 650 °C can be obtained with the CL system, due to the high concentration degree of CL solar reflection method. Thus, the CL system can achieve both high concentration temperature and high collection efficiency in both winter and summer seasons, even at high latitudes. Therefore the CL system seems to be the only CSP system suitable for the CSP-sites at high latitudes such as Mongolia (outer and inner), southern areas of Spain and Australia, and northern area of India. Due to the promising CL system, a joint collaboration between Japanese and Indian industries, institutes and universities has been launched to build solar plant based on CL technology. Also, the CL system also seems to be applicable for the CPV, because the coma tic aberration is very small during 9 am to 3 pm during the sunlight duration...|$|E

50|$|In astronomy, <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> {{is defined}} as the angular {{distance}} on the celestial sphere measured westward along the celestial equator from the meridian to the hour circle passing through a point. It may be given in degrees, time, or rotations depending on the application.In celestial navigation, the convention is to measure in degrees westward from the prime meridian (Greenwich <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> GHA), from the local meridian (local <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> LHA) or from the first point of Aries (sidereal <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> SHA).|$|R

When calculating topocentric phenomena, right ascension may be converted into <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> as an intermediate step.|$|R
50|$|Sidereal <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> used in {{celestial}} navigation, {{is similar}} to right ascension, but increases westward rather than eastward.

50|$|Observing the sun from earth, {{the solar}} <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is an {{expression}} of time, expressed in angular measurement, usually degrees, from solar noon.

40|$|Sun {{observations}} {{provide a}} robust way {{for determining the}} geodetic or true azimuth at a location. Azimuth is generally defined as the angle in the plane measured from the meridian’s north (or south) {{to the location of}} the line of interest. It is common to use the north azimuth; also referred to as “azimuth”, especially in civilian surveying applications. The astronomic meridian is obtained through astronomic observations of the Sun or North Star (Polaris) and it is important since it provides one instance of the geodetic or true meridian. There are two methods for determining the sun azimuth; the first is known as the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> method and the other is called the altitude method. The <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> method requires the determination of accurate time while altitude method requires accurate vertical <b>angle.</b> The <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> method is more popular because it is more accurate, can be performed at any time of day and is applicable to the sun, Polaris and other stars. In this article, an error modeling framework for the errors result in the process of determining the sun azimuth using the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> method; namely random errors, is presented. A Gauss-Markov model is used to represent the errors in the true azimuth estimation process. Six sets of sun observation for azimuth data; three with telescope direct and three reverse, including horizontal circle’s readings and time were collected and used in order to estimate the true azimuth of a line in a study area in central Orlando, Florida, United States...|$|R
