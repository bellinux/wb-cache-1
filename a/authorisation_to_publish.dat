(M106) Bismarck had hurried from Varzin to Berlin on July 12, in {{profound}} concern lest {{his royal}} master should subject {{his country and}} his minister to what, after the menace of Gramont and Ollivier on July 6, would be grave diplomatic defeat. He had resolved to retire if the incident should end in this shape, and the chief actor has himself described the strange sinister scene that averted his design. He invited Moltke and Roon to dine with him alone on July 13. In the midst of their conversation, “I was informed,” he says, “that a telegram from Ems in cipher, if I recollect rightly, of about 200 ‘groups’ was being deciphered. When the copy was handed me it showed that Abeken had drawn up and signed the telegram at his Majesty’s command, and I read it out to my guests, whose dejection {{was so great that}} they turned away from food and drink. On a repeated examination of the document I lingered upon the authorisation of his Majesty, which included a command, immediately to communicate Benedetti’s fresh demand and its rejection to our ambassadors and to the press. I put a few questions to Moltke as to the extent of his confidence in the state of our preparations, especially as to the time they would still require in order to meet this sudden risk of war. He answered that if there was to be war he expected no advantage to us by deferring its outbreak.... Under the conviction that war could be avoided only at the cost of the honour of Prussia, I made use of the royal <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> the contents of the telegram; and in the presence of my two guests I reduced the telegram by striking out words, but without adding or altering, to the following form: ‘After the news of the renunciation of the hereditary Prince of Hohenzollern had been officially communicated to the imperial government of France by the royal government of Spain, the French ambassador at Ems further demanded of his Majesty the King that he would authorise him to telegraph to Paris that his Majesty the King bound himself for all future time never again to give his consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. His Majesty the King thereupon decided not to receive the French ambassador again, and sent to tell him through the aide-de-camp on duty that his Majesty had nothing further to communicate to the ambassador.’ The difference in the effect of the abbreviated text of the Ems telegram, as compared with that produced by the original, was not the result of stronger words but of the form, which made this announcement appear decisive, while Abeken’s version would only have been regarded as a fragment of a negotiation still pending and to be continued at Berlin. After I had read out the concentrated edition to my two guests, Moltke remarked: ‘Now it has a different ring; it sounded before like a parley; now it is like a flourish in answer to a challenge.’ I went on to explain: ‘If in execution of his Majesty’s order I at once communicate this text, which contains no alteration in or addition to the telegram, not only to the newspapers, but also by telegraph to all our embassies, it will be known in Paris before midnight, and not only an account of its contents, but also an account of the manner of its distribution, will have the effect of a red rag upon the Gallic bull. Fight we must, if {{we do not want to}} act the part of the vanquished without a battle. Success, however, essentially depends upon the impression which the origination of the war makes upon us and others; it is important that we should be the party attacked, and that we fearlessly meet the public threats of France.’ This explanation brought about in the two generals a revulsion to a more joyous mood, the liveliness of which surprised me. They had suddenly recovered their pleasure in eating and drinking, and spoke in a more cheerful vein. Roon said: ‘Our God of old lives still, and will not let us perish in disgrace.’ ”(211) ...|$|E

5000|$|Governor Somerset's {{banning of}} the paper, {{only a few}} months after its founding, {{followed}} on his earlier decree that The South African Commercial Advertiser would have to submit to censorship before printing and distribution. In March 1824 Pringle had printed details of a libel suit against a Cape solicitor, William Edwards, who had accused the Governor of abuse of his powers. The autocratic Somerset also ordered Greig to deposit 10 000 Rixdollars with the Fiscal as security in case he should publish anything unacceptable. In the face of the government pressure, Pringle resigned later in 1824, and left the country to return to Britain. However Fairbairn and Greig continued the struggle. Greig sailed to England and obtained <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> free from Colonial Government censorship, resuming publication on 31 August 1825. Ordinance 60 of 1829 finally guaranteed freedom of the Cape press.|$|E
50|$|Soon after {{establishing}} The Far East, {{and while}} maintaining the Japan Gazette, Black worked to launch a Japanese-language newspaper. He received little support in this endeavour from other residents of the foreign settlement, but convinced {{of the need for}} a high quality newspaper published in Japanese, {{and with the help of}} F. da Rosa, a Portuguese friend knowledgeable in Japanese and management, he founded Nisshin Shinjishi (日新真事誌) with the permission of the government and the services of a Japanese editor. The first issue appeared on 23 April 1872. The same year Black received <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> articles on government policy and the proceedings of the Daijō-kan (太政官), or Council of State. Black openly advocated political reforms, including free speech and greater democracy, and as he became increasingly influential the government manoeuvred to silence him, at the same time carefully avoiding any controversy with British officials. In 1874 the government offered Black the important post of foreign advisor to the Administrative Section of the Sa-in (左院), a chamber of the Daijō-kan, but only on condition that he resign from the Nisshin Shinjishi. He accepted the condition and the position. The following year new laws were introduced forbidding criticism of the government and excluding foreigners from editing Japanese-language newspapers. One week after the laws were implemented, Black was transferred to a lesser position in the Translation Bureau, and soon thereafter he was dismissed. In spite of the Press Regulations, Black launched another newspaper, the Bankoku Shimbun (万国新聞). The government persuaded the British Minister, Harry Parkes, to intervene, which he did, issuing a prohibition against British citizens publishing Japanese-language newspapers. Black fought the prohibition at the courts in London, but was unsuccessful, and soon left Japan, settling in Shanghai.|$|E
