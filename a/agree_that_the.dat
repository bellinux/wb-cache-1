5|$|The {{work has}} been praised by critics {{including}} the poet and Beowulf translator Seamus Heaney. Michael D. C. Drout called it the most important article ever written about the poem.

5|$|Although many Pakistanis {{were silent}} about the {{operation}} against Lal Masjid, most {{agreed with the}} government's decision {{to use force to}} retake the complex. While hardliners have been able to stir up anger every time Musharraf moves against militants, most people have been tolerant and oppose the militants desire to impose their interpretation of Islamic law. Most residents of Islamabad <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> raid restored local peace, despite fears of retaliation.|$|E

5|$|In a 2002 {{review in}} The New York Times, film critic Dave Kehr compares the film with Stella Dallas (1937) for the {{thematic}} similarity {{of the series}} of sacrifices made by the female lead, and with Gone with the Wind (1939) as an epic mirroring social upheavals. Film critic Mark Cousins and author Tejaswini Ganti <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film is the Gone with the Wind of Indian cinema.|$|E
5|$|Most Polish historians <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Polish {{capitulation}} was {{a mistake}} both from the military perspective, and the political one. In the realm of military, the Poles had reasonable chances to defend the Vistula river line, and exhaust the Russian invading forces. From the political one, showing willingness to fight could have persuaded the partitioning powers that their plan was too costly.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, the Republic of China (Taiwan) {{has been}} {{excluded}} from the UN and since then has always been rejected in new applications. Citizens of this country are also not allowed to enter the buildings of the United Nations with the passport of Taiwan. In this way, critics <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> UN is failing its own development goals and guidelines. This criticism also brought pressure from the People's Republic of China, which regards the territories administered by Taiwan as their own territory.|$|E

5|$|These geopolitical {{calculations}} were debated {{and discussed}} in the following years. Historians <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British believed that expressing support would appeal to Jews in Germany and the United States, given two of Woodrow Wilson's closest advisors {{were known to be}} avid Zionists; they also hoped to encourage support from the large Jewish population in Russia. In addition, the British intended to pre-empt the expected French pressure for an international administration in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Although the French and the Austrians claimed {{victory at}} the time, {{military}} historians generally <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Austrians achieved a strategic advantage. However, the French withdrew from the battlefield in good order and several days later crossed the Rhine River at Hüningen. A confusion of politics and diplomacy in Vienna wasted any strategic advantage that Charles might have obtained and locked the Habsburg force into two sieges on the Rhine, when the troops were badly needed in northern Italy. The battle is commemorated on a monument in Vienna and on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{preparation}} of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly {{dates back to the}} 1700s, historians and drink experts <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cocktail as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail {{in the latter part of}} the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Hawaiian {{religious}} practice {{holds that the}} five volcanic peaks of the island are sacred, and regards Mauna Loa, the largest of them all, with great admiration; but what mythology survives today consists mainly of oral accounts from the 18th century first compiled in the 19th. Most of these stories <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian volcano deity, Pele, resides in Halemaʻumaʻu Crater on Kilauea; however a few place her home at Mauna Loa's summit caldera Mokuʻāweoweo, and the mythos in general associates her with all volcanic activity on the island. Regardless, Kīlauea's lack of a geographic outline and strong volcanic link to Mauna Loa led to it being considered an offshoot of Mauna Loa by the Ancient Hawaiians, meaning much of the mythos now associated with Kīlauea was originally directed at Mauna Loa proper as well.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand ordered 400 men {{to enter}} the saps; these men would storm the castle once the mine had been detonated. The {{remainder}} of his cavalry and foot soldiers were {{to wait in the}} fields below. Some sources assert that the fuse was lit at around 1:00 pm, although the 19th-century local historian Heinrich Joseph Floß argued that these sources are mistaken, and that the explosion clearly occurred in the morning. All sources <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> explosion, with a dreadful crack, propelled chunks of the towers and walls high into the air. Almost half the Godesburg collapsed instantly. According to a newspaper report dated 13 January 1584, debris raining on the valley below damaged several houses, and destroyed some of them completely.|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, Creswell, while {{referring}} to the Aphrodito Papyri, claims that Abd al-Malik's son, al-Walid I, reconstructed the Aqsa Mosque {{over a period of}} six months to a year, using workers from Damascus. Most scholars <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mosque's reconstruction was started by Abd al-Malik, but that al-Walid oversaw its completion. In 713–14, a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem, destroying the eastern section of the mosque, which was subsequently rebuilt during al-Walid's rule. In order to finance its reconstruction, al-Walid had gold from the dome of the Rock minted to use as money to purchase the material. The Umayyad-built al-Aqsa Mosque most likely measured 112 x 39 meters.|$|E
5|$|In early November, MacArthur's {{plan for}} a westward advance {{along the coast of}} New Guinea to the Philippines was {{incorporated}} into plans for the war against Japan. Three months later, airmen reported no signs of enemy activity in the Admiralty Islands. Although Willoughby did not <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> islands had been evacuated, MacArthur ordered an amphibious landing there, commencing the Admiralty Islands campaign. He accompanied the assault force aboard the light cruiser , the flagship of Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, the new commander of the Seventh Fleet, and came ashore seven hours after the first wave of landing craft, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star. It took six weeks of fierce fighting before the 1st Cavalry Division captured the islands.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Homer threatens Bart to win {{no matter}} what. In an {{extremely}} close match, Bart and Todd each do well, and tie by the time they reach the eighteenth hole. Bart and Todd <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> competition is not worth the stress, that they are equally good and that they should call it a draw, splitting the award evenly. As a result, Ned and Homer are forced to wear their respective wives' Sunday dresses and mow each other's lawn. People around the neighborhood laugh at them and Ned actually enjoys it (commenting that it reminds him of his fraternity days in college), much to Homer's dismay.|$|E

To some extent, respondents <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> temperature during <b>the</b> cold dry season (CDS) showed an increase in the past few decades. However, no significance difference was observed between the two study districts as a result of difference in the degree and frequency of development interventions.|$|R
