5|$|Alexander made a {{cautious}} and slow advance, intending to base his strategy {{on the structure}} of the Persian force. He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit. <b>Aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of the foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.|$|E

In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the Raychaudhuri equation, and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of energy conditions) are used to derive general results.|$|E
5|$|After the {{parachute}} brigade withdrew, the Axis forces {{gathered at the}} bridge. They now comprised the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the Arditi Battalion, with the German 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion and Captain Stangenberg's Battle group. The German High Command was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of holding the bridge, and overnight they dispatched reinforcements who arrived by parachute. These came from the 1st Fallschirmjäger Division, and consisted of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion, the 1st Battalion, 4th Fallschirmjäger Regiment and a battalion of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Artillery Regiment. The Fallschirmjäger engineers started to form a defensive line {{to the north of}} the bridge, and a smaller one on the southern bank.|$|E

Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann. Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays {{in the same way as}} uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} geneticist Sewall Wright {{focused on}} combinations of genes that interacted as complexes, {{and the effects}} of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations, which could exhibit genetic drift. In a 1932 paper, he introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which would in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks. Wright's model would appeal to field naturalists such as Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr who were becoming <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of geographical isolation in real world populations. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright helped to found the discipline of theoretical population genetics.|$|E
25|$|When Pottinger left Hong Kong on 13 June {{to rejoin}} the expedition, Johnston was again left in charge and was told not to grant land except for barracks and the troops' {{families}} who began to arrive from Britain. In October 1842, he informed Pottinger of the crime and disorder in the colony. Piracy was frequent and isolated houses were attacked, often by gangs who landed from boats. The jail was full, but Johnston said he lacked the authority to impose sentences on the inmates awaiting trial. Such conditions helped the Colonial Office be <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of establishing full control of law and order, and the danger of allowing the Chinese to share this responsibility. On 2 December, Pottinger returned from the north, and Johnston remained Deputy Superintendent of Trade, which was changed in 1843 to the Assistant and Registrar to the Superintendent of Trade. After Pottinger became the first Governor of Hong Kong on 26 June 1843, he appointed Johnston {{as a member of}} the Executive and Legislative Councils on 21 August.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Simpson {{wrote that}} the {{inability}} of the British artillery adequately to respond to the changes of German tactics may have been caused by the supply difficulties in October, when the gunners lacked the ammunition to extend creeping barrages {{all the way to the}} far side of German defences. Guns were worn out, ammunition had three types of propellant with inconsistent characteristics, all the ammunition was damp and corrections for atmospheric conditions were insufficient to regain accuracy, without observation of targets or information on the fall of shot from artillery-observation aircraft. In 2001, Simpson described the process of forming plans by the Fourth Army headquarters to be one of consultation and negotiation with corps commanders, provided that decisions were compatible with the corps artillery plan, which was derived from the army plan. Corps then set boundaries and let divisional commanders have discretion within them. By October corps headquarters were <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of passing information from contact-patrol aircraft and other sources forward to divisions, the corps headquarters developing into information clearing-houses by the end of the battle.|$|E

[...] The harbor was vital to the British, as the Royal Navy, at first under Admiral Samuel Graves, and later under Admiral Molyneux Shuldham, provided protection for the troops in Boston, as well as transportation of supplies to the besieged city. [...] Early in the siege, on June 15, the British agreed on the plan of seizing both of these heights, beginning with those in Dorchester, which had {{a better view of}} the harbor than the Charlestown hills.

500|$|Eadbald's {{influence}} over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms {{was less than}} Æthelberht's. Eadbald's reduced power is apparent in his inability to restore Mellitus to the see of London: in Bede's words, his authority in Essex [...] "was not so effective as that of his father". However, Kentish power was still sufficient to make alliance with Eadbald's relatives attractive to other kingdoms. Edwin's marriage to Eadbald's sister, Æthelburg, was probably also motivated {{by a desire to}} gain better access to communications with the continent. The relationship would have been valuable to Eadbald, too; it may have been {{as a result of this}} alliance that Edwin's overlordship of Britain did not include Kent. Another factor in Edwin's treatment of Kent may have been the location of the archbishopric in Canterbury: Edwin was well <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of Canterbury's metropolitan status, and at one time planned to make York an archbishopric too, with Paulinus as the planned first incumbent. Paulinus eventually returned to Kent, where at Eadbald's and Archbishop Honorius's request he became bishop of Rochester, and York was not made an archbishopric for another century. Within a year of Edwin's death in 633 or 634, Oswald took the throne of Northumbria, and it seems likely that his relations with Eadbald were modelled on Edwin's. Oswald's successor, Oswiu, married Eanflæd, who was Edwin's daughter and Eadbald's niece, thereby gaining both Deiran and Kentish connections.|$|E
