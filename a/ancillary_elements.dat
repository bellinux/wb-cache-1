40|$|Although key genetic {{regulators}} {{of early}} meiotic transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{have been well}} characterized, the activation of meiotic genes is still poorly {{understood in terms of}} cis-acting DNA elements and their associated factors. I report here that induction of HSP 82 is regulated by the early meiotic IME 1 -IME 2 transcriptional cascade. Vegetative repression and meiotic induction depend on interactions of the promoter-proximal heat shock element (HSE) with a nearby bipartite repression element, composed of the ubiquitous early meiotic motif, URS 1 (upstream repression sequence 1), and a novel <b>ancillary</b> repression <b>element.</b> The <b>ancillary</b> repression <b>element</b> is required for efficient vegetative repression, is spatially separable from URS 1, and continues to facilitate repression during sporulation. In contrast, URS 1 also functions as a vegetative repression element but is converted early in meiosis into an HSE-dependent activation element. An early step in this transformation may be the antagonism of URS 1 -mediated repression by IME 1. The HSE also nonspecifically supports a second major mode of meiotic activation that does not require URS 1 but does require expression of IME 2 and concurrent starvation. Interestingly, increased rather than decreased URS 1 -mediated vegetative transcription can be artificially achieved by introducing rare point mutations into URS 1 or by deleting the UME 6 gene. These lesions offer insight into mechanisms of URS-dependent repression and activation. Experiments suggest that URS 1 -bound factors functionally modulate heat shock factor during vegetative transcription and early meiotic induction but not during heat shock. The loss of repression and activation observed when the IME 2 activation element, T 4 C, is substituted for the HSE suggests specific requirements for URS 1 -upstream activation sequence interactions...|$|R

50|$|Despite the name, {{the scene}} is symbolic, {{and there is no}} {{evidence}} that patrons of the Roman cult ever performed such a rite. Like all Greco-Roman mysteries, the Mithraic Mysteries was limited to initiates, and there is very little known about the cult's beliefs or practices. However, several images of the bull include a dorsuale ribbon or blanket, which was a Roman convention to identify a sacrificial animal, so it is fairly certain that the killing of the bull represents a sacrificial act. And, because the main bull-killing scene is often accompanied by explicit depictions of the sun, moon, and stars, it is also fairly certain that the scene has astrological connotations. But despite dozens of theories on the subject, none has received widespread acceptance. While the basic bull-killing image appears to have been adopted from a similar depiction of Nike, and it is certain that the bull-killing symbolism and the <b>ancillary</b> <b>elements</b> together tell a story (i.e. the cult myth, the cult's mystery, told only to initiates), that story has been lost and is now unknown.

In some cases, this is a natural consequence of the nonspecific nature of the reaction pattern due to matters of sampling error and/or lesional evolution. Further, some conditions are so synonymous in their histologic presentation that to choose one without mention of the other, purely on a histologic basis, may serve to inadvertently mislead the clinician. Despite the often significant histologic overlap amongst the varying spongiotic dermatitides, there are many subtle, yet detectable, features that may serve as clues to the pathogenetic process.

40|$|Background: A {{remarkable}} {{series of}} recent papers {{have shown that}} colour can influence performance in cognitive tasks. In particular, they suggest that viewing a participant number printed in red ink or other red <b>ancillary</b> stimulus <b>elements</b> improves performance in tasks requiring local processing and impedes performance in tasks requiring global processing whilst {{the reverse is true}} for the colour blue. The tasks in these experiments require high level cognitive processing such as analogy solving or remote association tests and the chromatic effect on local vs. global processing is presumed to involve widespread activation of the autonomic nervous system. If this is the case, we might expect to see similar effects on all local vs. global task comparisons. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether chromatic cues also influence performance in tasks involving low level visual feature integration. Methods: Subjects performed either local (contrast detection) or global (form detection) tasks on achromatic dynamic Glass pattern stimuli. Coloured instructions, target frames and fixation points were used to attempt to bias performance to different task types. Based on previous literature, we hypothesised that red cues would improve performance in the (local) contrast detection task but would impede performance in the (global) form detection task.   Results: A two-way, repeated measures, analysis of covariance (2 × 2 ANCOVA) with gender as a covariate, revealed no influence of colour on either task, F(1, 29) = 0. 289, p = 0. 595, partial η 2 = 0. 002. Additional analysis revealed no significant differences in only the first attempts of the tasks or in the improvement in performance between trials. Discussion: We conclude that motivational processes elicited by colour perception do not influence neuronal signal processing in the early visual system, in stark contrast to their putative effects on processing in higher areas...|$|R

40|$|The diffuse chemosensory system (DCS) of the {{respiratory}} apparatus {{is composed of}} solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) that resemble taste cells but are not organized in end organs.

Here we investigated {{the presence of the}} DCS and of SCCs in cows and bulls (Bos taurus), in which the airway cytology is similar to that in humans, focusing our attention on detection in the airways of molecules involved in the transduction cascade of taste [i. e. α-gustducin and phospholipase C of the β 2 subtype (PLCβ 2) ]. The aim of the research was to extend our understanding of airway chemoreceptors and to compare the organization of the DCS in a large mammal with that in rodents. Using immunocytochemistry for α-gustducin, the taste buds of the tongue and arytenoid were visualized. In the trachea and bronchi, α-gustducin-immunoreactive SCCs were frequently found. Using immunocytochemistry for PLCβ 2, the staining pattern was generally similar to those seen for α-gustducin. Immunoblotting confirmed the expression of α-gustducin in the tongue and in all the airway regions tested. The study demonstrated the presence of SCCs in cows and bulls, suggesting that DCSs are present in many mammalian species.

40|$|Replication of the Epstein-Barr {{virus genome}} initiates {{at one of}} several sites in latently infected, {{dividing}} cells. One of these replication origins {{is close to the}} viral DNA maintenance element, and, together, this replication origin and the maintenance element are referred to as oriP. The replicator of oriP contains four binding sites for Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA- 1), the sole viral protein required for the replication and maintenance of oriP plasmids. We showed previously that these EBNA- 1 sites function in pairs and that mutational inactivation of one pair does not eliminate replicator function. In this study we characterized the contribution of each EBNA- 1 site within the replicator and flanking sequences through the use of an internally controlled replication assay. We present evidence that shows that all four EBNA- 1 sites are required for an oriP plasmid to be replicated in every cell cycle. Results from these experiments also show that the paired EBNA- 1 binding sites are not functionally equivalent and that the low affinity of sites 2 and 3 compared to that of sites 1 and 4 is not essential for replicator function. Our results suggest that a host cell protein(s) binds sequences flanking the EBNA- 1 sites and that interactions between EBNA- 1 and this protein(s) are critical for replicator function. Finally, we present evidence that shows that the minimal replicator of oriP consists of EBNA- 1 sites 3 and 4 and two copies of a 14 -bp repeat that is present in inverse orientation flanking these EBNA- 1 sites.

40|$|Four {{prominent}} portraitists {{were active}} in New York City between 1790 and 1825 : Gilbert Stuart, John Vanderlyn, John Trumbull, and John Wesley Jarvis. Despite working in the same geographic location, these four artists received different artistic training, developed distinct aesthetics, and often worked for distinct groups of patrons. Upon returning to the United States in 1793 Stuart quickly established himself as the preeminent portraitist in New York City. This coincided with a moment of particular political harmony in the United States, a harmony that was broken by the vitriolic debates over the ratification of the Jay Treaty in 1795. Although Vanderlyn briefly studied with Stuart, Vanderlyn received most of his training in Paris in the studio of Vincent, a prominent French neoclassicist. When Vanderlyn returned to New York City, Democratic-Republicans [...] politicians who wished to tie the diplomatic future of the United States to France [...] quickly embraced Vanderlyn's decidedly French aesthetic. This artistic style is characterized by an emphasis on linearity, a muted use of color, and compositions in which the artist places compositional focus on the sitter rather than objects around him. Conversely, Federalists who wished to further tie America to Great Britain preferred Trumbull and his English style: the energetic brushstrokes, colorful palette, and compositions that often contained <b>ancillary</b> <b>elements</b> that allude to the sitter's occupation, education, and wealth. In contrast to both Vanderlyn and Trumbull, Jarvis did not received European training.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{acknowledged}} that syntactic violations in poetry {{are central to the}} difficulty of a poetic text (e. g. Fowler 1971, Fois-Kaschel 2002, Burke 2007, Thoms 2008). However, for all its merits, most of the work carried out so far tends either to be more concerned with linguistic theory than with literary effects (i. e. the generativist tradition); or, conversely, it treats syntactic violations as <b>ancillary</b> <b>elements</b> of broader contextual concerns (i. e. literary criticism). It should be the business of stylistics to map the uncharted territory in between these two approaches, explaining syntactic effects at a textual level. Yet, when it comes to syntax, most work in stylistics confines itself to a few canonical authors (notably Dylan Thomas and E. E. Cummings) whilst ignoring later developments of experimental writing (e. g. John Ashbery, Susan Howe, Charles Bernstein). The present paper aims to widen the purview of poetic texts open to stylistic scrutiny as well as to make subtler predictions regarding the relationship between types of syntactic phenomena and resulting literary and processing effects. In particular, I show how different stylistic strategies (e. g. the blurring of constituency, syntactic ambiguity, the avoidance of main verbs) lead to very differentreaderly responses. My main case study is Susan Howe’s experimental poetry, whose ‘incomplete statements’ (Middleton 2010 : 637) and ‘asyntactic writing’ (Quartermain 1992 : 184) have called for extensive critical commentaries. I analyse the blurring of word classes and functions in a poem from the collection Bed Hangings (2001), leading to multiple garden paths and to a posited reading that de-emphasizes syntactic relations in favour of a coarse semantic processing guided by freestanding nouns and adjectives. I conclude by showing empirically that these parsing difficulties are reflected in reading times that are much longer than those for other poems with more moderate syntactic disruptions...|$|E
40|$|The {{exchange}} of waters between the Pacific and the Southern Oceans occurs {{along the eastern}} boundary of the South Pacific. Because water masses of the Antarctic provide a connection among the world’s ocean basins, these water masses maintain the ability to influence changes in ocean circulation and climate (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1996). One of the primary goals of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 202 was to exploit the sediments underlying the southeast Pacific continental margin to ascertain how changes in past ocean circulation (i. e., water mass distributions) have affected global carbon, heat, and nutrient balances. In the southeast Pacific, oxygen-rich Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) combines with (low oxygen) North Pacific Intermediate Water to produce a steep water column–dissolved oxygen gradient between depths of 0. 5 and 1 km. Shallower in the water column, the classical oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) impinges along the continental margin. These different water masses thus produce a “double” OMZ, with lowoxygen waters straddling the oxygen-rich AAIW. Given this distribution, changes in the intensity of water mass source functions through time should leave behind a depth transect of changing proxy distributions in response to changing bottom water oxygen concentrations. Sediments at Site 1233 are bathed by AAIW at a water depth of 838 m, whereas Pacific Central Water bathes the overlying waters at Site 1234. Site 1234 is located north of Site 1233 at 1015 -m water depth. Because of rapid erosion of the high Andes, terrigenous sedimentation rates at these sites {{are in the range}} of 1 – 2 m/k. y. To assess changes in the reducing nature of these sediments through time, a number of geochemical indicators were determined. The solubility of uranium, molybdenum, cadmium, and vanadium decreases under the reducing conditions common along the continental margin seafloor; thus changes in their distribution may signify changes in the reducing character of the surface sediment. A number of other, primarily <b>ancillary,</b> <b>elements</b> were also measured. Most of these elements are used to assess terrigenous inputs...|$|E
40|$|The main {{emphasis}} {{of my work}} as a PhD student was the analysis and prediction of nucleosome positioning, focusing on the role sequence features play. Part I gives a broad overview of nucleosomes, before defining important technical terms. It continues by describing and reviewing experiments that measure nucleosome positioning and bioinformatic methods that learn the sequence preferences of nucleosomes to predict their positioning. Part II describes a collaboration project with the Gaul-lab, where I analyzed MNase-Seq measurements of nucleosomes in Drosophila. The original intention {{was to investigate the}} extent to which experimental biases influence the measurements. We extended the analysis to categorize and explore fragile, average and resistant nucleosome populations. I focused on the relation between nucleosome fragility and the sequence landscape, especially at promoters and enhancers. Analyzing the partial unwrapping of nucleosomes genome-wide, I found that the G+C ratio is a determinant of asymmetric unwrapping. I excluded an analysis of histone modifications from this work, which was part of this collaboration, due to its low relevance {{to the rest of the}} presented work. Part III describes my main project of developing a probabilistic nucleosome-position prediction method. I developed a maximum likelihood approach to learn a biophysical model of nucleosome binding. By including the low positional resolution of MNase-Seq and the sequence bias of CC-Seq into the likelihood, I could separate them from the nucleosome binding preferences and learn highly correlated nucleosome binding energy models. My analysis shows that nucleosomes have a position-specific binding preference and might be uninfluenced by G+C content or even disfavor it – contrary to the Consensus in literature. Part IV describes further analysis I did during my time as a PhD student that are not part of any planned publications. The main topics are: <b>ancillary</b> <b>elements</b> of my main project, unsuccessful attempts to correct experimental biases, analysis of the quality of experimental measurements, and adapting my probabilistic nucleosome-position prediction method to work with occupancy measurements. Lastly, I give a general outlook that reflects on my results and discusses next steps, like ways to improve my method further. I excluded two collaboration projects I participated in from this thesis, because they are still ongoing: a systematic analysis of how the core promoter sequence influences gene expression in Drosophila and the development of an experiment to measure nucleosome occupancy more precisely...|$|E
