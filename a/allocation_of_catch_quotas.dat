2500|$|A common {{criticism}} of the CFP is its centralised, top-down approach to management; although Member States {{are responsible for the}} policy's implementation and enforcement, the EU adopts sole competence in the creation of proposals and the making of decisions. The Commission is not exclusively responsible for the setting <b>of</b> total allowable <b>catches.</b> These are proposed by the commission but ultimately determined by the Council <b>of</b> Ministers. [...] <b>Allocation</b> <b>of</b> national <b>catch</b> <b>quotas</b> to Member States is on a pre-determined basis—the so-called relative stability—giving each member state pre-determined percentages of the available fishing opportunities. Although Member States hold some responsibilities, such as the distribution of quotas, it is argued that the EU retains too much authority over fisheries management. Furthermore, critics maintain that the organisation is ill-suited to the task of fisheries management as it lacks sufficient understanding of fisheries, and is too far removed from the realities of the industry to set accurate TACs and quotas. The command-and-control method characterised by the CFP is no longer deemed an effective form of fisheries management, and advocates of CFP reform consider a shift from traditional government to participatory third-order governance, incorporating the fisheries industry and Member States, to be vital {{to the success of the}} policy.|$|R

Differences in these life history parameters among groups of fish have long been used as a basis for the identification of fish stocks because of the relative ease of assessing these parameters and their dual functionality as input into fisheries stock assessment and management strategies.

In recent years, the massive deployments of dFADs, {{as well as the}} massive use of tracking devices on dFADs and natural floating objects, such as GPS buoys, have raised serious concerns for tropical tuna stocks, bycatch species and pelagic ecosystem functioning.

The present paper provides an overview of a 4 -year research on the use of dFADs by tropical tuna purse seiners in the Western Indian Ocean.

Quantitative results (estimates of dFAD use, fishing efficiency and impacts of dFAD use) were discussed with French purse seine skippers during semi-structured interviews to understand their perception of the impacts of dFAD use and to propose adapted management options for tropical tuna purse seine dFAD fisheries.

40|$|Abstract. The recent {{expansion}} of the longline commercial fishery has heightened the conflicts among various fisheries in Hawaii, especially between longliners and non-longline commercial (troll and handline) and recreational fishing boats. The recent court ruling against longline fishing on some waters around Hawaiian islands may provide an impetus for the {{expansion of}} the non-longline commercial activities, which in turn may give rise to conflicts between non-longline commercial and recreational fisheries. This study examines the economic impacts <b>of</b> the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> from one nonlongline commercial fishing trip to recreational fishing using the 1992 input-output model of the state of Hawaii. The results show that the total impact on value added per unit of fish landed is greater for recreational fishing than commercial fishing, while total impacts on income and employment are greater for commercial fishing. When forward-linked trade and distribution services of final demands are also included, total value added, income, and employment impacts are all higher for commercial fishing and hence net impacts <b>of</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> the commercial fishery to the recreational/expense fishery are all negative. Furthermore, when the effects of an equivalent decrease in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) of other sectors due to an increase in expenditures in recreational fishing are also included, total losses on value added, income, and employment become more significant. However, relative to direct impacts indirect impacts on value added, income and employment are higher for recreational fishing than for commercial fishing such that the corresponding net indirect effects are positive in all cases...|$|R

However, acquiring {{data about the}} distribution and spatiotemporal <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> and fishing effort in small scale benthic fisheries re-mains challenging. Here, we used GIS-based spatio-statistical models to investigate the footprint of commercial diving events on blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) stocks along the south-west coast of Victoria, Australia from 2008 to 2011.

Spatial autocorrelation and hotspot analysis revealed significant spatiotemporal clusters of CPUE (with distance thresh-olds of 100 ’s of meters) among years, indicating the presence of CPUE hotspots focused on specific reefs. Cumulative hotspot maps indicated that certain reef complexes were con-sistently targeted across years but with varying intensity, however often a relatively small proportion of the full reef extent was targeted. Integrating CPUE with remotely-sensed {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) derived bathymetry data using generalized additive mixed model corroborated that fishing pressure primarily coincided with shallow, rugose and com-plex components of reef structures.
