5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles.

Neumann decided to leave his family and embark on a long journey to the British colony of Hong Kong in May 1939.

40|$|Abstract: Occupational {{exposure}} to asbestos fiber of brake repair job (<b>auto</b> <b>mechanics)</b> has seldom been evaluated in Iran. Accordingly, we evaluated asbestos fiber {{concentrations in the}} breathing zone of <b>auto</b> <b>mechanics</b> between July 2008 and December 2008. The asbestos fiber concentrations of 60 personal air samples collected from 30 cars and trucks brake replacement and they were analyzed by phase-contrast optical microscopy (PCM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The geometric means of the personal monitoring fiber concentrations were 0. 92 PCM f/ml and 0. 46 PCM f/ml respectively in car and passenger heavy truck auto shops. There was a {{significant differences in the}} asbestos fiber concentrations between the car and truck auto shops (p= 0. 006). Based on these findings, <b>auto</b> <b>mechanics</b> who worked with asbestos containing brake may have been exposed to asbestos concentrations approximately 7 times higher than the current occupational safety and health agency (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0. 1 f/ml. Fiber morphology and energy dispersive X-ray analysis by SEM revealed that amphibole fibers such as tremolite and actinolite existed in the brakes dust and that the vast majority (> 30 %) of the airborne chrysotile fibers were greater than 1 μm in diameter. It can be concluded that the imported chrysotile asbestos contains trace amounts of tremolite and actinolite fibers and they are responsible for the high airborne asbestos levels and occupational {{exposure to}} amphibole asbestos in <b>auto</b> <b>mechanics</b> job in Iran. Thus, it is to be expected that the <b>auto</b> <b>mechanics</b> will suffer negative health effects due to exposure to the serpentine and amphibole asbestos fibers...|$|R
