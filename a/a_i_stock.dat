After a two-for-one split, each shareholder has twice as many shares, but each represents a claim on only half as much of the corporation's assets and earnings.

Our formula holds for arbitrary marginal distributions and in addition does not require any parameterization of the multivariate distributions of the market and stocks. The determination of the extreme parameter, which is not accessible by a direct statistical inference, is made possible by the measurement of parameters whose estimation involves a significant part of the data with sufficient statistics. Our empirical tests find a good agreement between the calibration of the tail dependence coefficient and the realized large losses over the period from 1962 to 2000. Nevertheless, a bias is detected which suggests the presence of an outlier in the form of the crash of October 1987. ...|$|R

Sponsorship: ERDF, WAG, WDAFollowing {{on from the}} last AAB conference held on this topic in 2001, this conference provides an opportunity to gain a progress update in this rapidly developing sector where there have been significant policy and technology developments. Significantly, there have been moves to large-scale commercialisation of processes for conversion of biomass to energy in response to policy actions generated to deliver both the EU?s and the UK Governments objectives for development of renewable energy sources {{as a means of}} both reducing green house gas emissions and increasing fuel security. There have been significant moves in use of woody biomass, straw and energy grasses for electricity generation, but also in use of conventional arable crops for production of biodiesel and ethanol as transport fuels. These developments have not come without criticism of the impact such developments could have in terms of competition for land with food crops and the impacts this could have on food prices. Similarly, the environmental credentials of biomass technologies have been questioned in terms of their green house gas savings and wider environmental footprint. The impact of market pressures to develop oil crops to feed the growing biofuel market have been blamed for deforestation, thereby undermining potential green house gas savings. Clearly the benefits of use of biomass lies in their Life Cycle Assessment in terms of cradle to grave impacts on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental and socio-economic factors. Increasing biomass productivity and utilisation can significantly improve the results of such assessments. This conference provides academics, policy makers, environmental organizations and industry interests with an opportunity to hear about the research, policies and issues affecting developments in use of conventional and perennial crops for energy and transport fuels.

It is shown that in all these cases the minor partner in a fish-sharing agreement may not have an incentive to cooperate unless he gets a larger share of the cooperative profits than corresponds to his share of the stock. This is particularly likely to happen when the unit cost of fish does not depend on the stock. An exception could occur if stock migration depends on the stock level; the major partner could then keep the entire stock by fishing it down to a critical level...|$|R

Previous literature suggests that liquidity trading, information asymmetry, the extent of estimation uncertainty, and heterogeneity of opinion are related to share turnover of seasoned stocks, whereas very few papers examine the factors of liquidity of newly-listed firms. Because IPO stocks typically experience a volatile trading period following the IPO issuance date, I draw on the literature on trading activities and IPO firms and explore the sources, if any, of IPO liquidity {{during the period of}} 1995 through 2005. Past price performance and stock visibility reflect the degree of liquidity or noise trading. Past return and return volatility proxy for past price performance, and firm size and stock price proxy for the extent of stock visibility. Information asymmetry is proxied by the number of analysts following an IPO stock. Both forecast dispersion and financial leverage measure the degree of differences of opinion, and relative earnings surprises proxies for the extent of uncertainty about <b>an</b> IPO <b>stock.</b> <b>I</b> also examine IPO attributes, such as the presence of venture capital and the number of underwriters in a syndicate.
