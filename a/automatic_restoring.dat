We proposed two convenience applications which are searching an object and <b>automatic</b> object <b>restoring</b> to the storing place. The system functionalities include {{identification of the}} object, monitoring and tracking the object’s position, real-time recording of the object information and building historical database. We also provide an interface for retrieving and analyzing historical database. In additions, we introduce human posture and position tracking system to allow a system perceives human posture and position information. To improve the accuracy of positioning, we also offer Robotic Technology Case (RT-Case) which provides object tracking capability in living space based on RFID technology, and Robotic Technology Shelf (RT-Shelf) which represents perceivable storage space based on ultrasonic technology.

An {{everyday}} example is the cruise control on a road vehicle; where external influences such as gradients cause speed changes (PV), and the driver also alters the desired set speed (SP). The <b>automatic</b> control algorithm <b>restores</b> the actual speed to the desired speed in the optimum way, without delay or overshoot, by altering the power output of the vehicle's engine. In this way the SP-PV error is used to control the PV so that it equals the SP. A widespread use of SP-PV error control is the PID controller.|$|R

To put to test the browser vendors claim, I had setup a test to confirm the claims. During the first test the file system was monitored for all reads and writes. On the second test {{the image of the}} RAM was taken after the browser was used in private mode. The image was analyzed to check if the RAM contained any data related to the user browsing. The browsers chosen to perform this test were: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari.

Safari wrote data on just a single file called 2 ̆ 2 WebpageIcons. db 2 ̆ 2. Internet Explorer wrote browsing data on the file system and then deleted it.

40|$|Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) allows {{monitoring}} the fetal heart function through algorithms able {{to retrieve the}} fetal cardiac signal, but no standardized automatic model has become available so far. In this paper, we describe an <b>automatic</b> method that <b>restores</b> the fetal cardiac trace from fMCG recordings {{by means of a}} weighted summation of fetal components separated with independent component analysis (ICA) and identified through dedicated algorithms that analyse the frequency content and temporal structure of each source signal. Multichannel fMCG datasets of 66 healthy and 4 arrhythmic fetuses were used to validate the automatic method with respect to a classical procedure requiring the manual classification of fetal components by an expert investigator. ICA was run with input clusters of different dimensions to simulate various MCG systems. Detection rates, true negative and false positive component categorization, QRS amplitude, standard deviation and signal-to-noise ratio of reconstructed fetal signals, and real and per cent QRS differences between paired fetal traces retrieved automatically and manually were calculated to quantify the performances of the automatic method. Its robustness and reliability, particularly evident with the use of large input clusters, might increase the diagnostic role of fMCG during the prenatal period. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} an <b>automatic</b> algorithm to <b>restore</b> {{the shape of}} three-dimensional (3 D) left ventricle (LV) models created from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data using a geometry-driven optimization approach. Our basic premise is to restore the LV shape such that the LV epicardial surface is smooth after the restoration. A geometrical measure known as the Minimum Principle Curvature (κ 2) is {{used to assess the}} smoothness of the LV. This measure is used to construct the objective function of a two-step optimization process. The objective of the optimization is to achieve a smooth epicardial shape by iterative in-plane translation of the MRI slices. Quantitatively, this yields a minimum sum in terms of the magnitude of κ 2, when κ 2 is negative. A limited memory quasi-Newton algorithm, L-BFGS-B, is used to solve the optimization problem. We tested our algorithm on an in vitro theoretical LV model and 10 in vivo patient-specific models which contain significant motion artifacts. The results show that our method is able to automatically restore the shape of LV models back to smoothness without altering the general shape of the model. The magnitudes of in-plane translations are also consistent with existing registration techniques and experimental findings...|$|R

The schema re ects the interaction of the individual software modules that it comprises. It describes the integration of the modules with a uni ed database management system: access to the database, <b>automatic</b> backup and <b>restore</b> of databases in real-time and transmission of data over an open channel using modern encryption algorithms. The basic units of the system consist in: a unit for diagnosing the state of economic security; a unit for the welfare of the individual and residential area; a unit for extremism; a correlation unit; a modelling unit for the forecasting of the security of Subjects of the Russian Federation. As part of the simulation unit, a primary generalised mathematical model, based on a system of nonlinear differential equations, designed to take account of the correction factors, as well as taking into account all types of interaction indicators, is provided. The main types optimisation problems of interaction metrics are compiled using generalised models. Forecasts from 2016 to 2020 are generated on the basis of constructed optimisation propositions.

40|$|Colloquial Arabic (CA) is {{the set of}} spoken {{variants}} of modern Arabic {{that exist in the}} form of regional dialects and are considered generally to be mother-tongues in those regions. CA has limited textual resource because it exists only as a spoken language and without a standardised written form. Normally the modern standard Arabic (MSA) writing convention is employed that has limitations in phonetically representing CA. Without phonetic dictionaries the pronunciation of CA words is ambiguous, and can only be obtained through word and/or sentence context. Moreover, CA inherits the MSA complex word structure where words can be created from attaching affixes to a word. In automatic speech recognition (ASR), commonly used approaches to model acoustic, pronunciation and word variability are language independent. However, one can observe significant differences in performance between English and CA, with the latter yielding up to three times higher error rates. This thesis investigates the main issues for the under-performance of CA ASR systems. The work focuses on two directions: first, the impact of limited lexical coverage, and insufficient training data for written CA on language modelling is investigated; second, obtaining better models for the acoustics and pronunciations by learning to transfer between written and spoken forms. Several original contributions result from each direction. Using data-driven classes from decomposed text are shown to reduce out-of-vocabulary rate. A novel colloquialisation system to import additional data is introduced; <b>automatic</b> diacritisation to <b>restore</b> the missing short vowels was found to yield good performance; and a new acoustic set for describing CA was defined. Using the proposed methods improved the ASR performance in terms of word error rate in a CA conversational telephone speech ASR task...|$|R
