25|$|There {{were two}} primary {{goals for the}} ALTUS II development: to be a testbed for {{performance}} and propulsion concepts leading to development of future remotely piloted or autonomous aircraft designed for high-altitude science missions, and to evaluate its practicality for use as an <b>airborne</b> <b>platform</b> for such missions. The ALTUS II vehicle was used to verify technologies {{that will lead to}} a long-duration (12 to 72 hours), high altitude vehicle capable of carrying a 330-pound science payload. The efforts include work on engine integration, flight operations techniques and procedures, lightweight structures, science payload integration and science mission demonstration.|$|E
25|$|If the Avro 730 had {{proceeded}} into service, {{it would}} have replaced the V bombers as the primary <b>airborne</b> <b>platform</b> {{as a part of}} Britain's nuclear deterrent. In early 1957, the Avro 730 was abruptly cancelled, along with the development of a number of other manned aircraft, {{as a consequence of the}} 1957 Defence White Paper. Part of the reason for the cancellation was the perception that by the time it would enter service, Soviet anti-aircraft capabilities would have improved to the point where it would not be able to succeed in its mission; a preference for missile development over manned aircraft was another factor. A successor high-speed bomber would be developed to meet Air Ministry Specification GOR.339, designated as the BAC TSR-2; however, this too would be eventually cancelled.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 29/30 April 1942 No. 58 Squadron flying Whitleys bombed the Port of Ostend in Belgium. This was the last {{operational}} mission by a Whitley equipped bomber squadron. In late 1942, the Whitley was retired from service as a frontline aircraft for bomber squadrons and was shifted to other roles. The type continued to operate delivering supplies and agents in the Special Duties squadrons (138 and 161) until December 1942, as well as serving as a transport for troops and freight, a carrier for paratroopers and a tow aircraft for gliders. In 1940, the Whitley had been selected as the standard paratroop transport; in this role, the ventral turret aperture was commonly modified {{to be used for}} the egress of paratroopers. No. 100 Group RAF used Whitleys as an <b>airborne</b> <b>platform</b> to carry airborne radar and electronic counter-measures. In February 1942, Whitleys were used to carry the paratroopers who participated in the Bruneval raid, code named Operation Biting, in which German radar technology was captured from a German base on the coast of France.|$|E
