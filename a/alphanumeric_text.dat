40|$|For {{the vast}} {{majority}} of computer systems, passwords are the method of choice for authenticating users. The most widely and commonly used authentication is traditional “Username ” and “Password”. For such authentication generally <b>text</b> (<b>alphanumeric)</b> is used. It is well-known, however, that passwords are susceptible to attack: users tend to choose passwords that are easy to remember, and often this means that they are also easy for an attacker to obtain by searching for candidate passwords. On the other hand, if a password is hard, then it is often hard to remember. Keeping these things in mind we propose a novel, innovative and more secure way of selecting passwords: Graphical Passwords. In this paper we explore an approach to user authentication that generalizes the notion of a textual password and that, in many cases, improves the security of user authentication over that provided by textual passwords. We design and analyze graphical passwords, which can be input by the user to any device with a graphical input interface. We also try to answer two most important questions: “Are graphical passwords as secure and easy to use as text-based passwords”? “Major design and implementation issues for graphical passwords”?

40|$|Large image {{processing}} systems use multiple frame buffers with differing architectures and vendor supplied user interfaces. This variety of architectures and interfaces creates software development, maintenance, and portability problems for application programs. The Virtual Frame Buffer Interface program makes all frame buffers {{appear as a}} generic frame buffer with a specified set of characteristics, allowing programmers to write code which will run unmodified on all supported hardware. The Virtual Frame Buffer Interface converts generic commands to actual device commands. The virtual frame buffer consists of a definition of capabilities and FORTRAN subroutines that are called by application programs. The virtual frame buffer routines may be treated as subroutines, logical functions, or integer functions by the application program. Routines are included that allocate and manage hardware resources such as frame buffers, monitors, video switches, trackballs, tablets and joysticks; access image memory planes; and perform <b>alphanumeric</b> font or <b>text</b> generation. The subroutines for the various "real" frame buffers are in separate VAX/VMS shared libraries allowing modification, correction or enhancement of the virtual interface without affecting application programs. The Virtual Frame Buffer Interface program was developed in FORTRAN 77 for a DEC VAX 11 / 780 or a DEC VAX 11 / 750 under VMS 4. X. It supports ADAGE IK 3000, DEANZA IP 8500, Low Resolution RAMTEK 9460, and High Resolution RAMTEK 9460 Frame Buffers. It has a central memory requirement of approximately 150 K.

40|$|Now a days {{majority}} of computer systems, passwords are {{the method of}} choice for authenticating users. A process by which a systemverifies {{the identity of a}} user is known as ‘Authentication’. Authentication may also be generalized by saying that “to authenticate” means “to authorize”. Authentication is {{the first line of defense}} against compromising confidentiality and integrity. The most widely and commonly used authentication is traditional “Username” and “Password”. For such authentication generally <b>text</b> (<b>alphanumeric)</b> is used. It is well-known, however, that passwords are susceptible to attack: users tend to choose passwords that are easy to remember, and often this means that they are also easy for anattacker to obtain by searching for candidate passwords. Token and biometric based authentication systems were introduced as an alternative for that schemes. However, these schemes are very costy. Thus, Graphical scheme was introduced as a variation to the login/password scheme. In this paper we explore an approach to user authentication that generalizes the notion of a textual password and that, in many cases, improves the security of user authentication over that provided by textual passwords. In this proposed system we have used a new technique for authentication. It is a variation tothe login/password scheme using graphical password used in an graphical manner. We have introduced a framework of our proposed Graphical Password Authentication System (GPAS), which is immune to the common attacks suffered by other authentication schemes.

Specifically, we demonstrate the ability to deny voice service to cities the size of Washington D. C. and Manhattan with little more than a cable modem. Moreover, attacks targeting the entire United States are feasible with resources available at most medium-sized organizations. This analysis begins with an exploration of the structure of cellular networks. We then characterize network behavior and explore a number of reconnaissance techniques aimed at effectively targeting attacks on these systems.
