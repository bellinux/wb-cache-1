5|$|According to Renaissance accounts, gigantic, {{triangular}} fossil teeth {{often found}} embedded in rocky formations were once {{believed to be}} the petrified tongues, or glossopetrae, of dragons and snakes. This interpretation was corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolas Steno, who recognized them as shark teeth, and famously produced a depiction of a shark's head bearing such teeth. He described his findings in the book The Head of a Shark Dissected, which also contained <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> a megalodon tooth.|$|E
5|$|Although {{used before}} his presidency, Roosevelt used {{military}} muscle several times throughout his two terms {{with a more}} subtle touch to complement his diplomatic policies and enforcing the Monroe Doctrine throughout multiple interventions in Latin America.

5|$|Plot {{elements}} for the episode {{date back to}} the original pitch to The Walt Disney Company for the series produced by Povenmire and Marsh. The pitch was constructed of storyboard reels which were recorded and dubbed over by Povenmire for voices, narration, and sound effects.

5|$|Revolving bookcase: Revolving bookcases, {{known as}} zhuanluntang, have been {{documented}} in ancient China, and its invention is credited to Fu Xi in 544. Descriptions of revolving bookcases {{have been found in}} 8th- and 9th-century Chinese texts. Revolving bookcases were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the Song Dynasty under the reign of Emperor Taizu, who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka scriptures. <b>An</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> a revolving bookcase is depicted in Li Jie's architectural treatise the Yingzao Fashi.|$|E

In 1916, the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway criticised the illustration for differing from Du Tertre's description; Du Tertre supposedly only meant that the proximal primary feathers were yellow, whereas all the covert feathers are yellow in the illustration, apart from a red edge, and the head and underparts are slate.|$|E

5|$|The post-war years saw the Echo drop Shipping Gazette {{from its}} main title-piece, {{following}} a redesign in 1959. Instead, the paper {{became known as}} Echo Sunderland for several years, although the name Sunderland Echo and Shipping Gazette continued to be printed in much smaller type above the new title. A further title-piece redesign in 1972, however, dispensed with the words Shipping Gazette and introduced <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> Wearmouth Bridge alongside the title Echo Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|The term Frigate Bird {{itself was}} used in 1738 by the English naturalist and {{illustrator}} Eleazar Albin in his A Natural History of the Birds. The book included <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> the male bird showing the red gular pouch. Like the genus name, the English term {{is derived from the}} French mariners' name for the bird la frégate—a frigate or fast warship. The etymology was mentioned by French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Du Tertre when describing the bird in 1667.|$|E

5|$|In December 2003, the {{characters}} from Spica (Hikari, Amane, Yaya, and Tsubomi) and Lulim (Kizuna, Chikaru, Remon, and Kagome) were introduced {{and in the}} January 2004 issue the first illustrations of the three schools and the Strawberry Dorms were published, drawn by Chitose Maki; the reader participation game began in this issue. Polls were posted in the January 2004 issue where the readers could vote on how the story would start and progress in the following months. Before the votes were counted, the first three short stories were written and published in the February 2004 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine. Each story featured <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> the two girls who were the couple paired in each respective story.|$|E
5|$|Little {{documentary}} {{evidence of the}} games remains; contemporary and near-contemporary writings mostly record the major details and concentrate on the opening days. The poet Martial gives the most complete and only truly contemporary account {{in the form of}} his De Spectaculis ("On the Spectacles"), a somewhat sycophantic series of epigrams detailing the individual events of the games as <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> Titus' power and benevolence. Much of the work is concerned with praising Titus, and there have been difficulties with authenticating, dating and translating various portions, but Martial does give details of events not covered by other sources and the only known surviving complete record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena.|$|E
5|$|The leading case, Anti-Vivisection Society, {{sets out}} a strict rule that {{charities}} cannot campaign politically. <b>An</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> its strictness is Bowman v Secular Society, {{where it was}} held that even when attempted changes to the law were ancillary to the main goals, it was still unacceptable. There is a dividing line; charitable trusts discussing political issues can be valid, as discussed by Hoffmann J obiter dicta in Attorney General v Ross. This line is considered by the Charity Commission in their official guidelines, which allow the Commission {{to look at the}} wider purpose of the organisation when deciding if it constitutes a valid charity.|$|E

5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{presents}} <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> unintentional (or rather 'anti-intentional') selection by man. Weeders do {{not want}} to select weeds and their seeds that look increasingly like cultivated plants, yet there is no other option. For example, the Echinochloa oryzoides plant, a species of grass found as a weed in rice (Oryza sativa) fields, looks similar to rice; its seeds are often mixed in rice and have become difficult to separate through Vavilovian mimicry. Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves, {{as in the case of}} rye in wheat; Vavilov called these weed-crops secondary crops.|$|E
5|$|In {{between these}} works he {{found time to}} write Literarum latinarum, a small {{instruction}} manual on the italic script. The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy {{at the beginning of}} the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> the decorative style he developed.|$|E
5|$|The Viz Media {{releases}} {{preserve the}} Japanese reading order and overlay the visual sound effects with equivalent English text. The English lettering {{was criticized for}} being overly large, which Anime News Network thought made the characters appear to be shouting at inappropriate moments. There are several additional differences between the Japanese and English volume releases of Zombiepowder.. The cover of the second manga volume, which featured <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> C.T. Smith holding {{a gun to his}} own head, was replaced in the English edition with new art of Gamma in sunglasses. The English editions of volumes 2-4 also each contain a one-shot story from early in Kubo's career, which were not present in the Japanese collections: Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine, Rune Master Urara, and Bad Shield United, respectively. These extra stories were included for two apparent reasons: to further appeal to Zombiepowder.s primary English-speaking audience of Bleach fans interested in the development of Tite Kubo's style, and to expand the length of the later volumes, which would otherwise have been shorter than Viz's normal releases, to standard pagecounts.|$|E

5|$|The {{main feature}} {{of the game is}} focused on a map of Europe and western Russia, which {{displays}} accurate terrain such as mountain ranges, major cities, borders and all military forces belonging to each side. The game also features an arcade sequence which involves shooting down enemy units in order to secure combat bonuses; this gameplay mode, however, can be ignored by changing the game's settings. If the arcade sequences are turned on, the player will be notified to choose a battle on the map. Depending on the area chosen, <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> a battle commencing in countryside or a city is presented with various forms of military equipment including aeroplanes, helicopters and tanks. The player must shoot down and destroy enemy units using their cursor, in similar style to Missile Command. The outcome of the arcade sequence will affect the game; performing poorly will result in severe losses throughout that round.|$|E
5|$|The tail, {{according}} to Schwartz, {{is longer than}} in the potto. He does not provide measurements of the tail of AMZ 6698 and notes {{that at least one}} vertebra is missing, but Sarmiento counted 11 caudal vertebrae in <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> AMZ 6698 and Groves counted at least 15. However, Sarmiento found that the number of caudal vertebrae ranges from 5 to 17, with an average of 11, in pottos. Relatively long tails are also common in the western form of the potto, though {{according to}} Stump the tail of Pseudopotto is longer than any seen in pottos. The false potto allegedly has shorter spines on its cervical (neck) and first and second thoracic (chest) vertebrae, but Leon notes that this feature is also seen in western pottos. Schwartz writes that the false potto differs from pottos and angwantibos in lacking a bifid (two-tipped) spine on the second cervical vertebra, but Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 potto specimens he examined.|$|E
5|$|According to {{literary}} critics Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, possible fictional influences on Hergé's story include Jules Verne's 1870 novel Around the Moon and the 1950 American film Destination Moon. Hergé was certainly {{inspired by a}} number of photographic stills from the Destination Moon film which had been published. The computer system at the Sprodj space centre was visually based upon the UNIVAC I, the first computer to be created for non-military purposes. Hergé based his moon rocket on the designs of the V-2 rocket which had been developed by German scientists during World War II. The red-and-white checker pattern on Hergé's rocket was based upon <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> a V-2 which Hergé had come upon in Leslie Simon's 1947 book German Research in World War II. He commissioned the construction of a model rocket with detachable parts from his assistant Arthur Van Noeyen. He took the model to Paris where he showed it to Ananoff, asking him if it was a realistic representation of what a moon rocket might look like. He and his assistants then used the model from which to accurately sketch when producing the comic.|$|E
