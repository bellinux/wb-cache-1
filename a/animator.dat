50|$|<b>Animators</b> {{are said}} to be very rare, though not as rare as necromancers. There are three animating firms in the US {{according}} to Anita, and the firm she works for, <b>Animators</b> Inc., has about 6 different <b>animators</b> working there. <b>Animators</b> are born with their powers, and Anita is not sure she was ever human, even from birth. <b>Animators</b> have the ability resist vampires' hypnotic powers to some degree and to raise and control zombies. However, they can only control zombies, while necromancers (like Anita) can control all types of dead, and most undead.|$|R
50|$|<b>Animators</b> often specialize. One {{important}} distinction is between character <b>animators</b> (artists {{who specialize in}} character movement, dialogue, acting, etc.) and special effects <b>animators</b> (who animate anything {{that is not a}} character; most commonly vehicles, machinery, and natural phenomena such as rain, snow, and water).|$|R

5000|$|Czech {{animation}} {{has been}} a tradition for almost 100 years. Czech <b>animators</b> are considered pioneers in film animation. It began in 1920s and its [...] "Golden Era" [...] dates between 1950s and 1980s. Czech <b>animators</b> include Jiří Trnka, Karel Zeman, Břetislav Pojar, Jan Švankmajer or Jiří Barta. Czech <b>animators</b> have employed Cutout animation, Puppet animation and Clay animation. 3D animation is seldom used {{due to lack of}} finances and trained 3D <b>animators.</b> This led to downturn in the years after 1989.|$|R
5|$|Nathan Lane as Timon, a wise-cracking and self-absorbed yet {{somewhat}} loyal meerkat {{who becomes}} one of Simba's best friends and adoptive parents. Michael Surrey served as his supervising <b>animator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Simba {{was created}} by screenwriters Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton. While Mark Henn served as Simba's supervising <b>animator</b> as a cub, Ruben A. Aquino {{animated}} the character as he appears as an adult.|$|E
5|$|Barbera's {{desk was}} {{opposite}} that of William Hanna. The two quickly realized {{they would make}} a good team. By 1939, they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Barbera and Hanna worked alongside <b>animator</b> Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there are}} permanent/full-time {{positions}} in studios, most <b>animators</b> {{work on a}} contract basis. There are some <b>animators</b> that {{are considered to be}} in the core group of the studio, which can either be as a result of being there since the inception of the company or being talented recruits from other animation studios. These are the more secured positions in an animation studio, though the studio might have policies with regard to possible tenure of <b>animators.</b> Since studios can hire <b>animators</b> on a work for hire basis nowadays, many artists do not retain rights over their creations, unlike some of the early <b>animators.</b> The extent of these copyrights is subject to local intellectual property rights.|$|R
50|$|After release, {{controversy}} emerged after anonymous comments {{attributed to}} the <b>animators</b> on a Cartoon Brew article suggested that the <b>animators</b> at Nitrogen Studios worked under poor conditions and were forced by director Greg Tiernan to work overtime without pay. A total of 36 of the 83 <b>animators</b> were blacklisted and went uncredited in the film, believed {{to be due to}} their complaints; comments made in anonymous interviews by some of the <b>animators</b> involved in the project by Variety, The Washington Post, and The Hollywood Reporter alleged that the comments were accurate. All the <b>animators</b> in the film were reportedly told outright that they would be blacklisted if they did not work overtime without pay.|$|R
500|$|Much of the {{character}} animation on these productions and all subsequent features until the late 1970s was supervised by a brain-trust of <b>animators</b> Walt Disney dubbed the [...] "Nine Old Men," [...] many of whom also served as directors and later producers on the Disney features: Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, Woolie Reitherman, Les Clark, Ward Kimball, Eric Larson, John Lounsbery, Milt Kahl, and Marc Davis. Other head <b>animators</b> at Disney during this period included Norm Ferguson, Bill Tytla, and Fred Moore. The development of the feature animation department created a caste system at the Disney studio: lesser <b>animators</b> (and feature <b>animators</b> in-between assignments) were assigned {{to work on the}} short subjects, while <b>animators</b> higher in status such as the Nine Old Men worked on the features. Concern over Walt Disney accepting credit for the artists' work as well as debates over compensation led to many of the newer and lower-ranked <b>animators</b> seeking to unionize the Disney studio.|$|R
5|$|Bradley Pierce as Chip – Mrs. Potts' son, who {{has been}} turned into a teacup. Originally {{intended}} to only have one line, the filmmakers were impressed with Pierce's performance and expanded the character's role significantly, eschewing a mute Music Box character. Pruiksma also served as the supervising <b>animator</b> for Chip.|$|E
5|$|Continuing a Pixar tradition, WALL-E was {{paired with}} a short film for its {{theatrical}} release, Presto. The film was dedicated to Justin Wright (1981–2008), a Pixar <b>animator</b> who had worked on Ratatouille and {{died of a heart}} attack before WALL-Es release.|$|E
5|$|Created and {{animated}} by supervising <b>animator</b> Glen Keane, Rapunzel is {{loosely based on}} the title character of the fairy tale {{of the same name}} published by the Brothers Grimm. The character was adapted into a less passive heroine for the film..|$|E
5000|$|A {{large portion}} of [...] "Homer3" [...] was three {{dimensional}} and computer animated. Supervising director David Silverman was aiming for something better than the computer animation used in the music video for [...] "Money for Nothing" [...] by Dire Straits. The animation was provided by Pacific Data Images (PDI) and overseen by Tim Johnson. The <b>animators</b> at PDI {{worked closely with the}} normal <b>animators</b> on The Simpsons and worked hard not to [...] "reinvent the characters". The <b>animators</b> storyboarded the segments and showed the PDI <b>animators</b> how they would have handled the scenes. While designing the 3D model of Bart, the <b>animators</b> did not know how they would show Bart's hair. However, they realized that there were vinyl Bart dolls in production and purchased one to use as a model. One of the most difficult parts for the PDI <b>animators</b> was to make Homer and Bart move properly without making them look robotic.|$|R

5|$|David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth – Majordomo, {{the head}} of the {{household}} staff and Lumière's best friend, who has been transformed into a clock. He is extremely loyal to the Beast so as to save himself and anyone else any trouble, often leading to friction between himself and Lumière. Will Finn served as the supervising <b>animator</b> for Cogsworth. Stiers also narrates the prologue.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Seale as The Sultan, the pompous, but kind {{ruler of}} Agrabah, who desperately {{tries to find}} a suitor for his {{daughter}} Jasmine. Some aspects of the character were inspired by the Wizard of Oz, to create a bumbling authority figure. The Sultan's supervising <b>animator</b> was David Pruiksma.|$|E
5|$|During Homer's {{confrontation}} with the Hullabalooza crowd, there is a brief shot of Homer {{with the members of}} the musical group No Doubt behind him.

40|$|The 3 D {{animation}} {{has become}} a big business in Thailand. We conduct the focus group with key authorities in the Thai animation industry {{in order to understand}} the real issues in Thai animations business. We found that Thai <b>animators</b> trend to manually set the attributes for the effects. This causes human errors and time delay in the development process. The aim of this research is to develop an automatic shader tool to help reduce human errors and time delay. But at the same time, the tool should give the <b>animators</b> control over the necessary attributes setting. Moreover, it should act as a learning tool for the new <b>animators</b> in Thai animation industry as well. This is because Thai animation industries require their <b>animators</b> to have basic understanding about the effect setting. Our tool is then tested with the <b>animators</b> in their real environment. The experts find our tool works efficiently and help them getting their job done quickly. Moreover, the new <b>animators</b> find the tool easy to use and reduce errors as well...|$|R
50|$|Considered {{among the}} finest stop motion model <b>animators,</b> Dave Allen has contributed {{some of the}} best stop motion {{sequences}} to many feature films, rivaling the work of other premier model <b>animators</b> Ray Harryhausen and Jim Danforth.|$|R
50|$|In 1933, Warner Brothers Cartoons was founded. While Disney's {{studio was}} known for its {{releases}} being strictly controlled by Walt Disney himself, Warner brothers allowed its <b>animators</b> more freedom, which allowed for their <b>animators</b> to develop more recognizable personal styles.|$|R
5|$|Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Jafar's sarcastic, foul-mouthed parrot assistant. Much like Robin Williams, Gottfried {{was given}} freedom to improvise his lines. Iago's supervising <b>animator</b> Will Finn tried to {{incorporate}} {{some aspects of}} Gottfried's appearance into Iago's design, especially his semi-closed eyes and the always-appearing teeth.|$|E
5|$|He became seriously {{interested}} in film while attending Harvard after befriending Dan Schrecker, an aspiring <b>animator,</b> and Sean Gullette, {{who would go}} on to star in Aronofsky's first film, Pi. His cinematic influences included Akira Kurosawa, Roman Polanski, Terry Gilliam, Shinya Tsukamoto, Hubert Selby, Jr. Spike Lee, Satoshi Kon, and Jim Jarmusch.|$|E
5|$|Linda Larkin as Princess Jasmine: The {{princess of}} Agrabah, who {{is tired of}} life in the royal palace. Larkin was chosen nine months after her audition, and had to adjust (or lower) her high-pitched voice to reach the voice the filmmakers were looking for in the character. Jasmine's supervising <b>animator</b> was Mark Henn. Lea Salonga {{provides}} Jasmine's singing voice.|$|E
5000|$|Examples of the {{elasticity}} {{of the human}} body in motion were found in photographs the <b>animators</b> found in newspaper sports pages. Using these poses as reference the <b>animators</b> were able to start [...] "observing (the motion) in a new way".|$|R
50|$|Early into production, {{a team of}} designers, <b>animators,</b> producers, and Katzenberg {{embarked}} on research trips to Mexico where they studied ancient Mayan cities of Tulum, Chichen-Itza, and Uxmal in hopes of making the film's architecture look authentic. By January 1997, one hundred <b>animators</b> were assigned onto the project. However, because the animation department was occupied with The Prince of Egypt, the studio devoted more <b>animators</b> and resources on the film than on Road to El Dorado.|$|R
40|$|What are {{the labour}} {{conditions}} of working <b>animators</b> today in Japan? How are they {{extensions of the}} industry’s origins and neoliberal practices? Foregrounded by a historical inquiry into the origins of anime labour practices {{and the rise of}} Japanese neoliberalism, this paper explores attempts to answer these questions. Through case studies, industry data, and published interviews, this paper examines current precarious labour conditions for <b>animators</b> in Japan, and how <b>animators</b> often consent to exploitative working conditions through misconceptions about artistic labour. This paper will also highlight some small but substantial ways <b>animators</b> resist exploitation and present some recommendations for combating the rise of precarious work in this sector of the cultural industries...|$|R
