2500|$|The {{issue of}} <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> {{payments}} {{was a national}} and serious one. [...] By 1984, about 5 percent of employees at work sites covered by a union contract had opted not to join the union and instead pay an <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b> In 1987, {{the same number of}} workers covered by CWA contracts were <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers. At the time of the Beck case in 1987, a majority of unions had set the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> about equal to full union dues. More than 90 percent of all collective bargaining agreements (covering six million workers) made under the authority of the NLRA contained an <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> provision.|$|R
25|$|The 20 workers sought relief {{on three}} claims: 1) That the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> {{was too high}} to cover only {{collective}} bargaining activities as authorized by NLRA Section 8(a)(3); 2) That the high <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> breached the CWA's duty of fair representation; and 3) That the high <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> violated the workers' First Amendment rights.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, the Court held in Pattern Makers v. NLRB, 473 U.S. 95, that a union member may resign at {{any time}} without notice. Pattern Makers further {{undermined}} the union shop by giving workers the right to resign from the union {{at any time}} and incur no penalty (such as termination). The Court also crafted additional rules regarding <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> in Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U.S. 292 (1986). In Teachers, the union had failed to minimize the risk that <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> might be used for impermissible purposes and had failed to provide <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers with adequate information about how the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> was calculated. Now the Supreme Court imposed a third requirement, that <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers must be offered a timely, fair, and objective mechanism for challenging the computation of <b>agency</b> <b>fees.</b> The Court did uphold, however, the use of interest-bearing escrow accounts for holding disputed dues.|$|R
2500|$|Similarly, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had had {{occasion}} since 1945 {{to address the}} union shop and <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> issues. Among its key cases was In re Union Starch & Refining Co., 87 NLRB 779, (1949). [...] The Board held in Union Starch that unions were permitted to charge nonmembers <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> that were nearly equal to full union dues so long as these <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> were uniform in nature and no additional requirements were made in violation of NLRA Section 8(a)(3)(B) or §8(b)(2). A second important case, Teamsters Local No. 959, 167 NLRB 1042 (1967), the Board concluded that special assessments or fees could {{not be part of}} the <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b> Reacting to the Supreme Court's ruling in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, the Board held in Detroit Mailers Union No. 40, 192 NLRB 951 (1971) that certain fraternal activities may be included in the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> so long as they are not special assessments. The Board also ruled repeatedly {{on a number of issues}} associated with <b>agency</b> <b>fees.</b> It held in several cases that the NLRA does not permit the collection of assessments through the <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b> The RLA, in contrast, does. The Board also held that when determining what an assessment is, facts (not labels) matter most.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the years}} {{just before the}} Supreme Court took up the Beck case, however, it {{elaborated}} on its previous <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> rulings. [...] In Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U.S. 435 (1984), the Supreme Court concluded that the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> may only cover those activities {{directly related to the}} union's role as a collective bargaining representative. [...] These included national conventions (where dues levels were set and union programs debated and established), social activities (which enhanced union solidarity, especially during negotiations), grievance handling, contract negotiation costs, and union communications, but excluded union organizing activities. The Court in Ellis also wrestled with the issue of rebates, and concluded that a union could not simply rebate <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> to workers for that would essentially constitute a forced, interest-free loan from the worker to the union. In 1985, the Court held in Pattern Makers v. NLRB, 473 U.S. 95 (1985), that a union member may resign at any time without notice. Thus, Pattern Makers further undermined the union shop by giving workers the right to resign from the union at any time and incur no penalty (such as termination of employment). [...] The Court also crafted additional rules regarding <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> in Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U.S. 292 (1986). In Teachers, the union had failed to minimize the risk that <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> might be used for impermissible purposes and had failed to provide <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers with adequate information about how the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> was calculated. Now the Supreme Court imposed a third requirement, that <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers must be offered a timely, fair, and objective mechanism for challenging the computation of <b>agency</b> <b>fees.</b> The Court did uphold, however, the use of interest-bearing escrow accounts for holding disputed dues.|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} its constitutional and equity analysis to public employees in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209 (1977), holding that, where public employee collective bargaining exists and <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> clauses are clearly authorized by law, public employee <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> mechanisms also are constitutional. In Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U.S. 435 (1984), the Supreme Court {{concluded that the}} <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> may only cover those activities {{directly related to the}} union's role as a collective bargaining representative. These included national conventions (where dues levels were set and union programs debated and established), social activities (which enhanced union solidarity, especially during negotiations), grievance handling, contract negotiation costs, and union communications, but excluded union organizing activities.

2500|$|According to CSA's Department of Labor records since 2005, {{about half}} of the union's {{membership}} are considered retirees, with eligibility to vote in the union. CSA contracts also often cover some non-members, known as <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers, which usually number comparatively about 2% {{of the size of the}} union's membership.

25|$|A {{number of}} legal {{scholars}} {{who support the}} outcome of the ruling nonetheless criticize the Supreme Court's approach to Beck's First Amendment challenge. These scholars strongly criticize the Court for not deciding the case on First Amendment grounds, and argue that a constitutional ruling on <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> issues would provide for clearer decisions, a sounder basis for workers to challenge <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> calculations, and enhanced free speech rights not only for dissenting workers but for all employees.|$|R
5000|$|According to UFT's Department of Labor records since 2005, when {{membership}} classifications {{were first}} reported, about 32% of the union's membership are considered retirees, with eligibility {{to vote in}} the union.

50|$|An agency-shop {{agreement}} is concluded {{by a majority}} union and an employer or an employers’ organisation—concluded, that is, {{by way of a}} collective agreement. The employer must deduct an agreed <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> from the salaries of the employees identified in the agreement. In this regard, {{it is important to note}} that it may be deducted only from those who are not members of the union but also from those who are eligible for membership. Conscientious objectors to the policies of the union (on religious or moral grounds) must pay the fee; the fee, in turn, must be paid into a fund administered by the DoL. The fee that non-members pay must not be higher than the subscription fee payable by members of the majority union. <b>Agency</b> <b>fees</b> are paid over to a separate account and may be used only for the benefit of all employees at the workplace. <b>Agency</b> <b>fees</b> may not be used for political affiliation and may not be used for any purpose other than advancing or protecting the socioeconomic interests of employees. The employer may deduct <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> from the wages of employees without their authorisation.|$|R
50|$|According to SEIU's Department of Labor records since 2005 (when {{membership}} classifications {{were first}} reported) about 2% of the union's membership are considered retirees, with eligibility {{to vote in}} the union. SEIU contracts also cover some non-members, known as <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers, which since 2005 have numbered comparatively about one tenth {{of the size of the}} union's membership. As of 2014 this accounts for about 35,000 retirees and about 180,000 non-members paying <b>agency</b> <b>fees,</b> compared to about 1.8 million regular members.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on May 31, 1987. In a {{surprising}} move, the U.S. Department of Justice supported CWA's appeal. The Solicitor General at the time, Charles Fried, {{argued that the}} voluntary nature of collective bargaining agreements (including <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> clauses) made the issue of coercion moot. Because states could and did ban <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> agreements, there was no governmental action {{on which to base}} a constitutional claim against the union. And because Section 8(a)3 plainly requires uniform dues and fees (e.g., unions could not charge <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers more nor less than regular members), the Justice Department felt Beck's claim was justified. Upset by the Justice Department's stand, Republican Senators Jesse Helms, Dan Quayle, Steve Symms, and Strom Thurmond filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Supreme Court to rule in Beck's favor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{high court}} also confronted {{the issue of}} remedy (how can non-members {{challenge}} the calculation of <b>agency</b> <b>fees)</b> in Machinists v. Street, and outlined several options which unions and employers might adopt (as well as rejecting remedies which the district court in the case had chosen). [...] Making its first private sector ruling in NLRB v. General Motors Corp., 373 U.S. 734 (1963), the Court held that <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> equal to dues are not prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act. Nonetheless, in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 373 U.S. 746 (1963), the Court questioned whether an <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> set at a level equal to member dues was unfair because it set collective bargaining fees higher for non-members than for members. After reargument, however, the Court in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96 (1963), did not reach the issue again and instead decided the case on narrow procedural grounds (concluding that Florida's right-to-work law outlawed the union shop provision at issue). The Court further elaborated {{on the issue of}} remedies in Railway Clerks v. Allen, 373 U.S. 113 (1963), allowing <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers to opt out of all political expenditures rather than enunciate specific examples, but refusing to allow non-members to act as a class.|$|R
5000|$|According to GCC's Department of Labor records since 2006, when {{membership}} classifications {{were first}} reported, the [...] "active" [...] {{membership of the}} union has fallen from 60% to 45%. The other—now 55%—half of the union's membership are classified as [...] "honorary," [...] and are described as retirees who pay no dues and are ineligible {{to vote in the}} union. GCC contracts also cover some non-members, known as <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers, which since 2006 have numbered comparatively less than a percent {{of the size of the}} union's membership, or about 100 non-members paying <b>agency</b> <b>fees.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to LIUNA's Department of Labor records since 2005, when {{membership}} classifications {{were first}} reported, the union's membership {{has been in}} a slow decline across all categories except [...] "retired" [...] members, which reports a slight increase during the period. The most drastic decline, by over half, has been in [...] "mail handlers associate" [...] members, which is the second largest category of members and the only category reported as ineligible to vote in the union. LIUNA contracts also cover some non-members, known as <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers, which since 2006 have numbered comparatively less than 1% {{of the size of the}} union's membership. <b>Agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers have also fallen by about half of its reported number, although comparatively marginal throughout. As of 2013 this accounts for about 90,000 [...] "mail handler associates" [...] (16%), 68,000 [...] "retirees" [...] (12%) and 38,000 [...] "mail handler regulars" [...] (7%), plus less than 2,000 non-members paying <b>agency</b> <b>fees,</b> compared to about 362,000 [...] "regular" [...] members (65%).|$|R
2500|$|Brennan next {{turned to}} the workers' first two claims. [...] The {{majority}} noted that NLRA Section 8(a)(3) contains two provisions which clearly permit <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> agreements. For the majority, [...] "The statutory question presented in this case, then, is whether this 'financial core' includes the obligation to support union activities beyond those germane to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. We think it does not." [...] The majority reviewed the Court's previous decision in Machinists v. Street and found it controlling. The majority further concluded that Section 8(a)(3) and Section 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act were statutorily equivalent. The majority reviewed at length the legislative history of both the Railway Labor Act and the National Labor Relations Act to provide support for this conclusion, and to show why in each case Congress had approved of <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> agreements. Relying on the Court's analysis of the Railway Labor Act in Street, the Supreme Court said CWA was not justified in concluding that Section 8(a)(3) permits the collection of <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> {{in excess of the}} amount necessary to cover the costs of collective bargaining. The majority further found that the legislative history of the NLRA, the Taft-Hartley Act, and the Railway LAbor Act (RLA) showed that Congress intended to restrict <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> agreements to cover collective bargaining alone and no other purposes.|$|R
2500|$|According to NYSUT's Department of Labor records, about 33%, or a third, of the union's total {{membership}} {{are considered}} retirees, with eligibility {{to vote in}} the union. Other, voting ineligible, classifications include [...] "special constituency" [...] (2%) and [...] "at-large" [...] (1%). NYSUT contracts also cover some non-members, known as <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers, which number comparatively about 4% {{of the size of the}} union's membership. This accounts for 203,427 [...] "retiree," [...] 12,663 [...] "special constituency," [...] and 7,731 [...] "at-large" [...] members, plus 23,365 non-members paying <b>agency</b> <b>fees,</b> compared to 388,476 [...] "in-service" [...] members.|$|R
5000|$|Nonetheless, legal {{scholars}} have been {{highly critical of}} the Supreme Court's ruling in Davenport. As one legal scholar (who is {{highly critical of the}} <b>agency</b> <b>fee),</b> has said, [...] "Correctly understood, this decision promises little and delivers even less because it fails to deal decisively and comprehensively with the issues that both earlier private sector and public sector union dues disputes illuminated but failed to settle." [...] Other {{legal scholars}} have criticized Justice Scalia's judicial reasoning in Davenport, concluding that he should have ruled solely on First Amendment grounds and overturned the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> law entirely.|$|R

25|$|Harry Beck was a {{maintenance}} worker with the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. (C) in Maryland and a CWA organizer. Beck protested {{the use of}} his union dues for a political cause in which he did not believe and asked for a refund. The CWA refused, arguing that using union dues for political expenditures was appropriate and legal. In the early 1970s, after disagreeing with national CWA officials over a union organizing drive in suburban Baltimore, Maryland, Beck resigned from the union and began to pay the $10-a-month <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b> Beck continued to protest {{the use of his}} <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> for political purposes, and asked the CWA to provide a more accurate accounting of how much money it spent on politics. The union refused. In June 1976, Beck and 19 other non-union members of the CWA's bargaining unit at C sued the union for a refund. The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation provided legal counsel and support to Beck and the other 18 workers. Beck quit C in 1979 and moved to Oregon, where he worked at CWA-organized job at American Telephone & Telegraph and continued to pay his <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|R
25|$|U.S. District Court Judge James R. Miller, Jr. {{ruled in}} favor of Beck and the 19 other co-plaintiffs in March 1983. Beck et al. claimed that CWA had not only {{breached}} its duty of fair representation but had also violated the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers' First Amendment rights as enunciated by the Supreme Court in Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson. Applying the clear and convincing evidence standard, the district court found that CWA could not show that 21 percent of the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> was spent on collective bargaining purposes alone, ordered an immediate refund of all dues collected since January 1976, and directed CWA to establish a record-keeping system which segregated collective bargaining and non-collective bargaining accounts. The refund was about $5,000 for all 20 workers.|$|R
25|$|Prospects for {{addition}} {{initiatives and}} legislation {{at the federal}} and state level appear mixed as of 2009. Former Federal Election Commission Chair Bradley A. Smith (who opposes compulsory unionism) has argued that even the most stringent laws are unlikely to have any impact, as the number of <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers is small compared to the number of union members. At least one legal scholar has questioned the constitutionality of paycheck protection laws, while another, detailed analysis of the Washington state effort has concluded that instead of decreasing the amount of union dues available for political expenditures paycheck protection actually increased it (from approximately $630,000 to approximately $780,000) as unions shifted member dues internally to account for the <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> going toward collective bargaining.|$|R
