500|$|Tammy's {{storm surge}} was {{approximately}} [...] <b>and</b> <b>caused</b> salt-water flooding {{along the coast}} of northeastern Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. The surge damages boardwalks along the coast, <b>and</b> wave action <b>causes</b> over 2feet (0.6m) of beach erosion. In addition to the flooding, Tropical Storm Tammy spawned one tornado. Rated an F0 tornado, it touched down near Brunswick, Georgia were it snapped trees <b>and</b> <b>caused</b> moderate roof damage along its 2mi (3.2km) path. The storm's total damage was estimated at around $30million (2005USD). The outer bands of Tammy brought heavy rains, peaking around 7in (180mm) in places, <b>and</b> <b>caused</b> significant beach erosion. Winds along the coastline gusted up to 59mph (95km/h), downing numerous trees. The worst damage occurred in Beaufort County where 30 trees were downed, one of which fell on a home. Rough seas undermined several beach homes <b>and</b> <b>caused</b> one to be condemned.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Pauline {{produced}} torrential rainfall {{along the}} Mexican coastline, peaking at 32.62inches (930mm) in Puente Jula. Intense flooding and mudslides {{in some of}} the poorest areas of Mexico killed between 230 and 500people, {{making it one of the}} deadliest Eastern Pacific storms in recorded history. The passage of the hurricane destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of houses, leaving around 300,000people homeless <b>and</b> <b>causing</b> $447.8million in damage (1997USD).|$|E
5|$|Impact {{during the}} season was {{relatively}} minimal. In early June, Tropical Storm Barbara moved ashore just northwest of the Mexico–Guatemala border, causing $55 million (2007 USD) in damage and 4 deaths. In late July, Cosme passed south of the island of Hawaii as a weakening tropical depression; light rain and increased surf resulted. A few days later, Dalila passed offshore the coastline of southwestern Mexico, killing 11 <b>and</b> <b>causing</b> minimal damage. Hurricane Flossie followed a similar track to Cosme in mid-August, producing gusty winds and light precipitation in Hawaii. Hurricane Henriette in early September produced torrential rainfall in southwestern Mexico, killing 6 <b>and</b> <b>causing</b> $25 million in damage. Baja California received moderate rains from Hurricane Ivo in mid-September, though no damage nor fatalities were reported. In mid-October, Tropical Storm Kiko passed just offshore the coastline of southwestern Mexico. Though no deaths were reported on the Mexico mainland, the storm capsized a ship with 30 people on board, 15 of whom were recovered dead, and 9 of whom were reported missing. Overall, the season ended with $80 million in damage and 49 deaths.|$|E
