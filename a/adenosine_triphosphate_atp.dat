5|$|Helicases are {{proteins}} {{that are a}} type of molecular motor. They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates, predominantly <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP),</b> to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands. These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.|$|E
5|$|In some species, the {{luciferase}} requires other cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions, {{and sometimes}} also the energy-carrying molecule <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP).</b> In evolution, luciferins vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, {{is found in}} eleven different animal (phyla), though in some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species, and consequently bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP).</b> In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E
50|$|The ATP test is {{a process}} of rapidly {{measuring}} actively growing microorganisms through detection of <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> or <b>ATP.</b>|$|R
50|$|As a short-chain fatty acid, {{butyrate}} is {{utilized by}} mitochondria as an energy (i.e., <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> or <b>ATP)</b> source through fatty acid metabolism.|$|R
50|$|ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes encode for two {{proteins}} sterolin-1 and -2, respectively. Sterolin-1 and -2 are two ‘half’ <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> binding (<b>ATP)</b> cassette (ABC) transporters {{which found}} to be indispensable for the regulation of sterol absorption and excretion. Mutations in either genes result in a lipid disorder, sitosterolemia.|$|R
5|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2), {{adenosine}} monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate groups (PP) are released as waste products. Luciferase catalyzes the reaction, {{which may be}} mediated by cofactors such as calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium (Mg2+) ions, and for some types of luciferin (L) also the energy-carrying molecule <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP).</b> The reaction can occur either inside or outside the cell. In bacteria such as Aliivibrio, the expression of genes related to bioluminescence {{is controlled by the}} lux operon.|$|E
5|$|When {{combined}} with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including sugars, lignans, chitins, alcohols, fats, and aromatic esters, carotenoids and terpenes. With nitrogen it forms alkaloids, {{and with the}} addition of sulfur also it forms antibiotics, amino acids, and rubber products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms DNA and RNA, the chemical-code carriers of life, and <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP),</b> the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.|$|E
5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP),</b> {{the universal}} energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E
50|$|On December 28, 2012 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} bedaquiline (marketed as Sirturo by Johnson & Johnson) {{to treat}} multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, {{the first new}} treatment in 40 years. Sirturo {{is to be used}} in a combination therapy for patients who have failed standard treatment and have no other options. Sirturo is an <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> synthase (<b>ATP</b> synthase) inhibitor.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> or <b>ATP,</b> {{acts as a}} {{free energy}} [...] "currency" [...] in all living organisms. In a {{spontaneous}} dephosphorylation reaction 30.5 kJ/mol is released, which is harnessed to drive cellular reactions. Overall, nonspontaneous reactions coupled to the dephosphorylation of ATP are spontaneous, due to the negative free energy change of the coupled reaction. This is important in driving oxidative phosphorylation. ATP is dephosphorylated to ADP and inorganic phosphate.|$|R
50|$|The binding and cyclizing of <b>adenosine</b> 5’ <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP)</b> to the {{catalytic}} {{active site}} of the enzyme is coordinated by two metal cations. The catalytic activity of sAC is increase {{by the presence of}} manganese Mn2+. sAC magnesium Mg2+ activity is regulated by calcium Ca2+ which increases the affinity for ATP of mammalian sAC. In addition, bicarbonate HCO−3 releases ATP-Mg2+ substrate inhibition and increases Vmax of the enzyme.|$|R
5|$|Archaea {{exhibit a}} great variety of {{chemical}} reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released is used to generate <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP)</b> through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP).</b> Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
5|$|Different glands are {{specialized}} {{for different}} pheromones to attract mates. Pheromones from species of Rutelinae are produced from epithelial cells lining the inner {{surface of the}} apical abdominal segments; amino acid-based pheromones of Melolonthinae are produced from eversible glands on the abdominal apex. Other species produce different types of pheromones. Dermestids produce esters, and species of Elateridae produce fatty acid-derived aldehydes and acetates. To attract a mate, fireflies (Lampyridae) use modified fat body cells with transparent surfaces backed with reflective uric acid crystals to produce light by bioluminescence. Light production is highly efficient, by oxidation of luciferin catalyzed by enzymes (luciferases) {{in the presence of}} <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP)</b> and oxygen, producing oxyluciferin, carbon dioxide, and light.|$|E
25|$|Nrf2 transcriptionally regulates {{multiple}} genes that play both {{direct and indirect}} roles in producing antioxidative potential {{and the production of}} cellular energy (i.e., <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> or <b>ATP)</b> within the mitochondria. Consequently, unlike exogenously administered antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E or Coenzyme Q10), which provide a specific and finite antioxidative potential, omaveloxolone, through Nrf2, broadly activates intracellular and mitochondrial antioxidative pathways, in addition to pathways that may directly increase mitochondrial biogenesis (such as PGC1α) and bioenergetics.|$|R

5|$|Hydrogen cyanide is a {{poisonous}} gas that interferes with cellular respiration. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP)</b> by binding {{to one of}} the proteins involved in the electron transport chain. This protein, cytochrome c oxidase, contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, heme a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand pi bonding. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide complex, the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the heme group no longer accept them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP. In a human weighing , death occurs within two minutes of inhaling 70mg of hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{experiments}} using minced muscle cells {{demonstrated that}} cellular respiration using one oxygen atom can form two <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP)</b> molecules, and, in 1941, {{the concept of}} the phosphate bonds of ATP being a form of energy in cellular metabolism was developed by Fritz Albert Lipmann. In the following years, the mechanism behind cellular respiration was further elaborated, although its link to the mitochondria was not known. The introduction of tissue fractionation by Albert Claude allowed mitochondria to be isolated from other cell fractions and biochemical analysis to be conducted on them alone. In 1946, he concluded that cytochrome oxidase and other enzymes responsible for the respiratory chain were isolated to the mitchondria. Eugene Kennedy and Albert Lehninger discovered in 1948 that mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes. Over time, the fractionation method was further developed, improving the quality of the mitochondria isolated, and other elements of cell respiration were determined to occur in the mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|In human cells, and {{eukaryotic}} {{cells in}} general, DNA {{is found in}} two cellular locations— inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP)</b> via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
50|$|Warburg {{hypothesized}} that cancer growth {{is caused by}} tumor cells generating energy (as, e.g., <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> / <b>ATP)</b> mainly by anaerobic breakdown of glucose (known as fermentation, or anaerobic respiration). This {{is in contrast to}} healthy cells, which mainly generate energy from oxidative breakdown of pyruvate. Pyruvate is an end product of glycolysis, and is oxidized within the mitochondria. Hence, and according to Warburg, cancer should be interpreted as a mitochondrial dysfunction.|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} and synthesized a new hydrogelator Nap-FFGEY (1), which forms a supramolecular hydrogel. A kinase/phosphatase switch is used to control the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the hydrogelator and to regulate the formation of supramolecular hydrogels. Adding a kinase to the hydrogel induces a gel-sol phase transition {{in the presence of}} <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphates</b> (<b>ATP)</b> because the tyrosine residue is converted into tyrosine phosphate by the kinase to give a more hydrophilic molecule of Nap-FFGEY-P(O) (OH) (2) (2); treating the resulting solution with a phosphatase transforms 2 back to 1 and restores the hydrogel. Electron micrographs of the hydrogels indicate that 1 self-assembles into nanofibers. Subcutaneous injection of 2 in mice shows that 80. 5 (+/-) 1. 2 % of 2 turns into 1 and results {{in the formation of the}} supramolecular hydrogel of 1 in vivo. This simple biomimetic approach for regulating the states of supramolecular hydrogels promises a new way to design and construct biomaterials...|$|R
5000|$|An obligate aerobe is an {{organism}} that requires oxygen to grow. [...] Through cellular respiration, these organisms use oxygen to metabolise substances, like sugars or fats, to obtain energy. In {{this type of}} respiration, oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor for the electron transport chain. [...] Aerobic respiration {{has the advantage of}} yielding more energy (<b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> or <b>ATP)</b> than fermentation or anaerobic respiration, but obligate aerobes are subject to high levels of oxidative stress.|$|R

25|$|Then in 1997, Paul D. Boyer won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for {{discovering}} how cells make <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP).</b> Boyer was on {{the faculty}} of the biochemistry department from 1945-1957.|$|E
25|$|Complex sugars {{consumed}} by the organism {{can be broken down}} into simpler sugar molecules called monosaccharides such as glucose. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP),</b> a molecule that possesses readily available energy, through two different pathways.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, {{specifically}} those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP diphosphohydrolase (diphosphate-forming).

This enzyme participates in purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism.|$|R

However, no alteration was noted in the activity of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). The chronic administration of 50 % ethanol in a dose of 2 - 5 g/kg for two weeks did not affect either the ATP content or ATPase activity in jejunal mucosa...|$|R
5000|$|The {{mitochondria}} {{are vital}} to the efficiency of eukaryotes. These organelles breakdown simple sugars like glucose to create a multitude of <b>ATP</b> (<b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate)</b> molecules. <b>ATP</b> provides the energy for protein synthesis, which takes about 75% of the cell’s energy, {{as well as other}} cellular processes like signaling pathways. [...] Present in a cell’s endoplasm, the number of mitochondria varies based on the cell’s metabolic needs. Cells that must make a large amount of proteins or breakdown a lot of material require a large amount of mitochondria. Glucose is broken down through three sequential processes: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain.|$|R
25|$|Arginine is {{synthesized}} from citrulline in arginine and proline metabolism by the sequential {{action of}} the cytosolic enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). This is an energetically costly process, because for each molecule of argininosuccinate that is synthesized, one molecule of <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP)</b> is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), consuming two ATP equivalents.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} genetic {{material}} of the cell, nucleic acids often {{play a role}} as second messengers, as well as forming the base molecule for <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP),</b> the primary energy-carrier molecule found in all living organisms. Also, the nitrogenous bases possible in the two nucleic acids are different: adenine, cytosine, and guanine occur in both RNA and DNA, while thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil occurs in RNA.|$|E
25|$|Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA or mDNA) is the DNA {{located in}} mitochondria, {{cellular}} organelles within eukaryotic cells that convert chemical energy from food {{into a form}} that cells can use, <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (<b>ATP).</b> Mitochondrial DNA {{is only a small}} portion of the DNA in a eukaryotic cell; most of the DNA can be found in the cell nucleus and, in plants and algae, also in plastids such as chloroplasts.|$|E
5000|$|Warburg's {{hypothesis}} was postulated by the Nobel laureate Otto Heinrich Warburg in 1924. He hypothesized that cancer, malignant growth, and tumor growth {{are caused by}} the fact that tumor cells mainly generate energy (as e.g., <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> / <b>ATP)</b> by non-oxidative breakdown of glucose (a process called glycolysis). This is in contrast to [...] "healthy" [...] cells which mainly generate energy from oxidative breakdown of pyruvate. Pyruvate is an end-product of glycolysis, and is oxidized within the mitochondria. Hence, according to Warburg, the driver of cancer cells should be interpreted as stemming from a lowering of mitochondrial respiration. Warburg reported a fundamental difference between normal and cancerous cells to be the ratio of glycolysis to respiration; this observation is also known as the Warburg effect.|$|R
