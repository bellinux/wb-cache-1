I now told the Quaker, as she was sitting at work in her parlour, that we should very speedily leave her, and although she daily expected it, yet she was really sorry to hear that we had come to a full determination; she said abundance of fine things to me on the happiness of the life I did then, and was going to live; believing, I suppose, that a countess could not have a foul conscience; but at that very instant, I would have, had it been in my power, resigned husband, estate, title, and all the blessings she fancied I had in the world, only for her real virtue, and the sweet peace of mind, joined to a loving company of children, which she really possessed.|$|R

He {{commanded}} ten galleons, four galleys and various smaller vessels. The flagship was the 1,700-ton San Marcos. The fleet carried 5,000 men, both soldiers and sailors, including nearly 2,000 Spaniards and a unit of Japanese infantry, which numbered at 500. It also carried 300 artillery pieces and 6 Jesuits. It was the largest European armada yet seen in the region.|$|R

40|$|Signal {{cancellation}} is {{a serious}} problem in adaptive nulling. The problem arises when the actual direction <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the signal is slightly off the assumed direction <b>of</b> <b>arrival.</b> The adaptive algorithms consider the actual signal a jammer as the direction <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> is not exactly specified. In this paper, it is shown how to prevent signal cancellation when the direction <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> is not known exactly. Multiple look direction constraints are used to prevent signal cancellation. This paper outlines the principles and illustrates how this concept can be incorporated in an adaptive nulling situation using a deterministic direct data domain approach. � 1998 Academic Press 1...|$|R
