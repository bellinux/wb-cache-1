50|$|An <b>advising</b> <b>bank</b> (also {{known as}} a notifying bank) advises a {{beneficiary}} (exporter) that a letter of credit (L/C) opened by an issuing bank for an applicant (importer) is available. An advising bank's responsibility is to authenticate the letter of credit issued by the issuer to avoid fraud. The <b>advising</b> <b>bank</b> is not necessarily responsible for the payment of the credit which it advises the beneficiary of. The <b>advising</b> <b>bank</b> is usually located in the beneficiary's country. It can be (1) a branch office of the issuing bank or a correspondent bank, or (2) a bank appointed by the beneficiary. An important point is the beneficiary has to be comfortable with the <b>advising</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|E

50|$|In case (2), the {{beneficiary}} can request the applicant to specify his/her bank ({{the beneficiary}}'s bank) as the <b>advising</b> <b>bank</b> in an L/C application. In many countries, this is {{beneficial to the}} beneficiary, who may avail themselves of the reduced bank charges and fees because of special relationships with the bank. Under normal circumstances, advising charges are standard and minimal. In addition, {{it is more convenient}} to deal with the beneficiary's own bank over a bank with which the beneficiary does not maintain an account.|$|E
50|$|A {{letter of}} credit or LC can also {{be the source of}} payment for a transaction, meaning that redeeming the {{letter of credit}} will pay an exporter. Letters of credit are used {{primarily}} in international trade transactions of significant value, for deals between a supplier in one country and a customer in another. They are also used in the land development process to ensure that approved public facilities (streets, sidewalks, stormwater ponds, etc.) will be built. The parties to a letter of credit are usually a beneficiary who is to receive the money, the issuing bank of whom the applicant is a client, and the <b>advising</b> <b>bank</b> of whom the beneficiary is a client. Almost all letters of credit are irrevocable, i.e., cannot be amended or canceled without prior agreement of the beneficiary, the issuing bank and the confirming bank, if any. In executing a transaction, letters of credit incorporate functions common to giros and traveler's cheque. Typically, the documents a beneficiary has to present in order to receive payment include a commercial invoice, bill of lading, and a document proving the shipment was insured against loss or damage in transit. However, the list and form of documents is open to imagination and negotiation and might contain requirements to present documents issued by a neutral third party evidencing the quality of the goods shipped, or their place of origin.|$|E
40|$|Letter of Credit, {{a payment}} method in the export-import {{transaction}} {{which is considered}} as the safe one, in its implementation has some deviations and problems which cause an L/C not to run smoothly. This problem {{is closely related to}} the responsibility of the stakeholders that are involved in it. The problem of the research was how about the responsibility of <b>advising</b> <b>bank</b> in paying for goods by using letter of credit. The case occurred in The Development Bank of Singapore (DBS Bank), Jakarta. Here, the L/C transaction occurred between importer and exporter through their banks respectively. However, when the goods arrived at the importer 2 ̆ 7 s warehouse, they were not matched with the ordered ones. The importer ordered coconut shell charcoal, but he received the charcoal waste. The importer then asked the <b>Advising</b> <b>Bank</b> to refund them. The research used judicial normative method. Secondary data were gathered by conducting library research and scrutinizing all legal provisions related to L/C, along with conducting interviews with source persons {{in order to get the}} information. The gathered data were analyzed qualitatively. The result of the research, concerning the responsibility of the <b>Advising</b> <b>Bank,</b> shows that the Bank could reject the refund for the L/C because it is only responsible for the things stipulated in Article 34 UCP 600, as long as the documents, in the front view, are in line with the explanation in the L/C documents. When there is a fraud as what occurs in the case above, the bank is not responsible for the form, completeness, originality, forgery, or legal consequences of any document or of the condition mentioned in the document or any addition in the document. The bank is not also responsible for the explanation, the amount, weight, quality, condition, packaging, delivery, value, or the content of the goods attached in the original document. Along with UCP 600, in Article 5, the responsibility of the <b>Advising</b> <b>Bank</b> is limited in the document matters, not in the content of the shipped goods...|$|E

40|$|MBA 2012 ABSTRACT The {{research}} had three main objectives: firstly to establish if acquirers in Mergers and Acquisition (M&A) deals find value in M&A <b>advising</b> <b>banks,</b> secondly {{to determine what}} selection criteria acquirers use when deciding which advisor to select, and thirdly to determine some sort of ordering of these factors of the selection criteria of acquirers. The data for this research was collected using a survey questionnaire. The questions were informed by {{a review of the}} recent literature on the topic of M&As. The data was subjected to various statistical analysis techniques including ranking, averaging and factor analysis. The main finding of the research was that 90 per cent of acquirers still see value in using M&A <b>advising</b> <b>banks</b> on deals and find them especially useful where acquirers {{do not have access to}} the specialised intellectual capital that M&A <b>advising</b> <b>banks</b> have. The other important finding is that costs remain a key factor in explaining the selection process, but that costs, whether high or low, are not indicative of the quality acquirers perceive to get from advisors. Acquirers are looking to M&A advisors to show commitment to deals and deliver on their promises...|$|R

40|$|Commercial {{letters of}} credit {{facilitate}} {{the movement of}} goods into the channels of trade. A letter of credit is a written undertaking by a bank (issuing bank), acting at the request and on the instructions of its customer (applicant for the credit) to make payment to, or to the order of, a third party (the beneficiary). For a credit to be transferable, the exporter must arrange for the importer to have a credit opened expressly stipulating that is transferable. A beneficiary may require financing in order to complete the manufacturing of merchandise or to purchase items to fill a particular order. A red clause credit helps achieve this. The applicant and beneficiary may wish to have a letter of credit structured to satisfy a long term contract requiring the constant supply of merchandise over a specific time period. This can be accomplished with a revolving letter of credit. Key words: letter of credit, issuing bank, <b>advising</b> <b>bank,</b> payments, negotiatio...|$|E

40|$|This study extents the {{literature}} of the <b>advising</b> <b>bank’s</b> positive influence on the performance in mergers and acquisitions by modeling the expertise of banks on the industry level while considering two levels of endogeneity. The first level of endogeneity is caused by the most experienced banks being selected into the largest and most complex transactions with the lowest returns. The second level of endogeneity is caused by the observability of the influence of the bank’s industry expertise on the performance only when the acquirer decided to employ a bank as advisor and to choose that bank in particular. Along the acquisition sequence the bank that is most familiar with the acquirer and that has the highest industry expertise in the acquirer’s and target’s industries is most likely to be chosen as advisor. The choice of the <b>advising</b> investment <b>bank</b> based on its industry expertise and its access to the acquirer’s private information has a positive influence on the acquirer’s returns. In the analysis of the alternative advisor choice by endogenous switching the employment of a more experienced bulge-bracket bank would have resulted in higher returns in transactions <b>advised</b> by non-bulge-bracket <b>banks</b> or that are unadvised. The analysis shows that the matching of the most experienced banks with the largest and most frequent serial acquirers in the most complex transactions is efficient in terms of higher returns and a higher completion probability...|$|R
