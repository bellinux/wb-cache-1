5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{the area around}} the station became known for its seedy and downmarket character, and was used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> for several films as a result. There was major {{redevelopment}} in the 21st century, including restoration of the original roof, and the station became well known for its association with the Harry Potter books and films, particularly the fictional Platform 9¾.|$|E
5|$|Silver Reef has {{appeared}} in American films since the late 1960s. The area was scouted by corporate executives from Twentieth-Century Fox {{for use in the}} 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> in the 1979 film The Electric Horseman.

5|$|The {{station was}} also a popular subject for photographers.

5|$|Between 1990 and 2011, when Apocalypse {{was known}} as Iron Wolf, there was no theme for the roller coaster. After its {{relocation}} to Six Flags America, to match the new name of the coaster, an {{end of the world}} apocalypse theme was added with fire, crashed planes and zombies located in the queue line and along the layout of the roller coaster. As guests go further in the queue line to the end at the station, it mimics an end of the world apocalypse scenario. The skull from Skull Mountain also serves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> to the ride.|$|E

5|$|Lowell persuaded D. H. Lawrence to {{contribute}} poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes, {{making him the}} only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an Imagist. Marianne Moore also became associated with the group during this period. However, with World War I <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop,</b> the times were not easy for avant-garde literary movements (Aldington, for example, {{spent much of the}} war at the front), and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the Imagists as a movement.|$|E
5|$|Seacoal – a film made by Amber Films in 1985. The {{station is}} {{features}} heavily <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> in the beach scenes, where {{the characters are}} working, collecting seacoal. Photographer Mik Critchlow (who would later become involved with Amber Films' sister company Side Gallery) also documented the seacoalers at Lynemouth, between 1981 and 1983. He also used the power station as an industrial backdrop {{to some of his}} images.|$|E
5|$|Television too {{has used}} Eastbourne <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop.</b> The series Little Britain had the {{character}} Emily Howard strolling along the promenade. Other brief appearances {{were made in}} the television series Agatha Christie's Marple, The Two Ronnies, French and Saunders and Foyle's War. A sequence of sketches that appear in each episode of Bang, Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer, was shot in the old Jo Pip's / Cunninghams theatre venue on Seaside Road, which has since been developed into flats. The 1993 BBC drama series Westbeach was filmed on location in Eastbourne and surrounding areas.|$|E

5|$|The Dibbles' {{house was}} foreclosed around 1897 {{after they were}} unable to pay their taxes, and they moved to Portland, Oregon by 1900. It {{exchanged}} hands several times until 1917, when Gideon and Mary Hart Jones purchased it. The Jones family owned the house until 1933 (and notably added a kitchen which created the west wing of the house); thus, it was the Jones family who allowed Grant Wood to use their home <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> for American Gothic.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{has been}} used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> in commercial films, notably in the 2006 Hollywood film The Break-Up, which had to reshoot several scenes because the sculpture was under cover for the initial filming. It is also prominently featured in the ending scene of Source Code. Director Duncan Jones felt the structure was {{a metaphor for the}} movie's subject matter and aimed for it to be shown {{at the beginning and end}} of the movie. The sculpture served as an aesthetic and symbolic setting for the 2012 film The Vow when the lead characters share a kiss under it.|$|E
5|$|A 5 hours, 9 {{minutes long}} biographical {{documentary}} film, , made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures {{the history of}} those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader. Gandhi was a central figure in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values {{as a metaphor for}} the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal.|$|E
50|$|The fictional {{setting of}} Bloom County served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{recurring}} <b>backdrop</b> for the comic and its sequels, although {{the nature of}} the setting was frequently altered.|$|R

5|$|A luncheon at the U.S.Capitol {{has been}} part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the {{outgoing}} President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and pheasant entrees with Pinot noir wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon sponge cake with sweet cream glacé. Since 1985, a painting has served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was Thomas Hill's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley, a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.|$|E
5|$|Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge {{was painted}} uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. Partially as a result, {{it is now}} a major West London landmark. The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to {{increase}} visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day. At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation. Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> for numerous films set in the Chelsea area, such as A Clockwork Orange, Absolute Beginners, Sliding Doors and Maybe Baby.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{pastiche}} {{of science}} fiction used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop,</b> Red Dwarf is primarily a character-driven comedy, with science fiction elements used as complementary plot devices. In the early episodes, a recurring source of comedy was the Odd Couple-style {{relationship between the two}} central characters of the show, who have an intense dislike for each other yet are trapped together deep in space. The main characters are Dave Lister, the last known human alive, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram of Lister's dead bunkmate. The other regular characters are Cat, a lifeform which evolved from the descendants of Lister's pregnant pet cat Frankenstein; Holly, Red Dwarf's computer (Series I-V, briefly in the final episode of VII, VIII); Kryten, a service mechanoid (Series II-present); and Kristine Kochanski, an alternative-reality version of Lister's long-lost love (Series VII-VIII).|$|E

50|$|Most of Blurt's {{compositions}} feature simple, repetitive, minimalistic guitar and/or saxophone phrases, {{but they}} can also explore more abstract musical territories, often serving <b>as</b> <b>an</b> atmospheric <b>backdrop</b> for Ted Milton's existentialist poetry.|$|R
5000|$|The film is {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> candid documentary {{on a small}} town that [...] "serves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> perfect <b>backdrop</b> which provides <b>a</b> compromising look at our nation's political climate and proves that all politics is truly local".|$|R
