40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>andolast,</b> a new tetrazolyl-benzamido derivative with antiallergic, antiinflammatory, mucosal protective and antisecretive activities, {{have been}} investigated in patients suffering from mild asthma (FEV 170 % of predicted) in whom obstruction was reversible (FEV 1 increase 15 % of initial) after the administration of 0. 2 mg of salbutamol by inhalation. Twelve out-patients (seven males and five females) {{were enrolled in the}} present study and were treated with a single dose of <b>andolast</b> of 2, 4 and 8 mg by inhalation using the MIAT Monohaler® device according to a randomised crossover design. Plasma samples were collected before drug administration and up to 540 min after dosing. <b>Andolast</b> plasma concentrations were determined using a validated LC-MS/MS method with a limit of quantitation of 0. 2 ng ml- 1. Pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out using standard non-compartmental methods. In addition, <b>andolast</b> safety and tolerability were evaluated by performing standard laboratory tests, by recording vital signs and ECGs and by monitoring the occurrence of adverse events throughout the study period. <b>Andolast</b> was absorbed after inhalation and was available to the systemic circulation. The mean peak plasma concentrations were 6. 3, 10. 9 and 30. 5 ng ml- 1 at the three doses, respectively, and occurred at 30, 52. 5 and 30 min (median tmax). The mean AUCt values were 1852, 2889 and 7677 ng min ml- 1. The apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (Vz/F) were, respectively, 1168 ml min- 1 and 430 l at the dose of 2 mg, 1143 ml min- 1 and 468 l at the dose of 4 mg, and 1141 ml min- 1 and 486 l at the dose of 8 mg. The apparent elimination half-life averaged 4. 5, 5. 0 and 4. 6 h at the three doses, respectively. Even though the small number of subjects participating in the present study reduced the power of the statistical test, there was no statistically significant evidence of non-proportionality for all the <b>andolast</b> pharmacokinetic parameters calculated at the three doses. Thus, the data obtained as a whole suggest that <b>andolast</b> pharmacokinetics are dose-independent in the dose range investigated. Finally, the safety and tolerabilty of the drug administered to mild asthmatic patients was good up to the maximum investigated dose of 8 mg...|$|E
40|$|The novel {{coordination}} polymer [Mn(Andolast) (H 2 O) ] {{was isolated}} {{in the form of}} air- and moisture- stable polycrystalline powders by reacting Mn(CH 3 COO) 24 H 2 O and the sodium salt of N- 4 -(1 H- tetrazol- 5 -yl) phenyl- 4 -(1 H-tetrazol- 5 -yl) benzamide (Na 2 <b>Andolast).</b> The crystal structure of [Mn(Andolast) (H 2 O) ], determined by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) structure solution methods, is composed by 1 -D double-chain motifs. The thermal behavior of [Mn(Andolast) (H 2 O) ] was investigated by coupling thermal analyses to variable-temperature PXRD: water evolution takes place in the range 80 – 250 °C with no change of the unit cell parameters up to 180 °C; at 200 °C, a low-crystallinity phase is formed, surviving up to 300 °C. The electronic transition spectroscopic properties of both Na 2 <b>Andolast</b> and the coordination polymer were assessed, with particular care to luminescence: [Mn(Andolast) (H 2 O) ] is luminescent already at room temperature, even if its emission is reduced with respect to that of Na 2 <b>Andolast,</b> mainly {{as a consequence of the}} enhanced rate of non-radiative decay...|$|E
