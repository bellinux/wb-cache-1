We had been really good at being able to compartmentalize <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff.</b> Suppress it with drinking or other extravagances. This {{was the first time}} we had to talk to each other, get to know each other and work stuff out. The cameras were there catching all of it.” ...|$|E

He decided he wanted to do some kind of album cover, and he started talking to Steve O'Rourke, and I think what happened was Steve O'Rourke had in his brilliant mind {{that he was going to}} try something on the internet because he had been listening to me. And he got this guy, cause if you notice <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> can't be traced where it comes from. And I know that Dave for one thing didn't even know how to sign on." ...|$|E

[...] They said, [...] "Obviously, we can't guarantee that," [...] and I said, [...] "Obviously, I can't change the ending."Goldman says the character of Clay [...] "was sympathetic for me. There was a sergeant who was a villain, but I thought Clay was just a nice affable stoop.

5000|$|In a 2012 article {{based on}} Tiffany by Audio Video Revolution, the singer {{spoke of the}} idea behind the New Inside album. She stated [...] "I think that you grow as an artist, and for me, I'm so {{inspired}} {{by a lot of}} different artists.

And then it took me in a different direction with [...] "I Think We're Alone Now," [...] and then all of a sudden I was a pop star. But I loved it. My dreams had come true, but then there was also that side of, [...] "You're a young teen," [...] and there were so many people telling me, [...] "You can't do that now. You can't dress like this. You can't date boys." [...] It was like all of a sudden the world was watching, but it was mainly the corporate world, the business side of it, and it was very frustrating, because my fans were changing; they were growing up. The girls were dressing more sexy; music was changing. Now I'm in a semi-pop dance world, and I'm singing a lot of ballads, which are beautiful, well-written songs, but that's not why people buy tickets to come and see me, and that's not how I came out of the box with people. So that's kind of where [...] "New Inside" [...] came from. I definitely wanted to write. I had changed management at that time, because I was saying, [...] "It's time to grow up. It's time to be a little more edgy. It's time to be a little bit more tuned-in. If we're going to do dance music, then let's really do dance music." [...] I come from a dancer's background. We're not even tapping into <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> that would be a lot of fun for me, and I'm surrounded by a lot of great, talented people. I'm very lucky with that; why don't we use some of this and grow a little bit? A lot of the people I was working with didn't want to do that, so I found a whole new camp." ...|$|E
