40|$|Integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> {{planning}} of embedded systems {{is a task}} often performed by industry experts. The {{reason for this is}} the multi-disciplinary nature of the embedded system, the complexity of the components and their environment and the volatility of the integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plan. The Tangram research project aims at reducing the integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> duration of complex embedded systems, like ASML wafer scanners, without influencing the product quality or cost. Integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> planning is one of the areas where model-based techniques and algorithms can reduce the integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> duration. This paper presents a structured integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> planning method including several improvement cycles. This method is applicable for multi-disciplinary systems and can be used to guide the modeling and optimization effort of industrial-size integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans. This method {{has been used as a}} framework for our research into integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> modeling, sequencing, planning and optimization...|$|R

40|$|The {{complexity}} of semiconductor manufacturing equipment is growing. This growth {{results in a}} complexity increase of the integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> phase of these systems. Simply adding more test resources is not possible anymore, {{because of the cost}} involved. A better design of an integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategy can help to optimize this hectic phase. However, methods to design and evaluate integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategies for multi-disciplinary systems are hardly available. In this paper, we present a method to design and compare integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategies. Following this method, an optimal integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategy can be chosen from a set of possible strategies. A case has been performed where a system is integrated <b>and</b> <b>tested</b> using three different integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategies: a time-to-market-driven strategy, a quality-driven strategy and a combined quality and time-to-market strategy...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plan of a {{newly developed}} or manufactured product often has a typical form in a specific organization. This paper describes a number of typical integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans encountered at various organizations with different business drivers. The integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans are described using the same simple notation. A number of aspects per organization is investigated: a typical integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plan, the organization size, product volume, business drivers, number of components in the product and the used technology. The investigated organizations are grouped according to product complexity and a rough classification of integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans: flexible <b>and</b> regulated integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans. We conclude that flexible integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans are used in time-to-market driven organizations, while regulated plans are used for non-time-to-market driven organizations...|$|R

While none of the band members sustained any major injuries, some shows were cancelled as a result. In December 2002, {{the latter half of the}} German leg of the band's European tour had to be postponed after Liam Gallagher, Alan White and three other members of the band's entourage were arrested after a violent brawl at a Munich nightclub. The band had been drinking heavily <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> showed that Liam had used cocaine. Liam lost two front teeth and kicked a police officer in the ribs, while Alan suffered minor head injuries after getting hit with an ashtray. Two years later Liam was fined around £40,000.

5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E

5|$|The {{launching}} of the steam-powered ship {{of the line}} Napoléon by France in 1850 began an arms race between France and Britain that lasted for a decade. The destruction of a wooden Ottoman fleet by a Russian fleet firing explosive shells in the Battle of Sinop, early in the Crimean War, followed by the destruction of Russian coastal fortifications during the Battle of Kinburn in the Crimean War by French armoured floating batteries, <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> against armour plates, showed the superiority of ironclads over unarmoured ships. France's launching in 1859 of the first ocean-going ironclad warship, the wooden-hulled , upset {{the balance of power}} by neutralising the British investment in wooden ships of the line and started an invasion scare in Britain, as the Royal Navy lacked any ships that could counter Gloire and her two sisters. The situation was perceived to be so serious that Queen Victoria asked the Admiralty if the navy was adequate for the tasks that it would have to perform in wartime.

5|$|At the top-secret Icarus Base, {{the group}} is {{introduced}} to Colonel Everett Young (Louis Ferreira), Colonel David Telford (Lou Diamond Phillips), and First Lieutenant Matthew Scott (Brian J.

An evacuation is begun while the Hammond which is manned by Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) and a squadron of F-302s led by Colonel Telford battle the enemy. Rush, desperate to see his project succeed, enlists Wallace's aid in figuring out what went wrong. Wallace suggests that the final symbol of the address is wrong, and that they should use the symbol for Earth. Rush aborts the dialing sequence to Earth, arguing that the energy release from the exploding planet could follow them through the Gate, <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> the theory, which succeeds. With the planet's unstable core about to go critical and lacking any other means of escape, the remaining survivors in the base (roughly 80 people) are forced to risk heading to an unknown destination. The planet explodes shortly after everyone is evacuated, destroying the three Ha'tak vessels. The Hammond survives, but the fate of those in the base is a mystery to Stargate Command.|$|E
5|$|Project Alberta, {{also known}} as Project A, was formed in March 1945, {{absorbing}} existing groups of Parsons's O Division that were working on bomb preparation and delivery.

Its role was to support the bomb delivery effort. Parsons became the head of Project Alberta, with Ramsey as his scientific and technical deputy, and Ashworth as his operations officer and military alternate. In all, Project Alberta consisted of 51 Army, Navy and civilian personnel. The 1st Technical Service Detachment, to which the personnel of Project Alberta were administratively assigned, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Peer de Silva, and provided security and housing services on Tinian. There were two bomb assembly teams, a Fat Man Assembly Team under Commander Norris Bradbury and Roger Warner, and a Little Boy Assembly Team under Birch. Philip Morrison {{was the head of}} the Pit Crew, Bernard Waldman and Luis Alvarez led the Aerial Observation Team, and Sheldon Dike was in charge of the Aircraft Ordnance Team.

5|$|The suspect (later {{identified}} as David Lace) was discovered when {{the profile of}} the killer showed a partial match on the national database, which belonged to a sibling of a previous suspect. A further sample was taken from another sibling, who was not on the database, to help confirm the match via a process called familial searching. At first the police refused to release the identity of the new prime suspect, except to reveal that he had committed suicide in 1988, and had confessed to DeSimone's murder while in custody for an unrelated crime in 1983, 18 months after Hodgson's conviction. His body was exhumed at Kingston cemetery in Portsmouth on 12 August 2009 in order to compare his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Hampshire Constabulary said the breakthrough in the case was only possible because of advances in forensic science <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> on the body would take six weeks, after which a file on the dead suspect could then be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service. Visitors to the cemetery in Portsmouth said the grave of the suspect had no headstone and was untended.
