50|$|The wild {{water buffalo}} (Bubalus arnee), also called Asian buffalo, <b>Asiatic</b> <b>buffalo</b> and Wild Asian Buffalo, is a large bovine native to the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It has been listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List since 1986, as the {{remaining}} population totals less than 4,000. A population decline of at least 50% {{over the last three}} generations (24-30 years) is projected to continue. The global population has been estimated at 3,400 individuals, of which 3,100 (91%) live in India, mostly in Assam. The {{wild water buffalo}} is the probable ancestor of the domestic water buffalo.|$|E
5000|$|In 1765, Hunter {{bought a}} house near the Earl's Court {{district}} in London. The house had large grounds which were used to house a collection of animals including 'zebra, <b>Asiatic</b> <b>buffaloes</b> and mountain goats', as well as jackals. In the house itself, Hunter boiled down the skeletons {{of some of these}} animals as part of research on animal anatomy. A newspaper article reported that many animals there were 'supposed to be hostile to each other but [...] [...] [...] in this new paradise, the greatest friendship prevails', and this image may have been the inspiration for the Doctor Dolittle literary character.|$|R

50|$|The park {{is managed}} under several {{conservation}} management units {{such as the}} Core Zone, the Buffer Zone, and the Economic Zone. The park {{is known for its}} rare and endangered endemic wildlife such as the tigers, elephants, Assam roofed turtle, hispid hare, golden and capped langurs and pygmy hog, one-horned rhinoceros, <b>Asiatic</b> <b>buffalo,</b> swamp deer, barking deers, leopards, clouded leopards, marbled cats, sloth bears, hoolock gibbons, wild boar, gharials, crocodiles, and river dolphins. Reptiles consist of pythons, common Indian crocodile, common wolf snake, cat snake and many other species. Birds listed include hornbills, common crane, common redshank, Eurasian woodcock, spotted eagles, black-throated diver, little grebe, different types of herons, black ibis, Eurasian sparrowhawk, spot-bellied eagle-owl and several others. The park is home for 22 endangered mammal species. Fish species identified are: katli, jurraha, chenga, telliah, labeo and mahaseer. Conservation measures have been undertaken to prevent poaching, overfishing, encroachments, and many other related issues. These measures are meant to minimise human interference in the fragile core zone, creation of a data base and carry out research on animal and plant populations for better conservation of the ecosystem.|$|E

50|$|The {{lowland anoa}} (Bubalus depressicornis) {{is a small}} bovid, {{standing}} barely over 90 cm at the shoulder. They are also known as anoa de Ilanura or anoa des plaines. It is most closely allied to the larger <b>Asiatic</b> <b>buffaloes,</b> showing the same reversal of {{the direction of the}} hair on their backs. The horns are peculiar for their upright direction and comparative straightness, although they have the same triangular section as in other buffaloes. White spots are sometimes present below the eyes, and there may be white markings on the legs and back; the absence or presence of these white markings may be indicative of distinct races. The horns of the cows are very small. The nearest allies of the anoa appear to be certain extinct buffaloes, the remains of which are found in the Siwalik Hills of northern India. In habits, the animal appears to resemble the Indian buffalo. It is usually solitary, living in lowland forests and wetlands, browsing on plants and understory.|$|R

50|$|Kaziranga {{contains}} significant breeding {{populations of}} 35 mammalian species, of which 15 are threatened as per the IUCN Red List. The park has {{the distinction of}} being home to the world's largest population of the Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros (1,855), wild <b>Asiatic</b> water <b>buffalo</b> (1,666) and eastern swamp deer (468). Significant populations of large herbivores include elephants (1,940), gaur (30) and sambar (58). Small herbivores include the Indian muntjac, wild boar, and hog deer. Kaziranga has the largest population of the Wild water buffalo anywhere accounting for about 57% of the world population.|$|R
40|$|The {{systematic}} {{position of}} the Anoa is discussed, with reference to its nomenclature and taxonomic history. Two distinct types of Anoa are found all over Celebes, a large one with white legs, long tail and rugged horns, and a small one with legs mainly the same colour as the body, short tail and conical horns. There is some indication that the small Anoa inhabits mountainous areas. In {{the absence of any}} evidence of intergradation they must be classed as two distinct species; since the Anoa is closely related to the Indian Buffalo and the Tamarao, the two must be called Bubalus (Anoa) depressicornis and B. (A.) quarlesi. The definitive fusion of vomer to palatines is a long-established character; according to Pilgrim (1939) it was shown already in the Dhok Pathan (Plio-The Anoa is the Dwarf Buffalo of Celebes. While closely similar to the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>Buffalo</b> (Bubalus), many authors (Mohr, 1921; Pilgrim, 1939; Hooijer, 1948, 1950) have regarded the Anoa as forming a genus on its own, Anoa H.

40|$|Although buffalo {{population}} is about 1 / 10 of that of cattle, buffaloes interest a larger human population, {{especially in the}} east countries. For this reason, this species is of great economic importance. Two main species of buffalo {{are found in the}} world: the <b>Asiatic</b> (water) <b>buffalo</b> (Bubalus bubalis) and the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). These two different species have both two different sub-species differing in diploid number but interbreeding within the same genus.

50|$|Shortly after World War II, {{the brown}} tree snake was {{introduced}} to the island of Guam and caused much of the endemic wildlife to become extinct. Due to an abundance of prey species and lack of predators, the brown tree snake’s population exploded and reached nearly 13,000 snakes per square mile at most. Ten out of twelve endemic bird species, ten lizards and two bats all became extinct {{as a result of the}} introduction of the brown tree snake. In recent years, a lot has been done by the U.S. government to decrease the number of brown tree snakes on the island. For instance in 2013, a $1 million program by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service dropped more than 2000 mice filled with poison on the island. In 2013, it is estimated to be more than two million brown tree snakes on the island. Other introduced species include the Philippine deer, the <b>Asiatic</b> water <b>buffalo,</b> the marine toad and the giant African land snail. Several native species of skinks, geckos and monitor lizards are still found on the island.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Asiatic</b> Wild Water <b>Buffalo</b> Bubalus arnee is an {{endangered}} species restricted to South and Southeast Asia. Nepal’s only population survives in the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve which {{is located on the}} floodplain of the Koshi River, a tributary of Ganga. This species is under threat due to high anthropogenic pressure ranging from habitat deterioration to hybridization with domestic buffalo. Yet, the population has grown from 63 in 1976 to 219 in 2009, despite the decline in the calf/cow ratio. The present study conducted in 2009 used the block count method. The count showed the presence of a backcrossed population of 74 in addition to the total of 219 individuals. At present, a number of conservation and livelihood interventions have been undertaken to safeguard the biodiversity, particularly the wild buffalo population in the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve. The community-based sustainable management approach benefiting both conservation and livelihood of local people is necessary to ensure the long term conservation of the specie...|$|R
5000|$|Royal Manas National Park in {{southern}} Bhutan, considered the national heritage of Bhutan, was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1996 and subsequently {{raised to the}} status of a national park in 1993. Covering an area of 9938.54 km2, the area is forested to the extent of 92% and is a well-preserved Eastern Himalayan ecosystem. The park is bounded on its north by the Black Mountain National Park and the Manas Tiger Reserve on its South in India. Within Bhutan, biological corridors linked with the park are the Thrumshingla National Park in the North, Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary in the West, and Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary in the East. As researched so far, the park has a large diversity of tropical grasslands, temperate moist forests, alpine meadows, and scrublands. The various flora and fauna identified in the park are 45 species of mammals, 366 species of birds and 900 species of vascular plants. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is actively working on a conservation management plan in association with local wildlife authorities to preserve and protect this national heritage.Some of the important faunal species identified are: the royal Bengal tiger, elephant, gaur (Bos gaurus), four rare species of golden langur (Trachypithecus geei), pygmy hog (Sus salvanius), hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus), greater one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and wild <b>Asiatic</b> water <b>buffalo</b> (Bubalus arnee).
