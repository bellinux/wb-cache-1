Thiol-polyethylene glycol adsorption and avidin/biotin binding kinetics were monitored by exploiting the high sensitivity of grating-coupling SPR under <b>azimuthal</b> <b>control.</b> A time saturation binding kinetics reduction of 82 % and 24 % for polyethylene and avidin adsorption was obtained, respectively, due to the fluid mixing enhancement {{by means of the}} SAW-generated chaotic advection. These results represent the first implementation of a nanostructured SAW-SPR microfluidic biochip capable of significantly improving the molecule binding kinetics on a single, portable device. In addition, the biochip here proposed is suitable for a great variety of biosensing applications...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop an analytical model to capture two symmetry breaking effects controlling the frequency and nature (spinning, standing or mixed) of azimuthal modes appearing in annular chambers: (1) Using two different burner types distributed along the chamber (2) Considering the mean azimuthal flow due to the swirlers or to effusion cooling. The ATACAMAC (Analytical Tool to Analyze and <b>Control</b> <b>Azimuthal</b> Modes in Annular Chambers) methodology is applied using the linearized acoustic equations with a steady and uniform azimuthal mean flow. It provides an analytical implicit dispersion relation which can be solved numerically. A fully analytical resolution is possible when the annular chamber is weakly coupled to the burners. Results show that symmetry breaking, either by mixing burners types or with a mean azimuthal flow, splits the azimuthal modes into two waves with different frequencies and structures. Breaking symmetry promotes standing modes but adding even a low azimuthal mean flow fosters spinning modes so that the azimuthal mean flow must be taken into account to study azimuthal modes...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} mechanisms {{governing the}} use of active noise control in an extended volume of a cylindrical shell are discussed. Measured data was compared with computer results from a previously derived analytical model based on an infinite shell theory. For both the analytical model and experiment, the radiation of the external monopoles is coupled to the internal acoustic field through the radial displacement of the thin, elastic cylindrical shell. An active noise control system was implemented in the cylinder using a fixed array of discrete monopole sources, all of which lie in {{the plane of the}} exterior noise sources. Good agreement between measurement and prediction was obtained for both internal pressure response and overall noise reduction. Attenuations in the source plane greater than 15 dB were recorded along with a uniformly quieted noise environment over {{the entire length of the}} experimental model. Results indicate that for extended axial forcing distributions or very low shell damping, axial arrays of control sources may be required. Finally, the Nyquist criteria for the number of <b>azimuthal</b> <b>control</b> sources is shown to provide for effective control over the full cylinder cross section...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypocentre}} {{represent the}} {{location in space}} and time of the initial release of seismic energy. This location is normally estimated from the time of arrival of seismic phases at a well distributed set of seismic stations. Strong control on the hypocentre requires that it be surrounded by stations and that <b>azimuthal</b> <b>control</b> is available without large gaps. When we consider the onset of the corresponding seismograms the first arriving energy will come from the immediate neighbourhood of the hypocentre. We can project this energy back to its origin with a suitable propagation model and then an estimate of the concentration of energy in space can replace the matching of arrival times. Our approach to characterising the evolution of the high-frequency part of a seismic source is to endeavour to determine the location of energy emission as a function of time by exploiting the characteristics of the seismograms at a suitable suite of stations. We increment the origin time in steps and seek to find the position of the evocentre for which the summed energy over a time span on the various seismograms is maximised. For each point we construct the propagation delays to each of the stations to define the relevant segments of the seismograms. We use the ak 135 model to calculate the appropriate times of passage from the putativ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method to explore the full {{sensitivity}} of grating coupled surface plasmon resonance (GCSPR) sensors on an azimuthally rotatable grating by optimizing the polarization angle of the incident light. This is the condition where double surface plasmons polaritons (SPPs) can be excited by a single wavelength [1]. This configuration provides a sensitivity up to 950 degrees/RIU compared to a system without <b>azimuthal</b> <b>control</b> [2]. We show here that the sensitivity of this configuration is only achievable when the polarization angle of the incident light is optimized. This {{is due to the}} excitation of a fully coupled SPP (as can be observed as a deeper dip in the reflectivity spectra) which is only possible using the optimized polarization angle in an azimuthally rotated grating. This result in a well-defined, sharper spectrum and the positions of the minima are more obvious. The figure of merit (FOM) increases by 50 - 100 % compared to spectra collected using p-polarized light. We demonstrate this sensitivity using a dodecanethiol (C 12) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on a Au grating surface, representing a thickness difference of 1. 5 nm compared to the uncoated grating. Using the new configuration with optimized polarization angle, a shift in resonance angle as large as 3. 6 degrees can be observed. In principle, we expect the refractive index resolution of this method to be on the order of 5 x 10 (- 7) RIU. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{technology}} and control methods developed for the pointing system of the SPIDER experiment. SPIDER is a balloon-borne polarimeter designed to detect the imprint of primordial gravitational waves in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. We describe the two main components of the telescope's azimuth drive: the reaction wheel and the motorized pivot. A 13 kHz PI control loop runs on a digital signal processor, with feedback from fibre optic rate gyroscopes. This system can <b>control</b> <b>azimuthal</b> speed with < 0. 02 deg/s RMS error. To control elevation, SPIDER uses stepper-motor-driven linear actuators to rotate the cryostat, which houses the optical instruments, relative to the outer frame. With the velocity in each axis controlled in this way, higher-level control loops on the onboard flight computers can implement the pointing and scanning observation modes required for the experiment. We have accomplished the non-trivial task of scanning a 5000 lb payload sinusoidally in azimuth at a peak acceleration of 0. 8 deg/s$^ 2 $, and a peak speed of 6 deg/s. We can do so while reliably achieving sub-arcminute pointing control accuracy. Comment: 20 pages, 12 figures, Presented at SPIE Ground-based and Airborne Telescopes V, June 23, 2014.

40|$|We {{analytically}} and numerically {{study the}} analogue of the Parker (magnetic buoyancy) instability in a uniformly rotating plasma screw pinch confined in a cylinder. Uniform plasma rotation is imposed {{to create a}} centrifugal acceleration, which mimics the gravity required for the classical Parker instability. The goal {{of this study is}} to determine how the Parker instability could be unambiguously identified in a weakly magnetized, rapidly rotating screw pinch, in which the rotation provides an effective gravity and a radially varying <b>azimuthal</b> field is <b>controlled</b> to give conditions for which the plasma is magnetically buoyant to inward motion. We show that an axial magnetic field is also required to circumvent conventional current driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities such as the sausage and kink modes that would obscure the Parker instability. These conditions can be realized in the Madison Plasma Couette Experiment (MPCX). Simulations are performed using the extended MHD code NIMROD for an isothermal compressible plasma model. Both linear and nonlinear regimes of the instability are studied, and the results obtained for the linear regime are compared with analytical results from a slab geometry. Based on this comparison, it is found that in a cylindrical pinch the magnetic buoyancy mechanism dominates at relatively large Mach numbers (M> 5), while at low Mach numbers (M< 1) the instability is due to the curvature of magnetic field lines. At intermediate values of Mach number (1 <M< 5) the Coriolis force has a strong stabilizing effect on the plasma. A possible scenario for experimental demonstration of the Parker instability in MPCX is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Directional {{drilling}} {{technology was}} extended and modified to drill the first well of a subsurface geothermal energy extraction {{system at the}} Fenton Hill, New Mexico, hot dry rock (HDR) experimental site. Borehole geometries, extremely hard and abrasive granite rock, and high formation temperatures combined to provide a challenging environment for directional drilling tools and instrumentation. Completing {{the first of the}} two-wellbore HDR system resulted in the definition of operation limitations of -many conventional directional drilling tools, instrumentation, and techniques. The successful completion of the first wellbore, Energy Extraction Well No. 2 (EE- 21), to a measured depth of 4. 7 km (15, 300 ft) in granite reservoir rock with a bottomhole temperature of 320 C (610 F) required {{the development of a new}} high-temperature downhole motor and modification of existing wireline-conveyed steering tool systems. Conventional rotary-driven directional assemblies were successfully modified to accommodate the very hard and abrasive rock encountered while drilling nearly 2. 6 km (8, 500 ft) of directional hole to a final inclination of 35 {sup o} from the vertical at the <b>controlled</b> <b>azimuthal</b> orientation. Data were collected to optimize the drilling procedures far the programmed directional drilling of well EE- 3 parallel to, and 370 metres (1, 200 ft) above, Drilling equipment and techniques used in drilling wellbores for extraction of geothermal energy from hot granite were generally similar to those that are standard and common to hydrocarbon drilling practices. However, it was necessary to design some new equipment for this program: some equipment was modified especially for this program and some was operated beyond normal ratings. These tools and procedures met with various degrees of success. Two types of shock subs were developed and tested during this project. However, downhole time was limited, and formations were so varied that analysis of the capabilities of these items is not conclusive. Temperature limits of the tools were exceeded. EE- 2. Commercial drilling and fishing jars were improved during the drilling program. Three-cone, tungsten-carbide insert bit performance with downhole motors was limited by rapid gauge wear. Rotary drilling was optimized for wells EE- 2 and EE- 3 using softer (IADS 635 code) bits and provided a balance between gauge,. cutting structure, and bearing life.

40|$|NEIC) uses {{a variety}} of {{classical}} network-averaged magnitudes (e. g.,mb andMs) and waveform modeling procedures to determine the moment magnitude (Mw) of an earth-quake from teleseismic observations. Initial magnitude estimates are often inaccurate because of poor <b>azimuthal</b> <b>control</b> (sampling of the focal sphere) and/or intrinsic limitation of each method to a specific range of event size. To provide faster and more accurate estimates of the moment magnitude, source duration, and source com-plexity, NEIC is exploring {{the use of a}} variation of the empirical Green’s function (EGF) deconvolution procedure. This approach uses a predicted focal mechanism derived from the Global Centroid Moment Tensor Catalog to compute teleseismic P-wave synthetic seismograms, which are then deconvolved from observed P and SH waveforms to determine station-specific Mw, source time function, and a network-averaged Mw. Our EGF approach is validated using broadband waveforms from 246 earthquakes in the magnitude range Mw 6. 0 – 9. 1. Within approximately 13 min of earthquake ori-gin time, our procedure using teleseismic P waves only computes an Mw that lies within 0 : 25 of the final W-phase Mw in the magnitude range 6 – 8. Using later arriv-ing teleseismic SH phases results in anMw that lies within 0 : 12 of theW-phaseMw. For magnitude 8 or larger earthquakes, we underestimated the moment magnitude by up to 0. 8 magnitude units, primarily due to the initial P phase not containing the total seismic moment release. Long-period phases such as the W-phase and surface waves that better characterize total moment release can also be incorporated in the processing...|$|E
