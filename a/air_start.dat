As Durdles and Jasper come near, they are addressed by an inscribed paper lantern over the door, setting forth the purport of the house.

50|$|The NTSB report {{indicates}} that the ground handlers did not properly close the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> access door due to a sudden change in their procedure when the ground handler supervisor realized that the headset being used {{to communicate with the}} flightcrew was nonfunctional, and had to revert mid-routine to using hand signals. This break in routine led the supervisor to signal the flight to taxi before the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> hose was disconnected. Although he then realized that the hose was still connected and signaled the flight crew for an emergency stop, and the hose was successfully disconnected, the closing of the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> access door was not completed either prior to the supervisor's initial go-ahead or after the emergency stop.|$|E

50|$|Large Diesel {{generators}} {{and almost all}} Diesel engines used as the prime mover of ships use compressed air acting directly on the cylinder head. This is not ideal for smaller Diesels, as it provides too much cooling on starting. Also, the cylinder head needs to have enough space to support an extra valve for the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> system. The <b>air</b> <b>start</b> system is conceptually very similar to a distributor in a car. There is an air distributor that is geared to the camshaft of the Diesel engine; {{on the top of}} the air distributor is a single lobe similar to what is found on a camshaft. Arranged radially around this lobe are roller tip followers for every cylinder. When the lobe of the air distributor hits one of the followers it will send an air signal that acts upon the back of the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> valve located in the cylinder head, causing it to open. Compressed air is provided from a large reservoir that feeds into a header located along the engine. As soon as the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> valve is opened, the compressed air is admitted and the engine will begin turning. It can be used on 2-cycle and 4-cycle engines and on reversing engines. On large 2-stroke engines less than one revolution of the crankshaft is needed for starting.|$|E

50|$|The report {{concluded}} that the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> access door is {{what led to the}} vibrations. The investigation indicated that these vibrations were not a threat to the aircraft's safe operation, and would likely not have prevented the aircraft from reaching cruise speed and altitude.

50|$|An <b>Air</b> <b>Start</b> Unit is {{a device}} used {{to start the}} aircraft's engines when the aircraft's APU is not operational. There are three primary types of these devices that exist currently: a stored air cart, a gas turbine based unit, and a diesel engine driven screw {{compressor}} unit. All three devices create a source of high pressure air to start the aircraft engines. Typically one or two hoses are connect to these units, with the largest aircraft engines requiring three.|$|E
