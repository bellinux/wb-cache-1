5|$|Kalep {{grew up in}} Estonia and Russia, and {{subsequently}} moved to China to escape the Russian Civil War. She worked briefly as an interpreter for military officials in China before settling in Paris to study art with Alexandre Jacovleff. In 1931, she qualified as a pilot in Germany, becoming the first Estonian female pilot. Befriending American aviator Amelia Earhart, she joined the Ninety-Nines and took up the cause of encouraging other women to take up aviation. She wrote and illustrated a children's book <b>about</b> <b>flying,</b> Air Babies, which {{was first published in}} 1936.|$|E
5|$|Since {{his early}} youth {{he was very}} {{enthusiastic}} <b>about</b> <b>flying</b> and volunteered for military service in the Luftwaffe of the Third Reich on 10 December 1935. There he participated {{in a number of}} exercises and was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) of the Reserves on 1 December 1936. In his civilian life, Brändle attained a pilot license and worked as a flight instructor. As an instructor, he trained roughly 150 students and logged more than 6,000 starts and 8,000 flight hours before he became a military aviator. In addition to his passion for motor power flight, he also was a glider pilot.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939 Cunningham rejoined his {{squadron}} {{which had}} been equipped with {{a version of the}} Bristol Blenheim. John was not enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>flying</b> the Blenheim. The turret had been eliminated to reduce weight and increase speed, but the flying suits and cockpit were not heated, which caused discomfort to the crews over the winter period. The radios were too short-range which caused communication problems. The Blenheim's cockpit windshield was multi-faceted and difficult to clean. It was also liable to reflect light; which made cooperation with searchlights hazardous. The unit also had unspecified problems with blind-flying instruments. The squadron incurred some losses owing to the inexperience of crews flying patrols over the North Sea from RAF North Weald in Essex, a number of them a result of the difficulties with the aircraft. In January 1940 604 moved to RAF Northolt and flew Blenheim's adorned in the Finnish Air Force Swastika to Finland via Sweden to assist the country after the Soviet invasion.|$|E

25|$|The book {{tells the}} story of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a seagull who is bored with daily squabbles over food. Seized by a passion for flight, he pushes himself, {{learning}} everything he can <b>about</b> <b>flying,</b> until finally his unwillingness to conform results in his expulsion. An outcast, he continues to learn, becoming increasingly pleased with his abilities as he leads a peaceful and happy life.|$|E
25|$|The marathon's creator {{asserts that}} the marathon's name honors a local legend <b>about</b> <b>flying</b> monkeys. According to the legend, the flying monkeys are an {{endangered}} cryptid often confused with large owls and hawks. Before 1939 the monkeys were supposedly commonly seen throughout the Southeastern United States, with large populations living in middle Tennessee and Appalachia. The legend states that, following 1939, the flying monkeys were hunted {{to the point of}} near-extinction.|$|E
25|$|Before departure, Jean Lapierre {{mentioned}} that he was concerned <b>about</b> <b>flying</b> during bad weather. The aircraft left Montreal Saint-Hubert Longueuil Airport in St-Hubert, Quebec at 0931 Eastern Daylight Time and was destined for the Îles-de-la-Madeleine Airport, on Havre aux Maisons island in the Magdalen Islands, also in Quebec. A little over two hours later (1240 Atlantic Daylight Time), the aircraft collided with terrain in Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec, about 2km from Îles-de-la-Madeleine Airport, the flight's intended destination.|$|E

25|$|Harvey {{was an avid}} pilot. He {{served in}} the US Army Air Corps from 1943-1944. Harvey had been an Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) member for more than 50 years, and would {{occasionally}} talk <b>about</b> <b>flying</b> to his radio audience. He {{was a member of}} the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), and was frequently seen at EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He was responsible for funding the Paul Harvey Audio-Video Center at EAA headquarters in Oshkosh. Harvey was also an early investor in the Duluth, Minnesota-based aircraft manufacturing company, Cirrus Aircraft. According to AOPA Pilot contributing editor Barry Schiff, Harvey coined the term skyjack, and is credited with popularizing the terms Reaganomics and guesstimate.|$|E
25|$|The flight school {{moved in}} November 1911 to a farm leased near Augusta, Georgia, hoping to {{continue}} flying {{there during the}} winter. Training was limited by rain and flooding, and they returned to Maryland in May 1912. Arnold began to develop a phobia <b>about</b> <b>flying,</b> intensified by Al Welsh's fatal crash at College Park on June 11. In August Arnold was at Marblehead, Massachusetts, with 1st Lt. Roy C. Kirtland conducting acceptance tests of the Burgess Model H, an enclosed-fuselage tandem-seat seaplane and the Army's first tractor (front-mounted propeller and engine). The pair received orders to fly the new aircraft to Bridgeport, Connecticut to participate in maneuvers but high winds forced them to land on Massachusetts Bay on August 12. Attempting to take off again, Arnold caught a wing tip in the water turning into the wind and crashed into the bay off Plymouth. Arnold suffered a lacerated chin during the mishap but the aircraft was salvaged and repaired. Another crash at College Park on September 18 killed 2nd Lt. Lewis Rockwell, an academy classmate of Arnold's.|$|E

500|$|Upon coming home, McGovern {{returned}} to Dakota Wesleyan University, {{aided by the}} G.I. Bill, and graduated from there in June 1946 with a B.A. degree magna cum laude. For a while he suffered from nightmares <b>about</b> <b>flying</b> through flak barrages or his plane being on fire. He continued with debate, again winning the state Peace Oratory Contest with a speech entitled [...] "From Cave to Cave" [...] that presented a Christian-influenced Wilsonian outlook. The couple's second daughter, Susan, was born in March 1946.|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Kalep {{published}} {{the first edition}} of Air Babies, a children's book that she wrote and illustrated to teach children <b>about</b> <b>flying.</b> The story followed two young planes, Happy Wings and Speedy, and a 1938 reprint included a foreword from Earhart, who embarked on her last flight three days after writing the piece; she disappeared while flying in 1937. Kalep later said of Earhart's disappearance: [...] "I miss her very much. When I heard that Amelia had disappeared, well, I fell apart." [...] She visited the 1939 New York World's Fair to promote Air Babies on television and to speak at the National Woman's Party luncheon.|$|E
500|$|Chaffee was passionate <b>about</b> <b>flying,</b> and had {{a strong}} {{aptitude}} for science and engineering. To apply those talents, he transferred to Purdue University {{in the autumn of}} 1954 to attend the school's well-known aeronautical engineering program. Prior to his arrival in West Lafayette, he reported for an 8-week tour on [...] {{as a part of the}} NROTC program. To qualify, he had to finish training and pass additional tests. He initially failed the eye exam, but the physician allowed him to retake the test the next morning, and he passed. He was then allowed to tour on Wisconsin to England, Scotland, France, and Cuba. Upon his return to American soil, he worked as a gear cutter.|$|E

500|$|On [...] "All Falls Down", West wages {{an attack}} on consumerism. The song {{features}} singer Syleena Johnson and contains an interpolation of Lauryn Hill's [...] "Mystery of Iniquity". West called upon Johnson to re-sing a vocal portion of [...] "Mystery of Iniquity", which {{ended up in the}} final mix. Gospel hymn with doo-wop elements [...] "I'll Fly Away" [...] precedes [...] "Spaceship", a track with a relaxed beat containing a soulful Marvin Gaye sample. The lyrics are mostly critical of the working world, where West muses <b>about</b> <b>flying</b> away in a spaceship to leave his boring job, and guest rappers GLC and Consequence add comparisons to modern day retail environment with slavery.|$|E
500|$|Vulović {{was in a}} coma for {{ten days}} after the crash and spent several months in the {{hospital}} recovering. She suffered a fractured skull, three broken vertebrae, two broken legs, several broken ribs and a fractured pelvis. Her injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. She went on to make an almost complete recovery, but continued to walk with a limp. Vulović maintained that she had no memory of the incident and thus had no qualms <b>about</b> <b>flying</b> {{in the aftermath of the}} crash. Despite her willingness to resume working as a flight attendant, JAT decided to give her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. The airline apparently felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity. Vulović became a celebrity in Yugoslavia and was deemed a national hero.|$|E
500|$|On 10 May 1940, the Wehrmacht {{invaded the}} Low Countries and France under the codename Fall Gelb. JG 27 {{supported}} German {{forces in the}} Battle for Belgium.

Both aircraft were from No. 87 Squadron. The Hurricanes had been escorting Bristol Blenheim bombers to bomb bridges in the Netherlands. [...] Galland remembered; [...] "My first kill was child's play. An excellent weapon and luck had been on my side. To be successful, the best fighter pilot needs both"— Galland pursued one of the [...] "scattering" [...] Hurricanes and shot down another at low level.

500|$|She {{began taking}} flight lessons from flight {{instructor}} Joe Reid on her sixth birthday, and became enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>flying.</b> Her father suggested {{the idea of}} a coast-to-coast flight, which Jessica readily accepted, and Reid agreed to provide flight instruction and his aircraft for the endeavor. They decided to name their flight [...] "Sea to Shining Sea"; Lloyd ordered custom-made caps and T-shirts with that logo to distribute as souvenirs during their stops. Although she had received over 33 hours of flight training, seven-year-old Jessica did not hold an FAA medical certificate, nor any pilot or student certificate. In the U.S., a person must be at least 16 years of age to be eligible for a student pilot certificate, and 17 for a pilot certificate. Since Dubroff was not certified to fly the plane, a rated pilot (normally her flight instructor Reid) had to be at the controls during all flight operations. While the coast-to-coast flight was promoted as a [...] "record" [...] attempt because of Dubroff's young age, there was no known body recognizing record flights by underage [...] "pilots" [...] {{at the time of her}} flight (The Guinness Book of Records had officially discontinued its [...] "youngest pilot" [...] categories seven years earlier, because of the risk of accidents).|$|E
500|$|After its release, {{the book}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews. It was listed by Rolling Stone {{as one of}} the 10 Best Music Books in 2016. Jason Diamond from the publication reviewed it and found that the book gave a [...] "fuller, weirder and more interesting overview of Madonna" [...] than was already present in previous works about her. He complimented the author's [...] "riveting" [...] way of presenting the past figures from Bay City associated with the singer as well as Simone's own transition into indie music. Jennifer Levin from The Santa Fe New Mexican commended Simone's [...] "wit and grace" [...] in reporting Bay City's troubled relationship with Madonna, including the political agenda surrounding her. She noted that the story found its footing at the point in the book where the author wrote <b>about</b> <b>Flying</b> Wedge (in the last chapter). Writing for PopMatters, Megan Volpert rated the book 7 out of 10 stars, and described it as [...] "excellent", suggesting it as an important addition to modern cultural criticism. She commended Simone's writing and her courage to pick up an unusual subject for the book. Volpert commented, [...] "Does the world need one more half-baked biographical update on Madonna? No, it does not. What the world does need is Simone's productively clear-eyed assessment of her own musical and journalistic failures, [...] for the detours unavoidably provoked by fame and fandom," [...] concluded the review.|$|E
