5|$|Caragiale's legal {{representative}} was the fellow writer Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, who systematically disproved Caion's allegations, {{and noted that}} the absentee defendant was guilty of numerous forgeries. He also convinced the judge that the similarities between Năpasta <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Power</b> of Darkness were superficial. The court found Ionescu-Caion guilty of slander. He was sentenced to a three-month jail term, a 500 lei fine and 10,000 lei in court costs. However, he appealed the tribunal's decision. The jury selection was a laborious process: Caion's lawyer Danielopol recused writers Nicolae Iorga and Ovid Densusianu, alleging that all Romanian literati had a vested interest to defend plagiarism. Iorga took offense, and reportedly challenged Danielopol to a duel. During the proceedings, Caion backed up on the original accusations, explaining that he had only invented a reason to bring Caragiale in for a trial. The court eventually acquitted Caion.|$|E

It never came to anything but it brought to England Lutheran ideas: three sacraments only—baptism, Eucharist and penance—which Henry was prepared to countenance to maintain the possibility of an alliance.|$|E
