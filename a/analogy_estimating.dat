40|$|Analogy {{is one of}} {{the central}} {{inference}} methods in human cognition. Several analogy methods have been developed, they were different in the technique used to establish the <b>analogy,</b> <b>estimate</b> the similarities, and transform the concepts and knowledge from the source situation to the target situation. All of these methods were used separately in different learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a learning system based on hybrid model of analogy, learning is done using different analogy strategies, according to the learning task. Using one model of analogy in a learning system will constrain the learning task, while the possibility of using multi-methods of analogy in one model will contain two main features. First, it will integrate different models of analogy in a hybrid learning system. Second, it will help in selecting and applying the suitable analogy method according to the given learning task and the given knowledge. The developed learning system consists of four main modules: Knowledge Base, User Interface, Retriever and Learning Modules. A set of real cases from the domain of employment accidents is used to demonstrate the learning capability of the system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to compare two {{different}} acoustic analogies applied to time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) data for the prediction of the acoustic far-field generated by the flow over a rectangular cavity. We consider the model problem of sound radiating from an open, two-dimensional, shallow cavity with an aspect ratio of 2 at a Reynolds number of 3. 0 ?×? 104 (based on the cavity length). The study is carried out by simultaneous high-speed two-dimensional PIV and sound measurements. The instantaneous flow field is obtained from the PIV measurements. The emitted sound is then calculated using Curle’s analogy and Vortex Sound Theory. To our knowledge, Vortex Sound Theory is used {{here for the first time}} in combination with time-resolved PIV data. The acoustic analogies are derived through rather different pathways, and the mathematical schemes used to solve the equations are sensitive in a different way to factors such as data resolution, noise level, and complexity of the geometry. Both methods indicate that the trailing edge of the cavity is the main sound source. The predictions of the acoustic field obtained by applying the two methods are analyzed and compared with the measured sound. For the presented case, the results show that both <b>analogies</b> <b>estimate</b> the overall sound pressure level quite well and that they give very similar results, both in total intensity and in the spectral distribution of the emitted sound.

50|$|Marin Cârciumaru, {{according}} to <b>analogies</b> in Europe, <b>estimated</b> that the Cuciulat cave paintings were completed during the Upper Paleolithic, about 12,000 years ago. This dating {{could not be}} supported by other evidence of archaeological nature. A {{significant part of the}} cave had been already destroyed by quarrying, including possible traces of a human habitation in the cave or in its immediate vicinity. It compromised the chances to discover artifacts that would provide additional clues for the dating of the paintings.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to compare two {{different}} acoustic analogies applied to time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) data for the prediction of the acoustic far-field generated by the flow over a rectangular cavity. Recent developments in laser and camera technology allow the possibility to extend PIV to the study of aeroacoustic phenomena in air flows at moderate speed (up to V= 20 m/s, Ma= 0. 08). We make use of these new possibilities to obtain estimates of the acoustic emission from time-resolved PIV data. We consider the model problem of the sound radiating from an open, two dimensional, shallow cavity with an aspect ratio between its length and depth of 2 at a Reynolds number of 3 : 0 £ 104 based on the cavity length. The study is carried out combining high speed two dimensional PIV imaging and sound measurements. The emitted sound is then calculated using Curle’s analogy and vortex sound theory. The prediction of the acoustic fields obtained by applying the two methods are analyzed and compared with the measured sound. Results show that both the <b>analogies</b> <b>estimate</b> the overall sound pressure level quite well and within a few dB of each other. Vortex sound theory seems to provide a better estimate for the amplitude of the tonal component and its harmonics, but suffers from higher broadband noise compare to Curle’s analogy. This is due to the higher smoothing of the data involved in the computation of the source term in Curle’s analogy, which reduces noise but also smoothes out the signal. Results show that great care must be taken in the treatment of the experimental PIV data, especially in the techniques used for spatial and temporal differentiation. The data sets obtained by PIV measurements can be, in fact, quite noisy while the spatial and temporal resolution are still limited.

40|$|We propose TRIPWIRE as a {{framework}} that provides for the mediation of software self-awareness by supporting real-time assessment and response capabilities. Our approach is inspired by the recent success of automatic speech recognition systems, which can assess {{the likelihood of a}} potentially unbounded set of possible utterances and select the most likely candidate in real-time, given an underlying model of the conversational domain. We see an <b>analogy</b> between <b>estimating</b> an utterance from an acoustic waveform and estimating the behavior of a program from dynamicanalysis data. In both cases, there is an inherently stochastic causal relationship between the quantity of interest and the measurement data. Our strategy is to leverage the successful tools and methods of speech recognition in the novel context of program behavior analysis. TRIPWIRE technology provides a systematic approach to behavior modeling and recognition with three main elements: strong domain knowledge and tools, learned statistical models, and realtime classification processes...|$|R

40|$|Analogical {{procedure}} {{to obtain the}} heat transfer coefficient for fluid flowing inside tube in turbulent range with carbon nanotubes is carried out. A regression equation valid for both water and nanofluid is developed by making use of Colburn <b>analogy</b> to <b>estimate</b> the Nusselt number. Heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop with carbon nanotubes has been analogically determined with different Prandtl number and volume concentration. Based on the analysis, the regression equation showed considerable deviation with the Gnielinski correlation and considered reliable in turbulent flow for single-phase fluid. The results also showed that convective heat transfer flow in plain tube is enhanced significantly by the existence of carbon nanotubes when compared with water using the regression equation developed. It is also observed that heat transfer coefficient for carbon nanotubes having volume concentration of 0. 1 % is 48. 16 % higher compared with water at 20, 000 Reynolds number. Heat transfer coefficient is also enhanced {{with the increase of}} Prandtl number and volume concentration with maximum value of 0. 5 %...|$|R

40|$|Dedicated to Herbert Spohn on the {{occasion}} of his retirement from the TU München A bosonic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall effect occurs in rapidly rotating trapped Bose gases: There is a transition from uncorrelated Hartree states to strongly correlated states such as the Laughlin wave function. This physics may be described by effective Hamiltonians with delta interactions acting on a bosonic N-body Bargmann space of analytic functions. In a previous paper [RSY] we studied the case of a quadratic plus quartic trapping potential and derived conditions on the parameters of the model for its ground state to be asymptotically strongly correlated. This relied essentially on energy upper bounds using quantum Hall trial states, incorporating the correlations of the Bose-Laughlin state in addition to a multiply quantized vortex pinned at the origin. In this paper we investigate in more details the density of these trial states, thereby substantiating further the physical picture described in [RSY], improvingourenergyestimates andallowing toconsider moregeneral trappingpotentials.

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} noise radiating from an unsteady flow can be extracted by an acoustic analogy approach from time-resolved Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations. For this purpose, a Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) post-processor is developed, {{based on an}} advanced time formulation. The method is coded in Python and embedded in Antares, which is a CFD companion software developed by Cerfacs, France. The availability in Antares of input and output data interfaces for structured and unstructured CFD geometries and solutions provides a good software development platform. The new post-processor is tested on a hierarchy of noise sources of increasing complexity, for which comparison is made with existing data. The radiating field from a simple monopole is considered first, with progression to a subsonic jet test case, for which acoustic data have been estimated by Bogey and Bailly (2006). CFD results obtained at Cerfacs (France), using a compressible Large Eddy Simulation (LES) on the same test case, provide the input to the acoustic <b>analogy</b> to <b>estimate</b> the far-field noise. The far-field noise predictions are compared to the acoustic results obtained with the CFD software elsA (Onera, France), that uses the same Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings acoustic analogy formulation and these are found in good agreement.

40|$|The present work {{collects}} {{the results}} of research conducted on thermo-fluid dynamics and aero-acoustic noise sources, especially on the characteristic noise of the condensing boilers combustion and centrifugal fans noise. The confined combustion cause instability phenomena which produce pressure fluctuations inside the combustion chamber, resulting in generation of noise. The instability phenomena of condensing boilers can be divided in two main types: {{the first one is}} called "Rumbling," where an interaction among flame, acoustic field and system fluid dynamics occurs; the second one is called "Hooting", which is a thermo-kinetic instability. On {{the first part of this}} paper is shown the experimental and numerical analysis of the "Hooting" in order to find: causes, characteristics, and a methodology that allows the prediction of this phenomenon. For this purpose has been made a simplified prototype of a condensing boiler to study: the main acoustic characteristics of the instability phenomenon, the fluid dynamic parameters which affect its generation and find a simple geometry to perform 3 D simulation analysis. In order to evaluate the influence on the emitted spectrum of combustion chamber geometry, it has been performed an acoustic modes FEM analysis of the combustion chamber prototyped cavity. To study the reproducibility and therefore the prediction of the “Hooting” spectra sound pressure level a hybrid CFD/CAA model has been performed. The above numerical model combining a thermo-fluid dynamics simulation of combustion chemical reaction, with a frequency domain acoustic simulation considering the Lighthill’s acoustic analogy extension proposed by Curle. Beyond to this numerical method, CFD transient simulations have been performed to calculate the spectra of sound pressure levels of combustion chamber, analyzing the obtained pressure fluctuation. The last part of this work described two numerical methodologies to predict the noise level emitted from centrifugal fan outlet. The first one requires the combination of a transient CFD simulation with a CAA acoustic simulation using two different acoustic analogies. The Ffowcs Williams-Hawkins <b>analogy</b> <b>estimates</b> the emitted sound pressure level with the definition of a dipoles distribution placed on fixed and mobile hard surfaces present in a fluid domain. This numerical method enables to calculate centrifugal fans blade passing frequency noise and broadband noise as well. The Lowson theory defines an equivalent single sound source considering the pressure distribution on blades and rotation speed of the impeller. This numerical method enables to calculate only the noise contribution of blade passing frequency and its harmonics. The second numerical method considered enable to calculate the sound pressure level spectra directly from relative pressure fluctuations from CFD transient simulations. The simulation results have been compared with the experimental measurements performed on a test rig carried out according to UNI EN ISO 5136...|$|R

Generalized Polyhedral Methods for Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint A nalysis: Theory and Application Recently introduced polyhedral methods for choice-based conjoint analysis provide a means to adapt choice-based questions at the individual-respondent level and provide an alterna-tive means to estimate partworths when there are relatively few questions as in a web-based questionnaire. However, these methods are deterministic and are susceptible to the propagation of response errors. They also assume, implicitly, a uniform prior on the partworths. In this paper we provide a probabilistic interpretation of polyhedral methods and propose improvements that incorporate response error and/or informative priors into both individual- level question design and estimation. These improvements {{can also be used}} to incorporate population information into individual-level <b>estimates</b> in an <b>analogy</b> to shrinkage <b>estimates.</b> Simulations suggest that response-error modeling and informative priors improve polyhedral methods in the domains were they were previously weak.

40|$|Estimating cost of new {{technology}} intensive products is very ad hoc within the automotive industry. There {{is a need to}} develop a systematic approach to the cost estimating, which will make the estimates more realistic. This research proposes a methodology that uses parametric, <b>analogy</b> and detailed <b>estimating</b> techniques to enable a cost to be built for an automotive powertrain product with a high content of {{new technology}}. The research defines a process for segregating new or emerging technologies from current technologies to enable the various costing techniques to be utilised. The cost drivers from an internal combustion engine's characteristics to facilitate a cost estimate for high- volume production are also presented. A process to enable a costing expert to either build an estimate for the new technology under analysis or use a comparator and then develop a variant for the new system is also discussed.

40|$|There {{have been}} various {{attempts}} {{to devise a}} theoretical method for calculating the forces and moments acting on wings with external-flow, jetaugmented flaps. One of the simplest of these relies on the analogy between the internal-flow jet flap and the external-flow jet flap. To date, this method has been limited in application by its reliance on either measured or assumed values of the jet-deflection angle and the thrust-recovery factor, i. e. the factor that {{is applied to the}} momentum flux leaving the exit of the engine nacelle to allow for turning and spreading losses. This paper is concerned with a semi-empirical method for predicting these parameters. The method is based on an analysis of a series of tests performed on a wing, body and injector-powered nacelle under static conditions. The formulae derived from the analysis are combined with a theory, which is based on the jet-flap <b>analogy,</b> to provide <b>estimates</b> of the forces and moments acting on wings with external-flow, jetaugmented flaps in forward flight. Comparisons are made between this method and wind-tunnel data obtained from tests performed at the RAE and elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{accretion}} rate determinations are fundamental for {{an understanding of}} the evolution of pre-main sequence star circumstellar disks. Magnetospheric accretion models are used to derive values of the mass {{accretion rate}}s in objects of very different properties, from brown dwarfs to intermediate-mass stars; we test the validity of these models in the brown dwarf regime, where the stellar mass and luminosity, as well as the mass accretion rate, are much lower than in T Tauri stars. We have measured simultaneously two infrared hydrogen lines, Pab and Brg, in a sample of 16 objects in the star-forming region rho-Oph. The sample inc ludes 7 very low mass objects and brown dwarfs and 9 T Tauri stars. Brown dwarfs where both lines are detected have a ratio Pab/Brg of ~ 2. Larger values, >= 3. 5, are only found among the T Tauri stars. The low line ratios in brown dwarfs indicate that the lines cannot originate in the column of gas accreting from the disk onto the star along the magnetic field lines, and we suggest that they form instead in the shocked photosphere, heated to temperatures of ~ 3500 K. If so, in <b>analogy</b> to veiling <b>estimates</b> in T Tauri stars, the hydrogen infrared line fluxes may provide a reliable measure of the accretion rate in brown dwarfs.

In the psychological structure of this portrait, realism is the predominant means of representation of the inner life and a certioni stillness in the contrast soft modeling supports even more the impression of meditation, yearning, sensitivity and restraint. The details of the face with the small, lightly marked locks on the forehead, all shaped in a masterly manner, emphasize its individual characterizations. The whole treatment of the face points to a high quality work of art; {{it is obvious that}} its artist was an excellent sculptor who probably worked in some art centre where the tradition of the classical Greek sculpture inherited though the classicist sculpture of the late Hellenism and the art of Hadria’s epoch, was still respected. In contrast to the finely modeled hair and small locks on the forehead and over the ears, the braids are done very simply: by vertical and slanting broken cuts.This head was found in the layer which E.Cerskov, according to the other archaeological material, judges that it dates {{from the middle of the}} 3rd to the beginning of the 4th century.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and analyze challenges associated with contracting, subcontracting, estimation process, risk management and success measurement. Qualitative method was applied in this study. Questionnaire was designed and 40 agile professionals were contacted for interview but received responses from fourteen agile professionals only. In today’scompetitive market, software development projects are facing difficulty to get funded, therefore demands for shorter investment periods, faster time-to-market, and increased agility require new, radical software development approaches towards contracting and estimation. These competitive market pressures has posed may challenges and requires new insights into contracting and estimation processes. Risk management in agile projects must be done so that agile project management is suitable for projects with volatile requirements. The result of the study was that Time and Material is most widely used contract. Another finding was that subcontracting is being widely used in the agile companies. This study also found out that planning poker was most widely used estimation technique, other estimation techniques that are used commonly includes parametric estimate, expert judgment (Delphi), <b>analogy</b> / comparison <b>estimating,</b> threepoint estimation, work breakdown structure +weighted effort estimation in hours. It is also found that everyone in team were involved in estimation process while customer is not involved in this process in most of the companies. We found out that risk management in agile companies is done same like waterfall approaches. It is also found out that as opposed to some literature, agile methods are highly suitable for large projects. Perception of success varies from stakeholder to stakeholder but common measurement is based on the attributes of quality, cost, scope andtimeliness. At the end of study, list of recommendations are given to combat the challenges agile professionals are facing. It is recommended that project should be delivered in iterations and customer should be given shutdown option in case he don’t want to continue the project. It is also recommended that careful considerations should be given to subcontracting issues identified in research before going for it. It is found agile is ideal for large scale project. It is recommended to use mix of agile and waterfall where suitable. These finding implicates the need to study the application of list of recommendations presented at end of study. </p...|$|R
