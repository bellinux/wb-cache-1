30|$|Surfactant {{adsorption}} in porous {{media is}} one of the major criteria which decide the economic viability of surfactant flooding in chemical enhance oil recovery applications (CEOR). In this study, the static adsorption of a novel in-house synthesized <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> was investigated onto crushed Berea sandstone. The point of zero (PZC) charge for Berea sandstone and critical micelle concentration (CMC) of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> are also reported in this paper. The investigated PZC for Berea core was at pH 8.0 and the maximum adsorption of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> was 0.96  mg/g. Furthermore, the effects of alkali, salinity and temperature on static adsorption of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> were investigated at variable conditions. It was concluded that the <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> performs better at higher pH, higher temperature and lower salt concentration. An effective control of all these parameters can lead to the situation which helps in minimizing the surfactant loss and improved economic efficiency of CEOR process.|$|R

30|$|As can be seen, {{the surface}} {{tension of the}} as-prepared {{solutions}} is out of range, and the capability of electrospinning is reduced depending on the failure in overcoming surface tension. A decrease in surface tension can be proposed {{by the addition of}} <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> to cellulose/water solution. A remarkable decrease in surface tension was observed from 54 mN/m to 44.4 after addition of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> powder to the 0.63  % w/w polymeric solution of cellulose. Therefore, the inclusion of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> to the selected cellulose solution causes noticeable decrease in surface tension. Conductivity remained unchanged, and as a result, it can be expressed that the surfactant has no significant influence on conductivity, but its viscosity increases compared to surfactant-free solution to a value of about 345 cP. It can be seen, the viscosity is still in the efficient range of 100 – 400  cp for electrospinning. It is worthy to note that the selecting efficient density of cellulose and optimal amounts of Lithium Chloride and <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> leads to the best viscosity, conductivity, and surface tension. Hence, the solution containing 0.63  % w/w solution with 1  % Lithium Chloride salt and 10  mg <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> were selected as the most suitable solution for electrospinning.|$|R
5000|$|Surfactants are {{classified}} into four main types, each with different properties and applications: anionic, cationic, nonionic and zwitterionic (or amphoteric). <b>Anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> are compounds that contain an anionic polar group. Examples of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> include {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate. Included in this class of surfactants are sodium alkylcarboxylates (soaps). [...] Cationic surfactats are similar in nature to <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants,</b> except the surfactant molecules carry a positive charge at the hydrophilic portion. Many of these compounds are quaternary ammonium salts, as well as cetrimonium bromide (CTAB). Non-ionic surfactants are non-charged and together with <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> make {{up the majority of}} oil-dispersant formulations. The hydrophilic portion of the surfactant contains polar functional groups, such as -OH or -NH. Zwitterionic surfactants are the most expensive, and are used for specific applications. These compounds have both positively and negatively charged components. An example of a zwitterionic compound is phosphatidylcholine, which as a lipid is largely insoluble in water.|$|E

50|$|Anionic head {{groups are}} {{negatively}} charged, and {{commonly used in}} cleaning products. <b>Anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> {{can be found in}} products such as shampoos, laundry detergents, and soaps because of their ability to remove dirt from soft mediums such as fabric. <b>Anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> are easily suspended in water due to the polarity of the charged head group. However, hard water can deactivate the molecule. Some of the more commonly used anionic head groups are sulfates and ethoxylates.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> such as {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} {{are most}} {{commonly}} used for stabilizing emulsions because of their affinity for hydrogen bonding with the aqueous medium. Nonionic surfactants are rarely used alone due to their inferior efficiency in creating stable emulsions in comparison to <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants.</b> Because of this, non-ionic surfactants are usually used in tandem with <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> and impart a second method of colloidal stabilization through steric interference of the van der Waals forces amid polymer and pigment particles. Latexes that require stability over large pH ranges use larger nonionic to anionic surfactant ratios. Cationic surfactants are least commonly used because of their high cost, inefficient emulsifying capability, and undesirable effects on initiator decomposition. High speed application, low temperature storage, shear stresses from pumping, and other extreme storage or application conditions can cause {{the failure of a}} surfactant to adequately stabilize a paint dispersion.|$|E
50|$|Anionic {{softeners}} and antistatic agents can be, for example, salts of monoesters and diesters of {{phosphoric acid}} and the fatty alcohols. These {{are often used}} together with the conventional cationic softeners. Cationic softeners are incompatible with <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> in detergents because they combine with them to form a solid precipitate. This requires that they be added in the rinse cycle. Anionic softeners can combine with <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> directly. Other anionic softeners can be based on smectite clays. Some compounds, such as ethoxylated phosphate esters, have softening, anti-static, and surfactant properties.|$|E

50|$|After first {{acidifying}} a {{water sample}} (with boric acid, for example), one adds to it chloroform and {{a solution of}} methylene blue et al. Methylene blue is a cationic dye. The biphasic solution is then agitated to distribute these reagents throughout the aqueous and organic phases.

50|$|Anionic, nonionic, and {{cationic}} surfactants have been used, although <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> {{are by far}} most prevalent. Surfactants with a low critical micelle concentration (CMC) are favored; the polymerization rate shows a dramatic increase when the surfactant level is above the CMC, and minimization of the surfactant is preferred for economic reasons and the (usually) adverse effect of surfactant on the physical properties of the resulting polymer. Mixtures of surfactants are often used, including mixtures of anionic with nonionic surfactants. Mixtures of cationic and <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> form insoluble salts and are not useful.|$|E

Some common cationic surfactants head groups include amines and quaternary ammonium ions.

30|$|Static {{adsorption}} of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> {{was determined}} using 2  g of crushed core sample in 20  mL of surfactant solution.

In the small angle neutron scattering experiments, we use shell contrast {{to focus on the}} surfactant shell and its variation with addition of polymer. We observe, as predicted by indirect measurements such as dielectric spectroscopy, that the polymer interacts differently with a nonionic or an <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> shell: In the former case the addition of polymer does not seem to affect the surfactant shell. In the latter case, the obtained scattering data show that the <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> layer is strongly influenced leading to a higher polydispersity which may be attributed to a floppier surfactant shell...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of an <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) on a {{negatively charged}} silica was studied to provide {{a better understanding of}} surfactant adsorption phenomena in an electrostatic repulsion environment between surfactant and soil. The adsorption experiment was conducted under different electrolyte concentration and pH. Results indicated that adsorption happened with hydrophobic interaction, although electrostatic repulsion was generated between SDS and silica surface. The adsorption amount decreased with decreasing electrolyte concentration and increasing pH due to the increase of electrostatic repulsion. The influence of electric potential near the silica surface on the adsorption was confirmed with the modified Langmuir adsorption equation, 1 -pK basic Stern model and zeta potential. Because silica is ubiquitous in soils and the water environment, the adsorption characteristics of an <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> is important when we consider the fate of an <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> in the environment. The result is also useful when considering the fate of agricultural chemicals which contain negative charge and hydrophobic sites...|$|R
