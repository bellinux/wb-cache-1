We model integrated volatility as a latent fi?rst order Markov process and show that our model is closely related to the CEV and Barndorff-Nielsen & Shephard (2001) models for local volatility. We show that if measurement noise in the observable volatility proxies is not accounted for, then the estimated autoregressive parameter in the latent process is downward biased. Implied volatility performs better than any of the alternative realized measures when forecasting future integrated volatility.

Having identified subperiods of homogeneous volatility dynamics we concentrate on stylized facts to distinguish these volatility regimes.

40|$|The Local Volatility {{model is}} a {{well-known}} extension of the Black-Scholes constant volatility model whereby the volatility is dependent on both time and the underlying asset. This model can be calibrated to provide a perfect fit {{to a wide range}} of implied volatility surfaces. The model is easy to calibrate and still very popular in FX option trading. In this paper we address a question of validation of the Local Volatility model. Different stochastic models for the underlying can be calibrated to provide a good fit to the current market data but should be recalibrated every trading date. A good fit to the current market data does not imply that the {{model is a}}ppropriate and historical backtesting should be performed for validation purposes. We study delta hedging errors under the Local Volatility model using historical data from 2005 to 2011 for the AUD/USD implied volatility. We performed backtests for a range of option maturities and strikes using sticky delta and theoretically correct delta hedging. The results show that delta hedging errors under the standard Black-Scholes model are no worse than that of the Local Volatility model. Moreover, for the case of in and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>options,</b> <b>the</b> hedging error for the Back-Scholes model is significantly better. ...|$|R
40|$|Portfolio {{insurance}} strategies {{based on}} options typically treat {{the investment in}} the risky asset, e. g., stock, as fixed. We show in a mean/downside-risk framework that such a strategy is inefficient. Using <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> put <b>options,</b> expected returns can be {{increased by more than}} 250 basis points without taking on more risk. Gains can become arbitrarily large when one uses options with extremely high strike prices. This is due to a serious caveat to the mean/downside-risk framework that is typically adopted in the literature by substituting downside-risk measures for standard risk measures such as the variance of returns. These pathologic results vanish when one maximizes an appropriately chosen HARA utility function. In this framework, fixing the holding of the risky asset in advance leads to efficiency losses that vary between 250 and 650 basis points depending on the degree of risk aversion. mean/downside-risk efficiency; option strategies; optimal portfolio choice; portfolio insurance; downside-risk. ...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{empirical}} proofs {{indicate the}} adequacy of the time discrete auto-regressive stochastic volatility models introduced by Taylor in the description of the log-returns of financial assets. The pricing and hedging of contingent products that use these models for their underlying assets is a non-trivial exercise due to the incomplete nature of the corresponding market. In this paper we apply two volatility estimation techniques available in the literature for these models, namely Kalman filtering and the hierarchical-likelihood approach, in order to implement various pricing and dynamical hedging strategies. Our study shows that the local risk minimization scheme developed by Föllmer, Schweizer, and Sondermann is particularly appropriate in this setup, especially for <b>at</b> and in <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>options</b> or for low hedging frequencies. ...|$|R
40|$|The dissetation {{includes}} three main parts, {{with the first}} part studies investigate empirically whether or not {{and to what extent}} the GM technology has improved realized yields. We study this question for non-irrigated U. S. maize and soybean yields over 1964 - 2010, having controlled for local effects, weather, fertilization and the pre-existing (non-GM) crop improvement trend. For maize we find that GM varieties have increased realized yields, with a stronger gain in the Central Corn Belt. For soybeans, GM varieties appear to have slightly reduced yields. For both crops we nd a strong trend in yield growth, which may have accelerated in recent years. The second part of the dissertation studies the impact of pricing errors on implied volatilities. Financial researchers and practitioners frequently propose their models and design the pricing formulae based on the observed implied volatility pattern in reality. We find that, in addition to the pattern caused by the mismatch of Black-Scholes formula and true pricing formulae, the observed implied volatility pattern is also influenced by the pricing errors. We propose to study the combined effects of pricing errors and pricing formula on the implied volatility. We find that implied volatility is adversely impacted by pricing errors and stylish patterns of the inverse Black-Scholes price function. Hence, the implied volatility is not a reliable estimator to the underlying volatility even it is carried out for short maturity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>options.</b> We propose an alternative volatility estimator by inverting a nonparametrically estimated price based on a kernel smoothing estimator of the underlying price function. The proposal can consistently recover the underlying volatility for general price formulae and is free of the afore-mentioned problems with the conventional implied volatility. The third part of the dissertation focused on a situation that the seasonal pattern is a long cycle and the study period covers {{only a few of the}} long cycles, such as a daily series with an annual pattern and includes only 5 - 30 years. This situation is in contrast with the asymptotic study, corresponding to the situation that the sample includes many long cycles, and has been ignored in the literature. Although the estimator based on seasonal-dummy-regression is consistent, unbiased and asymptotically normal-distributed, we find this estimator does not perform well in our focused situation. We propose smoothing the estimated long-cycle patterns by seasonal-dummy regression and evaluate the benefit of smoothing. We study our proposed smoothing-seasonal-dummy-regression estimator for seasonal time series with a long cycle and no short cycle, a short cycle and many short cycles, both theoretically, and via simulation studies, and then apply our methodology to an empirical study of the return rates of electricity prices...|$|R
40|$|The Black-Scholes implied {{volatility}} skew <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> of SPX <b>options</b> {{is known to}} obey a power law {{with respect to the}} time-to-maturity. We construct a model of the underlying asset price process which is dynamically consistent to the power law. The volatility process of the model is driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter less than half. The fractional Brownian motion is correlated with a Brownian motion which drives the asset price process. We derive an asymptotic expansion of the {{implied volatility}} as the time-to-maturity tends to zero. For this purpose we introduce a new approach to validate such an expansion, which enables us to treat more general models than in the literature. The local-stochastic volatility model is treated as well under an essentially minimal regularity condition in order to show such a standard model cannot be dynamically consistent to the power law...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{expand the}} idea of Samuelson[3] and Shepp[2, 5, 6] for stock {{optimization}} using the Bachelier model [4] as our models for <b>the</b> stock price <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> (X[stock price]= K[strike price]) for the American call and put <b>options</b> [1]. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> (X= K) for American options, the expected payoff of both the call and put options is zero. Shepp investigated several stochastic optimization problems using martingale and stopping time theories [2, 5, 6]. One of the problems he investigated was how to optimize the stock price using both the Black-Scholes (multiplicative) and the Bachelier (additive) models [7, 6] for the American option above the strike price K (exercise price) to a stopping point. In order to explore the non-relativistic quantum effect on the expected payoff for both the call and put <b>options</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> we assumed <b>the</b> stock price to undergo a stochastic process governed by the Bachelier (additive) model [4]. Further, using Ito calculus and martingale theory, we obtained a differential equation for the expected payoff for both the call and put options in terms of delta and gamma. We also obtained {{the solution to the}} non-relativistic Schroedinger equation as the expected payoff for both the call and put options. Then, we expressed the stochastic process that is the expected payoff for both the call and put <b>options</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> in terms of the solution to the Schroedinger equation.

40|$|Information {{asymmetry}} is {{a critical}} element in today's financial markets. While asymmetric information related to directional information trading has been extensively studied in the existing literature, there is limited research and evidence on how volatility information trading impacts the options market. This dissertation studies, both theoretically and empirically, the behaviors of volatility information traders in options markets {{and the implications of}} their behaviors on information asymmetry and options pricing. I develop a model in which investors can trade multiple option contracts with varying strikes under an asymmetric framework. I show that volatility information trading is more likely to occur in Out of <b>The</b> <b>Money</b> (OTM) <b>options</b> if <b>the</b> overall presence of informed traders is low or if the relative liquidity in OTM options is better than <b>At</b> <b>The</b> <b>Money</b> (ATM) <b>options.</b> Moreover, I show that due to the variation in implicit leverage embedded in the option contracts, the OTM option contract contains a higher volatility information risk than the ATM option contract in equilibrium. In addition, I show that this volatility information risk differential plays a central role in forming the spread structure within an option series with the same underlying asset. Finally, I show that the shape of implied volatility skew (smile) is jointly determined by volatility uncertainty and heterogeneous information risk across the option contracts. I empirically examine the implications of my theory using US equity options data, including two intra-day trade and quote datasets from the Chicago Board Option Exchange (CBOE). I estimate the Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading (VPIN) variable to measure the volatility information risk in the option market. I show that OTM contracts, on average, have a higher probability of information trading than ATM contracts. I also document that volatility risk explains a considerable proportion of the spread variations in the US equity options market. Finally, I provide evidence that the difference in information asymmetry across strike prices not only helps to explain the dynamics of implied volatility skew but also has {{a significant impact on the}} degree to which a change in historical volatility affects the shape of the implied volatility skew. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R
