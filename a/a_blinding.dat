5|$|In {{the ending}} cutscene, Keil and the dragon enter the tower. While {{traveling}} {{down a long}} corridor, the dragon surrounds Keil in a force field, lifting him from the saddle and suspending him in the hallway. Keil watches as the dragon continues on {{to the core of}} the tower, then <b>a</b> <b>blinding</b> light is seen and the tower explodes. Keil wakes up some time later in a desert area abutting the ocean. Looking down, he sees the foot prints of the blue dragon around him, indicating that after the explosion, the dragon carried him to safety and flew away.|$|E
5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, {{there was a}} lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide <b>a</b> <b>blinding</b> pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty ordered Captain Warburton-Lee {{to attack}} German {{shipping}} in Narvik, Norway on 9 April. The following morning Hardy led four of her half-sisters down Ofotfjord in a surprise dawn attack on Narvik harbour during <b>a</b> <b>blinding</b> snowstorm. A torpedo from Hardy blew off {{the stern of}} the German flagship, , and killed the German flotilla commander, Commodore Friedrich Bonte. Heidkamp sank the next day. Another hit a merchant ship in the stern. A second salvo of four torpedoes was fired at two other German destroyers, but missed and badly damaged the ore docks. After regrouping, Captain Warburton-Lee led another attack on the harbour later that morning, but inflicted little additional damage due to poor visibility.|$|E

5|$|Helios– The former God of the Sun. Helios {{had entered}} into Ares' wager, {{choosing}} the fiery-being Cereyon, who was drowned by Kratos in the God of War comic series. Years later, in Chains of Olympus, Helios was kidnapped by the Titan Atlas {{on behalf of}} the goddess Persephone, who intended to use Helios' power to destroy the Pillar of the World, causing the destruction of Olympus. The plan was thwarted by Kratos, and Helios was rescued. When Kratos turned against the gods and lead the Titans in an assault against Olympus in God of War III, Helios was injured and left for dead by the Titan Perses. Found by Kratos, Helios remained loyal to Zeus and attempted to trick Kratos, but was decapitated by the Spartan, which caused worldwide darkness and storms. The Head of Helios became a weapon for Kratos, using it to cast <b>a</b> <b>blinding</b> light and reveal hidden doorways. The character was voiced by Dwight Schultz in Chains of Olympus, and Crispin Freeman in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Vice Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hornby, {{commander}} of the Channel Squadron, transferred his flag to Agincourt as her sister Minotaur, his former flagship, was taken in hand for a refit that lasted until 1875. That year Agincourt was paid off in turn for a refit and re-armament that lasted until 1877. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, the government became concerned that the Russians might advance on the Ottoman capital of Constantinople and ordered Hornby to form a Particular Service Squadron to show the flag at Constantinople and deter any Russian threat. Agincourt served as the flagship for his second-in-command and the squadron sailed up the Dardanelles in <b>a</b> <b>blinding</b> snowstorm in February 1878. After those tensions faded, the ship returned to the Channel, where she served as second flag until 1889 including during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887. Over her active career, she served as flagship to no less than 15 admirals. That year she was again paid off and was subsequently held in reserve at Portsmouth until 1893, when she was transferred to Portland {{for use as a}} training ship.|$|E
25|$|Russia was ill-prepared {{to fight}} the Swedes, and their first attempt at seizing the Baltic coast ended in {{disaster}} at the Battle of Narva in 1700. In the conflict, the forces of Charles XII, rather than employ a slow methodical siege, attacked immediately using <b>a</b> <b>blinding</b> snowstorm to their advantage. After the battle, Charles XII decided to concentrate his forces against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which gave Peter time to reorganize the Russian army.|$|E

25|$|Bent upon making others suffer as he had, Justinian had an {{expedition}} sent against the Exarchate of Ravenna, for reasons which elude historians today— though sheer madness cannot be ruled out. Upon arriving there the expedition led by Theodore sacked the city whilst his men deceptively invited the officials to a banquet {{where they were}} seized and sent to Constantinople. Upon arrival they were met by Justinian, who had them all executed except the Archbishop, who nonetheless suffered <b>a</b> <b>blinding</b> and the usual exile— {{not being able to}} return until Justinian was in his grave. It was this execution that led to Ravenna being looted by Theodore and his men.|$|E
25|$|Six months later, in {{the midst}} of a {{masquerade}} ball, the Phantom makes his first appearance since the chandelier disaster, in costume as the Red Death. He announces that he has written an opera entitled Don Juan Triumphant and demands that it be produced immediately, with Christine (who is now secretly engaged to Raoul) in the lead role, and he warns of dire consequences if his demands are not met ("Masquerade/Why So Silent?"). Noticing an engagement ring on a chain around Christine's neck, the Phantom angrily pulls it from her and vanishes in <b>a</b> <b>blinding</b> flash of light. As the masquerade attendees scatter in fear, Raoul accosts Madame Giry and demands that she reveal what she knows about the Phantom. Giry reluctantly explains that the Phantom is actually a brilliant scholar, magician, architect, inventor, and composer who was born with a terrifyingly deformed face. Feared and reviled by society, he was cruelly exhibited in a cage as part of a travelling fair until he eventually escaped and disappeared. He has since taken refuge beneath the opera house, which has now become his home.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} many {{encounters}} between English league sides and clubs from the DDR which mostly ended {{in favour of}} the English sides, although these confrontations were less spectacular than those involving clubs from West Germany. Newport County, then from the English third division but representing Wales in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1981, went tantalisingly close to eliminating Carl Zeiss Jena after a 2–2 draw in East Germany but lost 0–1 in the home leg after <b>a</b> <b>blinding</b> display by the East German keeper Hans-Ulrich Grapenthin. Jena {{made it to the}} final where they lost to Dynamo Tbilisi of Georgia, then part of the Soviet Union. Liverpool had three confrontations with Dynamo Dresden which they all won, including a splendid 5–1 performance at Anfield {{in the second round of}} the 1977-78 European Cup competition. Nottingham Forest played SC Dynamo Berlin in the quarter finals of the 1979-80 European Cup. Forest, the 1979 European Cup holders, had a mountain to climb to hold on to the trophy, having lost the first leg at the City Ground 0–1 to a goal by Hans-Jürgen Riediger. A Trevor Francis and John Robertson inspired Forest ran riot in Berlin in the second leg as Forest triumphed 3–1. Brian Clough's Forest then went on to beat Ajax and Hamburg to retain the trophy and a different Forest side, still managed by Clough, would eventually see off another East German side, Vorwärts Frankfurt/Oder in the first round of the 1983-84 UEFA Cup. As for Dynamo Berlin, they suffered another home defeat (1–2) in the 1981-82 European Cup to another English side, Aston Villa. They managed to register another victory (1–0) on English soil in the return leg only to be ousted on the away goal rule by Villa who went on to keep the European Cup in England for a sixth consecutive year, beating FC Bayern Munich in the Rotterdam final. Forest cast-away, Peter Withe, scored the only goal of the game against the run of play. For most of the second half, Bayern were camped inside the Villa half, hit the woodwork, went tantaisingly close on a number of occasions but found substitute rookie goalkeeper, Nigel Spink (who replaced veteran Jimmy Rimmer after only a few minutes), in inspiring form.|$|E
