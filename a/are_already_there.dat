2500|$|Michael Cavanagh, the {{chairman}} of Commonwealth Games Scotland, said a decision to stay away would be a joint one, as he insisted a possible knock on effects for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow {{would not be a}} factor. [...] He said [...] "In terms of withdrawal we don't see this as simply a Team Scotland decision, any decision to withdraw we would see as being a collective decision amongst the countries who <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>there</b> and already concerned. We can't allow ourselves to be influenced by thoughts of how it may impact on 2014, not when we have something as important as the safety of our athletes to consider." [...] Phillips Idowu, the world triple jump champion, also withdrew from the Games.|$|E

"When {{my brother}} left us yesterday, he {{imagined}} that the business which took him to London might be concluded {{in three or four}} days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, {{and at the same time}} convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>there</b> for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you." ...|$|E

6000|$|From little Ferdinand's room Friedrich Wilhelm has himself {{rolled into}} Queen Sophie's. [...] "Feekin, O my Feekin, thou must rise this day, {{and help me}} what thou canst. This day I am going to die; thou wilt be with me this day!" [...] The good Wife rises: I know {{not that it was}} the first time she had been so called; but it did prove the last. Friedrich Wilhelm has decided, as the first thing he will do, to abdicate; and all the Official persons and companions of the sick-room, Pollnitz among them, not long after sunrise, are called to see it done. Pollnitz, huddling on his clothes, arrived about five: in a {{corridor}} he sees the wheeled-chair and poor sick King; steps aside to let him pass: [...] "'It is over (DAS IST VOLLBRACHT),' said the King, looking up to me as he passed: he had on his nightcap, and a blue mantle thrown round him." [...] He was wheeled into his anteroom; there let the company assemble; many of them <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Seckendorf, Schulenburg, Grumkow and {{all hands}} are busy in this matter: geeho-ing the Crown-Prince towards the mark set before him. With or without explosion, arrive there he must; other goal {{for him is}} none!--In the mean while, it appears, illustrious Franz of Lorraine, coming on, amid the proper demonstrations, through Magdeburg and the Prussian Towns, has caught some slight illness and been obliged to pause; so that Berlin cannot have the {{happiness}} of seeing him quite so soon as it expected. The high guests invited to meet Duke Franz, especially the high Brunswicks, <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>there.</b> High Brunswicks, Bevern with Duchess, and still more important, with Son and with Daughter:--insipid CORPUS DELICTI herself has appeared on the scene; and Grumkow, we find, has been writing some description of her to the Crown-Prince. Description of an unfavorable nature; below the truth, not above it, to avert disappointment, nay to create some gleam of inverse joy, when the actual meeting occurs. That is his art in driving the fiery little Arab ignominiously yoked to him; {{and it is clear}} he has overdone it, for once. This is Friedrich's THIRD utterance to him; much the most emphatic there is:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{they must}} be fonder of journeying on horseback than I am," [...] the captain said. [...] "While {{we are in the}} Hope, where, indeed, for aught I know, we may tarry but a day or two, they could come down by boat {{conveniently}} without trouble, whereas to Yarmouth it is a very long ride, with the risk of losing their purses to the gentlemen of the road. Moreover, though the orders are at present that the Fleet gather at Yarmouth, and many <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>there</b> 'tis like that it may be changed in a day for Harwich or the Downs. I pray you get your meals at your inn to-day, for we are, as you see, full of work taking on board stores. If it please you to stay and watch what is doing here you are heartily welcome, but please tell the others that they had best not come off until late in the evening, by which time I will do what I can to have a place ready for them to sleep. We shall sail {{at the turn of the}} tide, which will be at three o'clock in the morning." ...|$|E

60|$|The Convention, driven such {{a course}} by wild wind, wild tide, and {{steerage}} and non-steerage, these three years, has become weary of its own existence, sees all men weary of it; and wishes heartily to finish. To the last, it has to strive with contradictions: it is now getting fast ready with a Constitution, yet knows no peace. Sieyes, we say, is making the Constitution once more; has as good as made it. Warned by experience, the great Architect alters much, admits much. Distinction of Active and Passive Citizen, that is, Money-qualification for Electors: nay Two Chambers, 'Council of Ancients,' as well as 'Council of Five Hundred;' to that conclusion have we come! In a like spirit, eschewing that fatal self-denying ordinance of your Old Constituents, we enact not only that actual Convention Members are re-eligible, but that Two-thirds of them must be re-elected. The Active Citizen Electors shall for this time have free choice of only One-third of their National Assembly. Such enactment, of Two-thirds to be re-elected, we append to our Constitution; we submit our Constitution to the Townships of France, and say, Accept both, or reject both. Unsavoury as this appendix may be, the Townships, by overwhelming majority, accept and ratify. With Directory of Five; with Two good Chambers, double-majority of them nominated by ourselves, one hopes this Constitution may prove final. March it will; for the legs of it, the re-elected Two-thirds, <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>there,</b> able to march. Sieyes looks at his Paper Fabric with just pride.|$|E
60|$|The antiquity of {{the port}} appeals to the {{imagination}} by the long chain of adventurous enterprises that had their inception in the town and floated {{out into the world}} on the waters of the river. Even the newest of the docks, the Tilbury Dock, shares in the glamour conferred by historical associations. Queen Elizabeth has made one of her progresses down there, not one of her journeys of pomp and ceremony, but an anxious business progress at a crisis of national history. The menace of that time has passed away, and now Tilbury is known by its docks. These are very modern, but their remoteness and isolation upon the Essex marsh, the days of failure attending their creation, invested them with a romantic air. Nothing in those days could have been more striking than the vast, empty basins, surrounded by miles of bare quays and the ranges of cargo-sheds, where two or three ships seemed lost like bewitched children in a forest of gaunt, hydraulic cranes. One received a wonderful impression of utter abandonment, of wasted efficiency. From the first the Tilbury Docks were very efficient and ready for their task, but they had come, perhaps, too soon into the field. A great future lies before Tilbury Docks. They shall never fill a long-felt want (in the sacramental phrase that is applied to railways, tunnels, newspapers, and new editions of books). They were too early in the field. The want shall never be felt because, free of the trammels of the tide, easy of access, magnificent and desolate, they <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>there,</b> prepared to take and keep the biggest ships that float upon the sea. They are worthy of the oldest river port in the world.|$|E
5000|$|The {{books on}} the lists were chosen by experts. The books can be {{recommended}} by GPs or other health professionals, or they can be borrowed from almost every public library in England. The scheme {{was based on a}} similar scheme in Wales, which was set up by Professor Neil Frude in 2003 (the Welsh assembly made it available nationally in 2005). Neil Frude said [...] "The doctors <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>there,</b> the books <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>there</b> and so are the libraries. It just needed joining them up." ...|$|E

50|$|There are two tracks at {{this station}} (not {{including}} the third, side track that leads into the nearby train yard), {{but only one}} platform, which means {{only one of the}} two tracks can be used.
