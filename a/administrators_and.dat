5|$|Bermuda's {{debut in}} the Olympic Games began with the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Nazi Germany, when the Bermudian {{delegation}} included five athletes, all men. Bermuda had appeared in twenty-one Olympic Games between 1936 and the 2008 Beijing Olympics, excluding the 1980 Summer Olympics. Of those twenty-one games, sixteen of them were Summer Olympics. Bermuda had, prior to Beijing, earned one medal, when Clarence Hill won bronze in the 1976 Summer Olympics. The 2008 Bermudian delegation had fewer people than it usually sent abroad, prompting {{the president of the}} Bermudian Olympic Association Austin Woods to complain publicly that the year's Olympic team lacked access to quality coaches, <b>administrators,</b> <b>and</b> facilities, and with the exception of several athletes, lacked the skill to be competitive.|$|E
5|$|Both the Inspector and Governor were {{responsible}} for inspecting commandery-level <b>Administrators</b> <b>and</b> their staffs, {{as well as the}} semi-autonomous kingdoms and their staffs. They evaluated officials on criteria of competence, honesty, obedience to the imperial court, adherence to the law, their treatment of convicts, and any signs of extortion, nepotism, or factionalism. These reports were submitted to the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk and Imperial Counselor during Western Han, but by Eastern Han these reports were submitted to each of the Three Excellencies. The reports were then used to promote, demote, dismiss, or prosecute local officials.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century major landowners {{tended to}} rent out their demesne lands for money, {{motivated}} by static prices for produce and {{the chaos of}} the Anarchy between 1135 and 1153. This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s, spurred by the greater political stability. In the first years of John's reign, agricultural prices almost doubled, at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing the cost of living for the landowners themselves. Landowners now attempted wherever possible to bring their demesne lands back into direct management, creating a system of <b>administrators</b> <b>and</b> officials to run their new system of estates.|$|E
