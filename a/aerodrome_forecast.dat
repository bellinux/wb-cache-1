40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOver the past 20 years, {{there have been}} many advancements in the process of weather. Specific contributions to improvements in the forecast process come from improvements in numerical model forecast guidance and the timely availability of many new observational data types. As numerical forecasts guidance improves, it has become important to document the value a human forecaster adds to the forecast process. Because of collateral duties and career requirements, United States Navy forecasters often find it difficult to become proficient at forecasting. In this study, a basic forecast process was used to identify the skill in forecasts of ceiling and visibility made by human forecasters and produced by a statistical modification to numerical model fields.

Climate determining is an capricious procedure that includes various particular fields of mastery. A fuzzy logic based methodology can be implemented with the Case based Reasoning (CBR) system.

Case Based Reasoning is method of solving a new problem with the help of old solutions. According to fuzzy k-nn based prediction algorithm we can get the predictable parameters such as visibilities, cloud ceilings.

The study aimed at investigating the utilization of METAR and satellite products, {{as well as their}} performance in issuance of Terminal <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Forecast</b> at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.

40|$|For any {{aircraft}} accident, {{the first}} suspected cause is weather until thorough investigations reveal the true cause. Indeed different weather events pose various hazards on aircrafts significantly. Since {{the commercialization of}} some of the services rendered by the South African Weather Services (SAWS) such as the aviation weather products, there is a greater need for SAWS aviation weather forecasters to deliver quality forecasts. It is therefore necessary to identify the most dangerous and most common weather hazards which are detrimental to the aviation industry so as to enhance the expertise on addressing them. With the aid of improved forecasting tools such as Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) which provides different images of clouds every fifteen minutes and Radar network which provides images every five minutes, it becomes much easier to identify dangerous clouds and give prior warning to the aviation industry.

The objective of this report is to compare predicted detection ranges from the EOTDA with actual reported detection ranges collected during the MAPTIP trials. During MAPTIP, TNO Physics and Electronics Laboratory the Netherlands employed a Safire infrared FLIR system aboard a P- 3 Orion aircraft and used the ship, the Hr. Ms. Tydeman, as a target. Ten sorties were flown and meteorological conditions were continuously recorded aboard the Hr. Ms. Tydeman.

The EOTDA was then run using the standard frigate model included in the EOTDA target menu. When the results are compared with the reported detection ranges, the data was scattered and showed a tendency to over-predict detection ranges. The average error was 51 % on first pass. After correcting the FLIR operator observations using the video recordings, the error was reduced to 41 %.

40|$|Airport arrival capacity, {{referred}} to {{here as the}} airport acceptance rate (AAR), is strongly influenced by the weather {{in the vicinity of}} the airport and thus AAR prediction necessitates an airport-specific weather forecast. Weather forecasts, however, are seldom accurate in predicting the actual weather conditions. Strategic decisions, for example arrival rates in a ground delay program (GDP), must be made ahead of time, usually more than two hours, when there is an uncertainty about the future capacity. This research uses probabilistic capacity scenarios to represent the uncertainty in the future arrival capacity. A probabilistic capacity scenario is defined as a time series of AAR values with which a certain probability of realization is associated. A set of probabilistic capacity scenarios may be used to represent the uncertainty in arrival capacity at an airport over the course of the day. There has been considerable research in developing GDP models that determine efficient ground delay decisions and require probabilistic capacity scenarios as inputs. It is assumed that the capacity scenarios can be developed from weather forecasts or can be obtained from the expertise of the air traffic managers. There is, however, considerably less literature on the development of specific day-of-operation probabilistic capacity scenarios from weather forecasts. This limits the use of these GDP models in real- world application. This thesis fills that gap and presents methodologies to generate probabilistic capacity scenarios from weather forecasts. In this thesis we develop methodologies for generating probabilistic capacity scenarios using a widely available airport-specific weather forecast called the Terminal <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Forecast</b> (TAF). These methodologies require the issued TAF forecast and the realized capacity for days in the past. We apply and assess the performance of these methodologies on four US airports: San Francisco International Airport, Boston Logan International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Los Angeles International Airports. Though we have focused on these airports as case studies, the TAF-based scenario generation techniques can be applied to any airport. In the first methodology, TAF Clustering, the scenarios are representative capacity profiles for days having similar TAFs. Groups of similar TAFs are found using K-means clustering and the number is verified using Silhouette value. In the second methodology, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Scenarios, the scenarios are the actual realized capacity profiles for days that have similar TAFs. The similarity between TAFs is determined using a statistical technique for comparing multidimensional time series called DTW. DTW Scenarios uses three airport specific input parameters. These parameters control the numbers and the probabilities of the scenarios. We determine the values of the parameters through optimization to maximize the performance of the scenarios through minimizing average delay costs. The optimal values are determined through a specialized algorithm designed for situations where evaluating the objective function is computationally expensive. For San Francisco International Airport we also use another forecast: the San Francisco Marine Initiative forecast (STRATUS) to develop the scenarios. In this methodology called, Fog burn-off clustering, the scenarios are representative capacity profiles for days that have the fog burn-off time in the same quarter hour. We measure the efficacy of the various scenario generation methodologies in a real world setting based on 45 historic days for each of the four case-study airports. For each day, the generated scenarios are provided as inputs to a static stochastic ground delay model (SSGDM) that determines the series of planned arrival rates that minimize the sum of ground delay costs and expected air delay costs, assuming that the plan is not adjusted to evolving information. The ground delay is determined directly from the SSGDM whereas the realized air delay is determined from a queuing diagram based on the planned arrival rate and the realized arrival capacity. The realized delay costs are averaged over 45 days for each airport, and is the metric used to compare the different scenario generation methodologies. Employing this approach, we compare the different methods for capacity scenario generation against each other and against two other reference cases. Under the first reference case, Naïve Clustering, the scenarios are developed from historical capacity data without the use of the weather forecast. Groups of similar arrival profiles are determined though K-means clustering. In the second reference case, Perfect Information, we assume that the GDP is planned based on perfect information about the future arrival capacity. Our results show that, on average, scenarios generated using the TAF-based DTW method results in the lowest delay cost amongst all scenario based methodologies. It is shown that capacity scenarios generated using day-of-operation weather forecasts can reduce the cost of delays by 5 %- 30 % compared to scenarios that do not make use of weather forecast. The benefit of the TAF based approach is more pronounced on days that have a greater capacity-demand imbalance when compared to Naïve Clustering...|$|E
5000|$|A {{universal}} access transceiver is a data link intended {{to serve the}} majority of the general aviation community. The data link is approved in the Federal Aviation Administration's [...] "final rule" [...] for use in all airspace except class A (above 18,000 ft. MSL). UAT is intended to support not only ADS-B, but also flight information service - broadcast (FIS-B), traffic information service - broadcast (TIS-B), and, if required in the future, supplementary ranging and positioning capabilities. [...] Due to the set of standards required for this rule, it is seen as the most effective application for general aviation users. UAT will allow aircraft equipped with [...] "out" [...] broadcast capabilities to be seen by any other aircraft using ADS-B In technology as well as by FAA ground stations. Aircraft equipped with ADS-B In technology {{will be able to see}} detailed altitude and vector information from other ADS-B Out equipped aircraft as well as FIS-B and TIS-B broadcasts. The FIS-B broadcast will allow receiving aircraft to view weather and flight service information including AIRMETs, SIGMETs, METARs, SPECI, national NEXRAD, regional NEXRAD, D-NOTAMs, FDC-NOTAMs, PIREPs, special use airspace status, terminal area <b>forecasts,</b> amended terminal <b>aerodrome</b> <b>forecasts</b> (TAFs), winds and temperature aloft. [...] These broadcasts serve to provide early adopters of the technology with benefits as an incentive for more pilots to use the technology before 2020. Aircraft receiving traffic information through the TIS-B service will see other aircraft in a manner that is similar to how all aircraft will be seen after they have equipped by 2020. The availability of a non-subscription weather information service, FIS-B, provides general aviation users with a useful alternative to other monthly or annual fee-based services.|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} value of weather forecasts for airports for commercial aviation is investigated by introducing financial data into {{the decision-making process}} for fuel carriage by aircraft. Using specific operating costs for a given flight, an optimal decision probability threshold can be calculated that identifies whether that flight should carry extra fuel, in case of adverse weather conditions and subsequent diversion. Forecasts of these adverse conditions can then be applied to a critical threshold to make a real-time decision regarding the carriage of additional fuel. This study focuses on forecasts of low ceiling and/or reduced visibility and their corresponding impact on forecast value for flights arriving at three major airports in the United States. Eighteen daily flights by American Airlines were examined during a 14 -month period, a total of approximately 7500 flights. Using operating cost data from this period, a critical decision threshold was derived for each daily flight. Two sets of forecasts, statistically derived probabilistic forecasts and National Weather Service terminal <b>aerodrome</b> <b>forecasts</b> (TAFs), were then applied to each flight's fuel carriage decision-making process. The probabilistic forecasts, which utilize regional surface observations, were generated for the destination airport with a lead time appropriate to the airline's flight planning time. If the forecast probability of adverse weather was greater than the critical decision threshold for a given flight, then additional fuel was deemed necessary for that flight. The categorical TAFs that corresponded timewise to the developed probabilistic forecasts were obtained for each location. For this study, a categorical "yes" forecast denotes the expectation that the visibility and/or cloud ceiling conditions are such that extra fuel is required, while a categorical "no" forecast does not require extra fuel. The analysis presented herein indicates that by using statistical, probabilistic forecasts rather than categorical forecasts, a significant saving is made in operating costs. This is probably because of a more optimal balance between false alarms and misses for each flight, rather than more "accurate" forecasts per se. This is the mechanism by which probabilistic forecasts create value, rather than {{increasing the number of}} hits and correct rejections and/or decreasing the number of false alarms and misses. For each of the flights investigated in this study, the total cost of using probabilistic forecasts was less than that of using TAFs. An average of $ 23, 000 is saved per flight during this 14 -month period. Projecting these figures over all American Airlines flights, a potential annual savings of approximately $ 50 million in operating costs would be realized by using probabilistic forecasts of adverse landing weather conditions instead of the traditional TAF...|$|R
40|$|Mesoscale weather {{conditions}} can significantly affect the space launch and landing operations at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS). During the summer months, land-sea interactions that occur across KSC and CCAFS {{lead to the}} formation of a sea breeze, which can then spawn deep convection. These convective processes often last 60 minutes or less and pose a significant challenge to the forecasters at the National Weather Service (NWS) Spaceflight Meteorology Group (SMG). The main challenge is that a "GO" forecast for thunderstorms and precipitation at the Shuttle Landing Facility is required at the 90 minute deorbit decision for End Of Mission (EOM) and at the 30 minute Return To Launch Site (RTLS) decision. Convective initiation, timing, and mode also present a forecast challenge for the NWS in Melbourne, FL (MLB). The NWS MLB issues such tactical forecast information as Terminal <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Forecasts</b> (TAF 5), Spot Forecasts for fire weather and hazardous materials incident support, and severe/hazardous weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. Lastly, these forecasting challenges can also affect the 45 th Weather Squadron (45 WS), which provides comprehensive weather forecasts for shuttle launch, as well as ground operations, at KSC and CCAFS. The need for accurate mesoscale model forecasts to aid in their decision making is crucial. This study specifically addresses the skill of different model configurations in forecasting warm season convective initiation. Numerous factors influence the development of convection over the Florida peninsula. These factors include sea breezes, river and lake breezes, the prevailing low-level flow, and convergent flow due to convex coastlines that enhance the sea breeze. The interaction of these processes produces the warm season convective patterns seen over the Florida peninsula. However, warm season convection {{remains one of the most}} poorly forecast meteorological parameters. To determine which configuration options are best to address this specific forecast concern, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which has two dynamical cores - the Advanced Research WRF (ARW) and the Non-hydrostatic Mesoscale Model (NMM) was employed. In addition to the two dynamical cores, there are also two options for a "hot-start" initialization of the WRF model - the Local Analysis and Prediction System (LAPS; McGinley 1995) and the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) Data Analysis System (ADAS; Brewster 1996). Both LAPS and ADAS are 3 - dimensional weather analysis systems that integrate multiple meteorological data sources into one consistent analysis over the user's domain of interest. This allows mesoscale models to benefit from the addition of highresolution data sources. Having a series of initialization options and WRF cores, as well as many options within each core, provides SMG and MLB with considerable flexibility as well as challenges. It is the goal of this study to assess the different configurations available and to determine which configuration will best predict warm season convective initiation...|$|R

The need for accurate mesoscale model forecasts to aid in their decision making is crucial. Both the SMG and the MLB are currently implementing the Weather Research and Forecasting Environmental Modeling System (WRF EMS) software into their operations. The WRF EMS software allows users to employ both dynamical cores - the Advanced Research WRF (ARW) and the Non-hydrostatic Mesoscale Model (NMM). There are also data assimilation analysis packages available for the initialization of the WRF model- the Local Analysis and Prediction System (LAPS) and the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) Data Analysis System (ADAS). Having a series of initialization options and WRF cores, as well as many options within each core, provides SMG and NWS MLB with a lot of flexibility. It also creates challenges, such as determining which configuration options are best to address specific forecast concerns. The goal of this project is to assess the different configurations available and to determine which configuration will best predict warm season convective initiation in East-Central Florida. Four different combinations of WRF initializations will be run (ADAS-ARW, ADAS-NMM, LAPS-ARW, and LAPS-NMM) at a 4 -km resolution over the Florida peninsula and adjacent coastal waters. Five candidate convective initiation days using three different flow regimes over East-Central Florida will be examined, as well as two null cases (non-convection days). Each model run will be integrated 12 hours with three runs per day, at 0900, 1200, and 1500 UTe. ADAS analyses will be generated every 30 minutes using Level II Weather Surveillance Radar- 1988 Doppler (WSR- 88 D) data from all Florida radars to verify the convection forecast. These analyses will be run on the same domain as the four model configurations. To quantify model performance, model output will be subjectively compared to the ADAS analyses of convection to determine forecast accuracy. In addition, a subjective comparison of the performance of the ARW using a high-resolution local grid with 2 -way nesting, I-way nesting, and no nesting will be made for select convective initiation cases. The inner grid will cover the East-Central Florida region at a resolution of 1. 33 km. The authors will summarize the relative skill of the various WRF configurations and how each configuration behaves relative to the others, as well as determine the best model configuration for predicting warm season convective initiation over East-Central Florida...|$|R
