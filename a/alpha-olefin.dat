50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>alpha-olefins,</b> {{branched}} and linear (or normal). The chemical properties of branched <b>alpha-olefins</b> with a branch at either the second (vinylidene) or the third carbon number are significantly different from the properties of linear <b>alpha-olefins</b> and those with branches on the fourth carbon number and further {{from the start of the}} chain.|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the double}} bonds, these 4-carbon alkenes can act as {{monomers}} {{in the formation of}} polymers, as well as having other uses as petrochemical intermediates. They are used in the production of synthetic rubber. But-1-ene is a linear or normal <b>alpha-olefin</b> and isobutylene is a branched <b>alpha-olefin.</b> In a rather low percentage, but-1-ene is used as one of the comonomers, along with other alpha-olefins, in the production of high-density polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene. Butyl rubber is made by cationic polymerisation of isobutylene with about 2 - 7% isoprene. Isobutylene is also used for the production of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and isooctane, both of which improve the combustion of gasoline.|$|E

5000|$|... 1-Octene is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with a formula CH2CHC6H13. The alkene {{is classified as}} a higher olefin and <b>alpha-olefin,</b> meaning that the double bond {{is located at the}} alpha (primary) position, endowing this compound with higher reactivity and thus useful chemical properties. 1-Octene is one of the important linear alpha olefins in industry.

50|$|The {{most common}} stretch wrap {{material}} linear low-density polyethylene or LLDPE, which {{is produced by}} copolymerization of ethylene with <b>alpha-olefins,</b> {{the most common of}} which are butene, hexene and octene. The use of higher <b>alpha-olefins</b> (hexene or octene) gives rise to enhanced stretch film characteristics, particularly in respect of elongation at break and puncture resistance. Other types of polyethylene and PVC can also be used. Many films have about 500% stretch at break but are only stretched to about 100 - 300% in use. Once stretched, the elastic recovery is used to keep the load tight.|$|R

40|$|The {{search for}} a {{low-cost}} process for the valorization of linear <b>alpha-olefins</b> combining high productivity and high selectivity is a longstanding goal for chemists. Herein, we report a soluble ruthenium olefin metathesis catalyst that performs the conversion of linear <b>alpha-olefins</b> to longer internal linear olefins with high selectivity (> 99 %) under neat conditions at low loadings (50 ppm) and without the need of expensive additives. This robust catalytic process allowed us to efficiently and selectively re-equilibrate the naphtha fraction (C- 5 -C- 8) of a Fischer-Tropsch feed derived from non petroleum resources to a higher-value product range (C- 9 -C- 14), useful as detergent and plasticizer precursors...|$|R
5000|$|Practically all polyolefins {{that are}} of any {{practical}} or commercial importance are poly-alpha-olefin (or poly-α-olefin or polyalphaolefin, sometimes abbreviated as PAO), a polymer made by polymerizing an <b>alpha-olefin.</b> An <b>alpha-olefin</b> (or α-olefin) is an alkene where the carbon-carbon double bond starts at the α-carbon atom, i.e. the double bond is between the #1 and #2 carbons in the molecule. Alpha-olefins such as 1-hexene {{may be used as}} co-monomers to give a alkyl branched polymer (see chemical structure below), although 1-decene is most commonly used for lubricant base stocks. [...] Many poly-alpha-olefins have flexible alkyl branching groups on every other carbon of their polymer backbone chain. These alkyl groups, which can shape themselves in numerous conformations, make it very difficult for the polymer molecules to align themselves up side-by-side in an orderly way. This results in lower contact surface area between the molecules and decreases the intermolecular interactions between molecules. Therefore, many poly-alpha-olefins do not crystallize or solidify easily and are able to remain oily, viscous liquids even at lower temperatures. [...] Low molecular weight poly-alpha-olefins are useful as synthetic lubricants such as synthetic motor oils for vehicles and can be used over a wide temperature range.|$|E
5000|$|Hexene is an alkene with a {{molecular}} formula C6H12. The prefix [...] "hex" [...] {{is derived from}} {{the fact that there are}} 6 carbon atoms in the molecule, while the [...] "-ene" [...] suffix denotes that there is an alkene present—two carbon atoms are connected via a double bond. There are several isomers of hexene, depending on the position and geometry of the double bond in the chain. One of the most common industrially useful isomers is 1-hexene, an <b>alpha-olefin.</b> Hexene is used as a comonomer in the production of polyethylene.|$|E
5000|$|... 1-Dodecene is an alkene {{with the}} formula C10H21CH=CH2, {{consisting}} of a chain of twelve carbon atoms terminating with a double bond. While there are many isomers of dodecene depending on which carbon the double bond is placed, this isomer is of greater commercial importance. It is classified as an <b>alpha-olefin.</b> Alpha-olefins are distinguished by having a double bond at the primary or alpha (α) position. This location of a double bond enhances the reactivity of the compound and makes it useful {{for a number of}} applications, especially for the production of detergents.|$|E

5000|$|Even polyethylenes copolymerized with a {{small amount}} of <b>alpha-olefins</b> (such as 1-hexene, 1-octene, or longer) are more {{flexible}} than simple straight-chain high-density polyethylene, which has no branching.

40|$|Olefin {{copolymers}} of <b>alpha-olefins</b> with polar monomers {{with various}} architectures remain an ultimate goal in polyolefin engineering. The present paper {{is a more}} detailed study on the copolymn. of <b>alpha-olefins</b> (1 -octene) with acrylates (Me acrylate). Comparison of reaction kinetics between free radical polymn. (FRP) and atom transfer radical polymn. (ATRP), monomer feed compn., ligand influence and chem. compn. distribution (CCD) using mass spectrometry, were studied. Copolymn. of Me acrylate and 1 -octene using both FRP and ATRP, resulted in copolymers constituting almost 25 mol% 1 -octene. Increasing the mol% of the olefin in the monomer feed, led {{to an increase in}} the level of incorporation of the olefin in the copolymer. Controlled CCD was obtained for the copolymers produced by ATRP, since, during FRP significant side reactions occurred. The copolymn. under ATRP conditions could be conducted using various ligand systems...|$|R
50|$|Like Group 4 metallocenes, {{suitable}} Group 4 CGCs may {{be activated}} for the {{polymerisation of ethylene}} and alpha-olefins by reaction with co-catalysts, e.g. methylaluminoxane (MAO), tris(pentafluorophenyl)boranes, and trityl borates. The catalytic systems based on CGCs, however, display incorporation of <b>alpha-olefin</b> comonomers to a greater extend than comparable metallocene based systems. This superiority of CGCs in copolymerisation reactions is ascribed to (i) a high accessibility of the reactive centre and (ii) a low tendency of the bulk polymer chain to undergo chain transfer reactions. CGC derived polymers are currently marketed by The Dow Chemical Company {{as part of their}} INSITE technology.|$|E
5000|$|There are two <b>alpha-olefin</b> {{processes}} {{that have not}} been commercialized as of Q2, 2010. One is an ethylene oligomerization {{to a wide range of}} linear alpha olefins technology being offered by a technology licensor UOP. The other is the DuPont Versipol technology. [...] To date, no commercial plants have been built using either UOP or DuPont's technology. [...] The only commercial process to isolate linear alpha olefins from synthetic crude is practiced by Sasol Ltd., a South African oil and gas and petrochemical company. Sasol commercially employs Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to make fuels from synthesis gas derived from coal and recovers 1-hexene from these fuel streams, where the initial linear alpha olefin concentration in a narrow distillation cut may be 60%, with the remainder being vinylidenes, linear and branched internal olefins, linear and branched paraffins, alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and aromatic compounds.|$|E
50|$|Cross {{metathesis}} and Ring-closing metathesis {{are often}} {{driven by the}} entropically favored evolution of ethylene or propylene, which are both gases. Because of this CM and RCM reactions often use alpha-olefins. The reverse reaction of CM of two alpha-olefins, ethenolysis, can be favored but requires high pressures of ethylene to increase ethylene concentration in solution. The reverse reaction of RCM, ring-opening metathesis, can likewise be favored by a large excess of an <b>alpha-olefin,</b> often styrene. Ring opening metathesis usually involves a strained alkene (often a norbornene) {{and the release of}} ring strain drives the reaction. Ring-closing metathesis, conversely, usually involves the formation of a five- or six-membered ring, which is energetically favorable; although these reactions tend to also evolve ethylene, as previously discussed. RCM has been used to close larger macrocycles, in which case the reaction may be kinetically controlled by running the reaction at extreme dilutions. The same substrates that undergo RCM can undergo acyclic diene metathesis, with ADMET favored at high concentrations. The Thorpe-Ingold effect may also be exploited to improve both reaction rates and product selectivity.|$|E
40|$|Among many {{precursors}} and catalysts for <b>alpha-olefins</b> polymerization, {{one seems}} to be particularly interesting, because it has not been completely clarified yet. We refer especially to precursors obtained via reaction between Mg-alkyls and SiCl 4. The products of this reaction are not well known; in fact, under some operating conditions, a special form of MgCl 2 is obtained, showing x-ray diffraction peaks in the angular region lower than 15 ° (2 theta), which corresponds to the 5. 9 A interplanar spacing, characteristic of alpha-MgCl 2. Under other conditions, MgCl 2 is obtained in the well known and strongly disordered delta structure. By employing these precursors, some catalytic systems for <b>alpha-olefins</b> polymerization have been prepared. In this paper, the peculiar aspects of these precursors and catalysts are described, particularly focusing on the correlation between structure and performances in ethylene and propylene polymerization...|$|R
