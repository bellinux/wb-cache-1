5|$|In January 2015, Florida State University's Center for Advanced Power Systems has {{unveiled}} a new 24,000-volt direct current power test system, {{the most powerful}} of its kind available <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>university</b> research center throughout the world. The new test facility is the latest piece of the center's PHIL testing program. It has a 24,000-volt direct current with a capacity of 5 megawatts, making it the most powerful PHIL system of its kind <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>university</b> research center worldwide. To create the new system, the center put together four individual 6 kilovolt, 1.25 megawatt converters that can be arranged in any combination, in series or parallel connection, to form an extremely flexible test bed for medium voltage direct current (MVDC) system investigations.|$|E

5|$|Edward VI acceded to the English throne in 1547, and the Protestant reformers there {{hoped to}} take the {{opportunity}} to more thoroughly reform the Church of England. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer invited Vermigli and Ochino to assist in the effort. In addition, the victory of Catholic Emperor Charles V in the Schmalkaldic War and the resulting Augsburg Interim led to a hostile environment for Protestants in Germany. Vermigli accepted the invitation in November and sailed with Ochino to England. In 1548, he replaced Richard Smyth, becoming the second Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. This was a very influential post <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>university</b> which had been slow to accept reform.|$|E

5|$|ISMB 1997 {{was held}} in Halkidiki, Greece and marked the {{foundation}} of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). ISCB was formed with a focus on managing all scientific, organizational and financial aspects of the ISMB conference and to provide a forum for scientists to address the emerging role of computers in the biological sciences. ISCB has assisted in organising the ISMB conference series since 1998. The period following the formation of ISCB also marked an expansion in the number of ISMB attendees: ISMB 2000 (held at the University of California, San Diego) was attended by over 1,000 delegates, submitting 141 scientific papers. This meeting was also the last time ISMB would be held <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>university,</b> due to size limitations.|$|E
5|$|Natural gas {{was first}} found in Indiana in 1876 {{but it was}} not until 1886 that the {{magnitude}} of the discovery was known; the Trenton Gas Field was the largest deposit of natural gas discovered in the 19th century and the first giant oil reserve found in the United States. As a professor <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>university</b> in the Trenton Field, Haynes offered his services to the drillers and worked to analyze soil samples, determine well pressure, and give estimates on the amount of energy that could be created by the gas. He delivered several lectures to large crowds about the importance of the gas discovery and the many possible applications of this new source of fuel. He began a petition to have the local citizens create a corporation to pump the fuel from the ground and pipe it to area homes and businesses. His promotion was successful and Portland Natural Gas and Oil Company was formed; Haynes' father was named to the new company's board of directors.|$|E

5|$|Alomar {{made her}} {{first and only}} {{appearance}} in Resident Evil 5. According to the character's backstory, her parents {{died when she was}} eight years old in an apparent factory accident and she was taken in by her uncle. Eventually, Alomar ran away and was found by a truck driver who was part of a rebel militia group. She later joined the group and soon learned that the factory accident her parents had died in was actually a test of a bio-organic weapon (BOW) by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella Corporation. With the help of the local government, Umbrella destroyed Alomar's village and its inhabitants after the test was complete. When Alomar was 15, she was contacted by U.S. operatives to sabotage Umbrella's attempt to sell a BOW. With Alomar's help, the deal was stopped and she was offered a chance {{to start a new life}} in America. Alomar accepted, was speaking fluent English within months and enrolled <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>university</b> two years later. After graduation, her benefactor recruited her to join the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA). While Umbrella had dissolved years before this, Alomar's hatred of Umbrella and others like them led her to join. She was assigned to a unit for eight months of training, in which she excelled and was chosen to become an agent assigned to the BSAA's West African department. When BSAA agent Chris Redfield is sent to intercept a black market BOW sale in the fictional African country Kijuju, Alomar is assigned to be his partner and guide.|$|E
