500|$|After {{seeing the}} {{portrayal}} of Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios {{has a bit of}} a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [...] treated {{in such a way that}} their freak flags are allowed to fly free.|$|E
50|$|At {{another such}} session, Mr Rucastle told {{a series of}} funny stories that made Miss Hunter laugh until she was quite weary. The one {{astonishing}} thing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Rucastle not only did not laugh, but did not even smile.|$|R

50|$|Another {{remarkable}} thing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> temple <b>is</b> <b>that</b> leeches {{very common in}} most parts of Wayanad are not found in the surrounding area of this temple. According to the legend, goddess Seetha cursed the leeches that bit Lava and Kusa. Another significant thing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> place <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a large number of termite mounds(valmeekam) can be seen at different spots. The festival of this temple celebrated {{in the first week of}} January is considered to be the regional festival attended by large number of people belonging to different castes and creed.|$|R

2500|$|The slot-and-state syntax in MCell {{can also}} be used to model multimeric {{proteins}} or macromolecular complexes. When used in this way, a slot is a placeholder for a subunit or a molecular component of a complex, and the state of the slot will indicate whether a specific protein component is absent or present in the complex. A way to think <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> MCell macromolecules can have several dimensions: A [...] "state dimension" [...] and one or more [...] "spatial dimensions". The [...] "state dimension" [...] is used to describe the multiple possible states making up a multi-state protein, while the spatial dimension(s) describe topological relationships between neighboring subunits or members of a macromolecular complex. One drawback of this method for representing protein complexes, compared to Meredys, is that MCell does not allow for the diffusion of complexes, and hence, of multi-state molecules. This can in some cases be circumvented by adjusting the diffusion constants of ligands that interact with the complex, by using checkpointing functions or by combining simulations at different levels.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{assume that}} S and S are Riemann surfaces, {{and that the}} map π is complex analytic. [...] The map π {{is said to be}} {{ramified}} at a point P in S if there exist analytic coordinates near P and π(P) such that π takes the form π(z) = z'n, and n>1. [...] An equivalent way of thinking <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there exists a small neighborhood U of P such that π(P) has exactly one preimage in U, but the image of any other point in U has exactly n preimages in U. [...] The number n is called the ramification index at P and also denoted by e'P. [...] In calculating the Euler characteristic of S we notice the loss of eP1 copies of P above π(P) (that is, in the inverse image of π(P)). Now let us choose triangulations of S and S with vertices at the branch and ramification points, respectively, and use these to compute the Euler characteristics. Then S will have the same number of d-dimensional faces for d different from zero, but fewer than expected vertices. Therefore we find a [...] "corrected" [...] formula ...|$|E

In January 2017, HIM were also announced as the headliner of Miljoona Rock, held in Tuuri, Finland, on 18 July 2017. On 5 March 2017, HIM announced the band would be disbanding following a farewell tour that same year. In the announcement, Valo stated: [...] "After quarter of a century [...] of love and metal intertwined we sincerely feel HIM has run its unnatural course and adieus must be said in order to make way for sights, scents and sounds yet unexplored. We completed the pattern, solved the puzzle and turned the key. Thank you." [...] Valo further elaborated on the band's decision to call it quits later, stating: [...] "We got together and started playing some songs and thinking whats next [...] We felt like the new material wasn't taking flight. We got along well together, but something was lacking. The stars weren't in alignment." [...] He also went on to say that: [...] "We felt like {{there was nothing left to}} give collectively. It was fun playing the old songs, everybody got along well together, but that spark was missing." [...] Valo didn't rule-out the possibility of the band reuniting in the future, stating: [...] "The good thing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there's no drama [...] So it doesn't hurt the chances." ...|$|E

50|$|Another theory <b>about</b> <b>this</b> section <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it talks}} about John Petrucci's music career, first admiring his idols but not wanting to become a {{complete}} rip off, and eventually changing his mind and realizing what he wanted all along, to write progressive rock.|$|R

50|$|Advertising {{does not}} {{represent}} men and women the same way. Men are frequently presented as the central figure in the ads, and women are just accompanying them. Men are usually portrayed with more authority and proficiency than women. The results of research <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> in advertising over 85% of voiceovers were men. In advertising, usually the man acts and the woman appears. For example: On television commercials of condoms, when {{a man and woman}} are together, the woman usually just laughs and stays quietly beside the man, while he talks and acts as the central figure. In other ads of condoms when the women talk, they are only talking about how great the guy was, and how happy they feel after being with him. In advertising, men and women don't receive the same value.|$|R
