40|$|A parallelized system, <b>ASSURE,</b> for {{computing}} {{the reliability}} of embedded avionics flight control systems which are able to reconfigure themselves {{in the event of}} failure is described. <b>ASSURE</b> accepts a grammar that describes a reliability semi-Markov state-space. From this it creates a parallel program that simultaneously generates and analyzes the state-space, placing upper and lower bounds on the probability of system failure. <b>ASSURE</b> is implemented on a 32 -node Intel iPSC/ 860, and has achieved high processor efficiencies on real problems. Through a combination of improved algorithms, exploitation of parallelism, and use of an advanced microprocessor architecture, <b>ASSURE</b> has reduced the execution time on substantial problems by a factor of one thousand over previous workstation implementations. Furthermore, <b>ASSURE's</b> parallel execution rate on the iPSC/ 860 is an order of magnitude faster than its serial execution rate on a Cray- 2 supercomputer. While dynamic load balancing is necessary for <b>ASSURE's</b> good performance, it is needed only infrequently; the particular method of load balancing used does not substantially affect performance...|$|R
