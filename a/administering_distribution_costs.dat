40|$|Part Two of the Germany in Global Economic Governance SeriesFinancial crises {{underline}} {{the necessity for}} more effective governance of global markets. While the New Basel II Accord showed the possibility of multilaterally creating better governance, no agreement has been reached on the reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Why do governments agree on a reform of global financial governance in some cases, but not in others? I argue that convergence and divergence of governmental positions towards new governance cannot be explained solely by {{the logic of the}} international system nor by globalization, but instead strongly reflect domestic ideas and interests. In addition, I argue that variation in success in achieving new governance is shaped by the different impact of ideas versus interests on the ability of governments to compromise internationally. But when do ideas prevail over interests and vice versa? In this regard, I argue that ideas prevail when new governance initiatives affect lobby groups only diffusely and concern fundamental questions on the role of politics in governing the economy. Interests prevail when specific lobby groups are affected directly and when new governance initiatives try to <b>administer</b> the <b>distribution</b> of <b>costs</b> and gains sectorally. The arguments are tested in case studies on the preference formation of the U. S. and German governments on the reform of the IMF and on Basel II in 2001 - 2007...|$|R

In order to achieve that objective, the company should be able to market product it produces maximally. Distribution activity is a part of marketing activity.

The objectives of research are to find out the distribution activity the company undertakes, the <b>distribution</b> <b>cost</b> determination, <b>distribution</b> <b>cost</b> change, as well as to find out the extent to which the <b>distribution</b> <b>cost</b> affects the sale volume in 2005 - 2009 period.

40|$|Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (International Real Business Cycles, JPE, 100 (4), 1992) {{documented}} several {{discrepancies between}} the observed post-war business cycles of developed {{countries and the}} predictions of a two-country, complete-market model. The main discrepancy termed as the â€œquantity anomalyâ€ that cross-country consumption correlations are {{higher than that of}} output in the model as opposed to data, has remained a central puzzle in international economics. In order to resolve this puzzle mainly two strategies: restrictions on asset trade, and introducing non-traded goods in the model, have been employed by researchers. While these extensions have been successful in closing the gap to some extent, the ordering of correlations has stayed unchanged: consumption correlations still exceed that of output. This paper attempts to resolve the quantity puzzle by introducing non-traded <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> in the retailing of traded goods. In a standard two-good model traded output and traded consumption, by definition, are identical goods. With <b>distribution</b> <b>costs,</b> traded output and consumption are two distinct entities as each unit of final traded consumption good incorporates a unit of traded good and a fixed amount of non-traded goods. Thus, effectively, the model with <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> {{can be viewed as a}} model without <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> but with a modified utility function that has a substantially stronger complementarity between traded and non-traded goods. In a simple two-good extension of the Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland model, it is shown that the cross-country consumption and output correlations are 0. 55 and 0. 30, respectively, whereas with <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> consumption correlation reduces to 0. 09, output correlation to 0. 23. Incorporating <b>distribution</b> <b>costs,</b> in addition, improves the model’s performance in matching the volatility of real exchange rates and the correlation of net exports with output. These improvements are achieved without sacrificing the model's performance in any other dimension. open economy business cycles; quantity puzzle; <b>distribution</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R

This approach consists on the estimation {{of the impact of}} continuity of supply improvements on <b>distribution</b> network <b>costs.</b> For this purpose, <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> resulting from different continuity of supply requirements are computed by a Reference Network Model (RNM). The results obtained from the RNM are used to estimate a cost-function that considers continuity of supply a <b>cost</b> driver for <b>distribution</b> <b>costs.</b> This methodology is applied to three Spanish areas of service (an urban one, a semi-urban one and a rural one) {{in such a way that}} differences in <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> caused by the characteristics of the area type can be taken into account. The analysis indicated that <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> are more sensitive to continuity of supply improvements in rural areas of service.

40|$|Economies {{of scale}} in {{infrastructure}} are a recognised factor in urban agglomeration. Less recognised {{is the effect}} of <b>distribution</b> or access <b>costs.</b> Infrastructure can be classified as: (a) Area-type (e. g. utilities); or (b) Point-type (e. g. hospitals). The former involves <b>distribution</b> <b>costs,</b> the latter access costs. Taking water supply as an example of Area-type infrastructure, the interaction between production <b>costs</b> and <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> at settlement level is investigated using data from England & Wales and the USA. Plant level economies of scale in water production are confirmed, and quantified. Water <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> are analysed using a new measure of water distribution output (which combines volume and distance), and modelling distribution areas as monocentric settlements. Unit <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> are shown to be characterised by scale economies with respect to volume but diseconomies with respect to average distance to properties. It follows that higher settlement densities reduce unit <b>distribution</b> <b>costs,</b> while lower densities raise them. The interaction with production costs then means that (a) higher urban density (“Densification”) is characterised by economies of scale in both production and distribution; (b) more spread out settlement (“Dispersion”) leads to diseconomies in distribution; (c) “Suburbanisation” (expansion into lower density peripheral areas) lies in between, with roughly constant returns to scale, taking production and distribution together; and (d) “Constant density” expansion leads to small economies of scale. Keeping (per capita) water supply costs low thus appears to depend as much on density as size. Tentative generalisation suggests similar effects with other Area-type infrastructure (sewerage, electricity supply, telecommunications); and with Point-type infrastructure (such as hospitals), viewing access <b>costs</b> as <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> in reverse. It follows that the presumption in urban economics that such services are always characterised by economies of scale and therefore conducive to agglomeration may not be correct...|$|R
