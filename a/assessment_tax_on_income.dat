40|$|In {{this study}} we make an {{analysis}} of the major aspects concerning the budgets of the EU countries. On this paper we focus <b>on</b> the main <b>taxes</b> of the 27 EU countries. Our analysis concerns the direct taxes and indirect taxes. Direct taxes have the following structure: current <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> capital. Current <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> are made up of: <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and other current <b>taxes.</b> <b>Taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> consist of <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> personal <b>income</b> and the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the revenue or profit of companies. Indirect taxes consist of: <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production and imports, which in turn are composed of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production and other <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production. The <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production consist of: Value Added <b>Tax,</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> imports excluding VAT and <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production excluding VAT and duties. Analysis of main trends of taxation in the European Union countries will be achieved by calculating several indicators, namely: fixed-base indices, chain-based indices, minimum, maximum, average, percentages and percentages of total GDP. </p...|$|R
