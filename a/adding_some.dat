Between August and September 2004, the plan {{was the subject of}} a public survey, organised by the prefect in the 24 communes of the island.

5|$|East Midwood was {{organized}} in 1924 by Jacob R. Schwartz, a dentist who {{was concerned that}} his two sons had no nearby Hebrew school which they could attend. From the start his intention had been to create a Conservative synagogue: Conservative Judaism {{was seen as a}} compromise between Orthodox and Reform, providing the familiar (and lengthy) Hebrew services of Orthodox Judaism, but, like Reform, <b>adding</b> <b>some</b> English prayers. East Midwood differed from earlier Ashkenazi synagogues in New York, as services were to be conducted in Hebrew and English only (not Hebrew and Yiddish), and the members were to come from immigrants from all over Europe, not just one city or region.|$|E
5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or <b>adding</b> <b>some</b> MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E

25|$|Bartlett's {{district}} was significantly altered in redistricting plans released in October 2011, which {{was described as}} gerrymandering.

25|$|The first {{typology}} for Anglo-Saxon glass vessels was {{devised by}} Dr. Donald B. Harden in 1956, which was later revised in 1978.

25|$|Jan-Willem Maessen, in 2002, and Simon Peyton Jones, in 2003, {{discussed}} {{problems associated}} with lazy evaluation while also acknowledging the theoretical motives for it, in addition to purely practical considerations such as improved performance. They note that, in addition to <b>adding</b> <b>some</b> performance overhead, lazy evaluation {{makes it more difficult}} for programmers to reason about the performance of their code (particularly its space use).|$|E
25|$|Hovercraft {{teamed up}} with Stereolab guitarist/backing vocalist Mary Hansen, forming the band Schema. Schema {{featured}} vocals and instrumentals in approximately equal measure, <b>adding</b> <b>some</b> synthesizer. An eponymous maxi-EP/mini-album was released in 2000 on avant-garde Kill Rock Stars imprint, 5 Rue Christine. A second album and a tour was planned.

25|$|There is however a {{disconnection}} {{between these}} laws and everyday life experiences, {{as we do}} not find it necessary (nor even theoretically possible) to know exactly at a microscopic level the simultaneous positions and velocities of each molecule while carrying out processes at the human scale (for example, when performing a chemical reaction). Statistical mechanics fills this disconnection between the laws of mechanics and the practical experience of incomplete knowledge, by <b>adding</b> <b>some</b> uncertainty about which state the system is in.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{standardize}} and {{make it easier to}} process passports, several countries have implemented RFID in passports, despite security and privacy issues. The encryption on UK chips was broken in under 48 hours. Since that incident, further efforts have allowed researchers to clone passport data while the passport is being mailed to its owner. Where a criminal used to need to secretly open and then reseal the envelope, now it can be done without detection, <b>adding</b> <b>some</b> degree of insecurity to the passport system.|$|E
25|$|Initially, CEP was {{constituted}} as {{a single}} reinforced infantry division, organized according to the Portuguese model, in which divisions were {{much larger than the}} British ones. Subsequently, it was decided to reorganize the CEP according to the British model, allowing it to become an army corps of two divisions and corps support troops, just by <b>adding</b> <b>some</b> additional battalions. This new organization would allow it to have sufficient autonomy {{to be able to take}} the responsibility for an entire independent sector of the Western Front.|$|E
