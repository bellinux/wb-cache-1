5|$|Graham visits Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) and {{describes}} his visions, to which Henry replies {{that he must}} be the queen's Huntsman. The Huntsman was hired by the Evil Queen to remove Snow White's heart and bring it back to her, but when he does not do so, she removes his heart. Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not feel anything with Regina because he does not have a heart. Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham's visions, <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham saw in his visions and in Henry's book. Looking for his heart, Graham fervently searches the vault, which {{turns out to be the}} tomb of Henry Mills. Regina arrives to place flowers on her father's grave and is furious to find them there.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, {{the state}} highway system was {{adjusted}} again, and several new roads {{were added to}} the system, including parts of what would become US410. The Olympic Highway traveled around the Olympic Peninsula and a section from Aberdeen to Olympia was later used as part of US410. The Pacific Highway would later have a brief concurrency with US410 from Olympia to Tacoma, and US410 would later connect to the National Park Highway in Tacoma <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> to Buckley, where State Road5, now a secondary highway maintained by the counties, began. From the end of State Road5 in Naches, the Inland Empire Highway is concurrent with the future US410 to Dayton, where a branch of the highway travels to Clarkston. State Road5 became the McClellan Pass Highway in 1919 and was aligned further south to Chinook Pass. The McClellan Pass Highway was renamed the Naches Pass Highway in 1921 to reflect the realignment in 1919. Despite the name, the road did not cross Naches Pass, as no highway ever has.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet in length, {{was released}} on June 14, 1910. Theater advertisements for the film were found in newspapers in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio. The film was alternatively known and advertised as Taming a Woman Hater. One theater in Pennsylvania would advertise Thanhouser's Jane Eyre as a magnificent and costly production <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> up with The Woman Hater with the generic advertisement promotion {{that it was a}} great film. It is unknown if published trade reviews for this work exist, but there is an absence of a citation Bowers. Given this absence, it is possible that additional details or commentary can be obtained from advertisements or local newspapers outside of typical trade publications. The film was labeled a comedy in an advertisement, using the name Taming a Woman Hater in The New York Dramatic Mirror on June 18, 1910.|$|E

5|$|US11 and NY41 follow Port Watson Street into {{downtown}} Cortland, {{where they}} meet NY13 at Church Street. All three routes turn north here, following Church Street for three blocks to Groton Avenue. Here, NY13 turns east to follow Groton Avenue (which becomes Clinton Road) {{out of the}} city while US11 and NY41 turns west onto Groton, joining NY222, which begins at the junction of Groton Avenue and Church Street. Here, maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the city of Cortland. The overlap between NY41 and NY222 ends two blocks later when US11 and NY41 turn north onto Main Street. The two routes remain on Main Street up to Homer Avenue, at which point the two routes veer onto Homer Avenue <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> {{out of the city}}, at which point maintenance of NY41 becomes the responsibility of NYSDOT once more.|$|E

25|$|In 1865, Whymper, {{weary of}} the defeats he had {{sustained}} on the south-west ridge, tried a new way. The stratification of the rocks on the east face seemed to him favourable, and the slope not excessive. His plan of attack was complicated: a huge rock couloir, the base of which lies on the Italian side below the Breuiljoch, on the little Matterhorn glacier, would be ascended to a point {{high up on the}} Furggen ridge; from there, traversing the east face of the mountain, he meant to reach the Hörnli (north-east) ridge <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> to the summit. However, when this route was attempted, the mountain discharged an avalanche of stone upon the climbers, and the ascent failed. His guides refused to make any further attempts by this route.|$|E

25|$|A {{few months}} later another plane landed in Mexico after its crew {{followed}} the wrong railroad tracks. Patrolling on Monday, 2 February 1920, 1st Lts. Leroy M. Wolfe and George L. Usher intended {{to pick up the}} El Paso and Southwestern Railroad west of Douglas, Arizona, <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> to Nogales. Visibility was poor and the compass did not work properly. Sighting a railroad, Wolfe and Usher followed it for some time until it ended. Lost and having engine trouble, they landed and were taken into custody by Mexican officials. The tracks they had steered by ran due south instead of west, and had led them to Nacozari, Sonora, seventy-five or eighty miles below the border. Though treated well, Wolfe and Usher were not set free until 2 February. They waited three more days for release of their airplane, shipping it to Douglas by train.|$|E
500|$|Racers exit Dawson City on the Yukon River <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> {{for about}} [...] to the Fortymile River {{hospitality}} stop. The river's {{name comes from}} its distance from Fort Reliance, an abandoned trading post established in 1874. From the hospitality stop, mushers travel southwest on the Fortymile River in what {{is one of the}} coldest portions of the race, because of cold air sinking {{to the bottom of the}} river valley. The trail on the river crosses the Alaska–Canada border, noticeable only because of the border vista, a strip of land cleared of all foliage. Shortly past the border, the river turns northwest, and mushers leave its frozen surface when it meets the Taylor Highway, a road closed to automobile traffic during the winter. As the trail follows the highway for [...] conditions are often hazardous, with high winds and drifting snow that can obscure trail markers. After climbing the 3,420-foot (1,042m) American Summit, the trail gradually descends [...] to Eagle, on the banks of the Yukon River.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{commercial}} breaks, a brief {{image of a}} glyph is shown. Abrams revealed {{in an interview that}} the glyphs had a hidden meaning. [...] "It's something that we're doing for people who care to figure it out <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it,</b> but it's not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch the show." [...] Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi (Φ) imprinted on their back appeared in promos for the show have significance {{within the context of the}} series, saying [...] "it's part of the code of the show." [...] The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica, who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode; for example, the pilot episode's eight glyphs spell out the word [...] "observer". Whether there is a further second-order code to be solved remains to be seen. Additionally, the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case (such as the moth/butterfly from [...] "Johari Window", the seahorse strain of DNA from [...] "The Bishop Revival"). In [...] "Jacksonville", behind Walter as he speaks to Olivia about her treatment where the nootropic Cortexiphan was first studied as a trial, each of the glyphs is clearly visible on the daycare wall. An episode-by-episode key to the various glyphs was made available on Fringepedia.|$|E

At times, Inuit were known {{for using a}} more passive approach when hunting whales. According to John Bennett and Susan Rowley, a hunter would harpoon the whale and instead of pursuing it, would [...] "wait patiently for the winds, currents, and spirits to aid him in bringing the whale to shore." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guide line: A {{continuous}} {{guide line}} is maintained {{at all times}} between {{the leader of a}} dive team and a fixed point selected outside the cave entrance in open water. Often this line is tied off a second time as a backup directly inside the cavern zone. As the dive leader lays the guideline he takes great care to ensure there is appropriate tension on the line. and that it does not go into line traps. Other team members remain between the lead diver and the exit, in easy reach of the line at all times. If a silt out occurs, divers can find the line <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> back to the cave entrance. Failure to use a continuous guide line to open water is cited as the most frequent cause of fatality among untrained, non-certified divers who venture into caves.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{editions of}} a book as popular and {{enduring}} as J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit inevitably attract the attention and money of both book collectors and fans. Because a publisher cannot predict accurately how the public will receive a new author, they usually print a small first run <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> with reprints as needed. Often this first run is called a [...] "first edition". Technically, however, the first edition spans not only the first printing but all printings until the type is reset. In the collectibles market, normally {{it is the first}} printing that commands the bulk of attention and money. That is because it was printed in small quantity and under risk of failure in the market. The people who bought the first copies pioneered the book's popularity, and those copies are considered precious. While {{the same is true of}} The Hobbit, the curious history of the book complicates and broadens the market considerably.|$|E
2500|$|The show's pilot {{episode is}} told almost entirely in retroversions to three {{different}} time frames. According to Nick Wauters, the show's creator, later episodes would use flashbacks more {{to develop the}} characters. [...] "There will be big reveals and big clues in each episode," [...] he said, promising that viewers {{would not have to}} wait too long for answers to questions raised. After the pilot aired, he and executive producer Steve Stark answered some viewer questions on their Twitter feeds, one being the fate of the plane used in the assassination attempt, which ended up disappearing through a portal before it could crash. The characters also have Twitter feeds, and one had a blog, truthseeker5314.com, which would reveal additional information. The last two episodes before and all episodes following the show's hiatus no longer featured flashbacks. Cast member Blair Underwood said regarding the removal of the flashbacks, [...] "We had been jumping around a lot and doing flashbacks and that was confusing to people," [...] and [...] "So when we come back, that device is done with! We are now telling the story straight through so people can track it <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> easier." ...|$|E

2500|$|Next to the {{passages}} of Scripture recited in cantillation, {{the most ancient}} and still the most important section of the Jewish liturgy is the sequence of benedictions which {{is known as the}} Amidah ("standing prayer"), being the section which in the ritual of the Dispersion more immediately takes the place of the sacrifice offered in the ritual of the Temple on the corresponding occasion. It accordingly attracts the intonation of {{the passages}} which precede <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> into its own musical rendering. Like the lessons, it, too, is cantillated. This free intonation is not, as with the Scriptural texts, designated by any system of accents, but consists of a melodious development of certain themes or motives traditionally associated with the individual service, and therefore termed by the present writer [...] "prayer-motives." [...] These are each differentiated from other prayer-motives much as are the respective forms of the cantillation, the divergence being especially marked in the tonality due to the modal feeling alluded to above. Tonality depends on that particular position of the semitones or smaller intervals between two successive degrees of the scale which causes the difference in color familiar to modern ears in the contrast between major and minor melodies.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the game's 18-month {{development}} time {{was focused on}} the game's controls and making sure they worked, as Mustard believed that without controls that [...] "feel sweet," [...] the game would have been poorly received. This included the incorporation of weapon aiming through the right thumbstick and other tactical elements such as firing from cover from games such as Gears of War. With the game being published by Microsoft Studios, the development team had access to the Microsoft play testers, who helped to identify other problem areas with their original level design. This also {{led to the development of}} the option to show a blue line on the game's map that would show the player where to go next. Mustard realized there was both a benefit and downside to this feature, as it would help guide players that were stuck, but at the same time, players could become too dependent on the line <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> exactly, giving them no challenge in exploring the game's world. To counter this, they had the line show the general path that needed to be taken but included parts of their world where the player would be forced to deviate from the suggested path in order to work around an obstacle or collect a required power-up.|$|E
2500|$|The {{description}} of the beast is found primarily in Revelation chapters thirteen and seventeen. Chapter thirteen gives the fullest description. John saw it [...] "rise {{up out of the}} sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy." [...] (...) It was like a leopard, with feet like the feet of a bear, and had a mouth like a lion. One of its heads had a mortal wound which healed itself, causing people to wonder at it <b>and</b> <b>follow</b> <b>it.</b> (...) This description draws many parallels with a vision in the Book of Daniel where four beasts symbolizing a succession of kingdoms come out of the sea in the forms of a lion, bear, leopard and a beast with ten horns. In Revelation chapter seventeen we learn of a third beast, scarlet in color and some of the symbols are explained. The prevailing view is that the scarlet beast is another, distinct, visualisation of the same subject as the beast of the sea, which is pictured with crowns on its horns, unlike the scarlet beast. The scarlet beast is shown being ridden by a harlot who [...] "reigns over the kings of the earth", (...) whereas the beast of the sea is not described as being ridden, and is given [...] "power and great authority." [...] The seven heads represent both seven mountains and seven kings, and the ten horns are ten kings who have not yet received kingdoms. Of the seven kings, five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come. The beast itself is an eighth king who is of the seven and was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition." ...|$|E
