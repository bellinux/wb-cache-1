500|$|Astronaut Shannon Lucid, who set {{the record}} for longest stay in space by a woman while aboard Mir (surpassed by Sunita Williams 11 years later on the ISS), also commented about working aboard Mir saying [...] "I think {{going to work on}} a daily basis on Mir is very similar to going to work on a daily basis on an {{outstation}} in Antarctica. The big difference with going to work here is the isolation, because you really are isolated. You don't have a lot of support from the ground. You really <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own." ...|$|E
500|$|Warren {{spoke at}} the 2012 Democratic National Convention {{immediately}} before Bill Clinton on the penultimate night of the convention. Warren contrasted President Obama's economic plan with Mitt Romney's in the 2012 election and rebuked the Republican Party's economic policy stating: [...] "Their vision is clear: 'I've got mine, {{and the rest of}} you <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own.'" [...] Warren positioned herself as a champion of a beleaguered middle class that, as she said, [...] "has been chipped, squeezed and hammered." [...] Brown attended the 2012 Republican National Convention, but was not a speaker there. According to Brown, he had rejected an offer to play a larger role, and limited his attendance to a single day because of scheduling demands.|$|E
500|$|If we {{stick to}} the Faust story – if I had been in that story – and I had sold my soul [...] for fame and fortune, and had the arrogance of [...] to not want {{to pay back the}} deal, it's taken a few years for me to {{acknowledge}} to myself that I was hearing: 'Manson , the hell hounds <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> trail.' And this record is my payment. This is me giving back what I was given, or took. [...] If you believe in some mythology, and you want to live by those rules, then I had to say myself: 'I'm not really doing what I set out to do,' even though I tried to convince myself that I was. I'm not regretting the last few records that I've made, but since Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), I've not made something with [...] sheer utter fearlessness and anger and force.|$|E

2500|$|Nurse {{was born}} on 10 November 1933 in Saint Michael, Barbados. From a humble background, Nurse {{was the son of}} a {{carpenter}} and the youngest of a family of two boys and two girls. His older brother Sinclair showed an early aptitude for cricket as a leg-spin bowler but did not carry on with the game. The younger Nurse went to school at St Stephen's Boys School where he excelled in both football and cricket. A severe leg injury brought an end to Nurse's football career along with advice from his father to [...] "stay in cricket and quit football, otherwise you <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own. Football in Barbados is too rough." [...] Keen to start working for a living Nurse left school aged 16, a decision he would later regret.|$|E
2500|$|According to Maluțan, it was 12:08 {{when they}} left for Snagov. After they arrived there, Ceaușescu took Maluțan into the presidential suite and ordered him to get two {{helicopters}} filled with soldiers for an armed guard, and a further Dauphin to come to Snagov. Maluțan's unit commander replied on the phone, [...] "There has been a revolution [...] [...] [...] You <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own [...] [...] [...] Good luck!". Maluțan then said to Ceaușescu that the second motor was now warmed up and they needed to leave soon but he could only take four people, not six. Mănescu and Bobu stayed behind. Ceaușescu ordered Maluțan to head for Titu. Near Titu, Maluțan says that he made the helicopter dip up and down. He lied to Ceaușescu, saying that this was to avoid anti-aircraft fire, since they would now be in range. Ceaușescu panicked {{and told him to}} land.|$|E
2500|$|Beckett's prose pieces {{during the}} late period were not so {{prolific}} as his theatre, {{as suggested by the}} title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts Fizzles (which the American artist Jasper Johns illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella Company (1980), which continued with Ill Seen Ill Said (1982) and Worstward Ho (1984), later collected in Nohow On. In these three [...] "'closed space' stories," [...] Beckett continued his preoccupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, {{as well as with the}} positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of Company make clear: [...] "A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine." [...] "To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said." [...] Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including Company and Rockaby.|$|E
