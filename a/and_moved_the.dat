5|$|Even as Metro officially {{designated}} Rosecroft Raceway as the Green Line's southern terminus, {{more than}} half of Prince George's County's representatives in the Maryland state legislature asked Governor Harry Hughes to review the proposed route after allegations of improper political pressure regarding the 1978 route decision surfaced.

5|$|Following a 3017 {{victory at}} Pittsburgh, Virginia Tech {{traveled}} to Morgantown, West Virginia, {{to face the}} West Virginia Mountaineers in the annual battle for the Black Diamond Trophy. In West Virginia, Virginia Tech eked out a 2220 victory with a last-second field goal from placekicker Shayne Graham.

This was in the western backwoods area.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Captain Dixon {{lost all}} of his {{property}} <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> family to Henderson, Kentucky. Archibald Dixon was educated by his mother and attended the common schools of Henderson. In 1822, he began to study law {{in the office of}} James Hillyer. He was admitted to the bar in 1824, and commenced practice in Henderson. He became well known as a skilled defense attorney and was employed in a number of cases in Kentucky and Indiana.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, American {{soldiers}} established Camp Warner, {{a military}} camp near present-day Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge in Lake County. They were sent from Boise, Idaho, {{to build a}} military camp in the high desert, and built it east of the Warner Lakes, because they doubted that they could cross the series of wetlands. Maj. Gen. George Crook disapproved of the soldiers' decision. He built a road across the lakes <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> camp to {{the western side of}} them.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{became the}} {{administrative}} centre for the earldom {{and was used}} by Robert's court. There was already an existing market held at nearby St Stephen's church by the local canons, but Robert appropriated it <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> market to outside his new castle, intending {{to profit from the}} trade. A watermill was built to the south-west of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the day {{large numbers}} of fans, both English and Turkish, were seen {{throughout}} the city and at the airport. Later, {{large numbers of}} Galatasaray fans congregated in Copenhagen's City Hall Square, raising the Turkish flag in the square. Arsenal fans congregated in nearby bars. Galatasaray fans attempted to provoke the Arsenal fans in the bars, and the two sides began chanting at each other until bottles were thrown from both sides around 16:00. The Danish police then moved in to separate the fans, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> Galatasaray fans back towards the square.|$|E

5|$|Armed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish {{to break through the}} pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their Mesoamerican allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cost-saving}} move, {{effective on}} July 1, 1934, the Georgia Board of Regents transferred {{control of the}} relatively large Evening School of Commerce to the University of Georgia <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> small civil engineering program at UGA to Tech. The move was controversial, and both students and faculty protested against it, fearing that the Board of Regents would remove other programs from Georgia Tech and reduce it to an engineering department of the University of Georgia. Brittain suggested {{that the lack of}} Georgia Tech alumni on the Board of Regents contributed to their decision. Despite the pressure, the Board of Regents held its ground. The Depression also {{had a significant impact on}} the athletic program, as most athletes were in the commerce school, and resulted in the elimination of athletic scholarships, which were replaced by a loan program. Plans for an industrial management department to replace and supersede the Evening School of Commerce were first made in fall 1934. The department was established in 1935, and evolved into Tech's College of Management.|$|E
5|$|Australia had {{previously}} won {{medals in the}} event, but was not {{regarded as one of}} the favourites for the gold, as the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden all fielded more decorated swimmers over the component legs of the relay. After the backstroke leg, Australia was in fourth place and more than a second in arrears of the Soviet leaders. However, Evans was the fastest among the breaststrokers <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> team into second position at the halfway point in the race; and Tonelli, a makeshift butterflyer, completed his leg in a time much faster than his previous best, allowing Australia to keep the Soviet lead reasonable. Australia's anchor swimmer Brooks overtook his more credentialled Soviet counterpart Sergey Koplyakov in the latter half of the final leg to secure a narrow victory. The quartet disbanded after the Olympics due to Tonelli's retirement, although some of the members continued to be present in the relay team at various times alongside new swimmers. By 1986, all four members of the 1980 team had retired from international competition.|$|E

5|$|Both Boycott and McGregor Blacker were {{involved}} in a protracted dispute with Mr Carr, the agent for the Achill Church Mission Estate, from whom McGregor Blacker leased the lands, and Mr O'Donnell, Carr's bailiff. The dispute began when Boycott and Carr supported different sets of candidates in elections for the Board of Guardians to the Church Mission Estate, and Boycott's candidates won. Carr was also the local receiver of wrecks, which meant that he was entitled to collect the salvage from all shipwrecks in the area, and guard it until it was sold in a public auction. The local receiver had a right to a percentage of the sale and to keep whatever did not sell. In 1860 Carr {{wrote a letter to the}} Official Receiver of Wrecks stating that Boycott and his men had illegally broken up a wreck <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> salvage to Boycott's property. In response to this accusation, Boycott sued Carr for libel and claimed £500 in damages.|$|E
5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} by Danish naturalist Erik Pontoppidan in 1763, the red-throated loon is a monotypic species, with no distinctive subspecies despite its large Holarctic range. Pontoppidan initially placed the {{species in the}} now-defunct genus Colymbus, which contained grebes as well as loons. By 1788, German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster realized that grebes and loons were different enough to warrant separate genera, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>the</b> red-throated loon (along with all other loon species) to its present genus. Its relationship to the four other loons is complex; although all {{belong to the same}} genus, it differs more than any of the others in terms of morphology, behaviour, ecology and breeding biology, and may be the basal lineage of the genus. It is thought to have evolved in the Palearctic, and then to have expanded into the Nearctic. Analysis of molecular data together with the fossil record suggests the lineage of the red-throated loon diverged from that giving rise to the other loon species around 21.4 million years ago in the Miocene. It is also most closely related to the fossil Pliocene species Gavia howardae.|$|E
