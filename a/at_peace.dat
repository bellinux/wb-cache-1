5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are <b>at</b> <b>peace,</b> as compared with four out of eight US cases <b>at</b> <b>peace.</b> Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E

Some credited luck and others skill in his rapid promotions, and Brock had substantial portions of both {{on his way to}} prominence. Lacking special political connections, Brock's ability to gain promotions even when the nation was <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> attests to his skills in recruiting men and organizing finances, and ambition.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s England was <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> and Pendennis was neglected; {{reportedly}} the garrison's pay {{was two years}} in arrears, forcing them to gather limpets from the shoreline for food. Nonetheless, a new Italian-styled gatehouse {{was added to the}} castle, probably in 1611. War with Spain broke out again 1624 and a new defensive line, with bastions and artillery, was built across the peninsula in 1627.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with France and Spain and the coastal forts, {{included}} Portland, received little attention.

Fourteen years later, the castle had 15 guns and a garrison of a captain and 12 men.|$|E

The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed {{the city and}} divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily <b>at</b> <b>peace.</b> Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving Antipater as regent.|$|E

5|$|Europe {{had been}} in turmoil {{since the start of}} the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792. In 1797, after five years of war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition, an {{alliance}} of Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, Spain, and various Italian states. A Second Coalition, led by Britain, Austria and Russia, and including the Ottoman Empire, Portugal and Naples, was formed in 1798, but by 1801, this too had been defeated, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was <b>at</b> <b>peace.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1648, the Peace of Westphalia {{had ended}} the Thirty Years' War, {{during which the}} Swedish Empire emerged as a major European power. In the Torstenson War, a theater of the Thirty Years' War, Sweden had {{defeated}} the former Baltic great power Denmark. Sweden had been <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with Russia since the Treaty of Stolbovo had ended the Ingrian War in 1617. Sweden had remained {{in a state of}} war with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth since the Polish–Swedish War (1626–29), which was concluded by the repeatedly renewed truce (Altmark, Stuhmsdorf).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with France and Spain and coastal defences {{received}} little attention. During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Calshot {{was held by}} Parliamentary forces against King Charles I, and protected with a 15-strong garrison at an annual cost of £107. Parliament considered the fortress important and kept it supplied with ammunition; unlike several other local forts, Parliament kept the castle operational, probably because of its ongoing role in defending Southampton Water. During the early 18th-century War of Spanish Succession it was equipped with up to 25 guns.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with France and Spain, and the country's coastal defences {{received}} little attention. The Gorges family continued as captains at Hurst, with Sir Edward Gorges {{taking up the}} post in 1610, but the castle was neglected. In 1628, the castle was unable to prevent Flemish ships from passing along the Solent, as only {{four or five of}} the castle's twenty-seven guns were functional, and the fort had no ammunition or powder for them. The government replaced all the brass ordnance in the castle, which were preferred, particularly on ships, as they could fire faster and more safely, with iron guns in 1635.|$|E
5|$|Louis Braille {{survived the}} torment of the {{infection}} {{but by the}} age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why it was always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.|$|E

5|$|The Jurchens were a Tungusic-speaking {{group of}} semi-agrarian tribes inhabiting areas of {{northeast}} Asia {{that are now}} part of Northeast China. Many of the Jurchen tribes were vassals of the Liao dynasty (907–1125), an empire ruled by the nomadic Khitans that included most of modern Mongolia, a portion of North China, Northeast China, northern Korea, and parts of the Russian Far East. To the south of the Liao lay the Han Chinese Song Empire (960–1276). The Song and Liao were <b>at</b> <b>peace,</b> but since a military defeat to the Liao in 1005, the Song paid its northern neighbor an annual indemnity of 200,000 bolts of silk and 100,000 ounces of silver.|$|E
5|$|When the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{reached the}} Platte in 1804, {{they found the}} Kitkehahkis (whom they mistakenly called Arapahos) living there. They {{were told that the}} band had {{returned}} to the Republican about ten years before (that is, before the conflict with the Omahas), but had recently moved to the Platte under pressure from the Kanzas. By 1806, however, the Kitkehahkis were <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with the Kanzas, and were once again living on the Republican.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decade}} of {{constant}} warfare, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end. Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories {{as well as for}} assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic. With Europe <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> and the economy recovering, Napoleon's popularity soared to its highest levels under the Consulate, both domestically and abroad. In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802, the French public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the Consulate permanent, essentially elevating Napoleon to dictator for life. Whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1.5 million people to the polls, the new referendum enticed 3.6 million to go and vote (72% of all eligible voters). There was no secret ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime; the constitution gained approval with over 99% of the vote. His broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution: Article 1. The French people name, and the Senate proclaims Napoleon-Bonaparte First Consul for Life. After 1802, he was generally referred to as Napoleon rather than Bonaparte.|$|E
