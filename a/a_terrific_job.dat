25|$|On 21 May 2009, Dragan Marić, {{a former}} {{businessman}} who was revolted over the court decision in his {{dispute with the}} national air carrier Jat Airways, entered the Presidency office carrying two hand grenades and seeking an out-of-court settlement signed by President or Government. Members of the Battalion of Military Police Cobras, providing security to the President of Serbia, managed {{to take one of}} the grenades immediately and isolate the attacker, however the perpetrator removed the pin from the second grenade and threatened to detonate it by releasing the lever. The negotiations were handled by the special team of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs, supported by the officials of the Ministry of Justice, and lasted for several hours until the man was disarmed and arrested. After the incident, Tadić, who was present in the secured area of the building, congratulated the police and army special units, the security and negotiation team for doing <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> <b>job,</b> peacefully and with no casualties and also said that problems, no matter what kind, cannot be resolved by force and by jeopardising citizens' lives.|$|E
500|$|Newsarama's Richard Gray gave Justice League #22 an 8 out of 10. Gray {{stated that}} [...] "Johns does <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> <b>job</b> of pulling {{together}} {{what has been}} essentially four or five separate stories, incorporating not only the three main titles that this will span over the coming months, but introducing several new players into the mix as well." [...] He also praised that the story advanced and showed similar promise that the reboot to the New 52 did in 2011. Joshua Yehl of IGN gave {{the first chapter of}} the Trinity War a 7.8 out of 10. He felt the issue {{set the stage for the}} event and praised the character work. However, he though that the conflict was not presented clearly yet and criticized the lack of the Justice League Dark in the first issue. Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, saying [...] "Johns manages to balance personality expositions with story breaks, giving readers a sense of who the opposing sides are, if nothing else. Johns brings lots of big moments to the pages, but the emotions he wrings from those moments really help sell this book." [...] Zawisza was surprised by the amount of time that was spent on Madame Xanadu, feeling as though it was only there for reason to include the Justice League Dark, and was wary that the characters are in danger of being absorbed by the plot. All three praised the art in the issue, especially Ivan Reis' pencils.|$|E
2500|$|Lennertz, who {{returned}} to score the One-Shot, and D'Esposito, the director, wanted a more traditional, orchestral score for Agent Carter, with D'Esposito wanting to balance the period setting and modern Marvel superhero feel. D'Esposito referenced Johnny Rivers' [...] "Secret Agent Man", [...] "even though {{it was in the}} 60's" [...] as inspiration. Lennertz felt D'Esposito [...] "did <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> <b>job</b> getting that [...] and reaching that" [...] while having [...] "a James Bond secret agent sentiment to it too." [...] To create the score, Lennertz [...] "put together a big band, combined it with an orchestra, and added modern electronic and dub-step elements", to represent the 40s setting, the Marvel feeling, and the advanced technology, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|An {{official}} remake, titled , {{was developed}} by Firaxis Games, led by MicroProse's co-founder Sid Meier. The game's prototype was actually a modernization of the original, with all the classic gameplay features, but then gradually evolved into a completely [...] "reimagined" [...] version. The game was released by 2K Games for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in October 2012, winning multiple Game of the Year awards. In a retrospective article in Eurogamer, Alec Meer compared both games with [...] "a sort of objectivity from me that hasn't been remotely possible {{over the last two}} decades of worshipping at its VGA shrine," [...] stating: [...] "I can see a game that can and will co-exist with rather than be supplanted by its remake. X-COM and XCOM are completely different games, both ingenious and both flawed in their own ways. I'd kill for a hybrid of the two, but having two rather than one sure is nothing to sniff at." [...] In a positive review of the remake, Dan Stapleton of GameSpy added: [...] "I leave the title of Best Game Ever with the original." [...] Julian Gollop himself commented that [...] "Firaxis did <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> <b>job</b> with the new XCOM," [...] although he [...] "would have done things differently for sure. (...) I tried many times for many years to get a remake underway, but Firaxis finally did it. Also, there is a promising and more faithful remake called Xenonauts." ...|$|E
