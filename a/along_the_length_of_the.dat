On one length side, a raised platform was also constructed, known as Koagari, where customers would sit while they examine the merchandise.|$|E

5|$|SMS Prinz Heinrich {{was built}} at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel. She was laid down in 1898 and {{completed}} in March 1902 {{at a cost of}} 16,588,000 Marks. Prinz Heinrichs design was a modification of Fürst Bismarck, and traded a smaller main battery for higher speed and more comprehensive armor protection. The ship set a precedent for subsequent German armored cruisers by concentrating her secondary armament amidships, as opposed to Fürst Bismarck, which spread the secondary armament <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{conditions}} {{surrounding the}} emplacement of the sulfur {{have caused the}} sulfur to assume various colours, including black, brown-orange, orange, red, yellow, and yellow-orange. These colours vary <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flows and between various flows, indicating that temperatures varied between one flow and another. Liquid sulfur has different viscosity and rheomorphic properties at different temperatures, and some variation occurred at Lastarria's flows as well.|$|E
5|$|The prehistoric {{breakup of}} the supercontinent Gondwana {{separated}} the Madagascar–Antarctica–India landmass from the Africa–South America landmass around 135million years ago. Madagascar later split from India about 88million years ago, allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. <b>Along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest.|$|E

The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates. Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to spoilage. Sinew will extend farther than wood, again allowing more energy storage.|$|E

5|$|A {{medical report}} {{documented}} that wearing an underwire bra in the Tropics, specifically East Africa, {{can lead to}} severe furuncular myiasis of the breast caused by the Tumbu fly. The eggs and larvae from this fly are deposited in clothing, especially <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metal wires of an underwire bra, and can only be killed by applying heat through ironing. It is almost impossible when ironing a traditional underwire bra to achieve the required heat to kill the larvae deposited along the underwire.|$|E
5|$|Cascade Locks and Canal {{were first}} {{constructed}} in 1896 around the Cascades Rapids, enabling boats to travel safely through the Columbia River Gorge. The Celilo Canal, bypassing Celilo Falls, opened to river traffic in 1915. In the mid-20thcentury, {{the construction of}} dams <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river submerged the rapids beneath a series of reservoirs. An extensive system of locks allowed ships and barges to pass easily from one reservoir to the next. A navigation channel reaching to Lewiston, Idaho, along the Columbia and Snake rivers, was completed in 1975. Among the main commodities are wheat and other grains, mainly for export. As of 2016, the Columbia ranked third, behind the Mississippi and Paraná rivers, among the world's largest export corridors for grain.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, after {{receiving}} {{approval from the}} government, the Parks Commission began to expropriate land <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. The broadened strip of land was used to construct a new paved parkway, which was opened in segments. The new parkway was ornamental and designed to be aesthetically pleasing, a prime consideration of road construction at that time. The section south of the falls was completed first, opening in 1912. It was extended north to the Whirlpool Rapids, incorporating the existing River Road, by 1915. The section between the rapids and Queenston was opened between 1921 and 1923. Finally, the remaining section between Queenston and Niagara-on-the-Lake opened in 1931, completing the present parkway.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, President Lukashenko {{issued a}} decree {{granting}} a flag to the Armed Forces of Belarus. The flag, {{which has a}} ratio of 1:1.7, has the national ornamental pattern <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hoist side of the flag. On {{the front of the}} flag is the Belarusian coat of arms, with the wording УЗБРОЕНЫЯ СІЛЫ ("Armed Forces") arched over it, and РЭСПУБЛІКІ БЕЛАРУСЬ ("of Republic of Belarus") written below; the text of both is in gold. On the reverse of the flag, the center contains the symbol of the armed forces, which is a red star surrounded by a wreath of oak and laurel. Above the symbol is the phrase ЗА НАШУ РАДЗІМУ ("For our Motherland"), while below is the full name of the military unit.|$|E
5|$|In addition, a {{programme}} of modernising {{many of the}} Underground's busiest central London stations was started; {{providing them}} with escalators to replace lifts. New and refurbished rolling stock was gradually introduced {{on a number of}} lines with automatic sliding doors <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriages instead of manual end gates, reducing boarding times. By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded {{to such an extent that}} a large, new headquarters building designed by Charles Holden was constructed at 55 Broadway over St. James's Park station.|$|E
5|$|In the mandible, the {{diastema}} (gap) {{between the}} incisors and the cheekteeth (premolars and molars) is relatively deep. The mental foramen (an {{opening in the}} bone) is located relatively high and before the p4. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which are located on the outer side of the jaw and anchor some of the chewing muscles, meet at the m1.

5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the MTO {{undertook}} an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in the mid-1990s. Highway407 became a tolled highway {{and for a time}} it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway416 would also be tolled, but ultimately this never happened. Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a cost savings of over C$7 million and several of the unique design features located <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freeway.|$|E
5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that run <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door and over on top {{to form a}} lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run {{over the top of}} the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E
5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since {{the direction of the}} side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel {{in the direction of the}} side-slip, away from the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E
