5|$|American {{alligators}} modify wetland habitats, most {{dramatically in}} flat {{areas such as}} the Everglades, by constructing small ponds known as <b>alligator</b> holes. This behavior has qualified the American <b>alligator</b> to be considered a keystone species. <b>Alligator</b> holes retain water during the dry season and provide a refuge for aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms that survive the dry season by seeking refuge in <b>alligator</b> holes are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of <b>alligator</b> holes, as well as a buildup of soils during the excavation process, provide drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are intolerant of inundation to colonize. <b>Alligator</b> holes are an oasis during the Everglades dry season, so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, <b>alligator</b> holes tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a Miocene fossil alligator's skull {{was found}} at Marion County, Florida. Unlike the other extinct <b>alligator</b> species of in the same genus, the fossil skull was {{virtually}} indistinguishable {{from that of the}} modern American <b>alligator.</b> This <b>alligator</b> and the American <b>alligator</b> are now considered to be sister taxa, meaning that the <b>Alligator</b> mississippiensis lineage has existed in North America for over 8 million years.|$|E
5|$|The American <b>alligator</b> {{was first}} {{classified}} by French zoologist Fran√ßois Marie Daudin as Crocodilus mississipiensis in 1801. In 1807 Georges Cuvier created the genus Alligator; the American <b>alligator</b> shares this genus with the Chinese <b>alligator.</b> They are grouped {{in the family}} Alligatoridae with the caimans. The superfamily Alligatoroidea includes all crocodilians (fossil and extant) that are {{more closely related to}} the American <b>alligator</b> than to either the Nile crocodile or the gharial.|$|E
2500|$|Large male <b>alligators</b> are [...] {{territorial}} animals. Smaller <b>alligators</b> {{can often}} be found in large numbers close to each other. The largest of the species (both males and females) defend prime territory; smaller <b>alligators</b> have a higher tolerance for other <b>alligators</b> within a similar size class.|$|R

5|$|American <b>alligator</b> {{predation}} on Florida panthers is rare, but {{has been}} documented. Such incidents usually involve a panther trying to cross a waterway or coming down to a swamp or river to get a drink. The American <b>alligator</b> is the only known natural predator of the panther. American <b>alligator</b> predation on black bears has also been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{honored the}} American <b>alligator</b> in 1987, but the Gators have titled the University of Florida's teams since 1911. In that year, a printer made a spur-of-the-moment {{decision}} to print an <b>alligator</b> emblem on {{a shipment of}} the schools football pennants; the mascot stuck, perhaps because the team captain's nickname was Gator.|$|E
25|$|The {{two kinds}} of white <b>alligators</b> are albino and leucistic. These <b>alligators</b> are {{practically}} impossible {{to find in the}} wild. They could survive only in captivity and are few in number. The Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans has leucistic <b>alligators</b> found in a Louisiana swamp in 1987.|$|R
40|$|Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), a {{replacement}} for decabromodiphenyl ether (deca-BDE), was investigated in captive Chinese <b>alligators</b> from China. DBDPE was detected in adult tissues, neonates and eggs of Chinese <b>alligators</b> with concentrations ranging from 4. 74 - 192, 0. 24 - 1. 94, and 0. 01 - 0. 51 ng g(- 1) lipid weight, respectively. Compared to PBDEs and PCBs, DBDPE contamination was limited in Chinese <b>alligators.</b> Additionally, DBDPE concentrations in adult muscles were one to three orders of magnitude higher than those in neonates and eggs, suggesting the limited maternal transfer potential of DBDPE in Chinese <b>alligators.</b> This is the first study to report the occurrence of DBDPE in Chinese <b>alligators...</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Alligator's</b> Outpost: a boardwalk leads {{visitors}} to a swamp where dozens of American <b>alligators</b> live. Unlike most zoo exhibits, {{this one is}} a natural habitat where the challenge is to see how many eyes visitors can spy emerging from the waters.

5|$|Allen's {{force of}} 100 was outnumbered by the pirates and also outgunned, with <b>Alligator</b> {{mounting}} only 12 six-pounders, {{compared to the}} pirates' 14 cannon. Despite being outnumbered, <b>Alligator</b> and her crew were experienced veterans, having taken the Portuguese brig Marianna Flora the year before in a bloody action. Allen was also an experienced commander who had taken command of USS Argus during her engagement with HMS Pelican in the War of 1812. Though <b>Alligator</b> draft was too deep to chase pirate craft inshore, if need be, she could send her cutter, gig, and launch out with boarding parties to engage the pirates.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alligator</b> and {{crocodile}} farming began {{because of}} demand for their hides, but now nearly {{all parts of the}} animal are put to use. The side and belly skin make the best leather, the meat is eaten, the gall bladders are valued in East Asia, and the heads are sometimes made into ornaments. In traditional Chinese medicine, <b>alligator</b> meat is said to cure the common cold and prevent cancer, while various internal organs are believed to have medicinal properties.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American <b>alligator</b> bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American <b>alligator</b> bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alligators</b> are {{generally}} timid towards humans {{and tend to}} walk or swim away if one approaches. This has led some people {{to the practice of}} approaching <b>alligators</b> and their nests in a manner that may provoke the animals into attacking. In Florida, feeding wild <b>alligators</b> at any time is illegal. If fed, the <b>alligators</b> will eventually lose their fear of humans and will learn to associate humans with food, thereby becoming both a greater danger to people, and at greater risk from them.|$|R
50|$|The farm {{started out}} as a {{business}} to raise <b>alligators</b> for their hides and to sell live <b>alligators</b> to parks and zoos. The farm {{was one of the first}} to use incubators to help raise the eggs into hatchlings. In its early days, visitors were able to purchase live baby <b>alligators</b> from the farm.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Alligators</b> {{generally}} mature at {{a length}} of [...] The mating season is in late spring. In April and May, <b>alligators</b> form so-called [...] "bellowing choruses". Large groups of animals bellow together {{for a few minutes}} a few times a day, usually one to three hours after sunrise. The bellows of male American <b>alligators</b> are accompanied by powerful blasts of infrasound. Another form of male display is a loud head-slap. In 2010, on spring nights <b>alligators</b> were found to gather in large numbers for group courtship, the so-called [...] "alligator dances".|$|R
5|$|Historically, {{hunting and}} habitat loss have {{severely}} impacted American <b>alligator</b> populations throughout their range, {{and whether the}} species would survive was in doubt. In 1967, the American <b>alligator</b> was listed as an endangered species (under a law that was the precursor Endangered Species Act of 1973), since it {{was believed to be}} in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.|$|E

5|$|Of vertebrates, {{numerous}} {{species of}} frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and <b>alligator</b> (<b>Alligator</b> mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most {{of these animals}} are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during <b>alligator</b> mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (Eudocimus albus), wood stork (Mycteria americana), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alligators</b> will {{occasionally}} prey {{on large}} mammals, such as deer, but will usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, <b>alligators</b> {{have been observed}} killing and eating bobcats, but such events are not common and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although <b>alligators</b> have been listed as predators of manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, <b>alligators</b> have been recorded preying on them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|R

Experimental transmission of this disease in Crocodylus porosus hatchlings is now described...|$|R
5|$|Recently, a {{population}} of Burmese pythons became established in Everglades National Park. Substantial American <b>alligator</b> populations in the Everglades may be a contributing factor in keeping the python populations low, preventing {{the spread of the}} species up north. While events of predation by Burmese pythons on young alligators have been observed, no evidence of a net negative effect has been seen on overall American <b>alligator</b> populations.|$|E

5|$|The American <b>alligator</b> {{is listed}} as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Historically, hunting had {{decimated}} their population, and the American <b>alligator</b> was listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Subsequent conservation efforts have allowed their numbers to increase and the species {{was removed from the}} list in 1987. American alligators are now harvested for their skins and meat. The species is the official state reptile of three states: Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.|$|E
50|$|Large <b>alligators</b> feed {{heavily on}} nutria, so <b>alligators</b> may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them {{spreading}} east into Florida {{and possibly the}} Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large <b>alligators</b> that {{are the most important}} in eating nutria, some changes in harvesting may be needed to capitalize on their ability to control nutria.|$|R

5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American <b>Alligator</b> (<b>Alligator</b> mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the <b>alligator</b> was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of <b>alligator</b> hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alligator</b> left Matanzas on 18 November escorting her prizes {{back to the}} United States. The {{following}} day, she ran hard aground on a {{coral reef}} in the Florida Keys, which has since been named <b>Alligator</b> Reef. Her crew failed to refloat the vessel, but managed to salvage her guns, papers, and other valuables. Fearing {{that she would be}} salvaged by pirates, they burnt her and she sank. Though it was previously thought that the location of the wreck was known, a 1996 expedition proved this false, and the precise location of <b>Alligator</b> final resting place remains unknown. Allen was regarded by the Navy as a hero for his efforts against the pirates, and his name was used as a rallying cry the following year when USS Galliniper and USS Mosquito engaged and defeated a band of pirates led by Diabolito near the same area where the American lieutenant had been slain.|$|E

40|$|Many {{environmental}} contaminants {{alter the}} reproduction of animals by altering the development and function of the endocrine system. The ability of environmental contaminants to alter the endocrine system of <b>alligators</b> was studied both in a descriptive study in which juvenile <b>alligators</b> from a historically contaminated lake were compared to animals from a control lake and in an experimental study in which hatchling control <b>alligators</b> were exposed in ovo to several endocrine-disrupting standards and two modern-use herbicides. Endocrine status was assessed by examining plasma hormone concentrations, gonadal-adrenal mesonephros (GAM) aromatase activity, and gonadal histopathology. In the descriptive study, juvenile <b>alligators</b> from the contaminated lake had significantly lower plasma testosterone concentrations (29. 2 pg/ml compared to 51. 3 pg/ml), whereas plasma 17 beta-estradiol concentrations did not vary when compared to controls. GAM aromatase activity was significantly decreased n the <b>alligators</b> from the contaminated lake (7. 6 pmol/g/hr compared to 11. 4 pmol/g/hr). In the experimental study, the endocrine-disrupting standards had the expected effects. 17 beta-Estradiol and tamoxifen caused sex reversal from male to female, with a corresponding increase in aromatase activity. Vinclozolin had no apparent effect on male or female <b>alligators.</b> Among the herbicides tested, atrazine induced GAM aromatase activity in male hatchling <b>alligators</b> that was neither characteristic of males nor females, although testicular differentiation was not altered. Exposure to 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid {{had no effect on}} the endocrine parameters that were measured. Together, these studies show that exposure to some environmental chemicals (such as atrazine) can alter steroidogenesis in <b>alligators,</b> but the endocrine alterations previously noted for Lake Apopka, Florida, <b>alligators</b> can not be fully explained by this mechanism...|$|R
5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, {{incidents}} are inevitable where American <b>alligators</b> intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s‚Äì1990s, but American <b>alligators</b> killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American <b>alligators</b> killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There have been at least 28 fatal attacks by American <b>alligators</b> in the United States since 1970.|$|R
