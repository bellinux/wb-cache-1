5|$|In {{the absence}} of folk instruments, other bands in the genre resort to using {{keyboards}} to replicate the sound of folk instruments. This includes the aforementioned Storm, Empyrium and Finntroll {{as well as other}} <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> Midnattsol. Bands that supplement a folk instrument like the violin with keyboards include Skyclad, Mägo de Oz, and Tuatha de Danann.|$|E

5|$|Around this time, veteran {{industrial}} metal artists (Ministry, Godflesh, and White Zombie) {{began to}} repudiate the industrial label. Sales remained high throughout 2000–2005; at least 10 million records were sold {{during that time}} frame. Many groups began to take influence from hip hop and electronic music, in addition to industrial metal. As a result, <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> Powerman 5000 are often described as industrial metal as well as nu metal.|$|E
5|$|British R {{continued}} to be played in the Northern Soul club scene, where early soul records, particularly those of Motown, were highly prized. There were also bands on the London pub rock circuit. Occasional R pub rock <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> Dr Feelgood managed to build a following through tireless touring. They topped the British charts with live album Stupidity (1976), but failed to make a significant impact in the US. With the rise of disco music, British soul music became popular in the mid-late 1970s.|$|E

Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.|$|E

5|$|Impermeable plasma {{is a type}} {{of thermal}} plasma which <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> an {{impermeable}} solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls. However, later {{it was found that the}} external magnetic fields in this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{is known}} for her {{particularly}} aggressive guitar-playing and its interaction with Linda Hopper's pop-influenced vocals. In addition, the vocal harmony between the two singers has defined the band's sound, especially on later releases such as Rubbing Doesn't Help that feature more of Morris' vocals. Critics have compared Morris' guitar-playing to punk <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> Johnny Ramone of Ramones as well as alternative rock musicians such as Johnny Marr.|$|E

5|$|Music {{journalist}} Stephen Davis {{claims the}} influences of the style {{can be traced back}} to <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> Aerosmith, Kiss, Boston, Cheap Trick, and The New York Dolls. Kiss and to a lesser extent Alice Cooper, were major influences on the genre. Finnish band Hanoi Rocks, heavily influenced themselves by the New York Dolls, have been credited with setting a blueprint for the look of hair metal.|$|E

The main characters comprise a royal family that includes King Ploobis, Queen Peuta, and a male child named Wiss. There are also a male servant named Scred, a female servant named Vazh, and a rock prophet named the Mighty Favog. Scred <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> a fervent supporter of dim-witted King Ploobis, while Vazh displays flirtatious qualities.|$|E
5|$|While {{psychedelic}} rock {{began to}} waver {{at the end}} of the 1960s, psychedelic soul continued into the 1970s, peaking in popularity in the early years of the decade, and only disappearing in the late 1970s as tastes began to change. <b>Acts</b> <b>like</b> Earth, Wind and Fire, Kool and the Gang and Ohio Players, who began as psychedelic soul artists, incorporated its sounds into funk music and eventually the disco which partly replaced it.|$|E

5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E

He follows them to the railway station and tries to gain the {{attention}} of Viji, but she is unable to recognise him. Cheenu <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> a dancing monkey that Viji developed a liking for, but Viji, unable to comprehend, thinks that he is insane and begging for food. Cheenu continues his futile attempts to gain her attention, and the train eventually leaves with Viji not recognising him. Cheenu, who was injured while chasing her car {{and trying to get}} her attention, is left alone, heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|Glam {{metal can}} be traced back to music <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> Alice Cooper, Cheap Trick, Kiss, The New York Dolls, and Van Halen. It arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, {{particularly}} on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene, pioneered by bands such as Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Quiet Riot, Stryper, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, and Dokken. It was popular throughout the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, bringing to prominence bands including Poison, Skid Row, Cinderella, and Warrant. Glam metal was associated with flashy clothing and makeup. Poison, for example, had long shaggy or backcombed hair, accessories, metal studs, leather, and make-up during their live performances.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, soul music was {{influenced}} by psychedelic rock and other styles. The social and political ferment of the times inspired artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield to release album-length statements with hard-hitting social commentary. Artists like James Brown led soul towards more dance-oriented music, which eventually evolved into funk. Funk was typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic, The Meters, and James Brown himself, while more versatile groups like War, The Commodores and Earth, Wind and Fire also became popular. During the 1970s, some highly slick and commercial blue-eyed soul <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> Philadelphia's Hall & Oates achieved mainstream success, {{as well as a}} new generation of street-corner harmony or city-soul groups like The Delfonics and Howard University's Unifics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of this attention, {{existing}} <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> Yeah Yeah Yeahs were able to sign to major record labels. A second wave of bands that managed to gain international recognition {{as a result of}} the movement included Interpol, the Killers, the Catheters, Mooney Suzuki and the Go in the US, and Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, Maxïmo Park, Editors, the Cribs, the Libertines, the Fratellis, Razorlight and Kaiser Chiefs in the UK. Arctic Monkeys were the most prominent act to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking, with two No. 1 singles and Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), which became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history.|$|E
5|$|Penelope's {{story is}} an attempt at {{narrative}} justice to retribute Helen for her erroneously idealised image in the Odyssey as the archetypal female. Penelope <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> a judicial arbiter, a position she held in Ithaca {{as the head of}} state and, during Odysseus' absence, as head of the household. The ancient form of justice and punishment, which was swift and simple {{due to the lack of}} courts, prisons, and currency, is tempered by more modern concepts of balanced distributions of social benefits and burdens. Penelope's chosen form of punishment for Helen is to correct the historical records with her own bias by portraying her as vain and superficial, as someone who measures her worth by the number of men who died fighting for her.|$|E
