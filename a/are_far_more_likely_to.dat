5|$|The {{prevalence}} of Alzheimer's Disease in the United States {{is estimated at}} 5.1 million, and of these two thirds are women. Furthermore, women <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be the primary caregivers of adult family members with depression, so that they bear both the risks and burdens of this disease. The lifetime risk for a woman of developing Alzeimer's is twice that of men. Part of this difference {{may be due to}} life expectancy, but changing hormonal status over their lifetime may also play a par as may differences in gene expression. Deaths due to dementia are higher in women than men (4.5% of deaths vs. 2.0%).|$|E
5|$|Multilingualism {{had been}} {{characteristic}} of Sicily for centuries, resulting from occupations by the Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans. While {{the slave trade}} during the Republican period brought speakers of Greek and other languages from the East to the island, Greek was the language of higher-status persons such as government officials and businessmen during the Imperial era. Immigration to Sicily in the early Empire originated more often in places where Latin was spoken than in Greek-speaking areas. African speakers of Latin were a significant presence in Sicily. Christian inscriptions <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be in Greek. In late antiquity, Greek-Latin bilingualism was common enough {{that it would have}} been acquired through everyday personal interaction. The Jewish communities of Syracuse seem to have been bilingual in Greek and Hebrew. There is some Sicilian evidence of Syriac.|$|E

Commentators such as Clare Dyer (journalist at The Guardian) have spoken of a legal aid 'crisis' in regard to trainees.|$|E

50|$|When {{viewed as}} action (LHS) and {{inaction}} (RHS) the anthropological {{development of these}} structures becomes elementary and logical. In environments of scarcity, like those faced by non-human animals, taking risks is the foundational approach to survival. In scarcity it <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to die of starvation than to damaging stimuli from hostile animals or situations. However, in environments of abundance, as humans have observed, it <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to die to damaging stimuli than of starvation. As such the anthropological development of first LHS then much later RHS is understandable.|$|R
25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal dominant gene. If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance somebody in the next generation will acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or more people in the past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is a lot easier. Those who have the gene <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> get melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but one is from Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian will get it. This is because the factors mentioned earlier pertaining to those who are more susceptible to the disease and also dependent on the amount of sunscreen one wears and the UV radiation potency in their environment.|$|E
500|$|Pesticides used on {{bee forage}} <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> enter the colony by the pollen stores rather than [...] nectar (because pollen is carried {{externally}} on the bees, while nectar is carried internally, and may kill the bee if too toxic), {{though not all}} potentially lethal chemicals, either natural or man-made, affect the adult bees; many primarily affect the brood, but brood die-off {{does not appear to}} be happening in CCD. Most significantly, brood are not fed honey, and adult bees consume relatively little pollen; accordingly, the pattern in CCD suggests, if contaminants or toxins from the environment 'are' responsible, it is most likely to be via the honey, as the adults are dying (or leaving), not the brood (though possibly effects of contaminated pollen consumed by juveniles may only show after they have developed into adults).|$|E

2500|$|Light water (the {{ordinary}} H2O) is both {{a neutron}} moderator and a neutron absorber.
