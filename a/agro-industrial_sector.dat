40|$|With {{regard to}} its energy supply, Italy {{has always been}} heavily {{dependent}} on foreign countries. As a consequence adequate strategies {{to solve the problem}} are urgently needed. In the last years the Italian energy policy has seemed to squint: on the one hand, renewable energies, particularly wind and photovoltaic energies, have been developed, also driven by the political strategy of the European institutions; on the other hand, a return to nuclear energy production has been attempted unsuccessfully, due to a recent popular referendum that ratified the termination of this kind of energy production. In conjunction with the consideration that in Italy the use of fossil fuel is very high and responsible for relevant greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO 2, particularly in the transport sector, this issue is boosting the need to study new and complementary options to diversify the energy supply and to tackle the most relevant economic and environmental effects of the energy system. All things considered, the production and use of biofuels could become a viable alternative. However, the implications associated with the increasing production and trade in both raw materials and biofuels, particularly the first-generation ones, show several issues worldwide (e. g. the “food versus fuel” debate). In the light of the previous considerations, this chapter focuses on an Italian energy strategy based also on the production of biofuels, particularly second and third-generation technologies, which could potentially overcome some of the mentioned limits. It should be noted that although both of them are in a pre-trade phase, they could be a good choice in the medium and long terms. Among the several sources for next-generation biofuel production, residual biomass, particularly the lignocellulosic kind, generated by the agricultural, forest and <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>sectors,</b> has to be considered as a potential feedstock for the second-generation biofuels. The authors aim to carry out an analysis of the exploitation of this residual biomass for the entire Italian territory in order to underline its potential in this sector.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} are deeply engaged in trade negotiations at the bilateral, {{regional and international}} (WTO) levels. As imports, exports and tariff duties all occupy {{an important part of}} their economies, far-reaching impacts on production, labor and capital markets, household incomes and, perhaps most importantly, economic growth will indubitably ensue. As men and women occupy very different roles in these economies, particularly in terms of the import and export orientation of the sectors in which they work, they will be affected very differently by these reforms. To anticipate these changes, a dynamic economy-wide model is developed with an application to Senegal. Whereas most similar existing studies consider the comparative static resource reallocation effects of trade reforms, ours is the first to focus on the growth effects (“dynamic gains from trade”), which are thought to be possibly much larger. The trade-productivity link is revealed to be the strongest growth channel, raising GDP by over three percentage points by the end of our 15 year simulation period. Trade liberalization is found to increase the gender wage gap in favor of men, especially among unskilled workers, as men are more active in export-oriented sectors such as cash crops and mining whereas women contribute more to import-competing sectors such as food crops. Furthermore, the ensuing growth effects further widen the over-all gender wage gap, as the productivity gains from increased openness are greatest in female-intensive sectors in which imports rise markedly. Thus, this suggests the need to implement policies aimed at increasing both unskilled and skilled women’s exposure in labor-intensive export industries, which is currently male dominated. A linked microsimulation analysis, based on a survey of Senegalese households, show that trade liberalization reduces poverty in Senegal, particularly in rural areas. While the fall in the relative wages of rural workers would initially lead us to believe that rural households would lose the most from trade liberalization, they are in fact compensated by greater consumer price savings, given that they consume more goods from the initially protected agricultural and <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>sectors.</b> Senegal, Trade, Gender, Poverty, Growth...|$|R
40|$|There {{are still}} many {{categories}} of children in India for whom adequate and appropriate strategies are not in place for their effective education. One such substantive category is children of seasonal migrants – a group {{which has not been}} on the radar screen of the government or development agencies. Distress seasonal migration is a growing phenomenon in almost all arid parts of India. Drought and lack of work in villages forces entire families to migrate for several months every year in search of work merely to survive. Children accompany their parents, and as a result drop-out rates go up. Migrants comprise the most vulnerable sections of society, and especially those that also belong to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe groups. There is no official data available on the scale of distress seasonal migration, but estimates put the numbers of migrants between 1 and 3 crore (10 to 30 million). The number of children involved in these migrations may range between 40 and 60 lakhs (4 to 6 million). Migration takes place to a range of industrial and <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>sectors</b> such as brick manufacture, salt making, sugar cane harvesting, stone quarrying, construction, plantations and fishing. This paper identifies major sectors and geographies with a high incidence of seasonal migration, and gives broad estimates of the numbers involved, especially the number of children between 0 - 14 years. It also outlines the nature and patterns of seasonal migration in different sectors, and how these annual migration cycles overlap with the annual school calendar. The discussion focuses on the difficulties that children face with schooling both in villages and at migration sites, and the conditions under which children drop out of schools, as well as the response or lack of response of local school systems to the education of migrant children in some areas. The paper also outlines the efforts made so far by government and NGOs to address these problems through alternative schooling, and provides recommendations for state and central governments in terms of policy and program interventions...|$|R

Method: The methodology used consists on to obtain a technological inventory (machines, equipment and IT infrastructure) and identify the technological assets of the related companies. Results: During the information collection phase, four panela producer companies were visited, all of them located in the Hoya del Rio Suarez region, of which it was found that only one presents a high degree of automation of its production processes, while the others have a very low or no automation. The literature review evidenced that there are several publications in indexed journals that describe important contributions on the development of the <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>sector</b> of panela, although none of them are made by universities of the department.

40|$|A {{debate over}} {{environmental}} policies and trade competitiveness, “Do environmental policies really matter to impact trade competitiveness?” still exists {{during the past}} decade. The thesis aims at investigating the impact of WTO-EU environmental policies for the international olive oil market on production and export competitiveness of developing countries. In particular, we focus our analysis on the <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>sector</b> in the Arab countries, and we take specific reference {{to the case of}} the olive oil <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>sector</b> in Syria. In the frame of a partial equilibrium trade model, we incorporate the “end-of-the-pipe” environmental policies which in turn enhance the productivity of the polluting input. Moreover, a part of the burden of environmental compliance may be shifted onto foreign consumers. The most novel part of our model consists of the augmented effect of compliance with environmental policies, which includes not only the standard impact on the effective product price, but also on the input shadow price. The empirical findings, based on Syrian data, provide strong support to the Porter Hypothesis and its application to international markets for agro-industrial products. Accordingly, the study disproves the legitimacy of concerns that stricter environmental policies in developing economies may have negative impacts on their production and export competitiveness. In contrast, our results show that compliance with environmental policies under the large country assumption has positive effects on their international competitiveness of environmentally sensitive sectors, in particular. Therefore, the policy implications suggest the implementation of strict environmental regulatory policies supporting environmentally sound technologies...|$|E
