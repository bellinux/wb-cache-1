5|$|Caracalla's {{official}} portrayal as sole emperor marks <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> detached {{images of}} the philosopher-emperors who preceded him: his close-cropped haircut {{is that of a}} soldier, his pugnacious scowl a realistic and threatening presence. This rugged soldier-emperor, an iconic archetype, was adopted by most of the following emperors, such as Maximinus Thrax, who were dependent on the support of the troops to rule the empire.|$|E
5|$|In 1713, Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI {{established}} {{a line of}} succession that gave precedence to his own daughters over the daughters of his deceased older brother, Emperor Joseph I. To protect the Habsburg inheritance, he coerced, cajoled, and persuaded the crowned heads of Europe to accept the Pragmatic Sanction. In this agreement, they acknowledged any of his legitimate daughters as the rightful Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, and Archduchess of Austria – <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tradition of agnatic primogeniture.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> studies came in {{the second}} half of 1892. After his father's death, he could not afford to attend {{university}} that semester. He worked briefly as a private tutor in the Skien district, and was paid to write in the newspaper Varden. On returning to his studies he worked as a Kristiania correspondent for the newspaper; eventually he also worked for Päivälehti. In 1901 he took over from Erik Vullum as obituarist and anniversary writer in Verdens Gang. In the next years he would contribute extensively to publications such as Den 17de Mai, Nationalbladet, Nordmanns-Forbundets tidsskrift, Syn og Segn, Samtiden, Unglyden, Dagbladet, Verdens Gang and Tidens Tegn; these were mostly Liberal or Norwegian nationalist publications.|$|E
5|$|Alliance members {{gathered}} that December in Ocala, Florida, and formulated a platform, {{later called}} the Ocala Demands, {{that called for}} looser money, government control of the railroads, a graduated income tax, and the direct election of senators. Weaver endorsed the message in the Tribune and corresponded with the group's leader, LeonidasL. Polk. Weaver attended the group's convention in Cincinnati in May 1891, where he and Polk argued against forming a third party. Another delegate, IgnatiusL. Donnelly, argued forcefully for <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two major parties, and his argument carried the day, although Weaver and Polk kept many of Donnelly's more radical proposals out of the convention's statement of principles.|$|E
5|$|Although The Raft of the Medusa retains {{elements}} of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death {{at the age of}} 32. The painting's influence {{can be seen in the}} works of Eugène Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and Édouard Manet.|$|E

Marco Saligari won the stage by over a minute on the second-place finisher Gianluca Bortolami, while the general classification contenders finished together leaving the classification largely unchanged. Stage eighteen was a primarily flat stage that closed with a field sprint. Adriano Baffi won the field sprint and the stage, which was his third stage victory at the Giro that year.|$|E

Most of the episodes of the two seasons were {{directed}} by the Wachowskis (or just Lana, in the second season), with the remainder being divided between their frequent collaborators James McTeigue, Tom Tykwer and Dan Glass. Lilly's break during the second season {{marked the first time}} in the sisters' career that they did not work together as a writing and directing unit. Sense8 was filmed almost entirely on location in a multitude of cities around the world.|$|E
5|$|Her novella Anthem {{was written}} during <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead.

It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.|$|E

After having a few mini-crises, including getting cold feet, he starts to break down, but regains his composure after speaking with Holly. Pam (Jenna Fischer) leaves the office to supposedly run errands, but takes <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> workday to see The King's Speech before Michael can say his goodbye to her.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 {{version of}} the All-Star Game {{featured}} <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional way in which teams were organized. Instead of using conferences or player nationalities as in the past, teams were selected by captains in a fantasy draft days prior to the game. Fans still elected players to the All-Star Game, but instead of the traditional 12 starters (six for each team), they elected only six players, with the remaining 36 players involved in the game selected by the NHL. Sidney Crosby received the most votes of any player, but due to a concussion {{he was unable to}} participate in the game. The participating players voted for team captains, selecting Nicklas Lidstrom of the Detroit Red Wings and Eric Staal of the Hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|Wada had {{stated in}} 2006, while the {{development}} and release of Compilation titles was still ongoing, that the Compilation could remain an active franchise until 2017, the twentieth anniversary of Final Fantasy VIIs release. After finishing work on Advent Children Complete, the team announced that they would take <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> series, although they stated that they still have various ideas for future titles. In later interviews relating to Final Fantasy VII, multiple staff members including Nomura stated that the Compilation was only ever intended to extend to three games and a movie, ending {{with the release of}} Crisis Core. Their reasoning was that releasing any more would saturate the market.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Jamaica, Queens in New York City, Clinkscales rose to {{prominence}} as {{a basketball player}} at a young age, drawing attention from coaches around the country. After his freshman year at Springfield Gardens High School, he transferred to Shores Christian Academy in Ocala, Florida, where his team won the National Association of Christian Athletes title. Consequently, Clinkscales received interest from several major college basketball programs as a three-star recruit. He played with the DePaul Blue Demons from 2004 to 2008 and joined the BayHawks soon after. For his entire college career, Clinkscales had a limited impact as a scorer despite his passing ability, becoming the fifth freshman at DePaul to pass for 100 assists. While most of his statistics stagnated over the years, he led NCAA Division I in assist-to-turnover ratio as a senior. After previously announcing <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hurricanes, Clinkscales affirmed in October 2016 that he would represent the team in the 2016–2017 season.|$|E
5|$|As the Giro left Austria, {{the race}} began {{to enter the}} Dolomites during stage fourteen. The {{eventual}} stage winner Marco Pantani was in a chasing group on the final climb of the stage, the Passo di Monte Giovo. He attacked, bridged the gap to the leading group, and left them behind to claim his first professional victory of his career. The next stage saw Pantani win again after he rode away from the attack group on the last climb of the Valico di Santa Cristina and he then soloed to the finish in Stradella. Pantani's efforts on the day moved him up to second overall in the race. The race's sixteenth stage took <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mountains with the stage being primarily fled, which ultimately led to the sprint finish that was won by Italian Maximilian Sciandri. Ján Svorada won the next day's stage after attacking from the breakaway group in the closing seconds.|$|E
