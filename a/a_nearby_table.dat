5|$|As other {{scenes of}} Carey in the latex mini {{and by the}} large red hone prop are interspersed, the club scene alters to a poker table, where Ealy reveals three of his card, '556', {{completing}} four of the seven digits of Carey phone number. The next scene finds Carey sitting on a large pink sofa in an empty room in the club, sporting only a white man's suit jacket and stilettos. As the song reaches the bridge, Carey is shown back in the club's main room dancing, as she leaves a number '4' on <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>table</b> for the man to find. As Carey once again {{is shown in the}} yellow latex dress, she walks down a small aisle, placing another card with the number '4' into Ealy's jacket pocket, before storming through the club by several followers. As the video ends, the number '555-6464' are shown lying on a small table, while Carey sits on the large pink sofa, and Ealy is seen on the other side gazing at her. The video concludes with Ealy slowly approaching Carey on the large sofa, as she winks and smiles to the camera.|$|E

500|$|... "The Hounds of Baskerville" [...] took {{around four}} weeks to film, with {{shooting}} mostly taking place throughout May 2011. Additional scenes were shot later in July and August. Filming on location mostly took place across South Wales, with {{parts of the}} episode being shot on location in Dartmoor, even though the producers did not originally intend to do so. The first day took place at a cemetery. The producers {{were looking for a}} village in South Wales that was [...] "very English-looking." [...] Scenes of the fictional [...] "Cross Keys" [...] pub were filmed at the Bush Inn in St Hilary, Vale of Glamorgan. The production team donated £500 to the village after filming had finished. In one scene, after Sherlock first witnesses the hound, Sherlock makes deductions about a mother and son from <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>table.</b> In filming the scene, Cumberbatch has to recall multiple pages of monologue in front of camera, and had to talk faster than he was used to.|$|E

500|$|Although shy and {{insecure}} as a teenager, as {{an adult}} Chamberlain became well known for his womanizing. As his lawyer Seymour [...] "Sy" [...] Goldberg put it: [...] "Some people collect stamps, Wilt collected women." [...] Swedish Olympic high jumper Annette Tånnander, who met {{him when he was}} 40 and she 19, remembers him as a pick-up artist who was extremely confident yet respectful: [...] "I think Wilt hit on everything that moved... he never was bad or rude." [...] Many of Chamberlain's personal friends testified that he once had 23 women in 10 days, had no problems organizing a threesome (or more), and particularly enjoyed a TV skit on the television show In Living Color in which a mother and her daughter approach a Vietnam Wall-like list of women who slept with him, both of them pointing out that their names are on it, as well as a 1991 Saturday Night Live sketch where MC Hammer played Chamberlain in [...] "Remembrances of Love", where Chamberlain spoofs a soap opera with romances with women that are usually over in five minutes. [...] However, Los Angeles Times columnist David Shaw claimed that during a dinner with Shaw and his wife, Chamberlain was [...] "rude and sexist toward his own date, as he usually was", adding that at one point Chamberlain left the table to get the phone number of an attractive woman at <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

2500|$|He {{never really}} {{turned off the}} {{computational}} portion of his mind, {{even when he was}} absorbed in other work. One evening found him deep in conversation at the officers club, planning the engineering aspects of an upcoming test series with the project pilot for the XF-91 rocket-assisted fighter program. Four master's degree hopefuls from MIT were seated at <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>table,</b> fretting at their inability to solve a complex problem which they had been assigned.

2500|$|On 13 April 1934, Dane was pickpocketed of all {{the money}} he had: $18. On 14 April, he was {{to meet with a}} young woman named Frances Leake, with whom he planned to see a movie.

2500|$|Mrs. Schneider was {{attacked}} {{in the early}} evening hours of August 5, 1918. [...] The 8 months pregnant, 28-year-old of Elmira Street, [...] awoke to find a dark figure standing over her, and was bashed in the face repeatedly. [...] Her scalp had been cut open, and her face was completely covered in blood. [...] Mrs. Schneider was discovered after midnight by her husband, Ed Schneider, who was returning late from work. Schneider claimed that she remembered nothing of the attack, and gave birth to a healthy baby girl two days after the incident. Her husband told police that nothing was stolen from the home, besides six or seven dollars that had been in his wallet. [...] The windows and doors of the apartment appear to have not been forced open, and authorities {{came to the conclusion that}} the woman was most likely attacked with a lamp that had been on <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>table.</b> James Gleason, who police said was an ex-convict, was arrested shortly after Schneider was found. [...] Gleason was later released due to a complete lack of evidence, and stated that he originally ran from authorities because he had so often been arrested. [...] Lead investigators began to publicly speculate that the attack was related to the previous incidents involving Besumer and Maggio.|$|E
5|$|The assailants were {{apparently}} targeting Rami Amira, {{who was sitting}} at <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>nearby</b> with Moti Hassin and Simantov Hatayeb, who are all identified with the Abergil group, {{in an effort to}} resolve an internal dispute. Amira sustained a slight injury in his cheek {{as a result of the}} attack.

While the work has usually been regarded as a genre scene, it is possible that it is in fact a portrait of Anna du Pire, the artist's wife.|$|R
2500|$|As the men {{attempted}} {{to enter the}} front of the residence, they were fired upon by military police [...] stationed inside. Yasuda and another soldier were wounded. The soldiers then forced their way in through the rear entrance, where they encountered Watanabe's wife standing outside their bedroom on the second floor. Shoving her aside, they found Watanabe using a futon for cover. Watanabe opened fire with his pistol, whereupon one of the soldiers fired a burst at him with a light machine gun. Takahashi then rushed forward and stabbed Watanabe with his sword. His nine-year-old daughter Kazuko witnessed his death as she hid behind <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>nearby.</b> The soldiers then boarded their trucks and left, taking their two wounded to a hospital, then assuming a position in northern Nagatachō.|$|R

60|$|And then I {{looked around}} and saw the Fool-Killer, as he had always {{appeared}} to my imagination, sitting at <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>table,</b> and regarding us with his reddish, fatal, relentless eyes. He was Jesse Holmes from top to toe; he had the long, gray, ragged beard, the gray clothes of ancient cut, the executioner's look, and the dusty shoes of one who had been called from afar. His eyes were turned fixedly upon Kerner. I shuddered to think that I had invoked him from his assiduous southern duties. I thought of flying, and then I kept my seat, reflecting that many men had escaped his ministrations when it seemed that nothing short of an appointment as Ambassador to Spain could save them from him. I had called my brother Kerner a fool and {{was in danger of}} hell fire. That was nothing; but I would try to save him from Jesse Holmes.|$|E

40|$|Observers make rapid eye {{movements}} to examine the world around them. Before an eye movement is made, attention is covertly shifted {{to the location of}} the object of interest. The eyes typically will land at the position at which attention is directed. Here we report that a goal-directed eye movement toward a uniquely colored object is disrupted by the appearance of a new but task-irrelevant object, unless subjects have a sufficient amount of time to focus their attention on the location of the target prior to the appearance of the new object. In many instances, the eyes started moving toward the new object before gaze started to shift to the color-singleton target. The eyes often landed for {{a very short period of}} time (25 [...] 150 ms) near the new object. The results suggest parallel programming of two saccades: one voluntary, goal-directed eye movement toward the colorsingleton target and one stimulus-driven eye movement reflexively elicited by the appearance of the new object. Neuroanatomical structures responsible for parallel programming of saccades are discussed. It is well-known that the visual system is sensitive to events that exhibit sudden change (Breitmeyer & Ganz, 1976). When a person is engaged in a particular task (e. g., reading a book), something might happen in the environment (e. g., someone switches on a desk lamp at <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> library <b>table)</b> that immediately captures the person 's attention even when he or she had no particular intention to look for such events. Directing attention to these events may merely seem to distract the person from the intended task. It has been argued, though, that detecting these sudden changes in the environment is significant for behaving organisms because these events may require immediate identification and action (Todd & Van G [...] ...|$|R
