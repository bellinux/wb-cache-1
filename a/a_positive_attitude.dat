40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{interactive}} effects of chief executive officer (CEO) age and CEO attitudes toward younger and older employees on organisational age cultures. Data was collected from 66 CEOs of small and medium-sized businesses and 274 employees. Results were consistent with expectations based on organisational culture and upper echelons theories. The relationship between CEO age and organisational age culture for younger employees was negative for CEOs with <b>a</b> less <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward younger employees and positive for those with <b>a</b> more <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward younger employees. The relationship between CEO age and organisational age culture for older employees was positive for CEOs with <b>a</b> more <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward older employees and non-significant for those with <b>a</b> less <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward older employees. The findings provide initial support for the existence of organisational age cultures, suggesting that these cultures can be predicted by the interplay of CEO age and age-related attitudes...|$|R

25|$|Conservative Judaism is {{characterized}} by a commitment to traditional Jewish laws and customs, including observance of Shabbat and kashrut, a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith, <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward modern culture, and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering Jewish religious texts. Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static, but has always developed in response to changing conditions. It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God and reflecting his will, but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses. Conservative Judaism holds that the Oral Law is divine and normative, but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions.|$|E

Pornographic films attempt to present a sexual fantasy and actresses are selected {{on their ability to}} create or fit that fantasy. Many times the fantasy can be an actress' physical features and appearance, such as figure, breast size, hair style, ethnicity, as well as on her willingness and expertise in performing particular sex acts. Actresses are required to present <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> to on-screen sexual performance with all sex acts being presented as enjoyable and joyfully entered into.

25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> towards team-based rewards.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the 2011 tennis tour Blake ended his partnership with coach Kelly Jones, choosing to travel alone. In a preseason interview, Blake stated he was healthy and carrying <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> and would skip the Australian Open. In his first match of the year, on February 8 at the SAP Open in San Jose, Blake defeated American qualifier Jesse Levine after Levine succumbed to an injury late in the second set. The American ran into red-hot Canadian youngster Milos Raonic in the second round and fell after battling back from a late break down in the second set to force a tiebreaker. Raonic would go on to win the tournament, his first as a pro. In the 2011 US Open, Blake hit a forehand winner on match point against Jesse Huta Galung in the first round that was clocked at 125mph, thus making it the fastest forehand ever hit, eclipsing Gaël Monfils's earlier record of 122mph against Marcos Baghdatis. Blake won the match but lost to David Ferrer.|$|E
25|$|A study {{dedicated}} to investigating the thin ideal internalization {{as a factor}} of bulimia nervosa is Thompson's and Stice's research. The aim of their {{study was to investigate}} how and to what degree does media affect the thin ideal internalization. Thompson and Stice used randomized experiments (more specifically programs) {{dedicated to}} teaching young women how to be more critical when it comes to media, in order to reduce thin ideal internalization. The results showed that by creating more awareness of the media's control of the societal ideal of attractiveness, the thin ideal internalization significantly dropped. In other words, less thin ideal images portrayed by the media resulted in less thin ideal internalization. Therefore, Thompson and Stice concluded that media affected greatly the thin ideal internalization. Papies showed {{that it is not the}} thin ideal itself, but rather the self-association with other persons of a certain weight that decide how someone with bulimia nervosa feels. People that associate themselves with thin models get in <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> when they see thin models and people that associate with overweight get in a negative attitude when they see thin models. Moreover, it can be taught to associate with thinner people.|$|E
