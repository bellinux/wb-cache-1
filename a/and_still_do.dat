5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E

25|$|Due to fire {{suppression}} efforts and livestock grazing {{during the early}} and mid 20th century, low-intensity fires no longer occurred naturally in many groves, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not occur in some groves today. The suppression of fires also led to ground fuel build-up and the dense growth of fire-sensitive white fir. This increased the risk of more intense fires that can use the firs as ladders to threaten mature giant sequoia crowns. Natural fires may also be important in keeping carpenter ants in check.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1962 the Vartiokylä dumping ground was closed, but not because of its {{environmental}} impact. The official story was that the place was full and could not accommodate further waste materials. Since it had originally been a hole from which gravel had been taken, it did not stick out from the surrounding areas, such as the Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground and the Vuosaari dumping ground did <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>do.</b> (These two dumping grounds now replaced the Vartiokylä dumping ground.) Thus, when {{the construction of the}} Myllypuro neighbourhood was begun, the new residents most likely were oblivious {{to the fact that there}} had once been such a site there.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, the bikini's design {{violates the}} Marshall Islanders' modern customs of modesty because it exposes a woman's thighs and shoulders.

Marshall Island women swim in their muumuus which are made of a fine polyester that dries quickly. Wearing a bikini in the Marshall Islands is mainly limited to restricted-access beaches and pools like those at private resorts or on United States government facilities on the Kwajalein Atoll within the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site.|$|E

The Starks have often gratefully remarked that the company would never have been as successful without their association with Luther Burbank. The great Luther Burbank was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame on February 10, 1986 by then-president Clay Stark Logan, an enormous honor for him and the Stark family.|$|E
25|$|After the {{independence}} of Pakistan in 1947, Pakistan inherited the historical red-light districts in Lahore and Multan including the infamous Hira Mandi area. These were well-developed and attracted both wealthy clients and those looking for singers and actresses. The prostitutes and associates in the sex-trade were named Kanjars. while their musician companions were known as the community of Mirasis. The prostitutes would usually, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>do,</b> dance {{to the music of}} harmonium and tabla played by the mirasis. Where Lahore and Multan were the known contenders in the trade, other cities also had their own red-light districts which may include Ghulam abad and Aminpur bazar in Faisalabad Napier Road in Karachi and Qasai Gali in Rawalpindi. The prostitutes retained the hereditary character of their occupation and the social stigma.|$|E
25|$|Affiliates {{were among}} the {{earliest}} adopters of pay per click advertising when the first pay-per-click search engines emerged during {{the end of the}} 1990s. Later in 2000 Google launched its pay per click service, Google AdWords, which is responsible for the widespread use and acceptance of pay per click as an advertising channel. An increasing number of merchants engaged in pay per click advertising, either directly or via a search marketing agency, and realized that this space was already occupied by their affiliates. Although this situation alone created advertising channel conflicts and debates between advertisers and affiliates, the largest issue concerned affiliates bidding on advertisers names, brands, and trademarks. Several advertisers began to adjust their affiliate program terms to prohibit their affiliates from bidding on those type of keywords. Some advertisers, however, did <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> embrace this behavior, {{going so far as to}} allow, or even encourage, affiliates to bid on any term, including the advertiser's trademarks.|$|E

25|$|Large {{immigrant}} {{populations in}} the North West result {{in the presence of}} significant immigrant languages. South Asian languages such as Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi are widespread, with the largest amount of speakers residing in Preston, Blackburn and Manchester. The Chinese once made up the largest minority in the region (as Liverpool has one of the oldest Chinese settlements in Europe), <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> to the far north where Chinese is spoken by small but significant communities. Since the enlargement of the EU, over 1 million Poles have immigrated to the UK, a large number of them settling in the North West. Places such as Crewe as well as larger cities make Polish written information available for the public, to much controversy. Other immigrant languages with a presence in the North West are Spanish, mainly amongst the Latin American communities in Liverpool and Manchester, as well as various other Eastern European and Asian languages.|$|E
25|$|The first {{official}} breed standard {{was written in}} 1933. This standard attempted to differentiate the Estrela as a distinct breed. This led to the hooked tail and double dew claws becoming a requirement. All colors were allowed. The standard has undergone small refinements since then. For example, dew claws became optional by 1955, and the allowed colors have been limited {{a few times to}} achieve today’s current set.Prior to World War II, the Estrela breeders were still primarily the shepherds and farmers of the region. Since they were mostly illiterate, they did not make any attempt to follow the official breed standard, if they even knew one existed. But by the early 1950s, interest in the breed returned, and the annual concursos were reinstated. Again the intent was to stimulate interest among the Serra residents and to encourage them to adhere to the official standard. During this period, the long-haired variety was most popular at shows, but “show dogs” represented (<b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>do)</b> {{only a small portion of}} the Estrela population in Portugal. Many of the working dogs were (and are) short-haired.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the fall}} of large {{portions}} of former Byzantine and Sasanian provinces to the Arab armies, a large indigenous Christian population of varying ethnicities came under Arab Muslim dominance. Historically, a number of minority Christian sects were persecuted as heretic under Byzantine rule (such as non-Chalcedonians). As Muslim army commanders expanded their empire and attacked countries in Asia, North Africa and southern Europe, they would offer three conditions to their enemies: convert to Islam, or pay jizyah (tax) every year, or face war to death. Those who refused war and refused to convert were deemed to have agreed to pay jizya. It is a common agreement that after {{the rapid expansion of}} Islam from the 7th century onward, many Christians chose not to convert to Islam. Many scholars and intellectuals like Edward Said believed Christians in the Arab world have made significant contributions to the Arab civilization since the 7th century AD <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>do.</b> Some of the top poets at certain times were Arab Christians, and many Arab (and non-Arab) Christians were physicians, writers, government officials, and people of literature.|$|E

25|$|This {{investigation}} included {{over one}} hundred interviews of former students, family of former students, and former staff members of the school. The interviews confirmed {{that in addition to}} the implementation of the Individual Rating System, school administrators used corporal punishment as a tool to encourage obedience. The interviews revealed little disagreement about the way in which corporal punishment was administered. The former students were consistent in that punishment was administered by school administrators and adult staff witnesses in the building referred to as the White House. The former students were consistent in stating that a wooden paddle or leather strap was the implement used for administering punishment. The area of disagreement amongst former students was the number of spankings administered and their severity. Although some former students stated that they were “beaten” {{to the point that the}} skin of their buttocks blistered and bled profusely, there was little to no evidence of visible residual scarring. A secondary disagreement was the former students’ perceptions of the punishment process. Some former students stated that their spankings caused them no psychological harm and that they learned from their mistakes while others stated that, mentally, they suffered greatly as a result <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> so to this day.|$|E
25|$|As the Nintendo Entertainment System grew in {{popularity}} and entered millions of American homes, some small video rental shops began buying their own copies of NES games, and renting {{them out to}} customers for around the same price as a video cassette rental for a few days. Nintendo received no profit from the practice beyond the initial cost of their game, and unlike movie rentals, a newly released game could hit store shelves and be available for rent on the same day. Nintendo took steps to stop game rentals, but didn't take any formal legal action until Blockbuster Video began to make game rentals a large-scale service. Nintendo claimed that allowing customers to rent games would significantly hurt sales and drive {{up the cost of}} games. Nintendo lost the lawsuit, but did win on a claim of copyright infringement. Blockbuster was banned from including original, copyrighted instruction booklets with their rented games. In compliance with the ruling, Blockbuster produced their own short instructions—usually {{in the form of a}} small booklet, card, or label stuck on the back of the rental box—that explained the game's basic premise and controls. Video rental shops continued the practice of renting video games <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> today.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the rare confrontation with an adult brown bear or gray wolf pack, adult black bears are not usually subject to natural predation. However, as evidenced by scats with fur inside of them and the recently discovered carcass of an adult sow with puncture marks in the skull, black bears may occasionally have fallen <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> fall prey to jaguars in the southern parts of their range. In such scenarios, the big cat would have the advantage if it ambushed the bear, killing it with a crushing bite {{to the back of the}} skull. Black bear cubs tend to be more vulnerable to predation than adults. Known predators of bear cubs have included bobcats, coyotes, cougars, wolves, brown bears and other bears of their own species. Many of these will stealthily snatch small cubs right from under the sleeping mother. There is a single record of a golden eagle snatching a yearling cub. Once out of hibernation, mother bears may be able to fight off most potential predators. Even cougars will be displaced by an angry mother bear if they are discovered stalking the cubs. Flooding of dens after birth may also occasionally kill newborn cubs. However, in current times, American black bear fatalities are overwhelmingly attributable to human activities. Seasonally, tens of thousands of black bears are hunted legally across North America, with many more being illegally poached or trapped. Auto collisions also may claim many black bear lives annually.|$|E

500|$|When Montclair State University station {{opened in}} 2004 [...] and the Wayne Route 23 Transit Center's train {{platform}} opened in 2008, this made Great Notch {{one of three}} stations in Little Falls, {{and it did not}} nearly have the ridership either of the other two stations had. The opening of Montclair State University Station helped to pull away commuters from Great Notch due to its location very near it. The small parking lot facing the station had very little room for cars and a parking lot {{on the opposite side of}} the single tracked station was isolated from it by fencing. Further exacerbating the problem was that the small lot abutting Notch Road was not marked specifically for train passengers only. Great Notch had (and still has) a bus stop on the corner of Notch and Long Hill Roads that serves buses headed for Port Authority Bus Terminal, and commuters using the bus would park in the train station's parking lot (<b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>do,</b> as it was never blocked off) and catch the bus up the street.|$|E
