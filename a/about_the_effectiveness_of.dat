25|$|As it has {{euphoric effects}} {{similar to other}} opioids, {{oxycodone}} {{is one of the}} drugs abused in the current opioid epidemic in the United States.

25|$|Knowingly {{giving a}} person a placebo {{when there is}} an {{effective}} treatment available is a bioethically complex issue.

25|$|Tom Laliberty of Raytheon {{said that}} President Barack Obama {{was forced to}} shift from a land based missile defense system to a sea based one because of the {{difficulties}} of coordinating with partner nations.

25|$|Service councils {{were created}} as {{governance}} councils in 2001, {{in response to}} complaints <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> Metro service in suburban areas. Communications between sectors and riders was poor, {{according to a report}} by the California State Auditor which was released one year into the new structure. In addition, each sector had its own scheduling, operations, and maintenance divisions, causing effort duplication, organizational silos, and inefficiency. Thus, in 2009, the sectors were eliminated, and transportation, maintenance, service planning, and administration were recentralized under the guidance of Metro's Chief Operations Officer. Governance councils, renamed service councils, now have more responsibility over local issues such as stop placement and service changes, while larger issues are handled by the Metro board.|$|E
25|$|While current {{technology}} is very effective at detecting smoke and fire conditions, the deaf and {{hard of hearing}} community has raised concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> the alerting function in awakening sleeping individuals in certain high-risk {{groups such as the}} elderly, those with hearing loss and those who are intoxicated. Between 2005 and 2007 research sponsored by the United States' National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) focused on understanding the cause of the higher number of deaths in such high-risk groups. Initial research into the effectiveness of the various alerting methods is sparse. Research findings suggest that a low frequency (520Hz) square wave output is significantly more effective at awakening high risk individuals. Wireless smoke and carbon monoxide detectors linked to alert mechanisms such as vibrating pillow pads for the hearing impaired, strobes, and remote warning handsets are more effective at waking people with serious hearing loss than other alarms.|$|E
25|$|According to the JCT, an {{organization}} that provides workers with sufficient levels of skill variety (using different skills and talents in performing work), task identity (contributing to a clearly identifiable larger project), and task significance (impacting the lives or work of other people) {{is likely to have}} workers who feel their work has meaning and value. Sufficiently high levels of autonomy (independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job) will inspire the worker to feel responsibility for the work; and sufficiently high levels of Task Feedback (receiving timely, clear, specific, detailed, actionable information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> his or her job performance) will inspire the worker to feel the organization is authentically interested in helping to foster his/her professional development and growth. The combined effect of these psychological states results in desired personal and work outcomes: intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, performance quality, low absenteeism, and low turnover rate.|$|E
