5|$|In 1961, {{the studio}} {{released}} One Hundred and One Dalmatians, an animated feature which popularized {{the use of}} xerography {{during the process of}} inking <b>and</b> <b>painting</b> traditional animation cels. Using xerography, animation drawings could be photochemically transferred rather than traced from paper drawings to the clear acetate sheets ("cels") used in final animation production. The resulting art style– a scratchier line which revealed the construction lines in the animators' drawings– typified Disney films into the 1980s. The film was a success, being the tenth highest-grossing film of 1961 with rentals of $6.4 million.|$|E
