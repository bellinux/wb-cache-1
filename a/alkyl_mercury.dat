40|$|AbstractIn {{the event}} of CO 2 leakage of {{offshore}} CCS, impurity substances in a CO 2 stream could have potential impacts on marine organisms. Hazardous impurities, i. e. CO, SO 2, H 2 S, NOx, NH 3 and Hg were reviewed. Effects of CO and SO 2 on marine organisms were scarcely known. Japanese guideline indicates safe levels< 0. 0009 mg/L for H 2 S,< 0. 2 mg/L for NO 2,< 30 mg/L for NO 3,< 0. 035 mg/L for NH 3,< 0. 0001 mg/L for total mercury and< 0. 001 mg/L for <b>alkyl</b> <b>mercury.</b> The impact of these impurities will likely be overshadowed by that of the leaked CO 2...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Acute HgCl 2 {{poisoning}} {{was shown}} to decrease significantly the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PyDH) and a-ketoglutanic dehydrogenese (aKgDH) activity in the kidney and liver {{but not in the}} brain. Rats receiving 77 % of the 2 hr 50 % lethal dose showed 57 % of normal renal PyDH activity and 69 % of normal renal aKgDH activity. Chronic HgCl 2 poisoning resulted in an unexpected increase in PyDH and aKgDH activity in the kidneys where mercury was most concentrated. In acute methyl mercury injection, no significant effect on PyDH or aKgDH activities was observed after 2 days. Less mercury was accumulated in the tissues with methyl mercury poisoning than in the other treatments. Am. J. Clin. Nwr. 31 : 859 - 864, 1978. It is well know that the symptoms of poisoning with organic <b>alkyl</b> <b>mercury</b> salts are chiefly neurological in nature, while symptoms from inorganic mercury and aryl compounds include chiefly salivation, sto-matitis, and renal malfunction. These differ...|$|E
40|$|Mercury (Hg) and {{selenium}} (Se) determinations {{were carried}} out to evaluate human exposure to those elements through fish consumption in Spain and Portugal. Atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (AFS) was applied in a cold vapor mode for total mercury quantification and was also hyphenated to gas chromatography (GC) to achieve the speciation of organomercurial species in fish samples. The results obtained show the highest concentration of Hg in swordfish and tuna (0. 47 +/- 0. 02 and 0. 31 +/- 0. 01 mug g(- 1), respectively), and a much lower concentration in sardine, mackerel shad, and octopus (0. 048 +/- 0. 002, 0. 033 +/- 0. 001, and 0. 024 +/- 0. 001 mug g(- 1), respectively). The determination of <b>alkyl</b> <b>mercury</b> compounds revealed that 93 - 98 % of mercury in the fish samples was in the organic form. Methylmercury (MeHg) was the only species found in the three fish species with higher mercury content. Total selenium concentration was high in sardine, swordfish, and tuna (0. 43 +/- 0. 02, 0. 47 +/- 0. 02, and 0. 92 +/- 0. 01 mug g(- 1), respectively), but low in mackerel shad and octopus (0. 26 +/- 0. 01 and 0. 13 +/- 0. 01 mug g(- 1), respectively). Speciation of selenium compounds was done by high-performance liquid chromatography in conjunction with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS). Selenomethionine (SeMet) was the only selenium compound identified in the fish samples with higher selenium content. Among the fish species studied, sardine had the most favourable Se:Hg and SeMet:MeHg molar ratios; therefore, its consumption seems to be preferable...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alkyl</b> {{derivatives}} of <b>mercury,</b> especially methylmercury, bring {{a significant}} {{risk to the}} environment and the human population. Methylmercury is highly toxic compound, which have the potential to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in tissues of aquatic organisms. This diploma thesis deals with issues of <b>alkyl</b> derivatives of <b>mercury</b> in biotic matrices. The goal of this thesis was to analyze fish tissues. Fish were caught from the river Svratka at the inflow and at the outflow of wastewater treatment plant. Methylmercury was determined in fish muscles and skin. Total mercury was determined in fish muscles. The extraction based on acidic digestion in hydrochloric acid and subsequent extraction with toluene was used for isolation of methylmercury from fish tissues. There was used gas chromatography with electron capture microdetector for determination of methylmercury. Total mercury was determined by special analyzer AMA 254...|$|R
40|$|THE BIOLOGICAL MONITORING IS ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING TOOLS FOR PERFORMING AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM OF PREVENTION FROM THE POTENTIALLY TOXIC EFFECTS OF CHE- MICALS IN OCCUPATIONAL ENVIRONMENT.

40|$|We found {{high levels}} of contaminants, in {{particular}} organochlorines, in eggs of the ivory gull Pagophila eburnea, a high Arctic seabird species threatened by climate change and contaminants. An 80 % decline in the ivory gull breeding population in the Canadian Arctic {{the last two decades}} has been documented. Because of the dependence of the ivory gull on sea ice and its high trophic position, suggested environmental threats are climate change and contaminants. The present study investigated contaminant levels (organochlorines, brominated flame retardants, perfluorinated <b>alkyl</b> substances, and <b>mercury)</b> in ivory gull eggs from four colonies in the Norwegian Svalbard) and Russian Arctic (Franz Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya). The contaminant levels presented here are among the highest reported in Arctic seabird species, and we identify this as an important stressor in a species already at risk due to environmental change...|$|R
