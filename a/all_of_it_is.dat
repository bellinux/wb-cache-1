5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built four {{dams and}} locks {{on the lower}} Snake River to {{facilitate}} shipping. The lower Columbia River has likewise been dammed for navigation. Thus a deep shipping channel through locks and slackwater reservoirs for heavy barges exists from the Pacific Ocean to Lewiston, Idaho. Most barge traffic originating on the Snake River goes to deep-water ports on the lower Columbia River, such as Portland. Grain, mostly wheat, is the main product shipped from the Snake, and nearly <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> exported internationally from the lower Columbia River ports.|$|E

Indeed, the first scholarly report on the battle, by James Henry Breasted in 1903, praised the sources that allowed the reconstruction of the battle with certainty. However, some historians argue that the battle was a draw at best and that Egyptian influence over Amurru and Qadesh seems to have been lost forever.|$|E
25|$|Transportation in North Dakota is {{overseen by}} the North Dakota Department of Transportation. The major Interstate {{highways}} are Interstate 29 and Interstate 94, with I-29 and I-94 meeting at Fargo, with I-29 oriented north to south along {{the eastern edge of}} the state, and I-94 bisecting the state from east to west between Minnesota and Montana. A unique feature of the North Dakota Interstate Highway system is virtually <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> paved in concrete, rather than blacktop, because of the extreme weather conditions it must endure. The largest rail systems in the state are operated by BNSF and the Canadian Pacific Railway. Many branch lines formerly used by BNSF and Canadian Pacific Railway are now operated by the Dakota, Missouri Valley and Western Railroad and the Red River Valley and Western Railroad.|$|E
25|$|Sakha can {{be divided}} into three great {{vegetation}} belts. About 40% of Sakha lies above the Arctic circle and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> covered by permafrost which greatly influences the region's ecology and limits forests in the southern region. Arctic and subarctic tundra define the middle region, where lichen and moss grow as great green carpets and are favorite pastures for reindeer. In {{the southern part of the}} tundra belt, scattered stands of dwarf Siberian pine and larch grow along the rivers. Below the tundra is the vast taiga forest region. Larch trees dominate in the north and stands of fir and pine begin to appear in the south. Taiga forests cover about 47% of Sakha and almost 90% of the cover is larch.|$|E

25|$|Burnt Fen {{is located}} near the eastern borders of Cambridgeshire, {{although}} parts of it are also located in Suffolk and Norfolk. It {{is an area of}} prime agricultural land, which is mostly below sea level, and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> below the normal flood levels of the rivers which surround it on three sides. These comprise the River Great Ouse (or Ten Mile River) on the north western edge, the River Little Ouse (or Brandon Creek) on the north eastern edge and the River Lark on the south western edge. The area is crossed by the A1101 Littleport to Mildenhall road, which runs broadly north west to south east, and the Ely to Norwich Railway, which runs from east to west. There are four hamlets within this area, Little Ouse, Shippea Hill, Sedge Fen and Mile End. Shippea Hill railway station was called Burnt Fen between 1885 and 1904.|$|E
25|$|The route {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with I-10 Bus. in Benson near an Amtrak station. The route heads south until it exits the city limit of Benson, where it turns slightly southeast. SR 80 turns eastward, entering St. David as Patton Street. In St. David, SR 80 turns south as Lee Street. SR 80 steers southeast into desert terrain, (south section San Pedro Valley), intersecting SR 82 {{just north of}} Tombstone, where SR 80 becomes Fremont Street. The road intersects SR 90 heading south. In Bisbee, (southern Mule Mountains), the road meets SR 92 at a traffic circle. SR 80 nears the international boundary with Mexico as it nears Douglas. A short concurrency begins where U.S. Route 191 turns eastward heading into Douglas. SR 80 turns north on Pan American Avenue away from US 191. The route then takes a more northeasterly route away from the international boundary. SR 80 heads through {{a long stretch of}} desert terrain, (San Bernardino Valley), before meeting New Mexico State Road 80 at the New Mexico state line. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> surface road, and it is the route of the Butterfield Stage Coach of the nineteenth century, and the Old Spanish Trail.|$|E
