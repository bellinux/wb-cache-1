40|$|Early {{events in}} {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) lesion formation are loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, immune cell trafficking {{into the central}} nervous system, and demyelination. To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathogenic events are poorly understood. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) is a trophic factor that is induced by inflammatory stimuli and has previously been shown to interact with tetraspanins (TSPs), a family of transmembrane proteins {{that are involved in}} cellular migration and adhesion. Given the known roles of <b>TSPs</b> <b>and</b> HB-EGF, we hypothesized that HB-EGF <b>and</b> <b>TSPs</b> {{may play a role in}} the processes that underlie MS lesion formation. We examined the expression of HB-EGF <b>and</b> the <b>TSPs</b> CD 9 <b>and</b> CD 81 in MS brain and found that HB-EGF was highly induced in reactive astrocytes in active lesions. TSPs were constitutively expressed throughout normal appearing white matter and control white matter. In contrast, CD 9 was reduced in demyelinated lesions and increased on blood vessels in lesion areas. In vitro studies revealed that expression of HB-EGF <b>and</b> <b>TSPs</b> is regulated during inflammation. Importantly, blocking either HB-EGF or CD 9 significantly reduced the migration of monocytes across brain endothelial cell monolayers. Moreover, blocking CD 9 strongly enhanced the barrier function of the BBB in vitro. Together, we demonstrate that these molecules are likely implicated in processes that are highly relevant for MS lesion formation, and therefore, HB-EGF <b>and</b> <b>TSPs</b> are promising therapeutic targets. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Tetraspanins {{are small}} {{membrane}} proteins {{that belong to}} a superfamily encompassing 33 members in human and mouse. These proteins act as organizers of membrane-signalling complexes. So far only two tetraspanin families {{have been identified in}} fungi. These are Pls 1, which is required for pathogenicity of the plant pathogenic ascomycetes, Magnaporthe grisea, Botrytis cinerea and Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, <b>and</b> <b>Tsp</b> 2, whose function is unknown. In this report, we describe a third family of tetraspanins (Tsp 3) and a new family of tetraspanin-like proteins (Tpl 1) in fungi. We also describe expression of some of these genes in M. grisea and a basidiomycete, Laccaria bicolor, and also their functional analysis in M. grisea. Results The exhaustive search for tetraspanins in fungal genomes reveals that higher fungi (basidiomycetes and ascomycetes) contain three families of tetraspanins (Pls 1, Tsp 2 <b>and</b> <b>Tsp</b> 3) with different distribution amongst phyla. Pls 1 is found in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, whereas Tsp 2 is restricted to basidiomycetes <b>and</b> <b>Tsp</b> 3 to ascomycetes. A unique copy of each of PLS 1 <b>and</b> <b>TSP</b> 3 was found in ascomycetes in contrast to TSP 2, which has several paralogs in the basidiomycetes, Coprinus cinereus and Laccaria bicolor. A tetraspanin-like family (Tpl 1) was also identified in ascomycetes. Transcriptional analyses in various tissues of L. bicolor and M. grisea showed that PLS 1 <b>and</b> <b>TSP</b> 2 are expressed in all tissues in L. bicolor and that TSP 3 and TPL 1 are overexpressed in the sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) and mycelia of M. grisea, suggesting that these genes are not pseudogenes. Phenotypic analysis of gene replacementmutants Δtsp 3 and Δtpl 1 of M. grisea revealed a reduction of the pathogenicity only on rice, in contrast to Δpls 1 mutants, which are completely non-pathogenic on barley and rice. Conclusion A new tetraspanin family (Tsp 3) and a tetraspanin-like protein family (Tpl 1) have been identified in fungi. Functional analysis by gene replacement showed that these proteins, as well as Pls 1, are involved in the infection process of the plant pathogenic fungus M. grisea. The next challenge will be to decipher the role(s) of tetraspanins in a range of symbiotic, saprophytic and human pathogenic fungi. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thrombospondin (TSP) 1 <b>and</b> <b>TSP</b> 2 {{have been}} implicated in the {{regulation}} of several processes during tissue repair. Due to their matricellular nature, these proteins are thought to modulate cell-matrix interactions {{through a variety of}} mechanisms specific to the spatio-temporal context of their expression. Most notably, TSP 1 <b>and</b> <b>TSP</b> 2 appear to play distinct, non-overlapping roles in the healing of skin wounds. In contrast, both proteins have been implicated as regulators of ischemia-induced angiogenesis. Moreover, TSP 2 {{has been shown to be}} a critical regulator of angiogenesis in the foreign body response (FBR). In this review, we discuss the role of TSPs in tissue repair and examine the mechanistic data regarding the ability of the thrombospondins to modulate cell-matrix interactions in this context...|$|E
40|$|Fumigation Process Fish on Fish Bandarharjo Fumigation Center, Semarang produce air pollution, {{especially}} Total Suspended Particulate (<b>TSP)</b> <b>and</b> PM 2. 5. This study aims {{to determine}} the concentration of <b>TSP</b> <b>and</b> PM 2. 5 {{in the process of}} production of large, medium, and small as well as the time division Weekdays and Weekend. The tools used in sampling the TSP is Dust Sampler DS 600 - MVS and for PM 2. 5 air sampling using the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) Particle Monitor. Stages of research conducted to identify the concentration of <b>TSP</b> <b>and</b> PM 2. 5, comparing the concentration at time Weekdays and Weekend and questionnaire analysis {{to determine the}} relationship due to contamination produced against the workers. The highest TSP concentration obtained is of 872. 877 µg/m 3, while for PM 2. 5 that is equal to 4018 µg/m 3. The presence of a strong relationship between the concentration of <b>TSP</b> <b>and</b> PM 2. 5 against contamination caused {{as a result of the}} evaporation process in this case relates to the health of workers...|$|R
40|$|Heuristics for the {{traveling}} salesman problem (TSP) have made remarkable advances in recent years. We survey the leading methods {{and the special}} components responsible for their successful implementations, together with an experimental analysis of computational tests on a challenging and diverse set of symmetric <b>and</b> asymmetric <b>TSP</b> benchmark problems. The foremost algorithms are represented by two families, deriving from the Lin-Kernighan (LK) method and the stem-and-cycle (S&C) method. We show how these families can be conveniently viewed within a common ejection chain framework which sheds light on their similarities and differences, and gives clues {{about the nature of}} potential enhancements to today's best methods that may provide additional gains in solving large <b>and</b> difficult <b>TSPs.</b> Traveling salesman problem Heuristics Ejection chains Local search...|$|R
