5|$|The {{study of}} glaciovolcanism {{is still a}} {{relatively}} new field. Early accounts described the unusual flat-topped steep-sided volcanoes (called tuyas) in Iceland that were suggested to have formed from eruptions below ice. The first English-language paper on the subject was published in 1947 by William Henry Mathews, describing the Tuya Butte field in northwest British Columbia, Canada. The eruptive process that builds these structures, originally inferred in the paper, begins with volcanic growth below the glacier. At first the eruptions resemble those {{that occur in the}} deep sea, forming piles of pillow lava {{at the base of the}} volcanic structure. Some of the lava shatters when it comes in contact with the cold ice, forming a glassy breccia called hyaloclastite. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> ice finally melts into a lake, and the more explosive eruptions of Surtseyan activity begins, building up flanks made up of mostly hyaloclastite. Eventually the lake boils off from continued volcanism, and the lava flows become more effusive and thicken as the lava cools much more slowly, often forming columnar jointing. Well-preserved tuyas show all of these stages, for example Hjorleifshofdi in Iceland.|$|E

25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> rage of the {{soldiers}} turned to thoughts of booty. Plate and jewels, stored gold and cunningly wrought tapestry fell prey to the victors. The men who were spared were stripped of their outer garments, and old Inigo Jones was carried out of the House wrapped in a blanket, because the spoilers had left him absolutely naked.|$|E

25|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} at the {{beginning}} of August in 1914, the common belief was, that the war would only last {{for a couple of months}} at most. The shipyard management did not expect to have many orders, and therefore reduced the headcount. But <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> order intake increased; the Imperial Russian Army ordered more vessels, ship repair projects and gave various other assignments. The earlier declared ban the Emipre had laid down towards orders from Finnish companies was practically omitted.|$|E
25|$|In one {{incident}} Jie was riding {{the back of}} a top chancellor like a horse. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> chancellor was tired to the point that he could no longer crawl or move.

Another chancellor, Guan Longfeng (關龍逢), told the king that he was losing the trust of his people along with the Xia dynasty’s rivers and mountains (江山). After yelling at Guan, he too was dragged out to be killed.|$|E

There, the expressway makes a curve to the northeast, crossing over Cordwood Lane on an overpass. The direction of the expressway begins to straighten, until exit5, where it encounters NY107. Soon after, the expressway comes upon exit6, which is for Boundary Avenue (CR 97), a connector to the nearby Bethpage State Parkway. From there, the expressway turns {{to the north and}} begins to parallel the Bethpage Parkway as it meets NY24 (Hempstead Turnpike).|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} {{the sheer number of}} dams in the project, more than would at first appear needed, is maintenance. Dams need to be cleaned from the debris carried with the water flow. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> dam becomes {{obsolete}} as water flow slows down to inadequate levels. The dams will be shut down every 5 to 10 years for fall maintenance (also called fall cleanup). Water levels are normally lowest in fall. The extra dams are placed in service during this maintenance period.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> {{intersection}} at {{the station}} proved to be hazardous, and the level crossing was closed. This caused many visitors to not {{find their way to}} the hospital. Visitors were therefore encouraged to instead use Frøen which, although further away, was easier to find. This led to the need for a new name for the station. The hospital was built on the grounds of a farm named Steinerud. The name was met with some opposition, as many locals preferred the more conservative form Stenerud. The station was upgraded in the 1970s with a standard concrete shed.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>the</b> {{old lady}} {{returned}} to the cave and noticed Yūkei's departure, whereupon her appearance transformed into that of a fearsome onibaba and then started to give chase at a furious speed. The onibaba caught up and was right behind Yūkei. In this time of desperation, Yūkei took out his statue of Nyoirin Kan'non Bosatsu (a form of Guanyin) from his pack and started to desperately chant a sutra. As he did so, the Bosatsu statue started to dance up into the sky, forming a shining demon-slaying pure white bow and a vajra (indestructible substance) arrow that shot and slew the onibaba.|$|E
50|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> since <b>the</b> {{television}} {{company that}} made the series needed an output of fifty-two episodes a year, the anime quickly outpaced the manga, meaning Tezuka also had to create many original stories that would {{not appear in the}} manga for the purpose of filling in the gaps.|$|R

In 1991, businessman Ebo Coker signed Yankson to his band Western Diamonds, after which he relocated to Takoradi where the band was based. Yankson left the band in 1993 after a successful stint and joined the Obuasi-based band Golden Nuggets. His move to Obuasi was influenced by the then-CEO of Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, Sam Jonah. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> band was moved to Accra, and in 1995 Yankson broke away and went solo.|$|E
25|$|The fortress' sole {{action with}} the German {{invasion}} forces came on 4 June 1940. Since early May German aircraft had overflown the area without incident, but on 4 June a single Luftwaffe bomber made an attack. The bomber missed its intended target, the radio station, but damaged {{the church and}} the commandant's quarters. After expending its bomb load the bomber went low and strafed the area, riddling the radio hut and other buildings with bullets. In response to the attack Corporal Olav Børve returned fire using the 65mm Hotchkiss gun with case-shot, firing 13 rounds. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> fortress' machine guns also fired back at the aircraft. With {{at least one of the}} case-shot rounds damaging the German bomber's hull it limped away from the area with a wounded navigator.|$|E
25|$|In September 1979, {{before the}} Olympics, the American team started {{exhibition}} play. They played {{a total of}} 61 games in five months against teams from Europe and America. Through these games, Herb Brooks instilled a European style of play in the American team, emphasizing wide open play with sufficient body contact. He believed {{it would be the}} only way for the Americans to compete with the Soviets. From the start of the exhibitions, he conducted the team through skating windsprints consisting of end line to blue line and back, then end line to red line and back, then end line to far blue line and back, and finally end line all the way down and back. Some of the players took to calling these Herbies. On September 17, 1979, the team played to a 3-3 tie in Norway. Brooks had them skate Herbies after the game, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>the</b> lights were turned off by custodians and the practice continued in the dark. Near the end of the exhibition season, although he had supported them throughout, Brooks threatened because of subpar play to cut Eruzione (the captain) and replace Craig as the starting goalie with Steve Janaszak.|$|E

25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>the</b> king sends {{his nephew}} Arthofilaus {{to demand that}} Galiene {{surrender}} the castle. She refuses, but they agree that if she can find a suitable knight, they will settle the dispute by single combat. Galiene soon regrets the deal, as she is {{unable to find a}} willing candidate among her men. She therefore sends her attendant, Arondele, to request a knight from Arthur at Carlisle. However, Arthur is unable to provide one because all of his knights are out searching for Fergus. Dejected, Arondele heads back to her mistress. On the way, she passes Melrose and relates the story to Fergus, before returning to Roxburgh. News of the attendant's failure brings Galiene to grief, because the combat must take place the following day. When the time arrives, Galiene prepares to throw herself from the castle tower. However, she catches sight of a shining shield in the distance. The mysterious knight slays Arthofilaus, and the king gives up his claim to Lothian. It is then that Galiene learns the identity of the knight, her lost love Fergus. By then, however, he had already departed.|$|E
