5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions {{were scheduled to}} be held before the Sunday race: two on Thursday and one on Friday. The first session was due to run for 105 minutes, and {{the second and third}} sessions were scheduled to last 90 minutes. Heavy rain on the days before the event resulted in the local clay absorbing a large amount of water. Only a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> had occurred due to low air temperatures. Race officials examined water that emerged through the track's surface in several areas on Thursday. The track surface had been drilled through overnight in an effort to drain collected water and prevent further seepage. CART's jet dryer was used on the track but, despite creating a dry track surface, water continued to appear through it. CART chief steward Chris Kneifel drove the pace car onto the track at 3:00p.m. British Summer Time (UTC+1) along with all 26 racing vehicles and 23 secondary cars under caution for five installation laps with both groups. No improvement was reported, and CART announced an hour later that the remainder of the day's activities were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{recharge}} water enters the aquifer is limited by several factors. Much of the plains region is semiarid, with steady winds that hasten evaporation of surface water and precipitation. In many locations, the aquifer is overlain, in the vadose zone, with a shallow layer of caliche that is practically impermeable; this limits {{the amount of water}} able to recharge the aquifer from the land surface. However, the soil of the playa lakes is different and not lined with caliche, making these some of the few areas where the aquifer can recharge. The destruction of playas by farmers and development decreases the available recharge area. The prevalence of the caliche is partly due to the ready evaporation of soil moisture and the semiarid climate; the aridity increases the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation,</b> which in turn increases the amount of caliche in the soil. Both mechanisms reduce the amount of recharge water that reaches the water table.|$|E
60|$|From this curious comparison, {{it becomes}} {{apparent}} that the variations {{of the difference in}} question depend upon the amount of variations of temperature which take place in the free air, and on the slowness with which such changes are communicated to the stagnant atmosphere of woods; in other words, as Herr Rivoli boldly formulates it, a forest is simply a bad conductor. But this is precisely the same conclusion as we have already arrived at with regard to individual trees; and in Herr Rivoli's table, what we see is just another case of what we saw in M. Becquerel's--the different progression of temperatures. It must be obvious, however, that the thermal condition of a single tree must be different in many ways from that of a combination of trees and more or less stagnant air, such as we call a forest. And accordingly we find, {{in the case of the}} latter, the following new feature: The mean yearly temperature of woods is lower than the mean yearly temperature of free air, while they are decidedly colder in summer, and very little, if at all, warmer in winter. Hence, on the whole, forests are colder than cleared lands. But this is just what might have been expected from the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation,</b> the continued descent of cold air, and its stagnation in the close and sunless crypt of a forest; and one can only wonder here, as elsewhere, that the resultant difference is so insignificant and doubtful.|$|E

5000|$|Precipitation in grasslands {{is equal}} to or less than {{evapotranspiration}} and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> causes buildup <b>of</b> calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.|$|R

50|$|By {{making a}} canal less permeable, the water {{velocity}} increases {{resulting in a}} greater overall discharge.

50|$|Natural {{circulation}} evaporators {{are based}} on the natural circulation of the product caused by the density differences that arise from heating.

40|$|Abstract. A new! 18 O map of {{southern}} Nevada groundwater shows a systematic decrease in! 18 O of! 5 ‰ from 36 " to 39 "N latitude. The variation {{is consistent with}} higher-latitude recharge following continuous flow paths along north-south trending graben valleys and systematically increasing in! 18 O due to mixing with lower-latitude, higher-! 18 O recharge. The data do not suggest that large masses of groundwater with unusually low! 18 O values were recharged during the last pluvial period as suggested by previous workers. Many! 18 O-!D pairs in groundwater indicate variable <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> relative to the global meteoric water line.

Dissolved inorganic carbon in groundwaters collected from deep regional flow systems typically has low 14 C concentrations (" 12 % modern carbon). In contrast, groundwaters collected from the carbonate rock of the Spring Mountains and alluvium of Forty Mile Canyon have higher 14 C contents, indicating more recent recharge. Because of nonlinear mixing of 14 C, groundwater in the regional flow system likely acquired most of its observable 14 C from mixtures of young, locally recharged groundwater. 1...|$|R

The poleward progression of coal deposits with time suggests that the regions of maximum rainfall shifted away from the equator. However, the employment coal as climatic indicator of precipitation is still employed with caution by geologists, as its creation is secondarily dependent on rainfall amounts. When a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> occurs, evaporites are formed, which therefore signifies arid conditions.|$|E
50|$|Potential {{evaporation}} {{or potential}} evapotranspiration (PET) {{is defined as}} the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> that would occur if a sufficient water source were available.

The test design selected for this experiment was a complete random design which was performed with 3 repetitions. Data analysis showed that the dried crop type factor, collector’s type and duration of sampling in crop’s water loss were significant at 1 % statistical level. Data showed that average water loss of spearmint crop was 6 % more than dill at each hour. This is because different physical and textural properties of plants. Also comparison <b>of</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> water <b>evaporation</b> in different durations for both iron and aluminum collectors showed that average <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> water <b>evaporation</b> in dryer with iron collector is 10 % more than the one with aluminum collector.

40|$|Arid {{areas have}} {{distinctive}} hydrological features substantially {{different from those}} of humid areas. The high temporal and spatial distribution of the ra;infall, flash floods, absence of base flow, sparsity of plant cover, high transmission losses, high <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> and evapotranspiration and the general climatologies are examples of such differences. The aim of this Ph. D. research is to use advanced tools of model analysis to test some of the current models that consider arid area hydrological characteristics. As most models were mainly developed for other regions, an attempt is made to study their limitations using Omani hydrological data, providing some guidelines for improved rainfall-runoff modelling in arid areas in general and Oman in particular. Two different types of models were selected for this research; KINEROS, which is an event based, semi-distributed, physically-based model that is considered suitable to be used for arid area conditions, and, which is continuous, lumped, conceptual model. Two Omani catchments were selected to test the performance of the selected models and to identify the main uncertainties arising, to provide some recommendations regarding the suitability of these models or model types and how they might be improved, to highlight any further data that is required, and how uncertainties should be handled in model applications.

50|$|Oxygen {{comes in}} three variants, but the 17O is so rare {{that it is}} very {{difficult}} to detect (~0.04% abundant). The ratio of 18O/16O in water depends on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> the water experienced (as 18O is heavier and therefore less likely to vaporize). As the vapor tension depends on the concentration of dissolved salts, the 18O/16O ratio shows correlation on the salinity and temperature of water. As oxygen gets built into the shells of calcium carbonate secreting organisms, such sediments prove a chronological record of temperature and salinity of the water in the area.|$|E

5000|$|Interception {{refers to}} {{precipitation}} {{that does not}} reach the soil, but is instead intercepted by the leaves, branches of plants and the forest floor. It occurs in the canopy (i.e. canopy interception), and in the forest floor or litter layer (i.e. forest floor interception [...] ). Because of evaporation, interception of liquid water generally leads to loss of that precipitation for the drainage basin, except for cases such as fog interception, but increase flood protection dramatically, Alila et al., (2009). Intercepted snowfall does not result in any notable <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation,</b> {{and most of the}} snow falls off the tree by wind or melts. However, intercepted snow can more easily drift with the wind, out of the watershed. Conifers have a greater interception capacity than hardwoods. Their needles gives them more surface area for droplets to adhere to, and they have foliage in spring and fall, therefore interception also depends on the type of vegetation in a wooded area.|$|E

For this period of the year, the late summer, when increasing variability in surface pressure starts occurring, the effect of different synoptic-scale regimes on the lake-atmosphere interface is investigated to understand the regional specificities, with comparisons to nearby stations and a high spatial and temporal resolution reanalysis model (North American Regional Reanalysis). The planetary boundary layer over the lake systematically shows typical surface and mixed layer structures but with varying depths depending on the mean lower tropospheric temperature. Inversions in the surface layer, linked with warm regimes, support deep mixed layers. Within the surface layer, during warm regimes, a superadiabatic lapse rate can support (or not) a higher-stability sublayer on top of it, in which case the mixed layer happens to be much deeper. The first mechanism for lake evaporation includes the occasional passage of synoptic-scale storm systems with both warm and cold frontal features creating strong, short-lived latent heat interactions between the lake and the atmosphere, but relatively low total <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation.</b> The main mechanism for extensive evaporation is a cold anticyclone allowing for significant daytime insolation.
