As the specimen holder is no longer driven, once dropped, the sample will slide on the concrete surface until it stops due to surface friction between it and the concrete surface.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to present the results of a special <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> of poly(vinyl chloride) and {{polypropylene}} filled with calcium carbonate pipes. Abrasion test’s results for pipes were compared with results of standard <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> (Taber method) and hardness test. Design/methodology/approach: Short cuts of pipe were subjected to erosion caused by erodent, usually a mixture of special kind of sand and water. The changes of pipe’s wall thickness was a measure of resistance to erosion. Additionally abrasion resistance was measured using Taber method and ball-hardness was measured using Brinell apparatus. Findings: Calcium carbonate filled polypropylene exhibited lower resistance to abrasion than hard poly(vinyl chloride). Probably it is the result of filler presence in polypropylene. No correlation between hardness and abrasion resistance was found. Research limitations/implications: Applied method may be used to compare different pipe’s materials but its results may not be applied to other plastics products and to other abrasion conditions. Practical implications: <b>Abrasion</b> <b>test</b> used in the research may be applied to compare different materials and different pipelines components. Achieved results showed that calcium carbonate without surface preparation decrease abrasion resistance of polypropylene. Originality/value: Applied method is rarely used for polymer materials testing. Results of presented research may be interesting for pipe manufactures and polymer pipe’s formulations producers...|$|E

30|$|The use of {{two-dimensional}} shape parameters {{to characterize}} abrasive particles {{is a potential}} approach to express their angularity. Nevertheless, in sliding abrasion, especially in pin <b>abrasion</b> <b>testing,</b> these descriptors could not be suitable for characterizing severe wear of engineering materials such as steels and cast irons. This work compares the applicability of two-dimensional shape parameters in describing severe wear of metals in recent pin <b>abrasion</b> <b>tests</b> with cases where {{they could have been}} correlated with the wear rates. Considering these aspects, this work puts in evidence the importance of clogging occurrence and the coated paper structure for a carefully application of shape parameters. In addition, it is proposed a possible relation between the shape parameters and one of the components of the abrasion factor.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT：A {{new piece}} of test equipment, the slurry wear tester (SWT), was {{proposed}} in this study to evaluate the wear behavior of rubber vulcanizate in environmental contact with slurry. Natural rubber (NR) and chloroprene rubber (CR) were chosen as the basic matrices to test the slurry wear. The fluids used to fill the chamber of the SWT were 35 % HCl and NaCl solution. The Akron <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> was used for comparison with SWT. According {{to the results of}} the Akron <b>abrasion</b> <b>test,</b> CR vulcanizate abraded more rapidly than NR vulcanizate under same test condition. It was found that the hysteresis of rubber was key factor contribute to the wear behavior. However, the slurry wear rate of the NR and CR vulcanizates did not change significantly, even with changes in the concentration of acid and the immersion time in both HCl and NaCl solutions; the fluid decreased the friction between the abrasive paper and the specimen. It also reduced the heat generated from repeated deformation and wear debris at the surface of the SWT's abrasion arm. Thus, these phenomena affected the wear behavior of rubber vulcanizate and caused different results in the conventional Akron <b>abrasion</b> <b>test.</b> This outcome could have resulted in an incorrect analysis if the slurry wear behavior of the rubber vulcanizat...|$|E

The dry sand-rubber wheel <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> (DSRW test) is an approved ASTM test designed primarily for testing metals, therefore, in this study the set of test conditions was optimized for use with polyurethane elastomers. The wear performance of polyurethanes was assessed for the range of Shore hardness 85 A to 65 D, and a correlation was identified between the wear rate and the sample hardness. Polyurethane elastomers can be separated into three classes according to their hardness and wear performance, and each class shows a different dependence on the specimen temperature. This work has implications {{for use of the}} DSRW test for the prediction of field performance of polyurethanes. (C) Elsevier Science S. A...|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} mainly {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} different <b>tests</b> on the <b>abrasion</b> resistance of concrete mixed with steel fibers and silica fume. The abrasion resistance was assessed at 28, 56 and 91 days on concretes with water-binder ratios of 0. 35 and 0. 55 where in some mixes silica fume was substituted by 5 % of cement by weight. Steel fibers of 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % of concrete volume were also added into the test concrete by replacement of coarse and fine aggregates. The results showed that concrete with higher compressive strength in Los Angeles <b>abrasion</b> <b>tests</b> also had better abrasion resistance. The inclusion of steel fibers into test concrete with a water-binder ratio of 0. 35 resulted in {{a significant increase in}} compressive strength. This concrete also displayed better abrasion resistance and splitting tensile strength than reference concrete; in the test sample with a water-binder ratio of 0. 55, the added steel fibers was unable to effectively produce cementation with the concrete. The inclusion of silica fume improved the abrasion resistance of concretes. In water <b>abrasion</b> <b>testing,</b> the <b>abrasion</b> resistance of concrete containing steel fiber was worse than that of concrete without steel fibers. In the water <b>abrasion</b> <b>testing,</b> the surface of steel fiber reinforced concrete was eroded by water and steel balls, and the impact caused the steel fibers to separate from the concrete and led to higher wear loss.

40|$|BHP Billiton Iron Ore is in {{the process}} of {{selecting}} wear liners for installation in their transfer chutes. Wear liners are chosen to maximise service life, while minimising maintenance costs and downtime.

40|$|Background: A bitemark can {{be defined}} as an injury on the skin or an object, caused by the tooth {{surfaces}} of a human or animal. Both loss of epithelium (abrasion) and bruising (haematoma) on skin can be seen after a bitemark injury. Earlier studies have shown that abrasions have a more distinctive healing pattern than bruises, which are harder to time. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} examine if it was possible to timeframe bitemarks and what restrictions these kinds of registration have. Then we compared our findings with the literature. Material and Methods: We did two experiments, one <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> and one bruise test. Two subjects did the <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> with a pen tip on the forearm. The healing period was 14 days (subject 1) and 49 days (subject 2). One subject carried out the bruise test, with healing after approximately 13 days. We used camera in daylight and a ruler. Photographs were taken with both normal colour function and black and white. Result: We then studied the literature findings about healing and concluded that our discoveries corresponded well to the literature, although there was a great difference in healing time between the test subject 1 and 2 in the <b>abrasion</b> <b>test.</b> Reason for inequalities can be many, for instance differences in size of the abrasion (depth/force) and physiological factors such as how the body response to injury. According to the literature abrasions heal after 3 - 4 weeks and bruises after about 13 days. Conclusion: Abrasion healing had specific phases that could be followed, while bruises varied. It was easier to determine the abrasion compared to the bruise. This is because there are several variables that can affect the appearance of a bruise...|$|E

The utilized commercial brands were Dyract (Dentsply), Dyract AP (Dentsply), Compoglass F (Vivadent), Freedom (SDI), F 2000 (3 M ESPE), which were compared to the two resin composites Z 100 (3 M ESPE) and Silux Plus (3 M ESPE). Ten cylindrical specimens for each commercial brand were prepared with 5 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness. An appropriate machine with soft bristle tips containing dentifrice solution and deionized water was used. A total of 100, 000 brushing cycles were performed. The amount of weight loss was measured by the percentage alteration between the initial (before toothbrushing) and final weight (after toothbrushing), measured by a Sartorius analytical balance. The surface roughness change was determined by the percentage difference between initial and final means after 5 tracings by a T 1000 Hommel Tester roughness meter on the specimen's surfaces before and after toothbrushing <b>abrasion</b> <b>test.</b> The statistical analysis (Students paired t-test, ANOVA and Tukey, á= 0. 05) showed that all materials presented statistically significant weight loss and roughness increase after <b>abrasion</b> <b>test.</b> All compomers presented higher weight loss than resin composites.
