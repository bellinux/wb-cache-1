5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> kidney disease. To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E
5|$|The film's soundtrack {{consists}} {{almost entirely}} of pre-World War I 78 rpm recordings of opera arias sung by the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been used before in his work <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> social class, such as in Husbands and Wives (1992). In Match Point, the arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on {{the actions of the}} characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasises his detachment from his crime.|$|E
5|$|The {{innovations}} of Andriamasinavalona {{were numerous}} and enduring. He created two additional noble castes and defined their associated rights, responsibilities and restrictions, and {{was responsible for}} introducing {{the tradition of the}} red parasol <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> royalty; he also decreed that all women had the right to choose their husbands. Trade with the Sakalava kingdom enabled this king to increase the firearms, cannons and gunpowder available for the defense of the kingdom, and expanded the availability of luxury items like silver piastres and porcelain dishes. The dikes around the Betsimitatatra rice fields of Antananarivo were expanded and raised to help ensure against famine.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest between the two sides of a village (East and West) was seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Between {{these two}} systems, {{that of the}} {{political}} order predominates in the layout of Ambohimanga, and the sacredness {{of the city was}} historically more explicitly associated with its role as a political rather than an astrological center. The forbidding of foreigners from the site in the 19th century, for instance, was enacted to preserve the sanctity of the social and political order, rather than the religious order. By respecting these systems of symbolism, successive rulers sought to ensure the benediction of the ancestors, strengthen the legitimacy of their rule and ensure the protection and stability of their kingdom. However, adherence to cardinal division and symbolism of space is weaker at Ambohimanga than its embodiment of the significance of vertical space and elevation <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> rank. The site of each new compound within the royal city was selected less for its cardinal direction than for {{the extent to which it}} was located on higher ground than the compound that predated it.|$|E
5|$|Geopyxis carbonaria is {{widespread}} on burned soil or charcoal {{in the spring}} and throughout the growing season. It {{is one of the most}} common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> imminent morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G.carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.|$|E

5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> adult sexual preference.|$|E
5|$|In a {{small sample}} of 11 {{deceased}} dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7years (maximum 15.9yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41years {{with a standard deviation of}} 2.36years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.|$|E
5|$|The grandsons are {{depicted}} {{in very different}} styles: Alessandro acts in a formal manner and wears clothes of similar colour and tones to Paul. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, {{an area of the}} painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is awkward and difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Alessandro has a distracted, brooding expression. He holds the knob of Paul's backrest, in an echo of Raphael's portrait where Clement VII holds the chair of Leo X <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> his ambitions of succession. Thus Alessandro seems better placed politically, standing to Paul's right in a pose that recalls traditional depictions of Paul the Apostle, and his hand is raised as if in blessing. In the end, Paul was unable to influence his succession after Charles V weakened the Medici hold on the office.|$|E
