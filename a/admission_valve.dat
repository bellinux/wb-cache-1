50|$|As {{with all}} steam engines where the cutoff can be regulated, {{the virtue of}} doing so {{lies in the fact}} that most of the power stroke is powered by the {{expansion}} of steam in the cylinder after the <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> has closed. This comes far closer to the ideal Carnot cycle than is possible with an engine where the <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> is open for the length of the power stroke and speed is regulated by a throttle valve.|$|E
5000|$|During A.G. Watson’s term as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1929 to 1936, {{many of the}} Classes 8 to 8F {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} superheated boilers, larger bore cylinders and either inside or outside admission piston valves. The outside <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> locomotives had their cylinder bore increased from 18+1/2 to 19 in and retained their existing SAR classifications, while the inside <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> locomotives had their cylinder bore increased to 20 in and were reclassified by having a [...] "W" [...] suffix added to their existing SAR classifications.|$|E

5000|$|In small sizes (less {{than about}} [...] ), {{reciprocating}} steam engines {{are much more}} efficient than steam turbines. White Cliffs Solar Power Station used a three-cylinder uniflow engine with [...] "Bash"-type <b>admission</b> <b>valves</b> to generate about 25 kW electrical output.|$|R
50|$|While the Class 10 had outside <b>admission</b> <b>valves,</b> the Class 10-2 {{saturated}} used inside <b>admission</b> piston <b>valves.</b> Two Trevithick {{exhaust steam}} feedwater heaters were {{mounted on the}} running boards {{on either side of}} the smokebox above the cylinders and a Weir's feedwater pump was mounted on the left-hand side of the firebox. Each feedwater heater cylinder was of 1 ft external diameter and 5 ft between tube plates, and contained 108 3/4 in external diameter brass tubes. The feedwater heaters and the feedwater pump were removed after a few years since the feedwater heater tubes proved to be troublesome to clean.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fraction}} of the stroke in which the <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> is open on a steam engine is termed the cutoff. On the WHE-25 it is 34% of the stroke. [...] From top dead center to 34% of stroke, the crank turns through an angle of about 71°. In the six cylinder engine, one piston reaches top dead center every 360°/6 = 60°. The three cylinder WHE-DR engine only has a piston reach TDC every 120°, so its <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> must be open over a much larger angle to ensure the engine is self-starting. If the valve is open for 130° of crankshaft rotation, the cutoff value would be about 64%.|$|E
50|$|A {{development}} {{introduced in}} the 1950s was the direct <b>admission</b> <b>valve,</b> fitted to every brake cylinder. These valves responded to a rise in train pipe pressure as the brake was applied, and admitted atmospheric air directly to {{the underside of the}} brake cylinder.|$|E
50|$|The {{speed of}} a Corliss engine is {{controlled}} by varying the cutoff of steam during each power stroke, while leaving the throttle wide open at all times. To accomplish this, the centrifugal governor is linked {{to a pair of}} cams, one for each <b>admission</b> <b>valve.</b> These cams determine the point during the piston stroke that the pawl will release, allowing that valve to close.|$|E

5000|$|A common {{feature of}} large Corliss engines is {{one or two}} sets of narrow gear teeth in {{the rim of the}} {{flywheel}}. These teeth allow the flywheel to be barred, that is, turned {{with the aid of a}} crowbar. [...] This may be needed during engine maintenance, for example, to set the cutoff and <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> timing, and it may be needed during engine starting.|$|E
5000|$|The piston {{assembly}} {{is an even}} number of pistons arranged radially around a single crankshaft. The pistons {{are attached to the}} crankshaft via a special [...] "spider" [...] bearing. This bearing consists of several small journal bearings attached to a disk which has a larger crankshaft journal bearing in the center. Each piston has one head <b>admission</b> <b>valve.</b> This valve is actuated by a variable cam on the crankshaft, and allows for the entrance of supercritical water into the cylinder. As the supercritical water enters the cylinder it flashes into steam and pushes the piston inward, thus rotating the crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|The steam {{produced}} in the boilers travelled at great pressure (38 kg/cm²) to the turbo-alternator sets, which transformed the steam’s thermal energy into mechanical energy through the turbine, which in turn transformed it into electric energy upon exiting the alternator. The generating sets were composed of a turbine and an alternator, thus the name turbo-alternator. The turbine had eight wheels with two crowns with blades, and the other seven only one crown. The steam coming from the boilers entered the turbine’s distribution box through the <b>admission</b> <b>valve.</b> From the box, with the aperture controlled by the nozzles’ valves and by undergoing the Venturi effect, the steam entered the first wheel with a high enough flow rate to get the turbine to 3000 rpm. The steam’s pressure gradually decreased in the next wheels until it equalled the condenser’s pressure, although its exchange speed remained constant.|$|E

40|$|Gas <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> is {{strategically}} {{important component}} on gas engine. Short response time, large flow rate capacity through the valve, {{ability to work}} at large pressure difference and fault tolerant are characteristics that a good valve should be fulfilled. The solenoid based gas <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> used at the moment has short response time and large flow rate capacity but the main problem is that if pressure difference over the valve is too large, the valve will not open. The goal of this thesis is to design, model and simulate a new gas <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> which utilizes the principle of digitalization. The application of the thesis is an intake valve which has been integrated gas flow edges. Through the flow edges the gas flows into the engine’s cylinder. The control of the intake valve is realized by using digital hydraulics. The second application of the thesis is digital pneumatic gas <b>admission</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve is realized by using binary coded digital flow control unit. As the results show, digital hydraulic intake air valve with gas flow edges is a realistic construction.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} layered neural networks to nonlinear power systems control. A single generator unit feeds a power line to various users whose power demand can vary over time. As a consequence of load variations, {{the frequency of the}} generator changes over time. A feedforward neural network is trained to control the steam <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> of the turbine that drives the generator, thereby restoring the frequency to its nominal value. Frequency transients are minimized and zero steady-state error is obtained. The same technique is then applied to control a system composed of two single units tied together through a power line. Electric load variations can happen independently in both units. Both neural controllers are trained with the backpropagation-through-time algorithm. Use of a neural network to model the dynamic system is avoided by introducing the Jacobian matrices of the system in the backpropagation chain used in controller training.

40|$|A control-oriented {{dynamics}} simulator for a Generation IV Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) demonstrator (DEMO) {{has been}} developed aimed at providing a flexible, simple and fastrunning tool allowing to perform design-basis transient and stability analyses, and to lay the foundations {{for the study of}} the system control strategy. For such purposes, a model representing a compromise between accuracy and straightforwardness has been necessarily sought, and in this view an object-oriented approach based on the Modelica language has been adopted. The reactor primary and secondary systems have been implemented by assembling both component models already available in a specific thermal-hydraulic library, and ad hoc developed nuclear component models suitably modified according to the specific DEMO configuration. The resulting overall plant simulator, incorporating also the balance of plant, consists in the following essential parts: core, integrated steam generator/primary pump block, cold and hot legs, primary coolant cold pool, turbine, heat sink, secondary coolant pump. Afterwards, the reactor response to typical transient initiators has been investigated: feedwater mass flow rate and temperature enhancement, turbine <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> coefficient variation, increase of primary coolant mass flow rate, and transient of overpower have been simulated; results have been compared with the outcomes of analogous analyses performed by employing a lumped-parameter DEMO plant model...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we are {{studying}} an innovative solution {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and production cost for electricity production by Diesel generators. The solution is particularly suitable for remote {{areas where the}} cost of energy is very high not only because of inherent cost of technology but also due to transportation costs. It has significant environmental benefits as the use of fossil fuels for electricity generation is a significant source of GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions. The use of hybrid systems that combine renewable sources, especially wind, and Diesel generators, reduces fuel consumption and operation cost and has environmental benefits. Adding a storage element to the hybrid system increases the penetration level of the renewable sources, that is the percentage of renewable energy in the overall production, and further improves fuel savings. In a previous work, we demonstrated that CAES (Compressed Air Energy Storage) has numerous advantages for hybrid wind-diesel systems due to its low cost, high power density and reliability. The pneumatic hybridization of the Diesel engine consists to introduce the CAES through the <b>admission</b> <b>valve.</b> We have proven that we can improve the combustion efficiency and therefore the fuel consumption by optimizing Air/Fuel ratio thanks to the CAES assistance. As a continuation of these previous analyses, we studied the effect of the intake pressure and temperature and the exhaust pressure on the thermodynamic cycle of the diesel engine and determined the values of these parameters that will optimize fuel consumption...|$|E
40|$|Three {{methods were}} {{utilized}} to analyze {{key components of}} slow-speed, large-bore, natural gas integral engines. These three methods included the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), dynamic modal analysis using finite element analysis (FEA), and a stress analysis method also using FEA. The CFD analysis focuses primarily on the fuel mixing in the combustion chamber of a TLA engine. Results indicate {{a significant increase in}} the homogeneity of the air and fuel using high-pressure fuel injection (HPFI) instead of standard low-pressure mechanical gas <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> (MGAV). A modal analysis of three engine crankshafts (TLA- 6, HBA- 6, and GMV- 10) is developed and presented. Results indicate that each crankshaft has a natural frequency and corresponding speed that is well away from the typical engine operating speed. A frame stress analysis method is also developed and presented. Two different crankcases are examined. A TLA- 6 crankcase is modeled and a stress analysis is performed. The method of dynamic load determination, model setup, and the results from the stress analysis are discussed. Preliminary results indicate a 10 %- 15 % maximum increase in frame stress due to a 20 % increase in HP. However, the high stress regions were localized. A new hydraulically actuated mechanical fuel valve is also developed and presented. This valve provides equivalent high-energy (supersonic) fuel injection comparable to a HPFI system, at 1 / 5 th of the natural gas fuel pressure. This valve was developed in cooperation with the Dresser-Rand Corporation...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a control-oriented {{modelling}} and simulation {{tool for}} the study of the Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED) plant dynamics is presented. It has been developed in order to perform design-basis transient analyses aimed at providing essential feedbacks for the system design finalization. The simulator has been meant to be modular, open and efficient. In this perspective, an object-oriented modelling approach has been adopted, by employing the reliable, tested and well documented Modelica language. Simulation of core behaviour is based on point kinetics for neutronics and one-dimensional heat transfer models for thermal-hydraulics, coherently with ALFRED specifications. An effort has been spent to model the bayonet-tube Steam Generator (SG) foreseen to be installed within the reactor vessel. The primary loop model has been built by connecting the above-mentioned components (taking into account suitable time delays) and by incorporating the cold pool, which has revealed to be fundamental for an accurate definition of the time constants characteristic of the system because of its large thermal inertia. The description of the overall plant has been finalized by connecting standard turbine, condenser and other components of the balance of plant. Afterwards, the reactor responses to three typical transient initiators have been simulated (i. e., reduction of feedwater mass flow rate, variation of the turbine <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> coefficient and transient of overpower). Simulation outcomes confirm the strong coupling between core and SG, besides showing the characteristic time constants of the various component responses. Results of the present study constitute a starting point in the definition of plant control strategies, laying the basis for investigation and development of a model-based control-system design...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{development}} of a control-oriented dynamics simulator for a Generation IV Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) demonstrator has been undertaken aimed at providing a very flexible and straightforward – though accurate – fast-running tool allowing to perform transient design-basis and stability analyses, and laying the foundations {{for the study of the}} system control strategy. The simulator, realized in the MATLAB/SIMULINK® environment, is composed of five essential parts: core, steam generator, primary pump, collectors, and coolant cold pool. An analytical lumped-parameter core model has been developed to treat the coupling between neutronics and thermal-hydraulics. For the steam generator a moving boundary approach has been adopted, allowing to get the physical behavior while satisfying the controller specifications, besides assuring coherence with the zero-dimensional core modeling. The complete primary loop model has been assembled by connecting the above-mentioned main subsystems through the hot and cold collectors, and by adding the remaining components blocks. Five different transients have been then simulated to analyze the whole system dynamic behavior in a control-oriented perspective: three scenarios have been initiated by acting on the secondary water side (i. e., enhancement of feedwater mass flow rate and temperature, and turbine <b>admission</b> <b>valve</b> coefficient variation), and two by perturbing the primary side nominal state (i. e., simulations of Unprotected Loss of Flow, ULOF, and of Unprotected Transient of OverPower, UTOP).
