Interestingly, this robust model {{also includes the}} binodal curve over the range of T and P so determined. An additional validation from the spinodal for methane is {{in comparison with the}} recent work of Aursand et al. [1]. In their work, they used the PR-EOS to determine the spinodal point by drawing an isotherm for methane liquid at 175  K and obtained a P value of 1.13  MPa at a density of 236.1  kg/m 3. Our PR-EOS prediction of spinodal <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>T</b> and density is 1.1626  MPa, as can be read off from Fig.  8, is almost in perfect agreement with theirs.

Furthermore, the robustness of our model is demonstrated in the fact that it predicts the spinodal T and P over a wide range. A robust model by Aursand et al.
