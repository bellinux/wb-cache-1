5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Link and Zelda {{was quite different}} from earlier incarnations, in particular the fact that Zelda was {{not a member of}} royalty. According to Aonuma, a recurring difficulty was how contrived the necessity for Link to rescue Zelda became with each passing installment, as their contact may only have been fleeting beforehand. In response to this, the team considered how to make the player care about Zelda and want to rescue her. Having the two characters as childhood friends both served this purpose and cut down on extraneous plot elements. They continued to encourage the player by having Link only just miss her on her early travels across the Surface. Mischievous elements were also added to Zelda's personality by her pushing Link over an ledge: initially intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> three-style gag, it was cut down to two during development. The figure of Hylia was a new addition to the world's lore, although her existence was linked to Zelda, with the two being essentially the same character known under different names in subsequent ages. Groose, who acted as Link's rival, was introduced to make the story more interesting within the school setting. Groose's maturation {{during the course of the}} story was intended to help convey Link's parallel growth as a character as he was otherwise mute and static.|$|E

5000|$|The {{deduction}} <b>rule</b> is <b>an</b> important {{property of}} Hilbert-style systems because {{the use of}} this metatheorem leads to much shorter proofs than would be possible without it. Although the deduction theorem could be taken <b>as</b> <b>a</b> primitive <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> inference in such systems, this approach is not generally followed; instead, the deduction theorem is obtained <b>as</b> <b>an</b> admissible <b>rule</b> using the other logical axioms and modus ponens. In other formal proof systems, the deduction theorem is sometimes taken <b>as</b> <b>a</b> primitive <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> inference. For example, in natural deduction, the deduction theorem is recast <b>as</b> <b>an</b> introduction <b>rule</b> for [...] "→".|$|R

25|$|After a vaginal delivery, without complications, {{three weeks}} is usually {{sufficient}} {{to allow the}} cervix to close, which {{reduces the risk of}} uterine infection.

50|$|This can be {{expressed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> simple <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> thumb:For every 1 °C difference in the dew point and dry bulb temperatures, the relative humidity decreases by 5%, starting with RH = 100% when the dew point equals the dry bulb temperature.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> thumb, {{senior debt}} usually has {{interest}} margins of 3–5% (on top of Libor or Euribor) {{and needs to}} be paid back over a period of 5 to 7 years; junior debt has margins of 7–16%, {{and needs to be}} paid back in one payment (as bullet) after 7 to 10 years. Junior debt often additionally has warrants and its interest is often all or partly of PIK nature.|$|E
25|$|Under {{standard}} conditions, from CH4 to C4H10 alkanes are gaseous; from C5H12 to C17H36 {{they are}} liquids; and after C18H38 they are solids. As {{the boiling point}} of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, {{it should not be}} a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size (molecular weight) of the molecule. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> thumb, the boiling point rises 20–30°C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.|$|E
25|$|The primary way of {{managing}} the symptoms of lactose intolerance is to limit the intake of lactose to a level that can be tolerated. Lactase deficient individuals vary {{in the amount of}} lactose they can tolerate, and some report that their tolerance varies over time, depending on health status and pregnancy. However, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> thumb, people with primary lactase deficiency and no small intestine injury are usually able to consume at least 12 grams of lactose per sitting without symptoms, or with only mild symptoms, with greater amounts tolerated if consumed with a meal or throughout the day.|$|E
