40|$|Many {{diagrams}} conventionally used {{to classify}} igneous rocks utilize mobile elements, which commonly renders them unreliable for classifying rocks from the geological record. The K 2 O^SiO 2 diagram, used to subdivide volcanic arc rocks into rock type (basalts, basaltic andesites, andesites, dacites and rhyolites) and volcanic series (tholeiitic, calc-alkaline, high-K calc-alkaline and shoshonitic), is particularly {{susceptible to the}} effects of alteration. However, by usingTh as a proxy for K 2 O and Co as a proxy for SiO 2 it is possible to construct a topologically similar diagram that performs the same task but is more robust for weathered and metamorphosed rocks.

40|$|We {{study the}} arc {{statistics}} of gravitational lensing due to dark matter halos {{in order to}} probe their density profile. More specifically, we characterize the halo profile by two parameters, the inner slope of the central cusp α, and the median amplitude of the concentration parameter, c_ norm, for a halo of mass 10 ^ 14 h^- 1 M_ at z= 0, and compute the numbers of tangential and radial arcs produced by gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters.

If the <b>arc</b> <b>samples</b> with well-defined selection criterion for the clusters are available, we can strongly constrain both c_ norm and α.

40|$|We have {{undertaken}} a spectroscopic survey of gravitational arcs in a carefully chosen sample of six clusters each containing a dominant brightest cluster galaxy. We use these systems {{to study the}} relative distributions of dark and baryonic material in the central regions. Three clusters present both radial and tangential arcs and provide particularly strong constraints on the mass profiles, whereas the other three display only tangential arcs and act as a control set. Following Sand et al. (2002), we analyze stellar velocity dispersion data for the brightest cluster galaxies {{in conjunction with the}} arc redshifts and lens models to constrain the dark and baryonic mass profiles jointly. For the systems containing radial arcs we find that the inner dark matter density profile is consistent with a 3 -(68 % CL). Similarly, we find that the tangential <b>arc</b> <b>sample</b> gives an upper limit, β 99 % confidence. In addition, we find considerable cosmic scatter in the β (∆β ∼ 0. 3) values of the radial <b>arc</b> <b>sample.</b> We find no evidence that systems with radial arcs preferentially yield flatter dark matter profiles as might be expected if they were a biased subset.

40|$|The {{assemblage}} of ca. 6 – 4 Ma volcanic rocks exposed at the Sagehen Research {{station in the}} Truckee-Tahoe region of the northern Sierra Nevada, United States, is interpreted to be, within the Ancestral Cascades volcanic arc, a Lassen-type stratovolcano complex. Sagehen is of particular importance because {{it is one of}} the few Tertiary arc volcanic centres in California which has not been heavily glaciated during the Pleistocene. The volcanic rocks are variably porphyritic or aphanitic, including abundant plagioclase with clinopyroxene and amphibole. The rocks range from basalt to basaltic-andesite to andesite in composition. Basalts are olivineand clinopyroxene-bearing with minor phenocrysts of plagioclase. The basaltic-andesites are primarily pyroxene bearing while the andesites contain pyroxene-, plagioclase- and hornblende porphyritic phases. Sagehen arc lavas are calc-alkaline and enriched in the large ion lithophile elements and depleted in High Field Strength Elements. The basalts are depleted in Zr and Hf while the andesites are enriched with Zr and Hf relative to the middle rare earth elements. Compared to previously studied Ancestral Cascade <b>arc</b> <b>samples,</b> Sagehen region basalts have lower 143 Nd/ 144 Nd isotopic values that do not correspond to proposed mantle-lithosphere mixing lines, while the andesite samples appear to represent the interplay of these two components on a 87 Sr/ 86 Sr vs. 143 Nd/ 144 Nd. The trace element data and isotopic plots suggest that the melts that produced the basalts are from subduction modified mantle wedge peridotites that ponded near the base of the lithosphere similar to the generation of other subduction related calc-alkaline lavas along convergent continental margins. The andesitic samples appear to be the result of further modification through crustal assimilation as seen in the higher isotopic Sr contents in the andesites and Ce/Smpmn vs. Tb/Ybpmn plots. Finally, the proposed map units from Sylvester & Raines (2007) were found to contain various geochemical facies based on the samples collected indicating that some map units may have to be redefined or sub-divided...|$|E

The United States, considered nonendemic for T. cruzi, could therefore {{be at risk}} to exposure to parasite transmission through blood or organ donations. Current tests show variable reactivity, especially with Central American sera. Here we describe {{the development of a}} lateral flow immunoassay for the rapid detection of T. cruzi infection that has a strong correlation to the radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) “gold standard” in the United States. Such a test could have utility in small blood banks for prescreening donors, as well as in cardiac transplantation evaluation. T. cruzi consensus and/or RIPA-positive sera from Central and South America were evaluated in enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). These included commercial panels from Boston Biomedica, Inc. (BBI) (n = 14), and HemaBio (n = 21). Other sources included RIPA-positive sera from the American Red Cross (ARC) (n = 42), as well as from Chile. Sera were tested with the multiepitope recombinant TcF. All but one of the BBI samples were positive and 7 of 21 HemaBio samples and 6 of 42 <b>ARC</b> <b>samples</b> were low positive or negative.

40|$|Crustal {{assimilation}} (e. g. Hildreth and Moorbath, 1988) and/or subduction erosion (e. g. Stern, 1991; Kay et al., 2005) {{are believed}} to control the geochemical variations along the northern portion of the Chilean Southern Volcanic Zone. In order to evaluate these hypotheses, we present a comprehensive geochemical data set (major and trace elements and O-Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotopes) from Holocene primarily olivine-bearing volcanic rocks across the arc between 34. 5 - 38. 0 °S, including volcanic front centers from Tinguiririca to Callaqui, the rear arc centers of Infernillo Volcanic Field, Laguna del Maule and Copahue, and extending 300 km into the backarc. We also present an equivalent data set for Chile Trench sediments outboard of this profile. The volcanic arc (including volcanic front and rear <b>arc)</b> <b>samples</b> primarily range from basalt to andesite/trachyandesite, whereas the backarc rocks are low-silica alkali basalts and trachybasalts. All samples show some characteristic subduction zone trace element enrichments and depletions, but the backarc samples show the least. Backarc basalts have higher Ce/Pb, Nb/U, Nb/Zr, and Ta/Hf, and lower Ba/Nb and Ba/La, consistent with less of a slab-derived component in the backarc and, consequently, lower degrees of mantle melting. The mantle-like δ 18 O in olivine and plagioclase phenocrysts (volcanic arc = 4. 9 - 5. 6 and backarc = 5. 0 - 5. 4 per mil) and lack of correlation between δ 18 O and indices of differentiation and other isotope ratios, argue against significant crustal assimilation. Volcanic arc and backarc samples almost completely overlap in Sr and Nd isotopic composition. High precision (double-spike) Pb isotope ratios are tightly correlated, precluding significant assimilation of older sialic crust but indicating mixing between a South Atlantic Mid Ocean-Ridge Basalt (MORB) source and a slab component derived from subducted sediments and altered oceanic crust. Hf-Nd isotope ratios define separate linear arrays for the volcanic arc and backarc, neither of which trend toward subducting sediment, possibly reflecting a primarily asthenospheric mantle array for the volcanic arc and involvement of enriched Proterozoic lithospheric mantle in the backarc. We propose a quantitative mixing model between a mixed-source, slab-derived melt and a heterogeneous mantle beneath the volcanic arc. The model is consistent with local geodynamic parameters, assuming water-saturated conditions within the slab...|$|E

The occurrence of such a burst was inferred from light signals detected by two Vela bhangmeters −2 min before the TIROS-N event. We found the precipitation to be unusually large but not unique. It probably resulted from passage of TIROS-N through the precipitating electrons above a pre-existing auroral arc that may have brightened to an unusually high intensity from natural causes −3 min before the Vela signals....We conclude that such an event, although rare, is not unique and, furthermore, that this particular event was associated with an auroral arc that probably existed before the Vela event.

40|$|The East Scotia Ridge, {{situated}} in the South Atlantic, is the back-arc spreading centre to the intra-oceanic South Sandwich <b>arc.</b> <b>Samples</b> from the ridge show a wide diversity in erupted magma compositions. Segment E 2, {{in the northern part}} of the ridge, has an axial topographic high, which contrasts with the rift-like topography common to most of the ridge. Lava compositions in the segment have been modelled by mixing of magmas derived from normal mid-ocean ridge basalt (N-MORB) -like mantle, a mantle plume component similar in composition to that sampled by Bouvet Island and mantle modified by addition of components from the subducting slab. The ‘Bouvet’-like plume signature has higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 206 Pb/ 204 Pb, Nb/Yb, and lower 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and 4 He/ 3 He, than the local upper mantle. It can be traced geochemically from the Bouvet Island hot spot to segment E 2, via the South American-Antarctic Ridge, which connects the Bouvet triple junction to the South Sandwich subduction system. Four samples dredged from segment E 2 have 4 He/ 3 He ratios of 85 000 – 90 200 (8. 5 – 8. 0 R/RA, where) R/RA is the 4 He/ 3 He ratio normalized to air) and three wax core samples taken from the segment axis have values of 104 300, 101 560 and 176 620 (6. 9, 7. 1 and 4. 1 R/RA). These latter data are similar to values from the South American-Antarctic Ridge which have no discernable plume input. Whilst the dredge samples have a measurably lower 4 He/ 3 He ratio than the South American-Antarctic Ridge and samples from the segment axis, these He isotope data contrast with a dominant plume signature recorded by other petrogenetic tracers. This is interpreted to be due to re-melting of an entrained plume component, with an inherent low He concentration, incorporated into the E 2 mantle. Helium depletion from the plume component can be seen to be a consequence of mantle processing and does not imply shallow-level degassing prior to entrainment within the upper-mantle-melting zone. As a consequence, He is characterized in the back-arc by values more similar to the upper mantle, whereas lithophile tracers are more influenced by the plume component. ...|$|E
40|$|Metal oxide {{thin films}} {{are the subject}} of {{considerable}} research due to their novel optical and electrical properties which make them suitable for use in many applications. These applications include gas sensors, solar cell arrays, anti dazzling rear view mirrors, smart windows, gate dielectrics, semiconductors and many more. The possibilities for new metal oxide based materials is forever growing with the introduction of novel deposition methods which allow precise control of the deposition parameters and the ability to dope in order to tailor properties. The conditions used for the deposition of these coatings has an influence on the microstructure which in turn {{plays an important role in}} determining physical properties, such as the optical transmission and electrical conductivity. In addition, for many metal oxide materials the structure-property relationship is not well understood. The aim of this thesis was two-fold. Firstly, to deposit some metal oxide thin film coatings using several physical vapour deposition techniques and characterise their microstructure and physical properties. Secondly, to make a comparison between films deposited using different techniques to determine how the properties of a film depend on the conditions under which they are formed. To achieve these aims, tungsten oxide, zinc oxide doped with aluminium (also known as aluminium zinc oxide - AZO) and hafnium oxide coatings were deposited and the microstructure and physical properties were investigated. For tungsten oxide deposition, films were deposited using pulsed magnetron sputtering and pulsed cathodic arc. It was found that films deposited using magnetron sputtering were highly disordered. In contrast, those deposited with cathodic arc were a highly ordered and exhibited a tetragonal phase, usually only observed at high temperatures. In the case of AZO, films were deposited using pulsed cathodic arc, pulsed magnetron sputtering and high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS). The pulsed cathodic arc films were found to have both good transmittance in the visible region and the best resistivity of all of the samples. It was found that magnetron and HIPIMS produced films that exhibited non-uniform properties across their surface due to in situ oxygen bombardment during deposition. This undesirable effect was eliminated by incorporating a novel magnetic filter into the deposition setup which acted to improve both the crystallinity and the resistivity. This thesis also performed the first comprehensive investigation of hafnium oxide films prepared using a filtered cathodic vacuum <b>arc.</b> <b>Samples</b> deposited at high substrate biases were found to damage readily which made them electrically leaky. Samples deposited at room temperature were found to have a disordered microstructure and had a good electrical breakdown. At elevated temperatures the crystallinity of the samples increased, resulting in a microstructure containing large monoclinic crystals. However, it was also found that the electrical breakdown worsened at elevated temperatures, in agreement with other researchers who also find that hafnium oxide films with disordered microstructure have the best electrical characteristics. Ab initio calculations of the near edge structure found in x-ray and electron loss edges were found to be a powerful way of distinguishing between the phases of tungsten oxide...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the H 2 O and CO 2 contents of glasses from lavas and xenoliths from the Mariana arc system, an intraoceanic convergent margin {{in the western}} Pacific, which contains an active volcanic arc, an actively spreading back arc basin, and active behind-the-arc cross-chain volcanoes. Samples include (1) glass rims from Mariana arc, Mariana trough, and cross-chain submarine lavas; (2) glass inclusions in arc and trough phenocrysts; and (3) glass inclusions from a gabbro + anorthosite xenolith from Agrigan (Mariana arc). Glass rims of submarine arc lavas contain 0. 3 - 1. 9 wt % H 2 O, and CO 2 is below detection limits. Where they could be compared, glass inclusions in arc phenocrysts contain more H 2 O than their host glasses; most arc glasses and phenocryst inclusions contain no detectable CO 2, {{with the exception of}} those from a North Hiyoshi shoshonite, which contains 400 - 600 ppm. The glass inclusions from the Agrigan xenolith contain 4 - 6 % H 2 O, and CO 2 is below the detection limit. Glasses from the cross-chain lavas are similar to those from the arc: H 2 O contents are 1. 4 - 1. 7 wt %, and CO 2 is below detection limits. Volatile contents in Mariana trough lava glass rims are variable: 0. 2 - 2. 8 wt % H 2 O and 0 - 300 ppm CO 2. Glass inclusions from through phenocrysts have water contents similar to the host glass, but they can contain up to 875 ppm CO 2. Volatile contents of melt inclusions from trough and arc lavas and from the xenolith imply minimum depths of crystallization of ~ 1 - 8 km. H 2 O and CO 2 contents of Mariana trough glasses are negatively correlated, indicating saturation of the erupting magma with a CO 2 -H 2 O vapor at the pressure of eruption (~ 400 bars for these samples), with the vapor ranging from nearly pure CO 2 at the CO 2 -rich end of the glass array to nearly pure H 2 O at the H 2 O-rich end. Degassing of these magmas on ascent and eruption leads to significant loss of CO 2 (thereby masking preeruptive CO 2 contents) but minimal disturbance of preeruptive H 2 O contents. For submarine Mariana arc magmas, depths were low enough that degassing on ascent and eruption led to loss of both H 2 O and CO 2; as a result, H 2 O contents are positively correlated with water depth for these samples. The H 2 O contents of primitive Mariana trough magmas richest in the slab-derived component (i. e., the most "arc-like" magmas) are ~ 2 wt %. Although evolved glasses with up to 4 - 6 wt % H 2 O are present among Mariana <b>arc</b> <b>samples,</b> we interpret the glass inclusion data as indicating that primitive Mariana arc liquids contain 1 - 3 wt % H 2 O. The preeruptive H 2 O contents of primitive cross-chain seamount liquids are > 1 - 2 wt %...|$|E

Barral et al. [14] assigns the highest value for the analyses by high-DMA measurements to the differences in the frequency for each analysis. This is because the dynamic analysis by DMA (heating rate ones), have a residual heat of reaction, thus masking the real value of the glass transition temperature.|$|R

In this paper, we propose a cylindrical surface spectrum and <b>arc</b> distance-based <b>sampling</b> frequency selection method for multiband RF signals. In this method, a 3 D visual expression of cylindrical surface spectrum of digital signal is introduced. This expression reflects better the circulatory nature of the spectrum of digital signals. It is found more intuitive, heuristic, and effective in dealing with undersampling issues of multiband RF signals than conventional spectrum expressions are. A function of arc distance between two frequency bands are also introduced {{which turns out to}} be useful in the determination of sampling frequency and design of digital filters.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{systematic}} search for gravitationally-lensed arcs in clusters of galaxies located in the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 data archive. By carefully examining the images of 128 clusters we have located 12 candidate radial arcs and 104 tangential arcs, each of whose length to width ratio exceeds 7. In addition, 24 other radial arc candidates were identified with a length to width ratio less than 7. Keck spectroscopy of 17 candidate radial arcs suggests that contamination of the radial <b>arc</b> <b>sample</b> from non-lensed objects is ∼ 30 - 50 %. With our catalog, we explore the practicality of using the number ratio of radial to tangential arcs as a statistical measure of the slope β of the dark matter distribution in cluster cores (where ρDM ∝ r −β at small radii). Despite the heterogeneous nature of the cluster sample, we demonstrate that this abundance ratio is fairly constant across various cluster subsamples partitioned according to X-ray luminosity and optical survey depth. We develop the necessary formalism to interpret this ratio in the context of two-component mass models for cluster cores. Although the arc statistics in our survey are consistent with a range of density profiles – β � 1. 6 depending on various assumptions, we show that one of the prime limiting factors is the distribution of stellar masses for the brightest cluster galaxies. We discuss the prospects for improving the observational constraints and thereby providing a reliable statistical constraint on cluster dark matter profiles on � 100 kpc scales.

40|$|The {{necessity}} of more trustworthy methods {{for measuring the}} risk (volatility) of financial assets {{has come to the}} surface with the global market downturn This dissertation aims to propose <b>sample</b> <b>arc</b> length of a time series, which provides a measure of the overall magnitude of the one-step-ahead changes over the observation time period, as a new approach for quantifying the risk. The Gaussian functional central limit theorem is proven under finite second moment conditions. With out loss of generality we consider equally spaced time series when first differences of the series follow a variety of popular stationary models including autoregressive moving average, generalized auto regressive conditional heteroscedastic, and stochastic volatility. As applications we use CUSUM statistic to identify changepoints in terms of volatility of Dow Jones Index returns from January, 2005 through December, 2009. We also compare asset series to determine if they have different volatility structures when arc length is used as the tool of quantification. The idea is that processes with larger <b>sample</b> <b>arc</b> lengths exhibit larger fluctuations, and hence suggest greater variability. ii Dedicatio...|$|R

Using well-established optical broadband color criteria we sort the entire <b>arc</b> <b>sample</b> into redshift bins based on u-g and g-r colors, and also r-z colors for the ~ 90 % of the arcs that have z-band data. This analysis yields broad redshift constraints with 85 + 4 - 5 % at z > 1. 0, 65 + 6 - 4 % at z > 1. 4, 56 + 5 - 4 % at z > 1. 9, and 21 + 4 - 2 % at z > 2. 7. The inferred median redshift of z = 2. 0 +/- 0. 1 is in good agreement with a previous determination of the redshift distribution of a smaller <b>sample</b> of brighter <b>arcs.</b> This agreement confirms that z = 2. 0 +/- 0. 1 is the typical redshift for giant arcs produced by cluster-scale strong lensing, independent of typical brightness of the arcs, and that this observed redshift distribution should therefore provide a good description of <b>samples</b> of lensed <b>arcs</b> {{over a wide range}} of arc brightnesses. Establishing that half of all giant arcs are galaxies at z >~ 2 contributes significantly toward relieving the tension of the order of magnitude discrepancy between the number of giant arcs observed and the number expected in a Lambda-CDM cosmology, but there is considerable evidence to suggest that a discrepancy persists. Additionally, this work confirms that forthcoming large <b>samples</b> of giant <b>arcs</b> will supply the observational community with a large number of strongly lensed galaxies at z >~ 2...|$|R

In particular, this family of models includes as special cases the directed versions of the Erdos-Renyi model, graphs with given expected degrees, the generalized random graph, and the Poissonian random graph. We establish the phase transition for the existence of a giant strongly connected component and provide some other basic properties, including the limiting joint distribution of the degrees and the mean number of arcs. In particular, we show that by choosing the joint distribution of the vertex attributes according to a multivariate regularly varying distribution, one can obtain scale-free graphs with arbitrary in-degree/out-degree dependence...|$|R

40|$|Many methods arc {{available}} {{to construct the}} models from data sets that <b>arc</b> <b>sampled</b> on scattered grid. For Scattered data, the inverse distance weighted methods are considered better due to their efficiency, extendibility to higher dimensions, global in nature and ease in implementation. Modified Quadratic Shepard (MQS) method, being smooth with C' continuity, is a commonly used method {{in the field of}} science and engineering such as geophysics, astronomy and meteorology. The method is available with many libraries and visualization environments such as Numerical Analysis Group (NAG) and FORTRAN and Surfer 8. However, it has problem that being a C' continuous method it interpolates values extending beyond the inherently limits of the data, which is sometimes meaningless for scientific and business community. So it is not suitable for applications where there is some inherent constraint on value of data. Examples of such value constraints arc non negativity, upper and/or lower bounds,and more general constraint defined by a function. Such constraints commonly arise in science and engineering applications. Non-negativity (for simplicity we use the term positivity to mean non- negativity) is a special case of the generalized bounds preserving problem. Positivity of data is commonly encountered in science, engineering and business. The significance of positivity {{lies in the fact that}} sometimes it does not make sense to talk of some quantity to be negative. For example the quantities like mass, volume, density, absolute temperate & pressure, radiation dose, number of persons, chemical concentration, hydraulic conductivity and porosity are meaningless when negative. In this thesis we formulate five methods, based on the MQS method, to preserve the arbitrary lower and upper bounds of data and fulfilling various requirements of Visualizations and other applications such as efficiency, accuracy, continuity, case in implementation, extendibility to higher dimensionality and gradient estimation etc. All these constrained interpolation functions are C continuous. An optimum solution having most of the above given required characteristics for different sizes and dimensionality of data has been identified...|$|R
