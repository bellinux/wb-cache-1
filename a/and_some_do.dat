5|$|In precocial species, {{the mothers}} invest little in nest {{building}} <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>do</b> not build nests at all. The female gives birth standing {{and the young}} emerge behind her. Mothers of these species maintain contact with their highly mobile young with maternal contact calls. Though relatively independent and weaned within days, precocial young may continue to nurse and be groomed by their mothers. Rodent litter sizes also vary and females with smaller litters {{spend more time in}} the nest than those with larger litters.|$|E
5|$|Over half of {{all known}} flatworm species are parasitic, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>do</b> {{enormous}} harm to humans and their livestock. Schistosomiasis, caused by one genus of trematodes, is the second-most devastating of all human diseases caused by parasites, surpassed only by malaria. Neurocysticercosis, which arises when larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium penetrate the central nervous system, is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. The threat of platyhelminth parasites to humans in developed countries is rising because of the popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods, and imports of food from high-risk areas. In less developed countries, people often cannot afford the fuel required to cook food thoroughly, and poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects increase the dangers presented by poor sanitation and unhygienic farming.|$|E

Substrate spawners clean off a suitable area of surface suitable for egg laying, and look after the area, but they do not actively build a nest.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, {{in several}} European {{countries}} (e.g. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland), religious unions have existed for decades. These unions typically distanced themselves {{from some of}} the doctrines of orthodox Marxism, such as the preference of atheism and from rhetoric suggesting that employees' interests always are in conflict with those of employers. Some of these Christian unions have had some ties to centrist or conservative political movements <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>do</b> not regard strikes as acceptable political means for achieving employees' goals. In Poland, the biggest trade union Solidarity emerged as an anti-communist movement with religious nationalist overtones and today it supports the right-wing Law and Justice party.|$|E
25|$|Mafiosi have {{protected}} {{a great variety}} of clients over the years: landowners, plantation owners, politicians, shopkeepers, drug dealers, etc. Whilst some people are coerced into buying protection <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>do</b> not receive any actual protection for their money (extortion), by and large there are many clients who actively seek and benefit from mafioso protection. This {{is one of the main}} reasons why the Mafia has resisted more than a century of government efforts to destroy it: the people who willingly solicit these services protect the Mafia from the authorities. If one is enjoying the benefits of Mafia protection, one does not want the police arresting one's mafioso.|$|E
25|$|It {{states that}} the Pope is the Antichrist, which was a very common belief in seventeenth-century England. It also stated that the Roman Catholic mass {{is a form of}} idolatry, that the civil magistrates have divine {{authority}} to punish heresy, and rules out marriage with non-Christians. These formulations were repudiated by several bodies which adopted the confession (for instance, the Church of Scotland, though its ministers are still free to adhere to the full confession <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>do),</b> but the confession remains part of the official doctrine of some other Presbyterian churches. For example, the Presbyterian Church of Australia holds to the Westminster Confession of Faith as its standard, subordinate to the Word of God, and read in the light of a declaratory statement.|$|E

50|$|Various {{laws in the}} United States {{prohibited}} marriage (<b>and,</b> in <b>some</b> cases, sexual relations) {{between white}} people and African-Americans (<b>and,</b> in <b>some</b> cases, Asians <b>and</b> Native Americans).

25|$|An example can {{be found}} in {{personality}} or temperament models. For example, a model that was derived from linguistic expressions of individual differences is subdivided into the Big Five personality traits, where everyone can be assigned a score along each of the five dimensions. This is by contrast to models of 'personality types' or temperament, where some have a certain type <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>do</b> not. Similarly, in the classification of mental disorders, a dimensional approach, which is being considered for the DSM-V, would involve everyone having a score on personality trait measures. A categorical approach would only look for {{the presence or absence of}} certain clusters of symptoms, perhaps with some cut-off points for severity for some symptoms only, and as a result diagnose some people with personality disorders.|$|E
25|$|The orange litter-mates {{of white}} tigers are not prone to strabismus. Siamese cats and albinos of every species {{which have been}} studied all exhibit the same visual pathway {{abnormality}} found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino ferrets. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality {{is that there is}} a disruption in the optic chiasm. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some optic nerves are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>do</b> not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.|$|E

These [...] "new Upanishads" [...] number in the hundreds, cover diverse range of topics from physiology to renunciation to sectarian theories. They were composed between the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE through the early modern era (~1600 CE). While over two dozen of the minor Upanishads are dated to pre-3rd century CE, many of these new texts under the title of [...] "Upanishads" [...] originated {{in the first half}} of the 2nd millennium CE, they are not Vedic texts, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>do</b> not deal with themes found in the Vedic Upanishads.|$|E
