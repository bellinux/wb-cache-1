5|$|GK Persei, {{also known}} as Nova Persei 1901, is a bright nova that {{appeared}} halfway between <b>Algol</b> and Delta Persei. Discovered on 21 February 1901 by Scottish amateur astronomer Thomas David Anderson, it peaked at magnitude 0.2almost as bright as Capella and Vega. It faded to magnitude 13 around 30 years after its peak brightness. Xi Persei, traditionally known as Menkhib, a blue giant of spectral type O7III, {{is one of the}} hottest bright stars in the sky, with a surface temperature of 37,500 K. It {{is one of the more}} massive stars, being between 26 and 32 solar masses, and is 330,000 times as luminous as our Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{star system}} is the {{prototype}} {{of a group of}} eclipsing binary stars named <b>Algol</b> variables, though it has a third member to make up what is actually a triple star system. The brightest component is a blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B8V, which is 3.5 times as massive and 180 times as luminous as the Sun. The secondary component is an orange subgiant star of type K0IV that has begun cooling and expanding to 3.5 times the radius of the Sun, and has 4.5 times the luminosity and 80% of its mass. These two are separated by only 0.05 astronomical units (AU)—five percent of the distance between the Earth and Sun; the main dip in brightness arises when the larger fainter companion passes in front of the hotter brighter primary. The tertiary component is a main sequence star of type A7, which is located on average 2.69 AU from the other two stars. AG Persei is another <b>Algol</b> variable in Perseus, whose primary component is a B-type main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.69. Phi Persei is a double star, although the two components do not eclipse each other. The primary star is a Be star of spectral type B0.5, possibly a giant star, and the secondary companion is likely a stellar remnant. The secondary has a similar spectral type to O-type subdwarfs.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, John Mauchly {{made the}} first mention of binary search {{as part of the}} Moore School Lectures, the first ever set of lectures {{regarding}} any computer-related topic. Every published binary search algorithm worked only for arrays whose length is one less than a power of two until 1960, when Derrick Henry Lehmer published a binary search algorithm that worked on all arrays. In 1962, Hermann Bottenbruch presented an <b>ALGOL</b> 60 implementation of binary search that placed the comparison for equality at the end, increasing the average number of iterations by one, but reducing to one the number of comparisons per iteration. The uniform binary search was presented to Donald Knuth in 1971 by A. K. Chandra of Stanford University and published in Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming. In 1986, Bernard Chazelle and Leonidas J. Guibas introduced fractional cascading as a method to solve numerous search problems in computational geometry.|$|E
5|$|South of the Eagle Nebula on {{the border}} with Sagittarius is the eclipsing binary W Serpentis, whose primary is a white giant that is {{interacting}} with the secondary. The system has been found to contain an accretion disk, {{and was one of the}} first discovered Serpentids, which are eclipsing binaries containing exceptionally strong far-ultraviolet spectral lines. It is suspected that such Serpentids are in an earlier evolutionary phase, and will evolve first into double periodic variables and then classical <b>Algol</b> variables. Also near the Eagle Nebula is the eclipsing Wolf–Rayet binary CV Serpentis, consisting of a Wolf–Rayet star and a hot O-type subgiant. The system is surrounded by a ring-shaped nebula, likely formed during the Wolf–Rayet phase of the primary. The eclipses of the system vary erratically, and although there are two theories as to why, neither of them is completely consistent with current understanding of stars.|$|E
5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} the Milky Way passes through Perseus, whose {{brightest}} star is the yellow-white supergiant Alpha Persei (also called Mirfak or Mirphak), which shines at magnitude 1.79. It {{and many of the}} surrounding stars are members of an open cluster known as the Alpha Persei Cluster. The best-known star, however, is <b>Algol</b> (Beta Persei), linked with ominous legends because of its variability, which is noticeable to the naked eye. Rather than being an intrinsically variable star, it is an eclipsing binary. Other notable star systems in Perseus include X Persei, a binary system containing a neutron star, and GK Persei, a nova that peaked at magnitude 0.2 in 1901. The Double Cluster, comprising two open clusters quite near each other in the sky, was known to the ancient Chinese. The constellation gives its name to the Perseus cluster (Abell 426), a massive galaxy cluster located 250 million light-years from Earth. It hosts the radiant of the annual Perseids meteor shower—one of the most prominent meteor showers in the sky.|$|E

40|$|Context. There is {{indirect}} evidence of non-conservative evolutions in <b>Algols.</b> However, the systemic mass-loss rate is poorly constrained by observations and generally set {{as a free}} parameter in binary-star evolution simulations. Moreover, systemic mass loss may lead to observational signatures that {{still need to be}} found. Aims. Within the "hotspot" ejection mechanism, some of the material that is initially transferred from the companion star via an accretion stream is expelled from the system due to the radiative energy released on the gainer's surface by the impacting material. The objective {{of this paper is to}} retrieve observable quantities from this process and to compare them with observations. Methods. We investigate the impact of the outflowing gas and the possible presence of dust grains on the spectral energy distribution (SED). We used the 1 D plasma code Cloudy and compared the results with the 3 D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code Skirt for dusty simulations. The circumbinary mass-distribution and binary parameters were computed with state-of-the-art binary calculations done with the Binstar evolution code. Results. The outflowing material reduces the continuum flux level of the stellar SED in the optical and UV. Because of the time-dependence of this effect, it may help to distinguish between different ejection mechanisms. If present, dust leads to observable infrared excesses, even with low dust-to-gas ratios, and traces the cold material at large distances from the star. By searching for this dust emission in the WISE catalogue, we found a small number of <b>Algols</b> showing infrared excesses, among which the two rather surprising objects SX Aur and CZ Vel. We find that some binary B[e] stars show the same strong Balmer continuum as we predict with our models. However, direct evidence of systemic mass loss is probably not observable in genuine <b>Algols,</b> since these systems no longer eject mass through the hotspot mechanism. Furthermore, owing to its high velocity, the outflowing material dissipates in a few hundred years. If hot enough, the hotspot may produce highly ionised species, such as Si IV, and observable characteristics that are typical of W Ser systems. Conclusions. If present, systemic mass loss leads to clear observational imprints. These signatures are not to be found in genuine <b>Algols</b> but in the closely related beta Lyraes, W Serpentis stars, double periodic variables, symbiotic <b>Algols,</b> and binary B[e] stars. We emphasise the need for further observations of such objects where systemic mass loss is most likely to occur...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} a 5 GHz survey of 26 Algol-type binaries. Six systems were detected. We combine the new results with {{previously}} published data to derive some radio characteristics of <b>Algols</b> and to compare them {{with those of other}} active binaries. The radio detection rate of 30 %, a factor that is somewhat smaller compared to the case of RS CVntype, {{does not seem to be}} due to a reduced coronal activity. In fact, <b>Algols</b> share many similarities with the radio behavior of RS CVns and the 5 GHz luminosity functions of both kind of systems look quite similar. Among the different possibilities, the high radio variability and distances, which, on average, are larger than those of RS CVns, seem to be the most reasonable explanation for the apparently reduced activity at radio wavelengths...|$|R

The interesting cases of Mu Sagittarii and in particular of Epsilon Aurigae are discussed in more detail. The barium star abundance anomaly appears now to be due to mass transfer in interacting systems. The symbiotic stars are another type of binary systems containing late-type giants; several possible models for the hotter star and for the type of interaction are discussed. The W Serpentis stars appear to be <b>Algols</b> in the rapid phase of mass transfer, but a possible link relating them to the symbiotics is also indicated.
