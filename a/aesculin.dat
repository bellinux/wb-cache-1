50|$|<b>Aesculin</b> is {{incorporated}} into agar with ferric citrate and bile salts (bile <b>aesculin</b> agar). Hydrolysis of the <b>aesculin</b> forms aesculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) and glucose. The aesculetin forms dark brown or black complexes with ferric citrate, allowing the test to be read.|$|E
50|$|The bile <b>aesculin</b> agar is {{streaked}} and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. The {{presence of}} a dark brown or black halo indicates that the test is positive.

50|$|The nut of the {{horse-chestnut}} tree (Aesculus species, especially Aesculus hippocastanum), {{is called a}} conker in the British Isles. Conkers are inedible because they contain toxic glucoside <b>aesculin.</b> They are used in a popular children's game, known as conkers, where the nuts are threaded onto a strong cord and then each contestant attempts to break their opponent's conker by hitting it with their own. Horse chestnuts are also popular slingshot ammunition.|$|E

It produces acid aerobically from D-glucose, D-fructose, D-mannose, maltose, lactose, trehalose, mannitol, sucrose, L-arabinose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, glycerol, erythritol, D-xylose, arbutin, and salicin.|$|E
5000|$|Lactobacillus pontis {{is capable}} of using {{fructose}} as a carbon source and convert stoichiometrically convert fructose to lactic acid and ethanol. However, when maltose is present, they use it chiefly as an electron acceptor, and fructose is reduced to mannitol. It can also metabolize ribose, D-raffinose, and gluconate, but cannot use glucose, L-arabinose, D-xylose, galactose, <b>aesculin,</b> lactose or melibiose. Its main products from fermenting fructose or maltose are lactate, acetate, ethanol, glycerol, and carbon dioxide. Lactobacillus pontis cannot use citrate as an electron acceptor {{in the presence of}} maltose. [...] There is also no presence of catalase activity.|$|E
50|$|Cryptobacterium curtum are Gram-positive, obligately anaerobic, non-spore-forming, and {{rod-shaped}} bacteria.

50|$|The flow {{of carbon}} for H. paucihalophilus {{is done with}} the {{oxidative}} tricarboxylic acid cycle, {{but it does not}} use the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle. It uses glutamic acid, histidine, norleucine, phenylalanine, D-glucuronic acid, <b>aesculin,</b> trehalose, dextrin, salicin, sucrose, fructose, xylose, glucose, galactose, glycerol, citrate, pyruvate, acetate, starch, lactate, mannitol, fumarate, and malate as sources of carbon. H. paucihalophilus is aerobic, so it uses oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. It is not capable using nitrate, sulfate, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, dimethyl sulfoxide, or trimethylamine N-oxide as an electron acceptor for growth in anaerobic conditions. In this species, lysine synthesis is done by the diaminopimelate pathway, the typical pathway for halophilic archaea. H. paucihalophillus sets itself apart by its biosynthesis of glycine by using a mixture of three biosynthetic pathways, which are the serine hydroxymethyltransferase pathway, the threonine aldolase pathways, and the reverse of the glycine cleavage system.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{its main}} {{ingredient}} is natural {{sugar in a}} proportion of approximately 55% sucrose, 24% glucose and 21% fructose, nectar is a brew of many chemicals. [...] For example, the Nicotiana attenuata, a tobacco plant native to the US state of Utah, uses several volatile aromas to attract pollinating birds and moths. The strongest such aroma is benzylacetone, but the plant also adds bitter nicotine, which is less aromatic, so may not be detected by the bird until after taking a drink. Researchers speculate {{the purpose of this}} addition is to discourage the forager after only a sip, motivating it to visit other plants, therefore maximizing the pollination efficiency gained by the plant for a minimum nectar output. Neurotoxins such as <b>aesculin</b> are present in some nectars such as that of the California buckeye. Nectar contains water, carbohydrates, amino acids, ions and numerous other compounds.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{biotransformation}} process of a Chinese compound, <b>aesculin,</b> by human gut bacteria, {{and to identify}} its metabolites in rat urine. METHODS: Representative human gut bacteria were collected from 20 healthy volunteers, and then utilized in vitro to biotransform <b>aesculin</b> under anaerobic conditions. At 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 72 h post-incubation, 10 mL of culture medium was collected. Metabolites of <b>aesculin</b> were extracted 3 × from rat urine with methanol and analyzed by HPLC. For in vivo metabolite analysis, aesculetin (100 mg/kg) was administered to rats via stomach gavage, rat urine was collected from 6 to 48 h post-administration, and metabolite analysis was performed by LC/ESI-MS and MS/MS in {{the positive and negative}} modes. RESULTS: Human gut bacteria could completely convert <b>aesculin</b> into aesculetin in vitro. The biotransformation process occurred from 8 to 24 h post-incubation, with its highest activity was seen from 8 to 12 h. The in vitro process was much slower than the in vivo process. In contrast to the in vitro model, six aesculetin metabolites were identified in rat urine, including 6 -hydroxy- 7 -gluco-coumarin (M 1), 6 -hydroxy- 7 -sulf-coumarin (M 2), 6, 7 -di-gluco-coumarin (M 3), 6 -glc- 7 -gluco-coumarin (M 4), 6 -O-methyl- 7 -gluco-coumarin (M 5) and 6 -O-methyl- 7 -sulf-coumarin (M 6). Of which, M 2 and M 6 were novel metabolites. CONCLUSION: <b>Aesculin</b> can be transferred into aesculetin by human gut bacteria and is further modified by the host in vivo. The diverse metabolites of <b>aesculin</b> may explain its pleiotropic pharmaceutical effects...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the application of}} ultraviolet spectroscopy for the rapid determination of <b>aesculin,</b> aesculetin and fraxetin in Cortex fraxini extract solutions, ultraviolet spectra of Cortex fraxini extract solutions from different batches were collected in the spectral range from 200 nm to 400 nm. The relationship between ultraviolet spectra and chemical parameters displayed some non-linear characteristics. Thus, K-OPLS was proposed to establish the calibration models for the determination of Cortex fraxini extract solutions between the reference data and ultraviolet spectra. The calibration results were achieved for the determination of Cortex fraxini extract solutions. The coefficients of determination in calibration (R 2) for <b>aesculin,</b> aesculetin and fraxetin were 0. 989, 0. 957 and 0. 939, while in prediction (R 2) were 0. 982, 0. 979 and 0. 962, respectively.

30|$|Regarding Proteus genus, P. hauseri {{belonged to}} the family of Enterobacteriaceae, is a gram-negative Proteobacterium, but not well {{characterized}} like P. mirabilis. Recent findings indicated that P. hauseri was capable of promising bioelectricity generation and textile dye decolorization for redox-mediating applications (Chen et al. 2010). The genus of Proteus was first classified by Professor Hauser in 1885 to characterize this kind of dimorphic strains. As indicated, exploration of Proteus genus has been implemented for more than one century. Up to now, Proteus genus at least contains five species of P. vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. penneri, P. hauseri, and P. myxofaciens (Pearson et al. 2008, 2011; Poore and Mobley 2003). Regarding classification, Brenner-introduced P. vulgaris was a heterogeneous group with at least three biogroups via DHA-hybridizations. The biogroup 1 was separated from P. vulgaris and the nomenclature of P. penneri was distinguished by negative reactions for indole production, salicin fermentation, and <b>aesculin</b> hydrolysis. Biogroup 2 was positive for reporter reaction of salicin and <b>aesculin,</b> while biogroup 3 was negative for salicin and <b>aesculin,</b> respectively. According to O’Hara, biogroup 3 could be composed of four distinct DNA groups, further assigned as biogroups 3, 4, 5, and 6. The new biogroup 3 was identified as P. hauseri due to l-rhamnose fermentation, DNase, lipase production, and Jordan’s tartrate utilization (O’Hara et al. 2000). Regard to the other biogroups, they are still remained open to be further classified via characterization of other biofunctions.|$|E
