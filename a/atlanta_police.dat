Brown and his staff oversaw investigation of the Atlanta Child Murders case and increased efforts to provide safety in black {{areas of the city}} during the period when murders were committed. A critical element of reform during Brown's tenure was increasing diversity of the police force. By the time Brown resigned to accept the top police job in Houston, <b>Atlanta's</b> <b>police</b> force was 20 percent black.|$|R
50|$|Believing that enfranchisement {{was the key}} to {{overcoming}} segregation, Dobbs {{started a}} voter registration drive in 1936 with a goal of registering 10,000 voters. That year, Dobbs founded the Atlanta Civic and Political League, and in 1946 along with A.T. Walden, he co-founded the Atlanta Negro Voters League. During the 1930s and 1940s, laws keeping blacks from voting were found to be unconstitutional. Between 1936 and 1946, 20,000 African-American voters were registered in Atlanta. With the power of the black vote behind him, Dobbs convinced Atlanta mayor William B. Hartsfield to integrate <b>Atlanta's</b> <b>police</b> force in 1948 and install gas lights along Auburn Avenue in 1949.|$|R

25|$|Neither Williams {{nor anyone}} else was ever tried {{for the murder of}} the boy, later {{identified}} as Curtis Walker, aged 13, whose body was dumped into Atlanta's South River in 1981.

Williams is serving his sentence at Telfair State Prison.|$|E
25|$|McKinney {{was exposed}} to the Civil Rights Movement through her father, an activist who {{regularly}} participated in demonstrations across the south. As a police officer, he challenged the discriminatory policies of the <b>Atlanta</b> <b>Police</b> Department, publicly protesting {{in front of the}} station, often carrying young McKinney on his shoulders. He was elected as a state representative. McKinney attributes her father's election victory, after several failed attempts, to the passage of the Voting Rights Act, of which provided for federal oversight and enforcement of voting. Most blacks in the South had been disenfranchised by state legislative barriers {{since the turn of the}} 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Warren McCleskey {{was convicted}} of two counts of armed robbery and one count {{of murder in the}} Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. McCleskey was African American; his victim was white <b>Atlanta</b> <b>Police</b> Officer Frank Schlatt. At the {{sentencing}} hearing, the jury found two aggravating circumstances existed beyond a reasonable doubt: the murder was committed during the course of an armed robbery, and the murder was committed upon a police officer engaged in the performance of his duties. A finding of either aggravating circumstance was sufficient to impose the death penalty. Petitioner did not provide any mitigating circumstances, and the jury recommended the death penalty. The court followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced petitioner to death.|$|E

25|$|In August 1982, <b>Atlanta</b> <b>police</b> officer Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a {{citation}} {{for public}} drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle {{into the brush}} along Monroe Ave, thereby observing him violating the city’s ordinance that prohibits drinking in public. Due to a clerical error, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained a warrant for Hardwick's arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying the $50 fine, but Torick showed up at Hardwick's apartment three weeks later to serve the now-invalid warrant. Hardwick’s roommate was sleeping {{on the couch in}} the living room. The roommate invited officers in and directed them down the hall to Hardwick’s room. The door was open and the officers observed Hardwick and a companion engaged in mutual, consensual oral sex.|$|E
25|$|Sarah Dozier, Johnston's niece, filed {{a motion}} asking a federal judge for {{sanctions}} against the city of Atlanta because she said it had withheld documents in a wrongful death lawsuit. Dozier's suit against the city had claimed that the incentives {{for the police to}} lie to obtain the warrant involved the quota system, which gives officers quotas for arrests and warrants. According to Dozier's motion, Lawyers for Johnston's family had asked the <b>Atlanta</b> <b>Police</b> Department for documents about the quotas before the trial began; the police chief had denied the existence of the quota system and the department indicated that there were no such documents. Dozier's motion claims that her lawyers obtained the documents another way and that APD officers had verified their authenticity during pretrial testimony. Alex White, the man the officers had used as their informant, also filed a lawsuit against Atlanta and police, claiming officers had held him against his will to pressure him to lie for the cover-up. In August 2010, Johnston's family was awarded $4.9 million in a settlement.|$|E

40|$|Dawna Fuqua-Whitley: Yes, {{as far as}} I am aware. Roland Chilton: Has the {{juvenile}} rate of crime, especially homicide, gone down in the areas that you studied? Dawna Fuqua-Whitley: In Atlanta, crime in general, including homicide, is dropping off. The <b>Atlanta</b> <b>policing</b> initiative program has only been in place 6 months. We have no specific answer yet about the specific link between our program and this decline. Becky Block: How often are you feeding data to police? Dawna Fuqua-Whitley: Currently, I am feeding them the data on monthly basis. We also report to the Police Chief {{about once a month}} and show how there’s fluctuation on a quarterly basis. Cheryl Maxson: How is the program in Atlanta similar to the one in Boston? Dawna Fuqua-Whitley: We looked at the Boston program and have an ongoing discussion about how to modify that program for our use in Atlanta. For example, we thought about using their gang strategies, but our gangs are too different from those in Boston...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{hearing that}} Martin Luther King Jr. {{had been shot}} in Memphis, Mayor Allen {{immediately}} rushed to the support of Dr. King's wife.

500|$|Keyes {{was also}} {{especially}} critical of Pat Buchanan, once saying {{during an interview}} on the Talk from the Heart program with Al Kresta (simulcast on KJSL St. Louis and WMUZ Detroit) that Buchanan had a [...] "black heart." [...] Keyes's entry into the Republican race after Buchanan had secured victories in New Hampshire and Louisiana led many to believe that Keyes was a stalking horse for neoconservative elements in the Republican Party, since Buchanan had been a well-known ardent foe of abortion and had suffered political fallout for bringing abortion and [...] "cultural war" [...] {{to the center of}} the public policy debate. [...] Later during the primaries, Keyes was briefly detained by <b>Atlanta</b> <b>police</b> when he tried to force his way into a debate to which he had been invited, and then uninvited. [...] He was never formally arrested and was eventually picked up 20 minutes later by Atlanta's mayor at the time, Bill Campbell.|$|E
500|$|Visually, Manhunter {{is driven}} by strong color cues {{and the use of}} tints, {{including}} the hallmark blue of Mann's work. Dante Spinotti has noted that these visual cues were meant to evoke different moods based on the tone of the scenes in which they were used: cool blue tones were used for the scenes shared between Will Graham and his wife Molly, and unsettling greens and magentas were used for the scenes with the killer Francis Dollarhyde. Steven Rybin has observed that [...] "blue is associated with Molly, sex, and the Graham family home", while green denotes [...] "searching and discovery", pointing out the color of Graham's shirt when the investigation begins and the green tone of the interior shots in the <b>Atlanta</b> <b>police</b> station. John Muir suggests that this helps identify the character of Graham with the [...] "goodness" [...] of the natural world, and Dollarhyde with the city, [...] "where sickness thrives". This strongly stylized approach drew criticism from reviewers at first, but has since been seen as a hallmark of the film and viewed more positively.|$|E

2500|$|The ROC flag is not {{commonly}} seen {{at international}} gatherings {{in which the}} PRC participates due to pressure from the PRC over the political status of Taiwan and resulting minimal political influence of the ROC in such circles. Instead, the ROC is usually represented under a pseudonym (usually [...] "Chinese Taipei") {{and in the case}} of Olympics, it flies its own flag, the Chinese Taipei flag. This is because the IOC recognises the PRC's position that the ROC is a defunct entity and that the ROC on Taiwan is illegitimate. The ban also effectively applies to spectatorsduring a Table Tennis final match at the 1996 <b>Atlanta</b> Olympics, <b>police</b> arrested a Taiwanese student for waving the ROC flag.|$|R
