40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>Beam</b> Spectroscopy {{diagnostics}} on ITER measure {{spectra of}} light emitted due to plasma {{interaction with the}} beams of neutral hydrogen isotopes injected into the plasma. They fall in roughly 3 groups: -Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CXRS), analyses line emission of plasma ions that receive electrons from the neutral beam atoms. The intensity, Doppler width and Doppler shift reveal information on the plasma ion density (typically an impurity), the ion temperature and the bulk ion velocity, respectively. -Motional Stark Effect (MSE), analyses Stark split line emission of the beam atoms itself due to collision with the background plasma. The Stark split {{is a result of}} the Lorentz electric field experienced by the beam atoms due to their motion across the magnetic field. Both the polarization of and the wavelength separation of the emission lines reveal information about the local magnetic field that provides powerful constraints to the plasma equilibrium reconstruction. -Beam Emission Spectroscopy fluctuations (BES), provides a fast (~ several 100 kHz bandwidth) measurement of the (filtered) intensity of the above mentioned MSE emission. The intensity fluctuations are proportional to electron density fluctuations due to turbulence and MHD modes. On ITER, <b>active</b> <b>beam</b> spectroscopy is faced with several challenges that are less present in current day devices: dominating background emission, partly due to reflection on the metallic walls and potentially polarized, low signal due to strong neutral beam attenuation, deposition of coatings on first mirrors, compliance with nuclear regulations and remote handling, limited access for in-vessel calibration et cetera.

30|$|The typical terrain for the HSR {{scenario}} is the viaduct in which exists a dominant LOS component. Therefore, {{the benefit of}} multiple antenna gain is hardly harvested, {{and that is one}} of the challenges for massive MIMO applied under HSR scenario. Although beamforming can form a signal beam towards the given direction which is better than MIMO in a strong LOS environment, the IBI problem of multi-stream beamforming is not yet mitigated. Thus, to maximize the throughput, a massive MIMO-based adaptive multi-stream beamforming scheme is proposed, which selects the active subset size and active receive antenna indices adaptively by exploiting the regular and predictive location information of the train. Numerical results also show that the throughput is not proportional to, but a nonlinear function of, the number of <b>active</b> <b>beams,</b> which is bottlenecked by IBI. Hence, the adaptive beam-selection design is needed in this scenario. Our future work will focus on further research on beam-selection procedure and design a massive MIMO-based multi-stream beamforming scheme for uplink transmission.|$|R

50|$|Starting in the 1960s new {{solid-state}} devices {{capable of}} delaying the transmitter signal {{in a controlled}} way were introduced. That led to the first practical large-scale passive electronically scanned array (PESA), or simply phased array radar. PESAs took a signal from a single source, split it into hundreds of paths, selectively delayed some of them, {{and sent them to}} individual antennas. The radio signals from the separate antennas overlapped in space, and the interference patterns between the individual signals was controlled to reinforce the signal in certain directions, and mute it in all others. The delays could be easily controlled electronically, allowing the beam to be steered very quickly without moving the antenna. A PESA can scan a volume of space much quicker than a traditional mechanical system. Additionally, thanks to progress in electronics, PESAs added the ability to produce several <b>active</b> <b>beams,</b> allowing them to continue scanning the sky {{while at the same time}} focusing smaller beams on certain targets for tracking or guiding semi-active radar homing missiles. PESAs quickly became widespread on ships and large fixed emplacements in the 1960s, followed by airborne sensors as the electronics shrank.|$|R

Although this treatment option for recurrent intracranial tumors is considered effective, however, it is rarely used because of severe radiation-induced neurologic complications. We present 3 case reports of using <b>active</b> <b>beam</b> scanning proton therapy for re-irradiation of intracranial tumors. In the first case, the patient with high-grade glioma was treated with proton beam therapy 1. 5 years after the previous conventional external beam radiation therapy. Tumor regression lasting 18 months was achieved. In the second case, the patient received repeated proton beam therapy for recurrent esthesioneuroblastoma. After 1. 5 years of follow-up, no evidence of recurrence and late toxicity was observed. The third case was unique, since the patient with recurrent hemangiopericitoma of the orbit received 4 courses of radiotherapy to the same area. A significant regression with no evidence of radiation-induced damage was also seen 12 months after the completion of radiation treatment. Conclusion. Recent advances in proton therapy allow for re-irradiation of CNS tumors in effective total doses, while reducing exposure to surrounding normal tissues.
