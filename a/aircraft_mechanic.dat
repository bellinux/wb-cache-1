5|$|Hanson {{was born}} in East Orange, New Jersey. He {{attended}} high school until his senior year; although he was offered a football scholarship to Wake Forest University, he declined the offer and stopped attending school. His mother was struggling financially, so Hanson became an <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanic</b> to help his family. He also competed as an amateur boxer, and he compiled a 613 record in New Jersey Golden Gloves competitions.|$|E
5|$|Philipp {{participated in}} various {{sporting}} events {{organized by the}} Christlicher Verein Junger Männer (CVJM—the German equivalent of YMCA) such as hiking, bicycling, skiing, paddling and rowing. He also {{was a member of}} the Hitlerjugend (HJ—Hitler Youth) and received the HJ-Ehrenzeichen (Honor Badge). Philipp learned to fly glider aircraft in the Hitler Youth and received his A and B glider license, leading the local HJ-Fliegerschar (Flying Squad) in Meissen. Adolf Hitler officially re-established the Luftwaffe in March 1935. Following this event, Philipp then changed his mind and decided he did not want to become a journalist. He passed his physical examination to become a pilot, observer, <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanic</b> and or radio operator on 6 September 1935 in Dresden. The financial situation of the Philipp family was always a cause for concern. When Alma's mother was paralyzed and required nursing care, the financial situation became severe. Alma's monthly income was 225 RM and the annual school fee of 180 RM was a big burden. She wrote to the city council multiple times asking for the fees to be waived. By early 1935, the family was behind on their payments which had accumulated to a debt of 390 RM by 31 March 1935. Philipp's graduation from school was at risk as he was threatened with expulsion on financial grounds. Philipp's decision to opt for military service in the Wehrmacht eased the financial tension. He was permitted to graduate, provided that his mother paid back the debt in instalments of 10 RM per month.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] In 2000, <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanics</b> {{and service}} {{technicians}} {{certified by the}} Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) earned on average $ 20. 16 per hour. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>mechanics</b> and technicians without FAA certification earned on average $ 15. 78 per hour, over $ 4. 00 less than their FAA certified counterparts. Total employment for <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanics</b> and service technicians in all industries in 2000 was 135, 730. Because the Federal Government may use Federal certification types other than FAA for its <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanics,</b> only private industry data are presented in this summary. Private industry employed 118, 770 <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanics</b> and service technicians in 2000. Of this total, almost 83 percent were FAA certified. Over 95 percent of the private industry employment for <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanics</b> and service technicians {{could be found in}} seven industries: Aircraft and parts manufacturing; air transportation, scheduled; air transportation, nonscheduled; airports, flying fields, and services; machinery, equipment, and supplies, wholesale trade; personnel supply services; and management and public relations.

25|$|Corrigan {{moved from}} {{job to job}} as an <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanic,</b> using his employers' planes to develop his flying skills. He gained his {{transport}} pilot's certificate in October 1929, and in 1930, started a passenger service between small East Coast towns, with his friend Steve Reich. The most lucrative part of the business turned out to be barnstorming displays promoting short recreational plane rides. Despite business success, after a few years, Corrigan decided to return to the West Coast. In 1933, he spent $310 on a used 1929 Curtiss Robin OX-5 monoplane and flew it home, where he returned to work as an <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanic</b> and began to modify the Robin for a transatlantic flight.|$|E

25|$|Eisenhower, after gaining {{permission}} from the War Department to decide the requests, concurred with Yeager and Glover. Yeager later credited his postwar success in the Air Force to this decision, saying that his test pilot career followed naturally from his having been a decorated combat pilot, along with having been an <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanic</b> before attending pilot school. In part, because of his maintenance background, he also frequently served as a maintenance officer in his flying units.|$|E
25|$|Chilstrom {{was born}} on April 20, 1921 in Zumbrotaa {{small town in the}} {{south-east}} part of Minnesota. He developed an interest in aviation at an early age and began building model airplanes while still in grade school in Chicago, Illinois. After graduating from high school in 1939, Chilstrom went to a military recruiting office to sign up for pilot training. Since {{he did not have the}} two years of college needed to enter the air cadet training program, Chilstrom enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps to train as an <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yeager enlisted as {{a private}} in the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) on , 1941, and became an <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanic</b> at George Air Force Base, Victorville, California. At enlistment, Yeager was not {{eligible}} for flight training because of his age and educational background, but the entry of the U.S. into World War II {{less than three months}} later prompted the USAAF to alter its recruiting standards. Having unusually sharp vision (a visual acuity rated 20/10), which once enabled him to shoot a deer at , Yeager displayed natural talent as a pilot and was accepted for flight training.|$|E

25|$|Post-accident {{investigation}} by the NTSB showed that {{the leading cause of}} the accident was Denver's inability to switch fuel tanks during flight. The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's transfer to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately prior to the final flight. His newly purchased experimental Rutan had an unusual fuel selector valve handle configuration. Intended by the plane's designer to be located between the pilot's legs, the builder instead had placed the fuel selector behind the pilot's left shoulder, with the fuel gauge also behind the pilot's seat and not visible to the person at the controls. An NTSB interview with the <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanic</b> servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turned.|$|E
25|$|In January 1923, having {{passed the}} RAF {{entrance}} examination {{with a high}} mark, Whittle reported to RAF Halton as an Aircraft Apprentice. He lasted only two days: just five feet tall and with a small chest measurement, he failed the medical. He then put himself through a vigorous training programme and special diet devised by a physical training instructor at Halton to build up his physique, only to fail again six months later, when {{he was told that}} he could not be given a second chance, despite having added three inches to his height and chest. Undeterred, he applied again under an assumed name and presented himself as a candidate at the No 2 School of Technical Training RAF Cranwell. This time he passed the physical and, in September that year, 364365 Boy Whittle, F started his three-year training as an <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanic</b> in No. 1 Squadron of No. 4 Apprentices Wing, RAF Cranwell, because RAF Halton No. 1 School of Technical Training was unable to accommodate all the aircraft apprentices at that time.|$|E
25|$|While {{living in}} Lorain, Ohio {{and working in}} a factory, Barr first learned how to fly {{aircraft}} in 1946 {{as part of a}} Piper club. She had dropped out of Oberlin College the year before in order to find a job to pay for flying lessons. After completing her training, she obtained a job training others to be commercial pilots. During the end years of World War II, she decided to help build aircraft for the war, which led to her moving to New York City and joining a <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanic</b> school. This also involved acting alongside members of the Women Airforce Service Pilots to assist in transporting war goods and planes across the US. The end of the war resulted in the Barrs moving to Susanville, California in 1949, and setting about running and improving the Susanville airport. After obtaining her certification in 1957, she obtained the position of FAA Pilot Examiner for Lassen County. In 1964, Barr {{became one of the first}} four women to ever be a part of the Reno Air Races. She placed second in the Reno National Championships in the Stock Plane Class using a Piper Cherokee.|$|E

The creation of the Royal Air Force did not initially {{have a big impact}} on Allingham and he later remarked that at that time he still considered himself a navy man. [...] In the RAF he was ranked as a Rigger Aero, <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Mechanic</b> Second Class and was given a new service number: 208317. Allingham returned to the Home Establishment in February 1919 and was formally discharged to the RAF Reserve on 16 April 1919. During the last few years of his life Allingham was recognized as the last surviving founding member of the RAF. Speaking with Dennis Goodwin of the First World War Veterans' Association, Allingham said, [...] "It is a shock as well as a privilege to think that I am the only man alive from that original reorganisation when the RAF was formed." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the {{military}} had officially barred or restricted the recruitment of Aborigines in earlier periods, these impediments were significantly relaxed after Japan entered World WarII, and Australia came under direct attack for the first time. Waters volunteered for service in the RAAF on 24August 1942, at Brisbane, and was accepted. He began training as an <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanic,</b> but later volunteered for flying service, and commenced initial training at Somers, Victoria, in December 1943. The aircrew interviewer thought he looked [...] "a bit rough" [...] but [...] "should make a fighter". Waters believed his lack of education would be a disadvantage, and studied nights {{to make up for}} it. Keen to be a pilot, he was concerned that he would be allocated to duty as a wireless operator because he showed an aptitude for Morse transmission early on. He was also asked to imagine himself as the tail gunner in a Lancaster or Halifax heavy bomber, to which he replied, [...] "I had a very disappointed look on my face, sir!" [...] So convinced was he that he would not achieve his dream of becoming an aviator, Waters made three separate bets against himself being selected, and had to pay out £15 when he was nevertheless chosen.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} long term {{exposure}} to excessive levels of aircraft noise {{have been considered}} {{to be one of}} the major factors causing permanent hearing loss of the military Background and Objective: Hearing impairment from noise exposure has been reported in fix-wing pilots, especially in civilized countries. However, there are few studies on rotary wing aviators and <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanics,</b> especially in developing countries whose hearing conservative program is not well established. The present study, therefore, was done to evaluate the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss and the contributing factors that may effect both groups of noise-exposed population. Material and Method: Report questionnaires were reviewed and physical examination combined with audiometric records of 34 pilots and 42 mechanics in the Royal Thai Army Aviation Center, Lobburi, were examined. Hearing loss was studied using four categories of significant threshold shift (STS). Amplitude of noise radiated by aircraft was also measured at different distances. Results: No significant difference was found in prevalence of hearing loss in aviators (32. 4 %) and <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanics</b> (47. 6 %), but in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>mechanics</b> group there were more damage of frequency involvemen...|$|R
