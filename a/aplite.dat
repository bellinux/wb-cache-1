25|$|Early Archean rocks {{generally}} form elongate, domal or circular {{bodies that}} are several kilometers thick. Late-stage dikes and sills of diabase, quartz-feldspar fine-grained instrusive rocks (<b>aplite)</b> and quartz-feldspar-mica coarse-grained intrusive rocks (pegmatite) are common.|$|E
25|$|Clastic {{rocks are}} also {{commonly}} found in shallow subvolcanic intrusions such as porphyry stocks, granites and kimberlite pipes, where they are transitional with volcanic breccias. Intrusive rocks can become brecciated in appearance by multiple stages of intrusion, especially if fresh magma is intruded into partly consolidated or solidified magma. This {{may be seen in}} many granite intrusions where later <b>aplite</b> veins form a late-stage stockwork through earlier phases of the granite mass. When particularly intense, the rock may appear as a chaotic breccia.|$|E
25|$|Tourmaline is a six-member ring cyclosilicate {{having a}} {{trigonal}} crystal system. It occurs as long, slender to thick prismatic and columnar crystals {{that are usually}} triangular in cross-section, often with curved striated faces. The style of termination {{at the ends of}} crystals is sometimes asymmetrical, called hemimorphism. Small slender prismatic crystals are common in a fine-grained granite called <b>aplite,</b> often forming radial daisy-like patterns. Tourmaline is distinguished by its three-sided prisms; no other common mineral has three sides. Prisms faces often have heavy vertical striations that produce a rounded triangular effect. Tourmaline is rarely perfectly euhedral. An exception was the fine dravite tourmalines of Yinnietharra, in western Australia. The deposit was discovered in the 1970s, but is now exhausted. All hemimorphic crystals are piezoelectric, and are often pyroelectric as well.|$|E
50|$|The <b>aplites</b> {{associated}} with diorites and quartz-diabases differ in minor respects {{from the common}} <b>aplites</b> which accompany granites. The accessory minerals of these rocks are principally oligoclase, muscovite, apatite and zircon. Biotite and all ferromagnesian minerals rarely appear in them, and never in considerable amounts. Riebeckite-granites have close affinities to <b>aplites,</b> shown especially in the prevalence of alkali feldspars. Tourmaline also occurs in some <b>aplites.</b>|$|R

500|$|Okehampton Castle {{was built}} along a long, thin rocky outcrop, rising {{up from the}} {{surrounding}} countryside. The stream that runs around {{the north side of}} the castle would have been more substantial in the medieval period and provided additional protection on that side, while the south side of the castle would have probably overlooked water-logged fields. The castle was mostly built from local stone, with <b>aplite</b> from nearby Meldon and some beerstone from south-east Devon; the interior and exterior stonework would have originally been rendered with lime plaster. The castle's final design involved a visitor entering from the barbican in the north-east, along a long passageway up the hill, into the bailey. On the south-west side of the bailey lay the motte, mounted by the keep.|$|E
2500|$|The rocks {{within the}} Verdugo Mountains block are almost entirely igneous and {{metamorphic}} rocks {{similar to the}} crystalline basement rocks exposed to the north in {{that portion of the}} San Gabriel Mountains south of the San Gabriel Fault. [...] These rocks consist of gneiss, and gneissic diorite and quartz diorite, intruded by irregular bodies of equigranular granitic rocks, predominantly quartz diorite and granodiorite, with accompanying pegmatite and <b>aplite.</b> Exposed rocks in the Shadow Hills neighborhood at the extreme northwestern end of the Verdugos are typically marine sedimentary rocks of Miocene age, predominantly sandstone and shale.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} pink and red <b>aplite</b> veins in the igneous {{complexes}} up to 5 cm wide. The <b>aplite</b> {{is the lowest}} melting remanent of the granite magma, that is poor in volatiles. The <b>aplite</b> minerals include tourmaline, topaz and fluorite. At St Brelade's Bay there are two aplogranites: Beau Port Granite and La Moye Granite. This is coloured yellow brown to pink and contains fine crystals of perthite, and oligoclase and quartz, coloured by limonite. Other parts more rich in volatiles have formed pegmatites featuring milky quartz and pink orthoclase.|$|E

50|$|<b>Aplites</b> {{usually have}} a genetic {{affinity}} to the rocks they intrude. The <b>aplites</b> of granite areas, for example, are {{the last part of}} the magma to crystallize, and correspond in composition to the quartzo-feldspathic aggregates that fill up the spaces between the early-formed minerals in the main body of the rock. They bear a considerable resemblance to the eutectic mixtures which are formed on the cooling of solutions of mineral salts, and remain liquid till the excess of either of the components has separated out, finally solidifying en masse when the proper proportions of the constituents and a suitable temperature are reached.|$|R
50|$|The <b>aplites</b> {{are clearly}} peraluminous and {{belong to the}} S-type and {{are very similar to}} the {{fine-grained}} border facies. Microgranites and lamprophyres show similarities and belong to the I-type; they are hypaluminous to normal aluminous rocks and most likely have originated from an independent magma pulse or batch.|$|R
50|$|The reddish colours of the <b>aplites</b> {{and the red}} facies rocks is due to {{hematite}} invading the plagioclase and staining it. These rocks therefore underwent Fe-metasomatism (see {{thin section}} at left). Most of the biotite has been altered to chlorite (chloritization) indicating retrograde metamorphism under greenschist facies conditions.|$|R

40|$|We present new field, petrographical, mineralogical and geochemical {{data from}} late Neoproterozoic pegmatites and <b>aplites</b> in {{southern}} Sinai, Egypt, at the northernmost {{limit of the}} Arabian-Nubian Shield. The pegmatites cross-cut host rocks in the Taba Metamorphic Complex (TMC) with sharp contacts and are divided into massive and zoned pegmatites. Massive pegmatites {{are the most common}} and form veins, dykes and masses of variable dimensions; strikes range mainly from E-W through NW-SE to N-S. Mineralogically, the massive pegmatites are divided into K-feldspar-rich and albite-rich groups. Zoned pegmatites occur as lenses of variable dimensions, featuring a quartz core, an intermediate zone rich in K-feldspars and an outer finer-grained zone rich in albite. All compositions are highly evolved and display geochemical characteristics of post-collisional A-type granites: high SiO 2, Na 2 O+K 2 O, FeO*/MgO, Ga/Al, Zr, Nb, Ga and Y alongside low CaO, MgO, Ba and Sr. They are rich in Rare Earth Elements (REE) and have extreme negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu*= 0. 03 â€“ 0. 09). A genetic linkage between the pegmatites, <b>aplites</b> and alkali granite is confirmed by their common mild alkaline affinity and many other geochemical characteristics. These pegmatites and <b>aplites</b> represent the last small fraction of liquid remaining after extensive crystallization of granitic magma, injected along the foliation and into fractures of the host metamorphic rocks. The extensional tectonic regime and shallow depth of emplacement are consistent with a post-collisional environment...|$|R

40|$|Two {{chemically}} and petrographically distinct intrusive bodies (a calc-alkaline trondhjemite and an alkaline quartz-syenite cut by granitic <b>aplites)</b> {{occur in}} the vicinity of Piranga (Minas Gerais State), near the southeastern border of the SÃ£o Francisco craton, Brazil. They intrude the Rio das Velhas greenstone belt and the Mantiqueira complex, both of Archean age. Both intrusive bodies are variably deformed and mylonitized. Age determinations using the Pb/Pb single-zircon evaporation method yielded Paleoproterozoic ages for the emplacement/crystallization of the trondhjemite (2058 Â± lOMa), quartz-syenite (2036 Â± 4 Ma), as well as the younger <b>aplites</b> (2012 Â± 8 Ma). These ages allow us to interpret the calc-alkaline as well as the alkaline magmatism as manifestations of the Transamazonian event in the southeastern SÃ£o Francisco craton region. Furthermore, the calc-alkaline trondhjemite is interpreted to have intruded during compressional deformation, while the alkaline quartz-syenite and its aplitic differentiates are post-orogenic, possibly extension-related. In terms of the Rb vs. (Y +Nb) contents, the trondhjemite plots in the field of volcanic arc granites, whereas the syenite and the <b>aplites</b> plot in the field of post-collision granites. The mylonitic overprinting of the syenite and the trondhjemite is also Paleoproterozoic, as deduced from the 2012 Â± 8 Ma age of the undeformed younger aplitic dykes which cut the syenite. It is likely that this alkaline magmatism correlates with a Paleoproterozoic post-collisional magmatic event well documented in the Transamazonian mobile belts of the northern SÃ£o Francisco craton...|$|R

These gneissic rocks are intruded by both acidic and basic igneous rocks which include white and pink pegmatite, <b>aplites,</b> granodiorite and dykes. The dykes, which are mostly dolerite, {{are probably the}} youngest units recognised in the area, and are less numerous than the acidic intrusives.|$|R
40|$|Lithium-rich aplite-pegmatite bodies intruding the {{metamorphic}} {{basement of}} northeastern Portugal are described {{for the first}} time. They constitute {{only a small percentage}} of an important granitic aplite-pegmatite population associated with Hercynian synorogenic two-mica granites. <b>Aplites</b> and pegmatites are deformed by the last event of deformation, which postdates the peak of metamorphism. This paper focuses on the mineralogy and crystal chemistry ol spodumene that is present mainly in the pegmatites but also in some associated <b>aplites</b> and, locally, in late ductile shear zones. Comparison with pegmatitic spodumene from Galicia (northwestern Spain) and with spodumene of gem quality ("kunzite") from pocket pegmatites from elsewhere in the world confirms the nearly constant composition of the pyroxene. Compositions of all spodumene examples are close to the theoretical formula, regardless of the location and paragenesis (early to late) in the aplite-pegmatite sequence of crystallization. Cell parameters determined by single-crystal or powder techniques present only slight variations, whatever the origin of the spodumene samples...|$|R

40|$|Summary. In the Donegal Granite garnet {{occurs as}} an {{accessory}} mineral in muscovite-granites, pegmatites, and <b>aplites.</b> The {{composition of the}} garnet in fourteen samples of granitic rock has been determined from the physical properties and three new chemical analyses are given. All the samples examined are inter-mediate in composition between ahnandine and spessartine. The reason for the high manganese content in garnet from granites is discussed. ARNET is a common accessory mineral in the muscovite granites, <b>aplites,</b> and pegmatites of the Donegal Granite, and this study {{was carried out in}} order to determine the composition of the garnet in each of the principal types of occurrence. There are four members of the Donegal granite suite in which garnetiferous rocks are found, and their relations are shown in fig. 1. The first to be emplaced was the Older Granodiorite (Pitcher, 1953 a), which is not itself garnetiferous although it contains nunterous inclusions of grossular-bearing limestones.

40|$|Abstract â€“ The {{study area}} {{is a part of}} the Sanandaj-Sirjan {{metamorphic}} belt comprising low- to high-grade regional and contact metamorphic rocks that are intruded by various plutonic bodies. Garnet crystals are abundant in pelitic schists, amphibole schists, migmatites, hornfelses and <b>aplites.</b> They are mostly almandine-rich (XAlm> 60) pyralspite garnets and show dodecahedron, trapezohedron and mixed (dodecahedron-trapezohedron) forms. Garnets in pelitic schists have different forms, but in hornfelses and <b>aplites</b> they have a mostly trapezohedron form. Sometimes, in some layers adjacent to each other that have experienced equal pressure and temperature, observed crystal forms are various, which may be due to the changes in the chemical composition of the mineral and its host rock. Absolute temperature may not be so important for form variations but temperature gradients during crystal growth may have affected the crystal forms. In more rapid temperature gradients the trapezohedron form is more common, but in slow gradients the dodecahedron form is more common. Mn-rich/Ca-poor crystals have a pure trapezohedron form; Mn-poor/Ca-rich crystals have a dodecahedron form and others have mixed forms...|$|R
