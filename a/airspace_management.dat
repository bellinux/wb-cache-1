500|$|Malaysia and Singapore have {{established}} {{what they have}} named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary {{in the area around}} Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge. Following a meeting on 3 June 2008, the Committee agreed that a technical sub-committee would be established to oversee the conduct of joint survey works to prepare the way for talks on maritime issues in and around the area. If any incident occurred in and around the waters of Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, either side would provide humanitarian assistance to the vessels involved. Finally, both Malaysian and Singaporean fishermen could continue traditional fishing activities in those waters. In September 2008, the Joint Technical Committee reported that its Sub-Committee on Joint Survey Works was finalising technical preparations for a hydrographic survey that would provide data for future delimitation discussions. A Sub-Committee on Maritime and <b>Airspace</b> <b>Management</b> and Fisheries had also been formed, and after a meeting on 20 August 2008 it decided that traditional fishing activities by both countries should continue in waters beyond [...] off Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge.|$|E
500|$|The International Aerial Robotics Competition {{was first}} {{held on the}} campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology (first mission, 1991–1995). Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center asked that the {{competition}} move to its location for the second mission, where it was held at the entrance to the park during 1996 and 1997. The U.S. Department of Energy's Hazardous Material Management and Emergency Response (HAMMER) training facility then brought the IARC to Richland WA from 1998 to 2000 for the conduct of the third mission. The fourth mission began in 2001 at the U.S. Navy's Webster Field in Maryland, but was moved to the Canada Olympic Village (Calgary, Canada) the following year because Webster Field was unsuitable. Weather, difficulty in <b>airspace</b> <b>management,</b> and extreme electromagnetic interference drove the IARC to an ideal venue where these issues could be managed: the U.S. Army's Fort Benning Soldier Battle Lab, McKenna MOUT site. For the fourth mission scenarios, the existence of the uninhabited McKenna village provides the perfect venue. [...] Due to the nature of the challenge, the fifth mission took place in an indoor location at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. [...] The sixth mission was initiated in the coliseum {{on the campus of}} the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez during August 2010, however the sixth mission was moved to Grand Forks, North Dakota beginning in 2011. [...] A second venue was established in Beijing China beginning in 2012. [...] This [...] "Asia/Pacific Venue" [...] serves the Asian and Australian continents while the [...] "American Venue" [...] serves the American, European, and African continents. [...] Teams are free to enter the competition at either venue. [...] Beginning in August 2012, the two venues conducted the sixth mission under the same set of rules. [...] The new seventh mission was begun at the McAmish Pavilion {{on the campus of the}} Georgia Institute of Technology (American Venue) and in Yantai, Shandong Province, China (Asia/Pacific Venue) during August 2014.|$|E

2500|$|The recent {{decision}} {{to join the}} Brady and Brownwood MOAs will provide additional maneuver airspace for Air Intercept Control/Air Combat Maneuvering (AIC/ACM) training. When scheduled concurrently, these areas enable numerous aircraft from several units to participate in joint fighter/bomber training exercises. Brownwood MOA {{is the subject of}} an innovative test to improve the dissemination of SUA status information to non-participating aircraft. This test, conducted to address action items in meeting Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Free Flight planning commitments, will use a combination of recently deployed airspace scheduling and reporting systems, including the FAA's Special-Use <b>Airspace</b> <b>Management</b> System (SAMS) and the Department of Defense Military <b>Airspace</b> <b>Management</b> System (MAMS). The intent of the trial is to provide more accurate [...] "near real-time" [...] area status via the internet to civilian users, especially to regional air carriers particularly affected by required rerouting around Brownwood MOA. Should the test and the technology prove successful and cost-effective, the result could address long-standing civilian dissatisfaction with the quality and timeliness of FAA-distributed special use airspace status information. In particular, such functionality may be appropriate for incorporation into the next generation of Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) modernization equipment.|$|E

40|$|The modern {{aeronautical}} scenario has {{welcomed the}} massive diffusion of new key elements, including the Remote Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), initially used {{for military purposes}} only. The current decade has seen RPAS ready to become a new airspace user in a large variety of civilian applications. Although RPAS can currently only be flown into segregated airspaces, due to national and international Flight Aviation Authorities′ (FAAs) constraints, they represent a remarkable potential growth in terms of development and economic investments for aviation. Full RPAS development will only happen when flight into non‐segregated airspaces is authorized, as for manned civil and military aircraft. The preliminary requirement for disclosing the airspace to RPAS is the implementation of an ad hoc Safety Management System (SMS), as prescribed by ICAO, for every aeronautical operator. This issue arises {{in the context of}} the ongoing restructuring of <b>airspaces</b> <b>management,</b> according to SESAR‐JU in Europe and NextGen in the USA (SESAR‐JU has defined how RPAS research should be conducted in SESAR 2020, all in accordance with the 2015 European ATM Master Plan).
