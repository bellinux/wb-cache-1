50|$|The {{study of}} height {{is known as}} <b>auxology.</b> Growth has long been {{recognized}} {{as a measure of}} the health of individuals, hence part of the reasoning for the use of growth charts. For individuals, as indicators of health problems, growth trends are tracked for significant deviations and growth is also monitored for significant deficiency from genetic expectations. Genetics is a major factor in determining the height of individuals, though it is far less influential in regard to differences among populations. Average height is relevant to the measurement of the health and wellness (standard of living and quality of life) of populations.|$|E

50|$|EarlyBird was {{a classic}} {{observation}} study of contemporary British children (1995-96 birth cohort) observed at six-month intervals {{over a period of}} 12 years from 5-16y. It combined objective measures of <b>auxology,</b> body composition (DEXA), physical activity (accelerometry) and metabolic rate (GEM) with annual blood samples to test a wide range of metabolic measures. By way of analogy, 300 5y-old children were lined up in rank order, the start gun was fired, and snapshots were taken every six months as the children progressed toward the finish line at 16y. Most ran straight, but many deviated out of lane towards insulin resistance and diabetes. The study was able to identify which children developed insulin resistance, and to answer in large part why.|$|E

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the association of birth weight SDS with insulin resistance, blood pressure, and <b>auxology</b> {{in children and adolescents}} born 23 - 42 weeks of gestation. We studied 143 singleton children and adolescents aged 9. 3 ± 3. 3 years (range 2. 0 - 17. 9 years). Clinical assessments included insulin resistance measured by HOMA 2 -IR, <b>auxology,</b> and blood pressure from sphygmomanometer measurements. Continuous associations were examined, and stratified analyses carried out. For the latter, participants were divided into those of below-average birth weight (BABW, < 0 SDS) and above-average birth weight (AABW, ≥ 0 SDS). Irrespective of gestational age, lower birth weight SDS was associated with progressively greater HOMA 2 -IR (p< 0. 0001) and higher fasting insulin concentrations (p< 0. 0001). Decreasing birth weight SDS was associated with higher systolic (p = 0. 011) and diastolic (p = 0. 006) blood pressure. Lower birth weight SDS was also associated with decreasing stature (p< 0. 010). The BABW group was ~ 40 % more insulin resistant than AABW participants (p = 0. 004), with the former also displaying fasting insulin concentrations 37 % higher (p = 0. 004). BABW participants were 0. 54 SDS shorter than those of higher birth weight (p = 0. 002). On average, BABW participants had not met their genetic potential, tending to be shorter than their parents (p = 0. 065). As a result, when corrected for parents' heights, BABW participants were 0. 62 SDS shorter than those born of higher birth weight (p = 0. 001). Sub-group analyses on participants born appropriate-for-gestational-age (n = 128) showed that associations of birth weight SDS with both insulin resistance and stature remained (although attenuated). Decreasing birth weight SDS (even within the normal range) is associated with adverse metabolic profile and lower stature in children and adolescents...|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of physical growth and maturation {{is relevant to}} many disciplines, including exercise and sport science, anthropology, human biology, medicine, psychology and education. Growth and maturation is governed by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. There is increasing evidence that physical activity {{plays an important role}} in normal growth, development, health and well-being of children and youth, however, caution is required in the activity setting so that growth and maturation is not jeopardised. To appreciate the impact of physical activity and/or exercise on growth and maturation, a thorough {{understanding of}} the general principles of <b>auxology</b> is useful. Following an introduction to terminology, an overview of physical growth and development is provided in the context of morphological changes. Detailed information is provided regarding individual variability in growth and development along with sexual dimorphism. A small degree of sexual dimorphism exists at birth however striking differences develop during the pubertal years. Sexual dimorphism in body composition is largely regulated by endocrine factors with critical roles played by growth hormone and gonadal steroids. ...|$|E
40|$|Almost {{as soon as}} we had {{completed}} our previous book Functional Data Analysis in 1997, it became clear that potential interest in the field was far wider than the audience for the thematic presentation we had given there.

Subjects and methods: We studied 97 growth hormone deficient (GHD) children in two groups: 1) The study group (n= 39) was treated with recombinant human GH (rhGH) at a low dose of 0. 15 mg/kg/week 2) The control group (n= 58) was treated with rhGH, at a conventional dose of 0. 2 mg/kg/week. All patients were evaluated for <b>auxology,</b> Insulin like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) and Insulin like growth factor binding protein- 3 -(IGFBP 3) levels at baseline, 6 and 12 months after starting GH therapy. Results: While {{there was no significant}} difference in IGF- 1, IGFBP 3, growth velocity (GV), and growth velocity SDS (GVSDS) levels after 6 months of therapy between the two groups, the GV and GVSDS levels were significantly higher in the control group after 12 months. This difference contributed to significant pu-bertal spurt in the control group. In both groups, no significant correlation was found among parental heights, target heights, IGF- 1 and IGFBP 3 levels with GV and GVSDS.

Study Design: The records of 139 CH patients referred to our center between 1978 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Biochemical and imaging data at diagnosis, initial treatment and growth were analyzed. Results: 111 patients had thyroid dysgenesis (64 ectopy, 46 athyreosis and 1 hypoplasia) and 28 patients had a gland in situ (17 dyshormonogenesis/goiter and 11 normal-sized gland). Levothyroxine treatment was initiated at a median age of 11 days with a mean dose of 11. 4 μg/kg/day. Compared to those with ectopy, patients with athyreosis had higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and lower thyroxine at diagnosis {{as well as more}} delayed bone maturation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of a longer acting preparation of the gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue goserelin (Zoladex LA, 10. 8 mg) in 12 girls with central precocious or early puberty.  METHODS—Two girls started treatment de novo; the remainder had been on suppressive treatment for a median duration of 1. 5 (range, 0. 2 - 5. 6) years. Assessment comprising <b>auxology,</b> pubertal staging, and pelvic ultrasound examination was carried out at weeks 0, 4, 8, 10, and 12 (first cycle) and weeks 8, 10, and 12 (second cycle) to evaluate the required injection frequency. Thereafter, assessment {{was performed on the}} day of injection. Zoladex LA was given every 12 weeks unless pubertal progression occurred.  RESULTS—Satisfactory control was achieved in eight patients using this regimen, and three patients required more frequent injections. One girl was removed from the study because of clinical progression and extreme mood swings. No serious adverse effects occurred. Mean height velocity during the study period was 4. 5 cm/year (range, 3. 1 - 6. 6) compared with 6. 5 cm/year (range, 3. 8 - 9. 6) before treatment in nine patients for whom data were available.  CONCLUSIONS—Zoladex LA was effective in controlling precocious puberty in girls when given at intervals of 9 - 12 weeks and it is recommended that an initial assessment is made eight weeks after beginning treatment. ...|$|E

Thanks to the advances in medical care and technology, many persons with PWS live longer and survive to adulthood. Currently, because of the many physical and behavioral manifestations, transitional health care is not easy for these patients and is considered a very important issue. Moreover, very few studies have examined these transitional problems in young adults with PWS. In recent years, there has been great interest in improving transition planning and support for young people with PWS reaching adulthood. In this article, we underline the main clinical problems in transition and give some advice to make this period less difficult and easier for adolescents with PWS. Special attention should be paid to obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, and sleep apnea during the period of transition. In PWS, for an effective transition from childhood to adulthood, a multidisciplinary team is needed, and should maintain the same approach to food, environment, and psychiatric issues. For comprehensive care, it is necessary to involve adult endocrinologists and other medical specialists in conjunction with the pediatric team. Parental involvement is, however, a great help for supervising adolescents with PWS during this particular period. Keywords: Prader–Willi, transition period, intellectual disabilitie...|$|E

We therefore aimed to examine body composition and cardiovascular risk factors in adults born preterm and their children. Methods: A cohort of 52 adults (aged 35. 7 years, 54 % female, 31 born preterm) and their term-born children (n= 61, aged 8. 0 years, 54 % female, 60 % from a preterm parent) were studied. <b>Auxology</b> and body composition (whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were measured, and fasting blood samples taken for metabolic and hormonal assessments. Results: Adults born preterm had greater abdominal adiposity, displaying more truncal fat (p= 0. 006) and higher android to gynoid fat ratio (p= 0. 004). Although women born preterm and at term were of similar weight and BMI, men born preterm (n= 8) were on average 20 kg heavier (p= 0. 010) and of greater BMI (34. 2 vs 28. 4 kg/m 2; p= 0. 021) than men born at term (n= 16). Adults born preterm also displayed a less favourable lipid profile, including lower HDL-C concentrations (p= 0. 007) and greater total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio (p= 0. 047).

40|$|A {{cohort of}} {{survivors}} of {{congenital diaphragmatic hernia}} (CDH), with matched controls, was studied to assess growth, respiratory function, and exercise performance. Nineteen of 24 survivors from an 11 year period (79 %) were compared with 19 matched controls. Subjects had detailed <b>auxology,</b> performed spirometry and cycle ergometry, and completed questionnaires about respiratory symptoms and exercise. There {{were no significant differences}} between the groups for height, weight, sitting height, head circumference, or body mass index expressed as SD scores. The mean (95 % confidence interval) percentage predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) was 84. 7 % (79. 1 to 90. 3) in index cases and 96. 5 % (91. 4 to 101. 6) in controls (p < 0. 01). There was no significant difference in total lung capacity. Expiratory flow rates corrected for FVC were also similar between groups, suggesting normal airway function relative to lung size. Mean maximum oxygen consumption in ml/kg/min was 40. 1 (36. 8 to 43. 4) and 42. 2 (38. 5 to 45. 8) in index and control cases. These differences were not significant. Index cases achieved a similar minute ventilation to controls by more rapid and shallower breathing. Index cases had lower perception of their own fitness and lower enjoyment of exercise, although habitual activity levels were similar. Survivors of CDH repair have reduced functional lung volumes, but normal airway function compared with matched controls. They have no growth impairment nor significant impairment of exercise performance, although they have more negative perceptions of their own fitness.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Cushing's disease (CD) in prepubertal {{children}} {{is very rare}} and presents important diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We report experience of the management of this subpopulation of CD patients. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Retrospective patient case note review. RESULTS: Between 1985 and 2008, 17 prepubertal children (13 M, 4 F), aged 5. 7 - 14. 1 years presented to our centre for diagnosis and management of CD. All children had subnormal linear growth and excessive weight gain at presentation. A high proportion (85 % of males, 75 % of females) had evidence of excessive virilisation. Striae and hypertension were seen in 41 % of patients. The investigation with highest sensitivity (100 %) for CD was excessive increase of serum cortisol to i. v. CRH (mean increase 113 %). Pituitary imaging performed in all the patients showed poor concordance with findings at surgery (31 %). In contrast bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus sampling (BSIPSS), performed in 11 / 16 subjects showed a high correlation with surgical findings (91 %). In 16 patients, transsphenoidal selective adenomectomy (TSS) achieved a cure rate of 44 %. However, in the 11 patients who had pre-operative BSIPSS, the cure rate was 64 %. Of the 16 patients, 9 patients who were not cured by TSS received external pituitary radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Prepubertal CD had distinctive features with increased frequency in males, abnormal <b>auxology</b> and excessive virilisation. The cortisol response to i. v.

40|$|Pituitary {{dysfunction}} is a recognised sequel {{of traumatic}} brain injury (TBI), occurring in 10 - 83 % of adult patients, but there are few data on the prevalence or natural history in childhood. Our objective was to determine pituitary function in {{children and young adults}} at least 4 years after TBI requiring paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. The effects of TBI and hypopituitarism on height, adiposity and quality of life (QOL) were also evaluated. Unselected patients discharged from the regional PICU with TBI (age < 18 years at injury) from 1999 - 2004 were recruited. Blood and urine samples were collected for baseline pituitary function testing. Height and weight were measured. Adiposity was assessed by mid-upper arm and waist circumferences and body fat percentage estimation using four-site skinfold thickness and bioelectrical impedance. <b>Auxology</b> and adiposity data were compared to local age and sex matched healthy control data. QOL questionnaires (PedsQL 4. 0 and QOL-AGHDA) were completed. Twenty subjects (median age 16. 7 years (range 9. 2 - 23. 3 years), 13 male) of 127 eligible agreed to participate at a median of 6. 8 years (range 4. 2 - 10. 3 years) since TBI; markers of injury were higher in those recruited than those who were not. Biochemical evidence of hypopituitarism was identified in only one case, possibly related to co-morbid pre-existing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Height, weight and adiposity were similar to healthy controls. Poor QOL was seen in patients with chronic functional deficits or co-morbidities.

40|$|Background: Preterm {{children}} {{are at risk}} for reduced growth in early childhood, which may predispose them to later changes in blood pressure. We studied growth and blood pressure (BP) in extremely preterm (EP) children at age 6 years. Methods: We evaluated children who were born at 25 completed weeks of gestation or less in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1995 when they reached early school age. Children underwent standardized assessments, including <b>auxology</b> and sitting blood pressure. Results: Of 308 surviving children, 241 (78 percent) were assessed at a median age of 6 years 4 months; 160 full term classmates acted as a comparison group. Compared to classmates, EP children were 1. 2 standard deviations (SD) lighter, 0. 97 SD shorter, BMI was 0. 95 SD lower and head circumference 1. 3 SD lower. Compared to 2. 5 years of age, EP children showed catch up in terms of weight by 0. 37 SD, height by 0. 42 SD and head circumference by 0. 13 SD. Systolic and diastolic BP were lower by 2. 3 mmHg and 2. 4 mmHg respectively in EP children but these differences were accounted for by differences in height and BMI. Maternal smoking in pregnancy was associated with lower BP, children born before 24 weeks had higher systolic and children given postnatal steroids higher diastolic pressures. Conclusions: Poor postnatal growth seen after birth and at in the third year persists into school age. Catch up growth reduces some of the early deficit but is least for head growth.

The Merck KGaA (Germany) funded " 360 ° GH in Europe" meeting, held in Lisbon, Portugal, in June 2016, comprised three sessions entitled "Short Stature Diagnosis and Referral," "Optimizing Patient Management and Adherence," and "Managing Transition. " The scientific program covered all stages of pediatric GH treatment, and reported here are the outcomes of the third session of the meeting, which considered transition from pediatric GH treatment to teenage and young adult GH therapy. A large number of patients with chronic diseases, including GH deficiency, drop out of therapy during the transition period. Multiple factors are associated with this, such as {{lack of understanding of}} the disease process, insufficient knowledge of treatment options, the patient becoming more independent, and requirement for interaction with a new set of health-care workers. Education regarding disease management and treatment options should be provided from an early age and right through the transition period.

Anthropometric characteristics, triglycerides (TG), total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) {{and blood pressure}} were measured. Results: Age, body mass index (BMI) and BMI z-score {{were not significantly different}} between the two subgroups. BMI z-score, TG, FPG, HOMA-IR and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were significantly higher in boys than in girls both in Brazilian and Italian adolescents, while HDL-cholesterol levels were lower in boys than in girls. No significant differences were observed in BMI, LDL and total-cholesterol and DBP in two genders and groups. Insulin, FPG, HOMA-IR and TG were significantly higher, while LDL-cholesterol and SBP were significantly lower in Brazilian than in Italian subjects, both in males and females. HDL and total-cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were not significantly different between the two subgroups and genders. MS prevalence was higher in Brazilian than in Italian obese boys (34. 8 vs. 23. 6 %, p < 0. 001) and girls (15. 6 vs. 12. 5 %, p < 0. 01). The most frequently altered parameter was HOMA-IR both in subjects with MS (100 % in Brazilian and 81. 8 % in Italian) and without MS (42. 9 % and 11. 7 %). Conclusion: Metabolic syndrome represents a worldwide emerging health problem in different ethnical populations, the alterations of the risk factors related to MS (different in their prevalence between different subgroups) being strictly linked to the degree of obesity.

40|$|SUMMARY This paper {{describes}} {{views of}} the Health Services Human Growth Hormone Committee on how a child suspected of growth hormone deficiency should be investigated in a district general hospital or in a regional growth centre. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency is rare whereas short children are common. The successful manage-ment {{of children who are}} short or failing to grow normally will depend on an effective partnership between the paediatrician working in a district general hospital and those in charge of the 20 regional growth centres in the UK. The former sees the majority of short children whereas the latter have special expertise in growth problems and the facilities necessary for the full investigation ofpatients who may need GH therapy. The evaluation of a short child or one whose growth has slowed encompasses all aspects of paediatrics and the initial expert assessment by a paediatric consultant who knows the child in his environment is complementary, not supplementary, to the expertise of the paediatric endocrinologist working in a growth centre. Two lines of investiga-tion are essential in making the diagnosis of GH deficiency: <b>auxology</b> and endocrinology. Just as there are many causes of short stature other than GH deficiency, a low peak plasma GH level is not sufficient to make the diagnosis in a child who is growing at a normal rate, be he short or not. The measurement of height is painless but unfortunately some of the GH stimulation tests are unpleasant and in unskilled hands may be dangerous. It is therefore vital that a national scheme for the clinical evalu-ation and investigation of these patients uses the skills of the district general hospital and the regional growth centre rationally so that a specific diagnosis can be made with the minimum discomfort and inconvenience to the child.

40|$|Growth hormone (GH) {{deficiency}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequent endocrine problems occurring in cancer survivors, particularly when there is a previous history of central nervous system (CNS) tumour and submission to radiotherapy (RT). Material andWe retrospectively assessed pediatric cancer survivors with GH deficiency, submitted to GH treatment from 1988 to 2010 in a tertiary level hospital. We analised the following data: sex, age, oncologic diagnosis, oncologic treatment, <b>auxology,</b> Tanner puberty stage, final height, target height and other associated endocrine problems. We determined the height z-score difference between the beginning and the end of GH treatment (for patients who ended treatment), and between the beginning of GH treatment and the last observation (for patients who are currently on treatment), which was defined as the dependent variable. SPSS® version 17. 0 was used for statistical analysis. A sample of 18 patients was obtained, 12 male, with a median age of cancer diagnosis of six years old. The diagnostics were CNS tumors (n= 15) and hematologic neoplasia (n= 3). Cancer treatment modalities were craniospinal RT (n= 9), cranial RT (n= 4), chemotherapy (n= 14) and CNS surgery (n= 15). The median of time between cancer treatment and beginning of GH treatment was 4 years and 8 months. Height z-score difference was positive in 12 patients. Statistical significant differences between medians and centiles of height z-score difference occurred in patients submitted to craniospinal RT (- 0. 08), cranial RT (0. 59) and no RT (1. 56) (p= 0. 003, IC 95 %). The biggest differences between final height and target height (- 10 and - 11. 5 cm) occurred in two patients submitted to craniospinal RT, with associated precocious puberty. Our results are consistent with previous studies, which point to a lesser efficacy of GH treatment when there is a past history of RT, namely craniospinal RT, and in association with precocious puberty.

Design   Three-year prospective study. Measurements   <b>Auxology,</b> blood pressure (BP), biochemical analysis of blood and urine, pelvic ultrasound in girls. Results   Fifty-two patients were recruited of whom one girl had nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (17 -OHP 17 nmol/l) and one had insufficient blood for analysis. The final cohort comprised 42 girls of mean (SD) age 7 · 7 (0 · 99) and eight boys of 8 · 8 (0 · 67) years. Mean (SD) birth weight was 3 · 27 (0 · 49) and 3 · 10 (0 · 76) kg in girls and boys respectively. Height/weight SDS were 1 · 13 / 1 · 69 in girls and 1 · 69 / 1 · 88 in boys. Mean systolic/diastolic BP was 107 · 8 / 60 · 4 (50 th– 75 th centile) in girls and 115 · 5 / 63 · 9 (75 th– 91 st centile) in boys. Uterine and ovarian development was prepubertal. Median serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) was 2 · 1 and 4 · 1 μmol/l, androstenedione 3 · 1 and 3 · 8 nmol/l in girls and boys respectively, with DHEAS within the reference range/undetectable in 18 / 2 and androstenedione in 12 / 6 patients. Fasting insulin was 9 · 0 and 15 · 0 mU/l in girls and boys respectively, with concomitant low normal SHBG. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) was 15 · 7 pmol/l in 27 girls, compared with 5 · 0 pmol/l in normal girls aged 5 – 8 years. Conclusions   Our Scottish EA cohort showed female predominance, no evidence of reduced foetal growth, a tendency to overweight with commensurate mild hyperinsulinaemia and modest elevation of serum androgens in some patients. We have found raised AMH levels in the girls, indicating advanced ovarian follicular development. </p...|$|E
40|$|The role of GH {{insufficiency}} in {{the pathogenesis}} of short stature in Noonan syndrome is unclear. Cross-sectional study. Seventeen patients with Noonan syndrome (13 boys, 4 girls; aged 4. 8 - 13. 3 (mean 9. 2) years) and short stature before start of GH treatment. Spontaneous 12 -h overnight GH secretion by continuous sampling analysed using Pulsar, plasma IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 levels, and 24 -h urinary GH excretion were measured at start of GH treatment. A glucagon stimulation test was performed. Height and height velocity were monitored before and after 1 year of GH treatment. IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 were remeasured after 1 year of GH treatment. Nine of the 17 children had a mean overnight GH concentration below the lower limit of the normal range. In six of the 17 patients, overnight GH profiles showed high trough GH concentrations. Glucagon stimulation tests were normal in 16 of the 17 patients. Mean IGF-I level was below normal (- 0. 4 SD). None of the parameters regarding GH secretion obtained from the overnight profile or provocative test was related to height or height velocity, nor to first year response to GH treatment. IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 did not correlate {{with any of the}} GH secretion data. IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 were related to height and height velocity at the start of GH treatment (r = 0. 53 (P < 0. 01) and r = 0. 61 (P < 0. 03) respectively). Rises in IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 under GH treatment were related to the increment in height velocity (r = 0. 70 (P < 0. 01) and r = 0. 71 (P < 0. 02) respectively). Abnormalities in GH secretion are frequent in patients with Noonan syndrome and short stature. These abnormalities were not related to <b>auxology</b> at start of or response to GH treatment. Clinically GH insufficiency is not important in Noonan syndrome and monitoring spontaneous GH secretion is not necessary before the start of GH treatment...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} problems facing forensic medicine is that of estimating the age of living subjects, as in cases where individuals are undergoing criminal proceedings, or are requesting asylum. In cases where authorities are in doubt {{about the age of}} a suspected criminal, forensic age estimation is often requested in order to determine if the suspect is of an age in which he may be charged with a crime [1]. In many European countries, the need for accurate age estimation techniques has never been greater than in the last two decades. This is partly due to armed conflicts within the subjects’ native countries, resulting in an increased number of immigrants and asylum-seekers. In cases such as these, the refugee’s birth might never have been registered, and often, identity documents may never have been issued. Often one of the criteria for having asylum granted is being a minor [2]. In Italy, the age at which a person becomes legally responsible is 14 years. If such a person were charged with a crime, he would be tried in juvenile court, and if convicted, would face the possibility of serving time in a detention center designated for non-adults. At 18 years of age a person is considered to be an adult, and would therefore be tried according to general criminal laws. Determining the age of a living individual is a rather time consuming task and requires an interdisciplinary approach which involves the services of physicians with forensic experience, knowledge of <b>auxology,</b> radiology, dentistry, and legal medicine [3]. The most commonly used indicators used in age assessment are those related to somatic, sexual, skeletal, and dental maturity [4]. This case study involves the ascertainment of the ages of illegal immigrants from non-EU countries who lacked proper identification documents, and who were either accused of committing a crime and/or requesting asylum. The main objective {{of this study was to}} verify the differences and/or similarities between skeletal and dental age assessments. In order to achieve this, a comparison of left hand/wrist radiographs and orthopantomograms (OPGs) was first carried out, followed up by a comparison of reported ages and assessed ages...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background An {{increasing}} number of foetuses are recognized as having double Y because of {{the widespread use of}} prenatal screening using chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis. 47, XYY karyotype occurs in about one out of 1, 000 newborn males, but it is not often detected unless it is diagnosed during prenatal testing. Despite the fact that unbiased follow-up studies demonstrate largely normal post-natal development of young men with 47, XYY, there is a scarcity of controlled studies about the neurological, cognitive and behavioural phenotype which remains the main reason for anxiety and anticipatory negative attitudes of parents. Furthermore, prejudices still exist among professionals and the general population concerning the relationship between this sex chromosome aneuploidy and aggressive and antisocial behaviours. Methods We report on the clinical follow-up of children diagnosed prenatally with a 47,XYY karyotype, whose parents received multidisciplinary counselling and support at time of diagnosis. The specific focus of our study is on <b>auxology,</b> facial features, developmental milestones, behaviour, detection of aggressiveness as well as the evaluation of parental attitudes toward prenatal counselling. Clinical evaluations including auxological measurements and dysmorphological descriptions were as conducted on 13 boys aged 9 month - 7 years. The Child Behavior Check List test specific for age and a 15 item questionnaire were administered to both parents. An update of ongoing problems was carried out by means of a telephone interview two years later. Results Our results show that, from birth, weight, height and head circumference were above average values while some facial features such mild hypertelorism are overrepresented when compared to parents' facial features. Language delay was detected in 8 out of 11 children older than 20 months. Parental attitudes were found to be favourable toward prenatal diagnoses of sexual chromosome aneuploidies. Conclusions Our data, although limited, is similar to other observational studies, and serves to alert clinicians about opportunities to delineate new and appropriate educational interventions that target the specific learning challenges of XYY boys. Our experience better defines the early manifestation of XYY and should aid those involved in prenatal counselling and paediatric surveillance. </p...|$|E

PWS’ clinical picture seems to resemble the classic non-PWS GH deficiency (GHD), including short stature, excessive body fat, decreased muscle mass, and impaired quality of life. GH therapy is able to ameliorate the phenotypic appearance of the syndrome, as well as to improve body composition, physical strength, and cognitive level. In this regard, however, some pathophysiologic and clinical questions still remain, representing a challenge to give the most appropriate care to PWS patients. Data about the prevalence of GHD in PWS children are not unequivocal, ranging from 40 % to 100 %. In this context, to establish whether the presence (or not) of GHD may have a different effect on clinical course during GH therapy may be helpful. In addition, the comparison of GH effects in PWS children diagnosed as small for gestational age with those obtained in subjects born appropriate for gestational age is of potential interest for future trials. Emerging information seems to demonstrate the maintenance of beneficial effects of GH therapy in PWS subjects after adolescent years. Thus, GH retesting after achievement of final height should be taken into consideration for all PWS patients. However, it is noteworthy that GH administration exerts positive effects both in PWS adults with and without GHD. Another critical issue is to clarify whether the genotype–phenotype correlations may be relevant to specific outcome measures related to GH therapy. Moreover, progress of our understanding of the role of GH replacement and concomitant therapies on bone characteristics of PWS is required. Finally, a long-term surveillance of benefits and risks of GH therapy is strongly recommended for PWS population, since most of the current studies are uncontrolled and of short duration.

It {{has been reported that}} grass pollen subcutaneous immunotherapy is effective in drug-resistant patients. In a real-life study, we evaluated the efficacy of 5 -grass pollen tablets in patients with grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis not responsive to drug therapy. Methods: We carried out this multicenter observational study in adults and adolescents with grass-induced allergic rhinitis not responsive to drug therapy who were treated for a year with 5 -grass pollen tablets. Clinical data collected before and after sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) included Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) classification of allergic rhinitis, response to therapy, and patient satisfaction. Results: Forty-seven patients entered the study. By ARIA classification, three patients had moderate to severe intermittent allergic rhinitis, ten had mild persistent allergic rhinitis, and 34 had moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis. There were no cases of mild intermittent allergic rhinitis before SLIT. After SLIT, 33 patients had mild intermittent allergic rhinitis, none had moderate to severe intermittent allergic rhinitis, seven had mild persistent allergic rhinitis, and seven had moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis. The mean medication score decreased from 4. 2 ± 1. 3 before to 2. 4 ± 2. 0 after SLIT (P< 0. 01), representing a reduction of 42 %. The response to treatment before SLIT was judged as poor by 70 % of patients and very poor by 30 %. Patient satisfaction was significantly increased after SLIT (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Background and objective: Childhood {{obesity is}} a serious global health problem and it is {{associated}} with insulin resistance and significantly increased risk for development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Metformin {{reduces the risk of}} developing T 2 D in adult patients with obesity and insulin resistance. However there is limited and inconclusive data in obese non diabetic children and adolescents. The objective of the Metformin in Obese Children and Adolescents (MOCA trial) was to assess the effect of metformin on body composition, metabolic risk factors and adipokines. Design and methods: The MOCA trial was a six month multi-centre randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of metformin (1. 5 g daily) in children and adolescents (8 - 18 years) with insulin resistance and/or impaired glucose tolerance. <b>Auxology,</b> blood pressure measurement and fasting blood tests (insulin, glucose, fasting lipids, ALT, bilirubin, CRP, lactate, resistin, adiponectin, leptin) were performed at baseline, three and six months. A prolonged oral glucose tolerance test was performed at baseline and after six months. Measures of insulin resistance/sensitivity were calculated including HOMA-IR and the adiponectin: leptin (A/L) ratio. Results: 151 obese children participated in the trial (metformin: 77, placebo: 78). 102 (67. 5 %) female, 99 (65. 6 %) post-pubertal, 115 (76. 2 %) White British and 36 (23. 8 %) British Asian or Afro-Caribbean. Mean age of participants was 13. 7 ± 2. 3 year and mean BMI-SDS 3. 4 (0. 5). In regression analysis, controlling for baseline values, sex, ethnicity and pubertal status, metformin had a greater treatment effect over placebo for BMI at three months, that was sustained at six months (- 0. 25 kg/m 2, p= 0. 01, 95 % CI 0. 29 to 1. 86) and BMI-SDS (- 0. 1, p= 0. 01, 95 % CI 0. 02 to 0. 19). Fasting glucose reduced (- 0. 03 mmol/l, p= 0. 03) and A/L ratio increased at three months (+ 0. 04, p= 0. 03), but the improvements were lost at six months. The other measures of insulin sensitivity, metabolic risk factors and concentrations of adipokines did not change with metformin treatment. Conclusions: Metformin therapy for obese children with abnormal insulin glucose status is safe, well tolerated and has a small beneficial treatment effect over placebo for BMI, BMI-SDS, fasting glucose and A/L ratio at three months, with the changes in body composition sustained at six months. A three month course of metformin should be considered by Paediatricians to halt the inexorable rise in BMI-SDS in these children, improve insulin glucose status and act as catalyst and support for more radical change in lifestyle in the individual.
