This is usually because the defendant may {{have some kind of}} insurance coverage (like homeowners' insurance or <b>automobile</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance).</b> As a matter of public policy, insurers are barred from covering intentional torts like IIED, but may be liable for NIED committed by their policyholders, and therefore are targeted indirectly in this fashion as deep pockets.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} the <b>automobile</b> third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> and several bonus malus system are {{compared}} in it {{on the basis of}} Loimaranta efficiency. Very important task for actuary is creating rating system that will fairly distributed the burden of claims among policyholders. For these purposes, most insurance companies use generalized linear models, especially Poisson regression. Thanks to these models the a priori tariff structure is created. But some heterogeneity still remains in this tariff structure. Therefore, insurance companies use the bonus malus system that rewards good drivers and penalizes bad drivers. In this paper the bonus malus system for sample of data is created and bayesian relativities are computed. Then this bonus malus system is compared with several bonus malus systems from Czech Republic. The elasticity of these bonus malus systems is examined and then Loimaranta efficiency is used as main tool for comparison these systems...|$|R

If certain assumptions hold, like the conditional Poisson {{distribution of the}} policyholders claim number, then an interesting task is to evaluate the so called claims frequency of the individuals.

The article is devoted to choose the method, which fits to the frequency parameters the best for certain input parameters. For measuring the goodness-of-fit we will use scores, similar to better known divergence measures. The detailed method is also suitable to compare bonus-malus systems in the sense that how much information they contain about drivers...|$|R

40|$|Leaving aside {{difficult}} to interpret doctrinal developments, such as the abrogation of traditional immunities, <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> has at least the following six impacts on tort law in action. First, for claims against all but the wealthiest individuals and organizations, <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> is a de facto element of tort <b>liability.</b> Second, <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> limits are a de facto cap on tort damages. Third, tort claims are shaped to match the available <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> {{with the result that}} <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> policy exclusions become de facto limits on tort <b>liability.</b> Fourth, <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> makes lawsuits against ordinary individuals and small organizations into repeat player lawsuits on the defense side, making tort law in action less focused on the fault of individual defendants and more focused on managing aggregate costs. Fifth, <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> personnel transform complex tort rules into simple rules of thumb, also with the result that tort law in action is less concerned with the fault of individual defendants than tort law on the books.

After reviewing some of the most interesting new regulatory changes, our paper proposes a new area of discussion: The merger of the four provincial insurance regulatory bodies to combat insurance fraud. We base our paper on the principle that recent premium increases are mainly due to an increase in insurance fraud. We show that merging the regulatory bodies may reduce insurance fraud if the merger allows savings on the average audit cost and on the development of better fraud detection technology. Finally, we suggest a fraud reducing insurance taxation scheme to finance insurance fraud investigations. [...] Insurance Fraud,Asymmetric Information,Insurance Taxation,Public Policy...|$|E

40|$|This essay explores how <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> mediates the {{boundary}} between torts and crime. <b>Liability</b> <b>insurance</b> sometimes separates these two legal fields, for example {{through the application of}} standard insurance contract provisions that exclude insurance coverage for some crimes that are also torts. Perhaps less obviously, <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> also can draw parts of the tort and criminal fields together. For example, professional <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> civilizes the criminal law experience for some crimes that are also torts by providing defendants with an insurance-paid criminal defense that provides more than ordinary means to contest the state 2 ̆ 7 s accusations. The crime-tort separation in <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> cannot be explained by economic incentives, alone. Morality matters, too. The fact that <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> sometimes provides coverage for criminal defense costs suggests that <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> institutions could cover a broader swath of crime torts than they do, providing further support for the claim that consequentialist reasoning, alone, cannot explain the observed relationship between <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> torts, and crime. The tort-crime separation reflects and reinforces a concept of <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> as protection for defendants, rather than as a fund for victims. In turn, this concept of insurance reflects and reinforces an understanding of tort claims as encounters between particular plaintiffs and defendants, rather than as a price setting or loss spreading insurance mechanism...|$|R
