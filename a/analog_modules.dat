5000|$|The lapse {{of patents}} in recent years, such {{as for the}} Moog {{synthesizer}} transistor ladder filter, has spurred a return of DIY and kit synthesizer modules, {{as well as an}} increase in the number of commercial companies selling <b>analog</b> <b>modules.</b> Reverse engineering has also revealed the secrets of some synthesizer components, such as those from ARP Instruments, Inc. In addition, despite the widespread availability during the 2000s of relatively inexpensive digital synthesizers that offered complex synthesis algorithms and envelopes, some musicians are attracted to the sounds of monophonic and polyphonic analog synths. While some musicians embrace analog synthesizers as preferable, others counter that analog and digital synthesis simply represent different sonic generation processes that both reproduce characteristics the other misses. Another factor considered to have increased use of analog synths since the 1990s is weariness with the complex screen-based navigation systems of digital synths, with the [...] "hands-on", practical controls of analog synths—potentiometer knobs, faders, and other features—offering a strong appeal.|$|E

50|$|In 1969, Salvatore Martirano, {{along with}} a group of {{engineers}} and musicians at the University of Illinois, began work on the design and construction of a musical electronic instrument. The instrument, named the SAL-MAR Construction, is a hybrid system in which TTL logical circuits (small and medium scale integration) drive <b>analog</b> <b>modules,</b> such as voltage-controlled oscillators, amplifiers and filters. The performer sits at a horizontal control panel of 291 lightable touch-sensitive switches (no moving parts). The two-state switches are used by a performer to dial sequences of numbers that are characterized by a variety of intervals and lengths. A sequence may bypass, address, or be added to other sequences forming an interlocked tree of control and data according to a performer's choice. The unique characteristic of the switch is that it can be driven both manually and logically, which allows human/machine interaction. The most innovative feature of the human/machine interface is that it allows the user to switch from control of macro to micro parameters of the information output. This is analogous to a zoom lens on a camera.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, a new {{approach}} of fuzzy modeling with emphasis on analog hardware implementation is suggested. In the suggested approach, the input space of each input variable is partitioned independently through the modified form of fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm to generate the membership functions. By considering all the possible combinations between the membership functions of the input variables and the cluster centers, the complete rule-base is generated through reference to the available input-output data. The output membership functions are taken to be singletons for easy and straightforward implementation in analog domain. The created rule-base is then optimized through the exhaustive search techniques suggested by the authors. The suggested approach has been applied on fuzzy controller data for rapid Nickel-Cadmium batteries charger developed [1]. The data for the batteries charger has been obtained through experimentation with an objective to charge the batteries as fast as possible. Special purpose <b>analog</b> <b>modules,</b> designed by the authors and realized with operational amplifiers (op-amps), diodes, resistors are considered for hardware implementation. The proposed fuzzy modeling design approach is described in Part I. Part II describes the synthesis and analog implementation.

This error constraint minimizes large spurious deviations in the input signal and the convergence problems that arise if multiple solutions exist or if the desired signal does not exist in the feasible signal space. As an additional attractive advantage, this formulation preserves the core iteration structure of a SPICE-like simulator without modifications, greatly easing implementation. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract— — High-speed input/outputs (I/O) are {{in demand}} due to {{advances}} in integrated circuits (ICs), {{which made it}} possible to obtain multi gigahertz clock speeds. However, as very large scale integration (VLSI) technology scales down, the pin bandwidth does not scale accordingly. Some factors to consider in designing of high-speed I/Os are the integration of analog and digital circuitry, the interconnect performance, the precision required in processing of analog signals, and the sensitivity of analog circuit to noise, crosstalk and interference. Given that I/O design involves the emergence of both analog and digital circuitry, the design flow is comprised of a mixed-signal scheme. Less experienced designers usually use ad hoc methods to simulate the trade-offs between digital and <b>analog</b> <b>modules,</b> since {{there is a lack of}} standard simulation test-benches.
