Dahan was satisfied, because Farmer had a clear and deep voice and could easily reach high notes. Initial rehearsals were held at Dahan's home. Dahan has said of these rehearsals: [...] "There was a large room with a piano and there we repeated the staging of the song. Mylène had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>understanding</b> all this, we had to teach her everything, starting with the choreography [...] This probably did not look very professional." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] is {{a parody}} of Nirvana's song [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", written and {{performed}} by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic; it was released both as a single {{and as part of}} Yankovic's Off the Deep End album in April 1992. [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] was written during a three-year career low for Yankovic after the financial failure of his film UHF, but captured the quickly-rising popularity of the grunge style and Nirvana's success. The song was written to poke fun at the fact that many people had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>understanding</b> Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's lyrics in the original song. After being unable to contact Nirvana by conventional means, Yankovic called Cobain while the band was on the set of Saturday Night Live, where Cobain quickly gave permission to record the parody.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} {{accepting}} of the character. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club was slightly more positive towards the concept of Adam. He wrote that he [...] "love the idea of Adam" [...] but was having <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>understanding</b> the coherence of his application to the main plot. He cited inconsistencies in Adam's existence, noting, [...] "Adam killed Professor Walsh weeks ago, and yet The Initiative is still fully operational, and no one seems overly bothered {{by the fact that}} one of their leaders was building a monster." [...] Murray, however, did conclude that the show's writers and producers [...] "did a decent job of bringing [...] to a conclusion". Despite critiquing the larger plot, Murray was [...] "always impressed with [...] costume/make-up". Furthermore, he was positively surprised that it [...] "took [...] a minute to recognize" [...] Adam's appearance in [...] "Restless" [...] sans makeup.|$|E

50|$|Symbolic gesture is the {{specific}} term that encompasses baby sign. This form of gesture aids in communication {{through the use}} of hand movements that represent an item or feeling. Infants are quick to note if there is a connection between an item and a symbolic gesture. Once they make the connection infants will imitate actions that are produced by the caregiver. Consistency from the caregiver is crucial during the teaching and feedback stage in order for infants to learn from repetition. This repetition applies to how the caregiver uses the sign and in what way the sign is associated with the object or emotion. If the association changes then the child will have <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>understanding</b> how the symbolic gesture links to the item. One way for caregivers to ensure the infant associates the symbolic gesture with the object or emotion is to gain the infant's attention, and say the name of the object {{at the same time that}} the sign is performed.|$|R
500|$|Davis {{appreciated}} Hammond's {{closeness to}} the SG-1 team and {{his willingness to}} compromise. At {{the beginning of the}} series, Hammond does not accept the alien warrior Teal'c but comes to trust and respect him after realizing Teal'c's devotion to the Stargate Program. Despite his admiration for Dr. Daniel Jackson's enthusiasm in the beginning, Hammond has <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>understanding</b> Daniel's unorthodox and non-military approach to problems until Hammond comes to realize the importance of a civilian viewpoint to SG-1's mission. When the alien Jonas Quinn joins SG-1 in season 6, Davis compared Hammond's response to Jonas to his reaction to Teal'c in season 1. Although Hammond does not blame Jonas for Daniel's death in [...] "Meridian", [...] "the situation does make it difficult for [...] to totally take the young man under his wing and embrace him like family as he has the rest of SG-1". Davis named the NID as Hammond's only source of frustration, since they regularly outflank Hammond and SG-1. Hammond's only option is to call the President for support, but most cases end with SG-1 or Hammond breaking the rules to assure the survival of humanity, so [...] "Hammond will do whatever he must to get things done".|$|E
500|$|As Elizabeth aged {{her image}} {{gradually}} changed. She was portrayed as Belphoebe or Astraea, {{and after the}} Armada, as Gloriana, the eternally youthful Faerie Queene of Edmund Spenser's poem. Her painted portraits became less realistic and more a set of enigmatic icons that made her look much younger than she was. In fact, her skin had been scarred by smallpox in 1562, leaving her half bald and dependent on wigs and cosmetics. Her love of sweets and fear of dentists contributed to severe tooth decay and loss {{to such an extent}} that foreign ambassadors had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>understanding</b> her speech. André Hurault de Maisse, Ambassador Extraordinary from Henry IV of France, reported an audience with the queen, during which he noticed, [...] "her teeth are very yellow and unequal... and on the left side less than on the right. Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly." [...] Yet he added, [...] "her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal." [...] Sir Walter Raleigh called her [...] "a lady whom time had surprised". However, the more Elizabeth's beauty faded, the more her courtiers praised it.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the story was that while each case is a {{standalone}} episode, they are also all interlinked, forming a larger mystery, with each episode revealing {{a piece of the}} puzzle. Because Edgeworth is portrayed as a genius prosecutor, whereas Phoenix Wright is a rookie attorney, the development team felt that they needed to come up with incidents that were larger in scale for Ace Attorney Investigations, to match Edgeworth's skill level; therefore, the opponents were made [...] "more formidable" [...] compared to the ones in previous games in the series. Eshiro saw the story as {{the most important part of}} the game, and said that, while time consuming, it was important to make sure that it works. This was accomplished through a lot of trial and error, and several rewrites and revisions: Yamazaki would come up with an idea, which was tested to see if players had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>understanding</b> it. Based on feedback from the testers, Yamazaki would rewrite and reorder some parts, and add hints. When creating the game's story, the development team took into account that some players might not have played any Ace Attorney games before. Because of this, they tried to make the game as accessible as possible, and make it playable without first having played any of the previous titles; for instance, the first part of the game is a tutorial that introduces the game and the characters. They did however add in-jokes for players who had played previous Ace Attorney games. Kay Faraday was the first new character that was created for the game, and was cited by Eshiro as one of his favorite characters.|$|E

40|$|Community Health Status Indicators Project ” (1) is a {{fascinating}} article that describes how county-level poverty data were created into maps.

I have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> enough <b>time</b> <b>understanding</b> the math, and I doubt whether one in a thousand elected officials could understand the maps or the data analysis if the mathematical formulae had to be explained. As a past local, regional, and state health director, I have had to elucidate many complex issues to elected officials to persuade them to implement policies that would improve the health of those for whom I was responsible. Is there some way to add transitional explanations to articles such as this one that would allow my students to use the maps (or similar maps) to work with policy makers during their internships to improve the health status of our communities?

2500|$|The modern {{trend in}} most {{countries}} and languages is towards the naming method used to describe US immigrants because it emphasises the status as full and equal citizens of the new country while providing information about cultural roots. This system is also more appropriate to the situation of immigrants who {{have been living in}} the new country for a long time, especially when they stop using the original language. In any case, the self-designation of all population groups is nowadays however considered more important than any other criteria. Swedish-speaking inhabitants of Finland whose ancestors have lived there for centuries almost exclusively consider themselves Finns in the English sense of the word, the [...] "Swedish-speaking Finns" [...] is preferred by the most representative political organisation of the Swedish-speaking population of Finland, the Swedish Assembly of Finland. Many Finns and Swedes are unaware that the English word [...] "Finn" [...] usually means [...] "a native or inhabitant of Finland" [...] ( [...] , [...] ) and only sometimes also has the meaning [...] "a member of a people speaking Finnish or a Finnic language" [...] or has this as its primary but not exclusive meaning. More specifically, due to the extremely small number of immigrants in Finland, Finns still have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>understanding</b> that the normal English expression for a naturalised Finnish citizen who immigrated from Vietnam, for example, is a Vietnamese Finn.

40|$|I am {{finishing}} my {{long journey}} of graduate study. It {{was all about}} a story how God worked on my life. My family and I experienced many milestones and challenges during this period: my father got cancer so I returned to Korea {{for a year and}} half to care for him, I got married, and my wife is now pregnant. Going through these tough or joyful times, I became closer to God and developed capability to understand and care for other people. This is such a precious experience that I would not exchange with anything else. Specifically, I had very <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> with my father when he got cancer and I stayed with him to support. Our relationship was broken and I came back to Ann Arbor with a broken heart after spending a year and half with him. Celebrating my defense with my father was hard to imagine at that point. However, God worked in a wonderful way to reconcile us by toughing the hearts of both of us. One late night when I was working on my experiments in the lab, I was physically and mentally exhausted because of much pressure. God reminded me how <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> my father had when he took chemotherapies and I had tears in my eyes because I gave him <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> without <b>understanding</b> his pain of chemotherapy. To make a long story short, my father and I celebrated together after my finishing the oral defense. iv I give my thanks to my wife Eun Young who supported and encouraged me through times.

40|$|The {{big bang}} marks the {{beginning}} of time. Since then people have been thinking about time - what it actually is, is it ever going to end, etc. Children have <b>a</b> particularly <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>understanding</b> concepts of <b>time</b> and that is why teachers must teach them sistematicly and gradually, because this {{plays an important role in}} students' understanding of the matter. In my seminar paper I first researched the background of the concept itself - the history of time and methods of measuring time. I then focused on the development of children's <b>understanding</b> of <b>time</b> and the difficulties they encounter during the process. Finaly, I studied the goals and teaching contents concerning time that students are presented with in the third grade. Based on the material I have read, I then wanted to research how well the students know and understand time concepts before and after the sistematic teaching, how good is their sense of time duration, how they read time and also what progress they can achieve. Before the beginning of classes, the students had to take a test which included some questions about time. That is how I got a sense of their prior knowledge. Then, during the whole week, the students studied about concepts of time,in subjets such as mathematics, nature study and Slovene, where they learned new words, refreshed their knowledge of familiar ones, developed their sense of time, learned to read time, got to know different kinds of clocks and their development, etc. At the end of the week, the children retook the same test about time they did at the beginning of the experiment. The results have shown that the students' knowledge improved the most when it came to reading time, there was also a visible progress in their sense of time duration but there was only a slight improvement in their knowledge of the actual concept. ...|$|R
