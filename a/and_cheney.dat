5|$|A {{few months}} before the {{election}} Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. This change was necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors to vote for both Bush <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> without contravening the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids electors from voting for someone from their own state for both President and Vice President.|$|E
5|$|On July 25, 2000, Bush {{surprised}} {{some observers}} when he selected Dick Cheney—a former White House Chief of Staff, U.S. Representative, and Secretary of Defense—to be his running mate. At the time, Cheney was serving {{as head of}} Bush's Vice-Presidential search committee. Soon after at the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> were officially nominated by the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Bush <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> were re-elected in the 2004 presidential election, {{running against}} John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards. During the election, the {{pregnancy}} {{of his daughter}} Mary and her sexual orientation as a lesbian became a source of public attention for Cheney {{in light of the}} same-sex marriage debate. Cheney has stated that he is in favor of gay marriages personally, but that each individual U.S. state should decide whether to permit it or not.|$|E

25|$|Like his {{predecessors}} Carlucci <b>and</b> <b>Cheney,</b> Aspin faced the perennial issue of base closures, which could also affect the Defense budget. In March 1993 he released {{a plan to}} close an additional 31 large military installations and to shrink or consolidate 134 other sites, projecting a savings of over $3 billion a year beginning in 2000. A new Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission approved the proposal, which went into effect when Congress accepted it as a package.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, SFPD {{developed}} a partial DNA profile from the saliva on stamps and envelopes of Zodiac's letters. SFPD compared this partial DNA to the DNA of Arthur Leigh Allen. A DNA comparison was also {{made with the}} DNA of Don Cheney, who was Allen's former close friend and {{the first person to}} suggest Allen may be the Zodiac Killer. Since neither test result indicated a match, Allen <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> were excluded as the contributors of the DNA, though it cannot be stated definitively that it is DNA from the Zodiac on the envelopes.|$|E
25|$|In modern elections, {{a running}} mate is often {{selected}} in order {{to appeal to a}} different set of voters. A Habitation Clause issue arose during the 2000 presidential election contested by George W. Bush (running-mate Dick Cheney) and Al Gore (running-mate Joe Lieberman), because it was alleged that Bush <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> were both inhabitants of Texas and that the Texas electors therefore violated the Twelfth Amendment in casting their ballots for both. Bush's residency was unquestioned, as he was Governor of Texas at the time. Cheney and his wife had moved to Dallas five years earlier when he assumed the role of chief executive at Halliburton. Cheney grew up in Wyoming and had represented it in Congress. A few months before the election, he switched his voter registration and driver's license to Wyoming and put his home in Dallas up for sale. Three Texas voters challenged the election in a federal court in Dallas and then appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where it was dismissed.|$|E

25|$|Obama, {{having a}} Caucasian mother and Kenyan {{father of the}} Luo ethnic group, became the first African American {{as well as the}} first bi-racial {{president}}. Although he may have been the first black president to win an election, Obama was not the first African American to run for president. Shirley Chisolm, Jesse Jackson, Lenora Fulani, Carol Moseley Braun, Alan Keyes, and Al Sharpton all at some point were in the process for presidential nomination. The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history on which neither candidate was a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant; Biden is Roman Catholic and is the first Roman Catholic to be elected Vice President; all other tickets with Catholic vice presidential candidates had been defeated (1964, 1972, 1984). Obama and Biden were the first President and Vice President elected from the Senate since 1960 (John F. Kennedy/Lyndon B. Johnson) (in the previous election cycle (2004) Democrats also nominated two sitting Senators, John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, but they lost to incumbents Bush <b>and</b> <b>Cheney),</b> Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy, and the Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning Democratic ticket to feature two Northerners since 1940 (Franklin D. Roosevelt/Henry A. Wallace). Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. This was the first presidential election since 1952 in which neither of the major party candidates was either the incumbent President or Vice-President.|$|E

In 2013, Gravel expressed disdain for President Obama, calling him a [...] "a total fraud" [...] and saying that both Bush and Obama should be tried [...] "for the crimes and murders they've committed" [...] in the International Court of Justice. Gravel specifically condemned Obama for the drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere.|$|E

The next day, ranch owner Katharine Armstrong informed the Corpus Christi Caller-Times of the shooting. Cheney had a televised interview with MSNBC News about the shooting on February 15. Both Cheney and Whittington have called the incident an accident. Early reports indicated that Cheney and Whittington were friends and that the injuries were minor. Whittington has since told the Washington Post that he <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> were not close friends but acquaintances. When asked if Cheney had apologized, Whittington declined to answer.|$|E

2500|$|Bush's {{explanation}} {{was written by}} Fred F. Fielding, White House Counsel {{during the last two}} years of Bush's presidency. According to a Time Magazine article published six months after Bush left office, Fielding worded the commutation [...] "in a way that would make it harder for Bush to revisit it in the future...; [...] language was intended to send an unmistakable message, internally as well as externally: No one is above the law." [...] The article suggested that there was a fundamental difference between how Bush <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> viewed the [...] "War on Terror", with aides close to Bush feeling that Cheney had misled the President and damaged the administration's moral character with the Plame leak.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{remaining}} members of Nixon's Cabinet stayed in place until Ford's dramatic reorganization {{in the fall of}} 1975, an action referred to by political commentators as the [...] "Halloween Massacre". All but three Cabinet members were replaced in 1975, the exceptions being Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon, and Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. Ford appointed George H.W. Bush as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, while Rumsfeld became Secretary of Defense <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> replaced Rumsfeld as Chief of Staff, becoming the youngest ever White House Chief of Staff. The moves were intended to fortify Ford's right flank against a primary challenge from Ronald Reagan. Ford also sought to end the in-fighting between Kissinger and Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger. Though Kissinger remained as Secretary of State, Brent Scowcroft replaced Kissinger as National Security Adviser.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Tao Ruspoli, Cockburn said, [...] "No doubt about it, since I got here in the early 70s things have gone downhill. The Left is in terrible shape. What's the leading obsession of the Left right now? This whole, I think, mad idea that Bush <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> organised {{the attack on the}} World Trade Towers. I think it's absolutely insane. I think [...] are capable of monstrous evil, I just think the theories they have - of no plane hitting the Pentagon - is nutty. It's like flying saucers." [...] He noted that his friend Chuck Spinney had a friend on the plane who was later identified by his dental records because his teeth were found inside the Pentagon. Cockburn writes in standard incisive wit [...] "This doesn’t faze the conspiracists. They’re immune to any reality check. Spinney “worked for the government.” They switched the dental records. The Boeing 757 was flown to Nebraska for a rendez-vous with President Bush, who shot the passengers, burned the bodies on the tarmac and gave Spinney’s friend’s teeth to Dick Cheney to drop through a hole in his trousers amid the debris in the Pentagon." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 2006, US Vice President Dick Cheney {{referred}} {{to himself as}} the Darth Vader of the Bush administration. Discussing the administration's philosophy on gathering intelligence, he said to CNN's John King, [...] "It means {{we need to be}} able to go after and capture or kill those people who are trying to kill Americans. That's not a pleasant business. It's a very serious business. And I suppose, sometimes, people look at my demeanor and say, 'Well, he's the Darth Vader of the administration.'" [...] Jon Stewart put on a Darth Vader helmet to address Dick Cheney as a [...] "kindred spirit" [...] on The Daily Show on January 25, 2007. Cheney's wife, Lynne, presented Stewart with a Darth Vader action figure on her appearance on the show on October 10, 2007. Both Stewart and Stephen Colbert have occasionally {{referred to}} Cheney as [...] "Darth Cheney". In the satirical cartoon show Lil' Bush, Dick Cheney's father is portrayed as being Darth Vader. At her presidential campaign event on September 19, 2007, Hillary Clinton also referred to Cheney as Darth Vader. At the 2008 Washington Radio and Television Correspondents' Association Dinner, Cheney joked that his wife Lynne told him that the Vader comparison [...] "humanizes" [...] him. George Lucas told The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, however, that Cheney is more akin to Emperor Palpatine, and that a better stand-in for Vader would be George W. Bush. An issue of Newsweek referenced this quote, and compared Bush <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> to Vader and Palpatine, respectively, in a satirical article comparing politicians to various Star Wars and Star Trek characters.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to press}} accounts, Cheney told {{investigators}} that he had learned of Mrs. Wilson's employment by the CIA and her potential role in her husband being sent to Niger by then-CIA director George Tenet, though it's unclear whether Cheney was made aware of her classified status. Tenet has {{told investigators that}} he had no specific recollection of discussing Plame or her role in her husband's trip with Cheney. Tenet did recall, however, that he made inquiries regarding the veracity of the Niger intelligence information as a result of inquires from both Cheney and Libby. According to press accounts, Libby told investigators that on July 12, 2003, while aboard Air Force Two, he <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> may have discussed leaking information about Plame to reporters. Libby told investigators he believed {{at the time that the}} information about Plame had come from Russert. After arriving back in Washington, according to Cooper's and Miller's testimony at Libby's trial, Libby spoke to both of them by telephone and confirmed to them that Plame worked for the CIA and may have played a role in sending her husband to Niger. FBI agent Deborah Bond testified at Libby's trial that during Libby's second FBI interview in his office on November 23, 2003, Libby was asked about the July 12 flight. Bond testified Libby told the FBI [...] "there was a discussion whether to report to the press that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA." [...] She added that Mr. Libby expressed some doubt, however, adding [...] "Mr. Libby told us he believed they may have talked about it, but he wasn't sure." [...] She testified that Libby did say he had discussed Wilson's wife with Cheney sometime after allegedly discussing her with Russert. Libby reportedly told investigators that neither the president nor the vice president specifically directed him or other administration officials to disclose Plame's CIA employment to the press.|$|E
