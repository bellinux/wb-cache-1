5|$|The Kingdom of This World {{has a deep}} {{focus on}} the nature of revolution, and the novel itself can be viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> Carpentier's ideological {{perspective}} towards revolutions. Carpentier tries to establish the idea that a distinction must be made between revolutions and reactions. While a revolution produces progress, a reaction does not.|$|E
5|$|Aaliyah is an R and neo soul {{record with}} music drawing from funk, hip hop, {{alternative}} rock, and electronica, among other styles. The producers incorporated synthesizer melodies, fragmented beats, distorted guitar, and eccentrically manipulated vocals and song structures. Much of Aaliyah {{dealt with the}} complexities of romantic love and different stages in a relationship. Most of the songs were written by lyricist Static Major, who shared a close friendship and strong rapport with Aaliyah. She viewed the album <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> herself as both a young adult and a matured vocalist.|$|E

5|$|As the Vanir {{are often}} {{considered}} fertility gods, the Æsir–Vanir War {{has been proposed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> the invasion of local fertility cults somewhere in regions inhabited by the Germanic peoples by a more aggressive, warlike cult. This has been proposed as an analogy of {{the invasion of the}} Indo-Europeans. Georges Dumézil stated that the war need not necessarily be understood in terms of historicity more than any other myth however.|$|E
5|$|At 1211 North LaSalle Street on the city's Near North Side, a 16-story {{apartment}} hotel {{built in}} 1929 and converted {{into an apartment}} building in 1981 was used by muralist Richard Haas for trompe-l'œil murals in homage to Chicago School architecture.

5|$|During {{the first}} quarter of the 7th century, the {{quayside}} settlement at Gipeswic (Ipswich) became an important estuarine trading centre, receiving imported goods such as pottery from other trading markets situated around the coasts of the North Sea. Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under Wuffingas supervision. It took another hundred years for the settlement to develop into a town, but its beginnings can be seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> the personal importance of Rædwald during the period of his supremacy.|$|E

He invited Donovan and Williams, who had been studying music at the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE, to join him; they in turn asked classmate Edmondo Ammendola to join in. The band took their name from the 1954 novel The Adventures of Augie March by Saul Bellow, citing its poetic, complex prose <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> Richards' vocals.|$|E

30|$|Let α be {{a regular}} curve and T be its tangent, and let u be a source. An orthotomic of α {{with respect to the}} source (u) is defined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> locus <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> u about tangents T [8]. Bruce and Giblin applied the {{unfolding}} theory {{to the study of the}} evolutes and orthotomics of plane and space curves [3, 4, 5]. Georgiou, Hasanis and Koutroufiotis investigated the orthotomics in the Euclidean (n + 1) space [7]. Alamo and Criado studied the antiorthotomics in the Euclidean (n + 1)-space [1]. Xiong defined the spherical orthotomic and the spherical antiorthotomic [20]. Also, an orthotomic concept can be applied to surface. For a given surface S and a fixed point (source) P, orthotomic surface of S relative to P is defined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> locus <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> P about all tangent planes of S [11].|$|R

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> {{categories}} of sexuality so sharply {{defined by the}} government and society at large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as butches: dressed in men's clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|As such, {{the role}} of the Army Reserve now {{encompasses}} the '3 Rs'—that is reinforcement, round-out and rotation. With a total strength in 2005–06 of just 15,579 active personnel, recruitment and retention remain an ongoing issue for Defence planners, nevertheless Reservists continue to have a high training obligation. Since September 2006, in an incentive to rectify sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows that in recent decades, there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members. In 2008–09 total strength included 17,064 active personnel. In addition there were another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Davis led a septet at the concert; saxophonist Sonny Fortune, bassist Michael Henderson, and guitarist Pete Cosey {{were given}} space to improvise against a dense {{backdrop}} of riffs, electronic effects, cross-beats, and funk grooves from the rhythm section—drummer Al Foster, guitarist Reggie Lucas, and percussionist James Mtume. Davis controlled their rhythmic and musical direction with hand and head gestures, phrases played on his wah-wah processed trumpet, and drones from an accompanying electronic organ. The evolving {{nature of the}} performance led to the widespread misunderstanding {{that it had no}} compositional basis, while its dark, angry, and somber musical qualities were seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> the musician's emotional and spiritual state at the time.|$|E

50|$|Tiferet also {{occupies}} {{a place on}} the middle pillar, and can be seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> Kether, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> Yesod and Malkuth. Tiferet relates to the sun, and as such, it takes a central place in the lower face of the Tree of Life, much in the same manner that the sun {{is at the center of}} the solar system. It is not the center of the universe, as one could perhaps argue Kether to be, but rather it is the center of our local astronomical system. Nonetheless, it is the sun that gives light and life, even though it did not create itself. Tiferet can be seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> metaphor for these same attributes.|$|R
5|$|Edler {{plays in}} the style of an {{offensive}} defenseman. One of his strongest offensive assets is his slapshot. At the Canucks' 2008 SuperSkills event, he beat the team's reigning hardest shooter, Sami Salo, with a 99.3 mile-per-hour shot and has gone on to win the competition in 2009 and 2010, as well. He is also known for his poise and confidence with the puck, allowing him to make strong first passes out of the defensive zone to forwards. Many within the Canucks organization, such as Assistant Coach Rick Bowness, have asserted this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> his calm off-ice demeanor.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Madonna {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Callaway Arts & Entertainment. The first release was the children's book, The English Roses, which was translated into 42 different languages over 100 countries. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list, spending a total of 18 weeks there. Telling the story of five friends, The English Roses was deemed by critics <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> Madonna's childhood, and received mixed reaction. Madonna's subsequent releases, Mr. Peabody's Apples and Yakov and the Seven Thieves, were both released within a year of The English Roses. They also debuted at number one on The New York Times list. Combined her first three children's books sold over 1.5million copies worldwide. She continued releasing other books like The Adventures of Abdi and Lotsa de Casha; all the five books released were included as part of an audiobook in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps each source has {{preserved}} {{a part of}} {{the same}} truth and Sessrúmnir was conceived of as both a ship and an afterlife location in Fólkvangr. 'A ship in a field' is a somewhat unexpected idea, but it is strongly reminiscent of the stone ships in Scandinavian burial sites. 'A ship in the field' in the mythical realm may have been conceived <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> actual burial customs and vice versa. It is possible that the symbolic ship was thought of as providing some sort of beneficial property to the land, such as good seasons and peace brought on by Freyr’s mound burial in Ynglinga saga.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the ideas}} of Likhachov's concept was the {{correlation}} between culture and nature.

5000|$|With many anachronistic changes, {{including}} {{the role of}} the bourgeois couple <b>as</b> <b>a</b> burlesque <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> the tragic couple, Elektra is another example of the timelessness of the tragedy.

50|$|The Wolek {{family is}} an {{original}} family of fictional characters on the American soap opera One Life to Live present at {{its debut in}} 1968.

5|$|The 2012 book Rising Above the Gathering Storm by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine {{cited the}} fact that the Obama Administration hosted the first White House Astronomy Night, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> the President's support for {{education}} in the STEM fields. The 2014 book The New Moon: Water, Exploration, and Future Habitation by Arlin Crotts discussed the appreciation of the importance of science education by the Obama Administration, citing the White House Astronomy Night and the inclusion of NASA's Lunar Electric Rover in the First inauguration of Barack Obama as key examples. Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space, a 2015 biography of the astronaut by Lynn Sherr, discussed Ride's attendance at the 2009 White House Astronomy Night and commented that she enjoyed speaking with youngsters about the possibility of humans visiting Mars in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{disappearance}} of Chandra Levy {{became a national}} topic {{of the news media}} in the summer of 2001, with 63 percent of Americans closely following the case. The media swamped Levy's parents from the moment they decided to go to Washington, D.C. in search of their daughter. According to Condit, there were about a hundred reporters camped out in front of his apartment during the morning of September 11, 2001, but they all left after news spread about that day's terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Media critics and cable news executives later cited the Levy case, as well as the concurrent sensationalist coverage of a string of shark attacks, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> the manner of news coverage in the United States before the September 11 attacks had taken priority.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E
