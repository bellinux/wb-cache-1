40|$|Road surface macro-texture is an {{indicator}} {{used to determine}} the skid resistance levels in pavements. Existing methods of quantifying macro-texture include the sand patch test and the laser profilometer. These methods utilise the 3 D information of the pavement surface to extract the <b>average</b> <b>texture</b> depth.

This paper reviews the FFT method, and then proposes two new methods, one using the autocorrelation function and the other using wavelets. The methods are tested on pictures obtained from a pavement surface extending more than 2 km's. About 200 images were acquired from the surface at approx. 10 m intervals from a height 80 cm above ground. The results obtained from image analysis methods using the FFT, the autocorrelation function and wavelets are compared with sensor measured texture depth (SMTD) data obtained from the same paved surface.

The analysis of music audio relies upon feature vectors that convey information about music texture or pitch content.

40|$|The {{performances}} of current texture analysis algorithms are still poor, especially {{when applied to}} a large, diffuse texture domain. Most of these purely computationally driven techniques are created to function within a highly restricted domain. When applied as computer vision techniques, frequently results are judged as not intuitive by the system’s users. In the current line of research, after two smaller studies, a large study has been conducted with 450 participants with the aim to unravel human texture classification. The bare bones of texture analysis, as embedded in the human visual system, were taken as starting point. Consequently, three aspects were identified: 1) colorful texture analysis, 2) gray scale texture analysis, and 3) global color distribution. For artificial color analysis, an unique, human inspired color space segmentation was utilized. Artificial texture analysis {{was based on the}} co-occurrence matrix. In addition to color and texture, the influence of shape was taken into account. To gather information on the human texture classification process, an online card sorting experimentation platform was used: [URL] In separate experiments, the participants clustered color and gray scale versions of 54 textures, drawn from the OuTex and VisTex texture databases, into six clusters. Three versions of the experiments were conducted with textures printed in: squares (the ‘shapeless condition’), three distinct shapes, (the ‘three-shape condition’), and six predefined shapes (the ‘six-shape condition’). Both color and shape did have a significant influence on the mutual agreement among the subjects, ranged from 78 % (color - ‘shapeless’) to 60 % (gray – ‘six-shape condition’). Using artificial clustering techniques we mimicked human’s <b>average</b> <b>texture</b> classification in 80 % (color - ‘shapeless’) to 58 % (gray – ‘six-shape condition’) of the cases. Hence, the artificial clustering did have a similar mutual agreement with the participants as the participants had among each others. The success of mimicking human texture classification could not mask the enormous variety among the participants in their classification task. The latter emphasized the impossibility to develop a generic texture classification system, which would resemble human texture classification. However, the results enable the design of a generic model. Subsequently, the model’s parameters could be adapted to specific users, if preferred. Then, not only average human texture perception could be mimicked but also specific user characteristics could be replicated, which would be a first step in new cognitive computer vision techniques...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the work carried out between March 2002 and January 2004 under ETSU Contract number B/CR/ 000783 / 00 / 00 by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Wallingford. It also {{describes the}} results of measurements made by Rothamsted Research staff under a sub-contract. The objectives of this work are: 1. 	To determine the effects on water availability at the catchment and sub-catchment scale, of production of energy crops, across England and Wales. 2. 	To indicate areas where the crops will be most productive, which will be largely determined by water availability. The two objectives have been met by a programme of field measurements, to provide parameter values for a numerical model and data to test the predictions of the model, and a numerical model that produced predictions of the water use of the current land cover and four energy crops: willow short rotation coppice, poplar short rotation coppice, Miscanthus and switchgrass, for a wet, a dry and a typical year. A demonstration GIS has been produced which shows how the predictions can be made use of in catchment management. Measurements The purpose of the measurements was to provide values for parameters used by numerical models and data against which the predictions of the model could be tested. Values for some parameters were available from the literature or previous studies A previous study had made measurements on poplar short rotation coppices (SRC) and so field measurements took place on willow SRC at Roves Farm (Wiltshire) and Miscanthus and switchgrass in experimental plots at Rothamsted and Woburn (Bedfordshire) and a field of Miscanthus near Richard’s Castle (Herefordshire). Willow SRC Measurements of the stomatal conductance were made {{in order to develop}} a relationship between the stomatal conductance and the atmospheric drivers on evaporative demand. These measurements were compatible with a published relationship. The evaporative flux of the willow SRC was measured using the eddy correlation technique, applied to data obtained from a sonic anemometer, and provided data for model testing. This was also the purpose of sap flow gauges which were used to quantify the transpiration of individual stools. These data were scaled up to the full canopy on the basis of measurements of the number of stools and the leaf area. The enhanced evaporation at the edges of plantations was investigated using the transpiration data and measurements of the soil water content in the top 10 cm. The results showed that the effect was only significant at the extreme edge of the coppice and {{is the result of the}} larger leaf area occurring at the edge. A simple relationship has been developed to capture this effect. Miscanthus and switchgrass Measurements of the stomatal conductance enabled a model of the variation of the stomatal conductance of the switchgrass as a result of the atmospheric drivers to be calibrated. Measurements of the interception by switchgrass were made during two seasons. These data were used to quantify the canopy capacity and relate it to the leaf area index. Measurements of the changes in the soil water with depth under both Miscanthus and switchgrass were made to enable the numerical model to be tested. For the same purpose, measurements were made of the evaporative flux from Miscanthus at the site near Richard’s Castle. Numerical modelling The numerical model used was based on the Met. Office Surface Energy Scheme (MOSES) which is physically based and provides a comprehensive description of the exchanges of energy, water and carbon at the land surface. The data collected on this project were used to give values for the parameters that determine the model’s description of the energy and water balances. The results of running the model to predict the water use of the energy crops were tested against measurements of soil water content and evaporation made in this project. The values of the parameters for the carbon balance of the MOSES were determined by calibrating the model against the measured canopy height and leaf area index. An analysis of the rainfall data for England and Wales enabled the choice of dry, wet and typical years to be made, viz: 1976, 1988 and 1982 respectively. The analysis also demonstrated that the water year (the period running from the beginning of October in the previous year to the end of September in the year) was appropriate, given the importance of the amount of the soil water stored in the period prior to the growing season. The MOSES model was run on grid cells of 1 km 2. The fractions of existing land cover classes (broadleaf woodland, needliferous woodland, grassland, shrubs, tilled land, urban, bare soil and water) were determined by aggregating the 25 classes of the Land Cover Map 2000 to eight MOSES classes and then calculating the fractions in each model grid cell. The soil hydraulic properties were obtained using the Hydrology Of Soil Types (HOST) as the basis. The dominant HOST class of each 1 km 2 was used. The properties were obtained by producing the <b>average</b> <b>texture</b> of the soil series within a HOST class and then using pedo-transfer models to calculate the properties. The daily meteorological driving variables were obtained from the Met Office as values on a 1600 km 2 grid. These were interpolated to the model grid using a bilinear algorithm. A further refinement was made to the values of air temperature by allowing for the altitude of the grid cell using the standard lapse rate. The greater spatial variability of the rainfall was handled by using a data set of monthly totals on a 1 km 2 grid, which were disaggregated to daily values using the data from the 1600 km 2 grid. There is no simple answer to whether energy crops will use more water than the existing land cover. It is a function of a number factors that include: the current type of the land cover; the specific energy crop, the amount of rainfall and the hydraulic properties of the soils. This was investigated in two ways: monthly time series for eight grid cells, to investigate the detailed temporal variability, and spatial distributions for water years with typical high and low rainfall, to investigate the spatial variability. Monthly time series The model was run on eight selected grid cells, representative of a range of climatological, soil and land cover conditions, to generate monthly times series, covering the period 1971 to 2000, of the predicted water use of each of the four energy crops, the change in water use from the existing land cover and the indicative yield. These time series allow the seasonal and inter-annual variability to be assessed. The results show that poplar SRC has a much higher transpiration rate than the other energy crops. This is due to the stomata having little response to high atmospheric evaporative demand. The effect of soils with low soil water storage in reducing indicative yield is reflected in the results. The three year harvesting cycle, assumed for the SRC, is apparent in the results and shows an increase in water use in successive years. The switchgrass and Miscanthus show an annual pattern that reflects the seasons but, there is a shorter growing season than for other land cover types because the threshold temperature, below which photosynthesis ceases, is higher Spatial distribution The predicted spatial distributions of the water use, change in water use and the indicative yield are presented as 39 maps which show: the predicted annual water use for the current land cover and the four energy crops, the change in annual water use if the current land cover were replaced with one of the energy crops and the indicative yield, all for water years with typical, high and low rainfall. The results show that, when soil water is plentiful, poplar SRC uses considerably more water that the current land cover or any of the other energy crops and also has significantly higher indicative yields. In areas of low rainfall, the rapid rate of transpiration early in the year rapidly depletes the soil water store with a result that growth is restricted in the later part of the year so that a low indicative yield is obtained. The conclusion is that the varieties of poplar SRC that the model was calibrated for are probably only viable in areas of high rainfall. Willow SRC has a higher water use than the existing land cover in most situations. This is mainly because it is specified in the model as having a greater rooting depth than the other land cover types, with the exception of broadleaf woodland and so is less affected by soil water stress. Miscanthus and switchgrass are predicted to have a lower water use than the existing land cover in most areas. This is because the canopy develops later in the year, due to these grasses being specified to have a higher threshold temperature below which photosynthesis ceases, with the result that the period when the transpiration occurs is shorter and occurs during the summer months. In addition, they have a higher water efficiency than the other land cover types because they use the C 4 photosynthetic pathway. To some extent, these factors are offset by the rooting depth, which is intermediate between the existing woodlands and grasses. However, it is acknowledged that measurements through at least one full year would be needed to confirm this prediction. Demonstration GIS Software for a simple demonstration GIS has been written which, for a 60  60 km area of the head waters of the river Severn, allows the user to explore the possible impact of energy crop plantations on the water losses within a catchment. Conclusions •	The effect of enhanced evaporation at the edges of SRC plantations is localised and so will have the greatest impact on small plantations. For plantation greater than 10 ha the effect is certainly comparable or less than other factors, e. g. the nature of the soil. •	For the same rainfall and soils, the water use of the energy grasses is likely to be less or comparable to that of the existing land cover where it is grass or tilled land and less if the existing land cover is woodland or heathland. •	In the final year of the three year cropping cycle, the water use of SRC is likely to be greater than the existing land cover if it is grass or tilled land and comparable or greater if it is woodland or heathland. However, in the first year it is likely to be less than existing land cover types. •	The results for poplar SRC show a very high water use. These results should be interpreted with caution as it is likely that varieties could be or are available that would have lower water use. In which case the water use is likely to be comparable to that of willow SRC. •	In areas of high annual average rainfall (greater than around 800 mm), the nature of the soil has little impact on the water use of the energy crops, or the existing land cover. However, in other areas, the soil hydraulic properties, particularly the ability to store water that can then be used by the plants for transpiration, can be important because of the higher transpiration rates of the energy crops. •	When the rooting depth of the energy crop is deeper than the existing land cover, there is the possibility that, after a period of drought, the soil water deficits will be greater resulting in a reduction in recharge and/or runoff in the following winter. •	During years with above average rainfall, when the transpiration rates are not constrained by soil water, the energy crops tend to use more water, than the existing land cover, mainly due to the higher interception losses. •	The predicted indicative yield from the energy crops is a function of air temperature and the amount of sunshine. The energy grasses are predicted to be more sensitive to these factors than the SRC and so show a more marked trend of decreasing indicative yield with increasing latitude and altitude. •	There are strong indications that, in areas of low annual average rainfall (less than about 700 mm), the indicative yields of all the energy crops are reduced by soil water stress. ...|$|E

The former does not capture important lighting e#ects due to textures, while the latter is too expensive computationally to be practical. To handle texture maps requires a detailed analysis of the underlying operator equation. In particular we decompose the radiosity equation into two steps: (i) the computation of irradiance on a surface from the radiosities on other surfaces, and (ii) the application of the reflectance operator # to compute ra [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to mimic human (colorful) texture classication by a {{clustering}} algorithm three lines of research have been encountered, in which as test set 180 texture images (both their color and gray-scale equivalent) were drawn from the OuTex and VisTex databases. First, a k-means algorithm was applied with three feature vectors, based on color/gray values, four texture features, and their combination. Second, 18 participants clustered the images using a newly developed card sorting program. The mutual agreement between the participants was 57 % and 56 % and between the algorithm and the participants it was 47 % and 45 %, for respectively color and gray-scale texture images. Third, in a benchmark, 30 participants judged the algorithms' clusters with gray-scale textures as more homogeneous then those with colored textures. However, a high interpersonal variability was present for both the color and the gray-scale clusters. So, despite the promising results, it is questionable whether <b>average</b> human <b>texture</b> classication can be mimicked (if it exists at all) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCarbon xerogels {{have been}} used to replace carbon black as {{catalyst}} support at the cathode of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells in order to decrease the mass transport limitations in this electrode. Carbon xerogels are very clean nanostructured carbons with well-defined pore texture, which allows forbetter reactant/product diffusion. Pt/carbon xerogel catalysts with high metal dispersion (nanoparticles ca. 2 nm in size) and high metal content (~ 25 wt. %) can be engineered via rational synthesis methods such as the 'Strong Electrostatic Adsorption' technique. The results show that choosing correctly the <b>average</b> pore <b>texture</b> of the carbon xerogel allows for minimizing the diffusion overpotential of the H 2 /air cell. However, the catalyst characterization indicates that the presence of chlorine, coming from H 2 PtCl 6, induces a dramatic decrease of the Pt utilization ratio in the final PEMFC catalytic layer. To remove chlorine, a reduction of the catalyst at 450 °C, at least, is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{hydraulic}} parameter {{values for}} large-scale modelling cannot {{be obtained by}} direct methods. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) that relate soil hydraulic properties (SHPs) to generally available soil texture data may provide an alternative. A considerable number of PTF models has been developed, the application of three recent PTFs is evaluated. As a first step sets of SHPs derived from the PTFs are compared with measured sets of SHPs for three sites. No good agreement was found statistically between measured and PTF results or between PTF results. As a second step and from a practical point of view results for three hydrologically functional variables were compared and evaluated. The three selected functional variables are saturated hydraulic conductivity, k 0, in relation to infiltration excess runoff, available soil water amounts for evapotranspiration and water table depth for a specified upward flux or capillary rise. Derived k 0 distributions from PTFs show substantially less variance than from the measured data at all three sites. This can have a considerable impact on infiltration excess runoff, depending on the actual rainfall regime. Simulated available soil water amounts for evapotranspiration for some combinations of PTFs and sites are close to those obtained for measured SHPs, however, no consistency in results can be detected. Water table depths for specified upward flux densities using PTF derived SHPs are generally deeper than those based on measured SHPs and means a potentially higher water availability. Overall, differences in capillary rise among the selected PTFs and between measured and PTF based results are again inconsistent and show no clear relationship with soil texture. Finally, as a third step, effective SHPs were calculated by using spatially <b>averaged</b> <b>texture</b> as PTF input representing areal average behaviour. For these effective SHPs the calculated effective values for the three selected functional variables appear {{to be close to}} the areally averaged values obtained with step 2. The selected functional variables thus appear to depend linearly on the PTFs over the range for which the data are representative. This suggests that for our specific PTFs areal mean or effective values for the three functional variables can be obtained fairly accurately from a single measurement of a bulk collection of soil samples as input...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] {{the second phase}} of the EFEDA experiment (ECHIVAL Field Experiment in a Desertification Threatened Area), the spatial variability of the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity characteristics of layers 2 - 12 and 17 - 27 cm depth was characterized. A simplified method, based on particle size distribution and simple infiltration tests was used. It provided these characteristics at the nodes of a 1 km grid over 10 x 10 km 2 around the town of Tomelloso (Castilla- La Mancha, Spain). A total number of 78 sample points were used to address the problem of soil surface properties variability and its consequences on the monthly and annual water balance. The SiSPAT (Simple Soil Plant Atmosphere Transfer model) 1 -D Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) model was run with a one-year climatic forcing for the 78 soil profiles until equilibrium was reached. As no runoff was generated, the spatial variability of the water budget components only concerned soil evaporation, transpiration and deep drainage. It was found that i) the choice of the type of boundary condition at the bottom of the soil profile was greatly influencing the final variability, ii) the variability of transpiration was the largest in situations of water stress for the vegetation, iii) soil evaporation was the most sensitive component when plants were well supplied with water. Various aggregation methods of soil surface parameters (use of the arithmetic mean, median of the parameters or parameters associated to the <b>average</b> soil <b>texture</b> of the Clapp and Hornberger (1978) classification) were assessed. The use of median parameters in a single 1 -D simulation was found to provide the best agreement with the average of the 78 simulations performed for each grid cell using locally measured soil properties. The use of <b>average</b> soil <b>texture</b> parameters led to a significant bias, especially in the case of water stress. This study was funded by the European Union in the context of the ECHIVAL Experiment in a Threatened Desertification Area (EFEDA) project (EPOCH-CT 90 - 0030 and EV 5 V-CT 93 - 0272).

However, few studies have investigated the effect of age-independent traits of a child's face on adult preferences for a child. In this study, ninety-six Japanese undergraduates and ninety-six preschool children provided the facial images used in this study. We divided children's facial variations into age-related and age-independent traits using methodologies of geometric morphometrics. The age-independent variations were summarized using a principal component analysis. The facial pictures corresponding to theoretical values from − 3 SD to + 3 SD along with both the age-related dimension and age-independent principal components were made by warping the <b>average</b> facial <b>texture</b> of the children's faces. A pairwise comparison method was used to investigate the relationship between cuteness/infantility and facial shape differences along with the age-related and age-independent components using the facial pictures. The results suggest that an evaluation of a child's cuteness depends on both age-independent and age-related facial features...|$|R

40|$|A soil plant {{atmosphere}} {{model for}} corn (Zea mays L.) {{together with the}} scaling theory for soil hydraulic heterogeneity are used to study the sensitivity of spatial variation of canopy temperature to field <b>averaged</b> soil <b>texture</b> and crop rooting characteristics. The soil plant atmosphere model explicitly solves a continuity equation for water flux resulting from root water uptake, changes in plant water storage and transpirational flux. Dynamical equations for root zone soil water potential and the plant water storage models the progressive drying of soil, and day time dehydration and night time hydration of the crop. The statistic of scaling parameter which describes the spatial variation of soil hydraulic conductivity and matric potential {{is assumed to be}} independent of soil texture class. The field averaged soil hydraulic characteristics are chosen to be representative of loamy sand and clay loam soils. Two rooting characteristics are chosen, one shallow and the other deep rooted. The simulation shows that the range of canopy temperatures in the clayey soil is less than 1 K, but for the sandy soil the range is about 2. 5 and 5. 0 K, respectively, for the shallow and deep rooted crops...|$|R

Groups of known vulnerable (KV) sections were identified using statistical clustering methods of climatic and soil data and then described using Principal Components Analysis. For soil data, five clusters were identified using two soil variables, one reflecting soil texture and one indicating the absence or presence of a hardpan. The <b>average</b> soil <b>texture</b> of the five clusters was diverse ranging from coarse (sandy) to fine (clayey) (Table 1). The average hardpan indicator of the five clusters ranged from practically no soils in a section with a hardpan to potentially all soils in a section with hardpan a (Table 1). A profiling method based on the soil clustering results was derived for determining cluster membership or nonmembership of candidate sections into KV clusters. All sections in Fresno county with soil data were profiled and subjected to the soil cluster classification algorithm. When the results of the classification were graphed, three important features were observed (Figure 1) : 1. When plotted, the statistical clusters formed discrete geographical areas.

40|$|Satellite {{sensor data}} have {{traditionally}} been used in multi-source forest inventory for estimating forest characteristics. Their advantages generally are large geographic coverage and large spectral range. Another remote sensing data source for forest inventories offering a large geographic coverage is high altitude aerial photography. In high altitude aerial photographs the spectral range is very narrow but the spatial resolution is high. This allows the extraction of texture features for forest inventory purposes. In this study we utilized a Landsat 7 ETM satellite image, a photo mosaic composed of high altitude panchromatic aerial photographs, and {{a combination of the}} aforementioned in estimating forest attributes for an area covering approximately 281 000 ha in Forestry Centre Häme-Uusimaa in Southern Finland. Sample plots of 9 th National Forest Inventory (NFI 9) were used as field data. In the estimation, 6 Landsat 7 ETM image channels were used. For aerial photographs, 4 image channels were composed from the spectral <b>averages</b> and <b>texture</b> features. In combining both data sources, 6 Landsat channels and 3 aerial image texture channels were selected for the analysis. The accuracy of forest estimates based on the Landsat image was better than that of estimates based on high altitude aerial photographs.

It provides high image quality without aliasing artifacts or excessive blurring even with non-spherical kernels. Hence it is suitable for regular, rectilinear, and irregular volume data sets. Moreover, our framework introduces a novel approach to compute the footprint function. It facilitates efficient perspective projection of arbitrary elliptical kernels at very little additional cost. Finally, we show that EWA volume reconstruction kernels can be reduced to surface reconstruction kernels. This makes our splat primitive universal in reconstructing surface and volume data...|$|R
