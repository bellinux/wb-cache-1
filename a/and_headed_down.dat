25|$|On 1 April 1884, Captain George John Hall (a son of {{the former}} owner) went on board with the fireman (James Franks) at Central Wharf, <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> harbour to tow in the {{schooner}} Malcolm, which was expected from Newcastle just before daybreak.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most of Australia, where {{exploration}} typically went inland {{from the}} sea, the Gippsland region was first explored and settled by Europeans who came overland from the Monaro region of New South Wales <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> to the coastal regions. This could perhaps {{be seen as}} a natural expansion of the first settlements of Australia radiating out from Sydney, but to do so the settlers had to cross the not insignificant barrier of the Australian Alps.|$|E
500|$|All {{possible}} armaments, {{as well as}} invalids, camp followers, {{and supplies}} were loaded onto a fleet of more than 200 boats that began {{to move up the}} lake toward Skenesboro, accompanied by Colonel Pierse Long's regiment. [...] Owing to a shortage of boats, four invalids were left behind, as were the very largest cannons and a variety of supplies—everything from tents to cattle. [...] The rest of the army crossed to Mount Independence <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the Hubbardton road, which Riedesel's forces had not yet reached. [...] A handful of men were left at the pontoon bridge with [...] loaded cannons to fire on British attempts to cross it, but they were drunk when the British arrived the next morning.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{icebreaker}} {{was launched}} on 9 September 1907 {{and given the}} name Tarmo, meaning [...] "vigour" [...] and [...] "spirit" [...] in the Finnish language. The ship was delivered on 17 December 1907 and on 30 December she left Newcastle {{under the command of}} Captain Leonard Melán <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the River Tyne to Hanko, Finland, where she arrived on 3 January 1908.|$|E
60|$|Immediately {{the meal}} was wolfed down the three {{partners}} took their empty pack-straps <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> trail to where the remainder of their outfit lay at the last camp a mile away. And old Tarwater became busy. He washed the dishes, foraged dry wood, mended a broken pack-strap, put an edge on the butcher-knife and camp-axe, and repacked the picks and shovels into a more carryable parcel.|$|E
60|$|There was {{the usual}} {{confusion}} until the cabins had been allotted, portmanteaus stowed away, and the general baggage lowered into the hold. A tedious wait {{of three or four}} hours followed, no one exactly knew why, and then the paddle wheels began to revolve. The men burst into a loud cheer, and a few minutes later they passed Drake's Island <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the sound.|$|E

60|$|Churchill {{waved his}} hand in token that he had got it. In truth, had Macdonald, half a mile away, opened his window, he'd have got it, too. The tumult of {{farewell}} rose again, the gongs clanged, and the Seattle No. 4 went ahead, swung out into the stream, turned on her heel, <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the Yukon, Bondell and Churchill waving farewell and mutual affection to the last.|$|E
60|$|The {{exchange}} was made, and {{the salmon}} boat got up its spritsail <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the bay toward the marshes off San Rafael. I {{ran up the}} jib and followed with the Reindeer. San Rafael, where we were to turn our catch over to the authorities, communicated with the bay {{by way of a}} long and tortuous slough, or marshland creek, which could be navigated only when the tide was in. Slack water had come, and, as the ebb was commencing, there was need for hurry if we cared to escape waiting half a day for the next tide.|$|E
60|$|We in {{the salmon}} boat, sailing {{close on the}} wind, tacked about and crossed the ship's bow. Then Charley put up the tiller <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the port side of the ship, the Greek letting out the sheet and {{grinning}} with delight. The Italians were already half-way down the ship's length; but the stiff breeze at our back drove us after them far faster than they could row. Closer and closer we came, and I, lying down forward, was just reaching out to grasp the skiff, when it ducked under the great stern of the Lancashire Queen.|$|E

60|$|We {{started in}} the late afternoon. We throbbed out of our yard above Hammersmith Bridge, fussed about for a moment, <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> stream. We came at an easy rush down Craven Reach, past Fulham and Hurlingham, past the long {{stretches}} of muddy meadow And muddy suburb to Battersea and Chelsea, round the cape of tidy frontage that is Grosvenor Road and under Vauxhall Bridge, and Westminster opened before us. We cleared a string of coal barges and there on the left in the October sunshine stood the Parliament houses, and the flag was flying and Parliament was sitting.|$|E
60|$|Jean {{discarded}} his useless rifle, <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> {{the ridge}} slope, keeping to the thickest line of pines and sheering around the clumps of spruce. As he ran, his mind whirled with grim thoughts of escape, of his necessity {{to find the}} camp where Gordon and Fredericks were buried, there to procure another rifle and ammunition. He felt the wet blood dripping down his arm, yet no pain. The forest was too open for good cover. He dared not run uphill. His only course was ahead, and that soon ended in an abrupt declivity too precipitous to descend. As he halted, panting for breath, he heard the ring of hoofs on stone, then the thudding beat of running horses on soft ground. The rustlers had sighted the direction he had taken. Jean did not waste time to look. Indeed, there was no need, for as he bounded along the cliff to the right a rifle cracked and a bullet whizzed over his head. It lent wings to his feet. Like a deer he sped along, leaping cracks and logs and rocks, his ears filled by the rush of wind, until his quick eye caught sight of thick-growing spruce foliage close to the precipice. He sprang down into the green mass. His weight precipitated him through the upper branches. But lower down his spread arms broke his fall, then retarded it until he caught. A long, swaying limb let him down and down, where he grasped another and a stiffer one that held his weight. Hand over hand he worked toward the trunk of this spruce and, gaining it, he found other branches close together down which he hastened, hold by hold and step by step, until all above him was black, dense foliage, and beneath him the brown, shady slope. Sure of being unseen from above, he glided noiselessly down under the trees, slowly regaining freedom from that constriction of his breast.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To study ICP {{changes during}} various head {{positions}} in patients undergoing ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt surgery. Methods: The {{study was conducted}} on 20 randomly selected American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Class I or II patients of either sex aged above five years scheduled for elective ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery. ICP was recorded in 15 ° head up, 15 ° <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> right <b>and</b> left lateral bending of <b>head,</b> right <b>and</b> left rotation of <b>head</b> <b>and</b> was compared with horizontal (neutral) position. Results: Intracranial pressure increased in all positions but significant increase was observed in right rotation (40. 8 %; p< 0. 01), left rotation of the head (22. 2 %; p< 0. 001) <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> 15 ° position (p< 0. 05; 6. 7 %). No clinically significant hemodynamic changes were observed in various positions. No significant changes were observed in oxygen saturation. Conclusion: Rotation of head to either right or left <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> position increases the ICP significantly. Head elevation may not reduce ICP in all cases. It depends on degree of elevation, intracranial pathology and associated neck position...|$|R
