5|$|On 17 March 2015, Chopra {{signed for}} Scottish Championship club Alloa Athletic {{for the rest}} of the season. On that very day, he made his debut against Rangers. On 2 May 2015, he scored his first goal for Alloa when he scored from six yards out in a league match against Cowdenbeath. Four days later, he scored his second goal for the club, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> scoring in a 2–0 victory against Brechin City in the relegation play-offs. Chopra was {{released}} by Alloa due to injury in March 2016, exactly one year after he signed for the club.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Laird {{scored in}} Stevenage's {{pre-season}} friendly victory over Histon. He {{started in the}} club's first ever Football League fixture, a 2–2 home draw with Macclesfield Town. In September 2010, in games against Cheltenham Town and Torquay United respectively, Laird {{was used as a}} left midfielder, as opposed to playing in his usual left-back position. He reverted to the left-back spot in Stevenage's 1–0 win over Lincoln City at Sincil Bank. He scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season from the penalty spot, in a 2–1 win over Burton Albion in October 2010. A week later, he missed the chance to double his goal tally for the season, missing a second-half penalty in a 0–0 draw against Morecambe. Coincidentally, Laird's second goal of the season came in the reverse fixture against Morecambe in January 2011; he scored from close range following John Mousinho's cross to give Stevenage the lead. Just three days later, Laird scored his third goal of the season, netting with a curling effort from 25 yards out to give Stevenage their third goal of a 3–0 win against Rotherham United. Laird was initially credited with scoring an 87th-minute winner in Stevenage's 1–0 away win at Crewe Alexandra on 19 February 2011, but the goal was eventually given to teammate Byron Harrison. At the age of 22, Laird captained Stevenage {{for the first time in}} their 1–0 loss to Hereford United on 8 March 2011. In the club's following match, against Wycombe Wanderers at Adams Park, Laird was sent-off for two bookable offences, although Stevenage held on to win the match 1–0. Laird's fourth goal of the campaign came in Stevenage's 3–3 draw against Bury on 7 May 2011, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> scoring with a strike from 25 yards out. He played a total of 54 games during the 2010–11 season, scoring four goals. This included three appearances in the 2010–11 League Two play-offs following Stevenage's sixth-placed finish. Following a 3–0 aggregate victory over Accrington Stanley, Stevenage earned promotion to League One after a 1–0 win against Torquay United at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011, with Laird playing the whole game.|$|E

His dedication paid off, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> season with 36 points in 18 games until sidelined by a hip pointer. His early season success led NHL Central Scouting to name him the top prospect for the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. He then slipped to second, behind Taylor Hall, who was eventually selected first overall by the Edmonton Oilers.|$|E

2500|$|In 1985 ADC offices {{suffered}} {{a series of}} violent attacks. On August 16, a bomb exploded in the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee office in Boston, severely injuring two police officers. On October 29 an arson fire damaged the ADC office in Washington, D.C. On October 11, {{the day after the}} ending of the Achille Lauro incident where a Jewish American died, [...] Alex Odeh, ADC's west-coast regional director, was killed in a bombing <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door to his office. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) suspected Jewish Defense League and Jewish Defense Organization members. Although Jewish Defense League leader Irv Rubin, who lived in Southern California, made some controversial statements about the bombing, the investigation focused on Robert Manning and his wife Rochelle who fled to Israel. They eventually were prosecuted on another bombing charge and Manning is serving a life sentence on that charge. In 2007, the FBI revealed they had received information from a deceased informant, believed to be former Jewish Defense League member Earl Krugel who had been sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for 2001 plots to bomb a Southern California mosque and office of U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, who is Arab-American. It is believed that Irv Rubin, who committed suicide in 2002 in custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Los Angeles while awaiting trial on the same charges, revealed to Krugel the names of those responsible for Odeh's death and that Krugel shared those with the FBI before he was murdered in prison in 2005. The bombers are believed to be Manning and two individuals now living in Israel. ADC continues to honor Odeh’s memory and call for prosecution of his killers. The FBI has failed to arrest anyone in the Odeh bombing case.|$|E
