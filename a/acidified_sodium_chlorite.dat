50|$|Mixing sodium {{chlorite}} solution {{with a weak}} food-grade acid solution (commonly citric acid), both stable, produces short-lived <b>acidified</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> (ASC) which has potent decontaminating properties. Upon mixing the main active ingredient, chlorous acid is produced in equilibrium with chlorite anion. The proportion varies with pH, temperature, and other factors, ranging from approximately 5-35% chlorous acid with 65-95% chlorite; more acidic solutions result in {{a higher proportion of}} chlorous acid. Chlorous acid breaks down to chlorine dioxide which in turn breaks down to chlorite anion and ultimately chloride anion. ASC is used for sanitation of the hard surfaces which come in contact with food and as a wash or rinse for a variety of foods including red meat, poultry, seafood, fruits and vegetables. Because the oxo-chlorine compounds are unstable when properly prepared, there should be no measurable residue on food if treated appropriately. ASC also is used as a teat dip for control of mastitis in dairy cattle.|$|E

The present study aimed at evaluating {{the effect of}} five disinfectants (<b>acidified</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite,</b> alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid, and sodium hypochlorite) on the populations of food quality indicator microorganisms and on Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) in the presence and absence of organic matter.

The treatment of phospholipids with chlorite yielded low levels of hydroperoxides, but <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> oxidized the thiol-containing antioxidant glutathione to its disulfide form very readily in vitro, with a 1 : 4 oxidant:GSH stoichiometry. In cultured cells, <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> also caused a substantial depletion of intracellular glutathione, whereas lipid oxidation was not very prominent. <b>Sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> had a lower toxicity to ocular mammalian cells than benzalkonium chloride, which could be responsible for the different effects of long-term application in the eye.

The results show that <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> can cause oxidative stress in cells, and suggest that cell damage {{is more likely to be}} due to interaction with thiol compounds than with cell membrane lipids.

This {{has been taken}} as evidence that isodityrosine acts as a cross-link holding the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein extensin in the cell wall. However, acidified chlorite was found to cleave peptide bonds in salt-soluble extensin and in bovine serum albumin (BSA). This invalidates the use of conventional acidified chlorite treatment to provide evidence for isodityrosine cross-links. The ratio of BSA:chlorite was important in determining peptidyl cleavage. At a ratio of 0. 75 : 1. 00 (mole amino acid residues/mole chlorite), or higher, peptidyl cleavage was not detected. Furthermore, in samples where a low concentration of radioactive extensin was present, BSA substantially protected the peptide bonds of the extensin against peptidyl cleavage during treatment with acidified chlorite, while not preventing the cleavage of isodityrosine.

Lactic acid was applied at concentrations of 2. 5 % and 5 % using different water sources (tap and distilled), and at a common pH of ~ 2. 2 using different water sources (tap and distilled). Peroxyacetic acid was applied at concentrations of 210 ppm and 150 ppm, and <b>acidified</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> was applied at concentrations of 500 ppm and 1200 ppm. Half of the strip loins received the chemical interventions prior to chilling or ?hot? (~ 25 ?C), whereas the other half received the interventions after a chilling for ~ 24 h at ~ 2 ?C.

40|$|The {{carcinogenic}} {{activities of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> in B 6 C 3 F 1 mice were examined. <b>Sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> was given at concentrations of 0 (control), 0. 025 % (low dose), or 0. 05 % (high dose) in {{the drinking water}} of 150 female and 150 male mice for 80 weeks, after which time the animals were returned to distilled water without <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite.</b> All mice were sacrificed 85 weeks {{from the beginning of}} the experiment. The incidence of tumor-bearing animals was 32 % (control), 34 % (low dose), and 26 % (high dose) in female mice, and 46 % (control), 57 % (low dose), and 53 % (high dose) in male mice. The types and incidence of neoplasms that occurred frequently in each group of both sexes were similar to those observed spontaneously in B 6 C 3 F 1 mice. The incidence of lymphomas/leukemias in the high dose group of females (2 %), however, was lower than that in the control group (15 %). Furthermore, the incidence of pulmonary adenomas in the high dose group of males (12 %) was higher than that in the control group (0 %), but neither dose-related increases in the adenoma incidences nor increased incidences of the adenocarcinomas were observed. These results indicated no clear evidence of a carcinogenic potential of <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> in B 6 C 3 F 1 mice...|$|R
