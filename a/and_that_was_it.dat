Before the pair met, it was often guesswork as to his intentions. Afterwards, his lyrics were far more direct.|$|E

In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way.

[...] She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and said that I really wanted to play this character.
