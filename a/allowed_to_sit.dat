5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants should not be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E
5|$|To {{recognize}} the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench. By tradition, freshmen are not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on the bench, which is currently located in the courtyard of the Administration Building. The logo is further embodied in the Double T neon sign, donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the jump {{seat in the}} cockpit. The passenger had no connection with the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline. Several of the other passengers were employees in Widerøe and shouldaccording to the airline's rulesinstead have been seated there. From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the jump seat passenger continued {{to sit in the}} cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention and concentration away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E
5|$|Mason's {{successor}} Horner {{proved to}} be extremely unpopular as governor and his tenure was very short. Residents disliked him so much they burned him in effigy and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into the territorial capital. In the October 1835 elections, voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor. The same election saw Isaac E. Crary chosen as Michigan's first U.S. Representative to Congress. Because of the dispute Congress refused to accept his credentials and seated him as a non-voting delegate. The two U.S. Senators chosen by the state legislature in November, Lucius Lyon and John Norvell, were treated with even less respect, being <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> only as spectators in the Senate gallery.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{returned}} to Massillon in 1932, {{when he was}} 24 years old and barely two years out of college. His assignment was to turn around a Tigers team that had fallen into mediocrity over the six seasons since the departure of Stewart, Brown's old coach. In 1931, the year before Brown arrived, the Tigers finished with a 2–6-2 record. Brown's strategy was {{to build up a}} disciplined, hard-working team. He fired an assistant early on for arriving at a practice late because he had to work on his farm. No Tigers player was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on the bench during a game; Brown made them stand. At Massillon, Brown put in an offense and blocking scheme he learned from Duke's Jimmy DeHart and Purdue's Noble Kizer. He emphasized quickness over strength.|$|E

5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He was not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> with European passengers in the stagecoach and told {{to sit on the}} floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E
5|$|The current 500 {{members of}} the National Assembly were elected during the 2011 {{parliamentary}} election, {{and they have a}} five-year term. Despite foreign criticism, it is generally believed that the National Assembly has become more powerful in recent years. The last election was held, according to the authorities, in a democratic, fair, lawful and safe manner and was considered a success. Voter turnout was 99.51 percent; nearly 62 million people voted. In their respective constituencies, Nguyễn Phú Trọng, the General Secretary, was elected to the National Assembly with 85.63 percent of the votes, Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng was elected with 95.38 percent and President Trương Tấn Sang was elected with 80.19 percent. Outside the ruling troika, it was Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, the Chairman of the Government Office, who was elected with the highest margin, with 94.59 percent of the votes. The number of self-nominated candidates was four times higher than the previous election. Fifteen out of the 182 candidates nominated by the central government and the central party leadership were defeated in the elections. Lê Thị Thu Ba, a member of the Party's Central Committee and Chairman of the Committee of Law during the 12th National Assembly (2007–2011), was not re-elected to the National Assembly. Several capitalists were elected to the assembly, but due to the socialist ideology of the state, they are not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on the assembly's Committee on Economy and Budget.|$|E
