25|$|David Sandison {{stated that}} he found the {{original}} framed artwork for Pink Moon in among the debris of the basement room that Island later allocated to him as his office, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> home and hung it {{on the wall of}} his house for several years, before eventually presenting it to Drake's parents. An undated photo of Drake's music room at his parents' house in Tanworth-in-Arden shows {{what appears to be the}} artwork hanging on the wall.|$|E
2500|$|The battery {{was formed}} on 1 February 1805 as I Troop, Horse Artillery at Colchester, Essex {{as a horse}} {{artillery}} battery of the British Army. [...] Captain Robert Bull was appointed to command <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> to the Iberian Peninsula in August 1809 where it served until 1814. [...] It arrived {{too late for the}} Battle of Talavera, but thereafter took part in most of Wellington's major actions of the Peninsular War including Bussaco (1810), Fuentes de Oñoro (1811), Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, and Burgos (1812), Vitoria, San Sebastián, the Bidassoa and the Nive (1813) and Bayonne (1814).|$|E
2500|$|While Henry was returning, the Third Virginia Convention in August {{commissioned}} him as colonel of the 1st Virginia Regiment, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> [...] {{up later}} that month. Although Henry had little military experience, {{this was not}} considered a major drawback at the time, and he was held to have distinguished himself in the march on Williamsburg. General Washington, though, felt that the convention had [...] "made a Capital mistake when they took Henry out of the Senate to place him in the Field". In September, Virginia's Committee of Safety placed Henry {{in charge of all}} of Virginia's forces.|$|E

6000|$|... (Did {{you hear}} that? Half a million {{sterling}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> just {{as quietly as}} that. And it isn't really in the play either. Sao Paolo and Rio Tinto just come in {{to let you know}} the sort of man you're dealing with.) ...|$|R
2500|$|This left Barrichello in {{the lead}} with Schumacher Ferrari, minus a front-wing, in second place and his brother Ralf in third. Michael Schumacher came into the pits for a new nose, {{promoting}} Ralf to second. The second lap saw a collision between the two Jordans of Giancarlo Fisichella and Takuma Sato, when the latter ran {{into the back of}} the former. [...] "I am really sorry about what happened," [...] said Sato after the race, [...] "I apologized to Giancarlo immediately after the race <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> very well which I think says a lot of good things about his character" [...] he added. On lap 7, Montoya was given a drive through penalty which cost the Colombian 20 seconds to Barrichello's lead.|$|E
2500|$|T.I. {{also worked}} with his former Grand Hustle signee, Philadelphia-based rapper Meek Mill on the album. Before Rick Ross signed him to Maybach Music Group and he cut off his braids, T.I. took the Philadelphia rapper under his wing and showed him the ropes: “He was around to observe a lot <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> and he used it to his advantage, which is {{extremely}} commendable." [...] They ended up recording “G Season”. “‘G Season’ is basically just two cats who are cut from a different cloth, separating themselves from the suckers,” T.I. told Rap-Up TV. This collaboration would come together after they met {{each other at the}} club. T.I. {{said in an interview that}} Jay-Z was originally supposed to be featured on [...] "G Season".|$|E
2500|$|In {{correspondence}} Darwin {{continued to}} discuss his species work with Hooker, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> personally when Hooker remarked of another naturalist [...] "that no one has hardly a right to examine the question of species who has not minutely described many." [...] However, even Richard Owen who was opposed to any mutability in species had {{told him it was}} [...] "a very fair subject" [...] with a mass of facts to be investigated, [...] "& though I shall get more kicks than half-pennies, I will, life serving, attempt my work." [...] Early in November Darwin, hinting that [...] "geographical distrib: will be the key which will unlock the mystery of species", invited Hooker to [...] "look over a rough sketch (well copied) on this subject" [...] while fearing this was [...] "too impudent a request".|$|E

2500|$|In 1821 he {{finished}} a painting commissioned by a childhood friend, Monsieur de Pastoret, The Entry into Paris of the Dauphin, the Future Charles V; de Pastoret also ordered {{a portrait of}} himself and a religious work (Virgin with the Blue Veil). In August 1820, {{with the help of}} de Pastoret, he received a commission for a major religious painting for the Cathedral of Montauban. The theme was the re-establishment of the bond between the church and the state. Ingres's painting, The Vow of Louis XIII (1824), inspired by Raphael, was purely in the Renaissance style, and depicted King Louis XIII vowing to dedicate his reign to the Virgin Mary. This was perfectly in tune with the doctrine of the new government of the Restoration. He spent four years bringing the large canvas to completion, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> to the Paris Salon in October 1824, where it [...] became the key that finally opened the door of the Paris art establishment and to his career as an official painter.|$|E
