5|$|While {{the human}} and {{property}} losses were staggering, the cultural loss is still felt today. The University of Copenhagen library was without a doubt the greatest and the most frequently mentioned of such. 35,000texts and a large <b>archive</b> <b>of</b> historical documents disappeared in the flames. Original works from the historians Hans Svaning, Anders Sørensen Vedel, Niels Krag, and Arild Huitfeldt and the scientists Ole Worm, Ole Rømer, Tycho Brahe and the brothers Hans and Caspar Bartholin were lost. Atlas Danicus by Peder Hansen Resen and the <b>archive</b> <b>of</b> Zealand Diocese went up in flames as well. The <b>archive</b> <b>of</b> the diocese had been moved to the university library the very same day the fire started.|$|E

Locally, documents are preserved in the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture's General <b>Archive</b> <b>of</b> Puerto Rico, the Ateneo Puertorriqueño, the University of Puerto Rico's General Library and Historic Investigation Department and the Catholic Church's Parochial Archives.

50|$|It {{should be}} noted that due to the events of the French Revolution, the pre-French Revolution {{archives}} kept by the Archives Nationales are not just the <b>archives</b> <b>of</b> the central state, but also the many local <b>archives</b> <b>of</b> the Paris region, such as all the <b>archives</b> <b>of</b> the abbeys surrounding Paris (e.g. the Basilica of St Denis), the <b>archives</b> <b>of</b> the churches of Paris, and the <b>archives</b> <b>of</b> the medieval Paris city hall. Thus, the Archives Nationales serve as the <b>archives</b> <b>of</b> the French central state for records from 1790 onwards, but for records before 1790 they serve as both the <b>archives</b> <b>of</b> the central state and the local <b>archives</b> <b>of</b> Paris and its region. The Archives Nationales, however, do not keep the church records of Paris (baptisms, marriages and burials). These were entirely destroyed by fires set by extremists {{at the end of the}} Paris Commune in 1871.|$|R
