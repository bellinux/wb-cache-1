5|$|Some {{species of}} molluscs, {{particularly}} certain snails and slugs, can be serious crop pests, and when introduced into new environments, can unbalance local ecosystems. One such pest, the giant African snail Achatina fulica, {{has been introduced}} to many parts of Asia, {{as well as to}} many islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. In the 1990s, this species reached the West Indies. <b>Attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> it by introducing the predatory snail Euglandina rosea proved disastrous, as the predator ignored Achatina fulica and went on to extirpate several native snail species, instead.|$|E

It is usually initiated and carried out by women, who {{see it as a}} source of honour, and who fear that failing to have their daughters and granddaughters cut will expose the girls to social exclusion. Health effects depend on the procedure. They can include recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, chronic pain, the development of cysts, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding. There are no known health benefits.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II in 1945, the rightwing {{elements}} who had {{resisted the}} US entry into World War II because of their pro-Fascist isolationism, continued their <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> and punish the left-leaning entertainment professionals who fought the spread of Fascism in Europe during the 1930s while the United States was technically neutral. In 1946, the Republicans gained an overwhelming majority in the Congressional elections. and used this power to re-invigorate committees there that had failed to stop anti-Fascist artists before the war.

5|$|Apart from <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> {{the spread}} of the Aedes {{mosquito}} there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{threat that}} Clan Donald posed to the Scottish crown {{led to the}} forcible {{dissolution}} of the Lordship of the Isles by James IV in 1493, but although the king {{had the power to}} subdue the organised military might of the Hebrides, he and his immediate successors lacked the will or ability to provide an alternative form of governance. The House of Stuart's <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the Outer Hebrides were then at first desultory and little more than punitive expeditions. In 1506 the Earl of Huntly besieged and captured Stornoway Castle using cannon. In 1540 James V himself conducted a royal tour, forcing the clan chiefs to accompany him. There followed a period of peace, but all too soon the clans were at loggerheads again.|$|E

5|$|With Andrew III's death, {{the male}} {{line of the}} House of Árpád became extinct, and a period of anarchy began. Charles Robert was crowned king with a {{provisional}} crown, but most lords and bishops refused to yield to him because they regarded him {{as a symbol of}} the Holy See's <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> Hungary. They elected king the twelve-year-old Wenceslaus of Bohemia, who was descended from Béla IV of Hungary in the female line. The young king could not consolidate his position because many lords, especially those who held domains in the southern region of the kingdom, continued to support Charles Robert. Wenceslaus left Hungary for Bohemia in mid-1304. After he inherited Bohemia in 1305, he abandoned his claim to Hungary in favor of Otto III, Duke of Bavaria.|$|E
5|$|Zajdel's early works, from 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, focuses on {{scientific}} inventions {{and their role}} in space exploration, alien contact or artificial intelligence. As his writing career continued, however, his stories evolved {{to focus on the}} social aspects and often negative consequences of those inventions. Over time, an increasingly visible theme became visible in his works - a concern over dangers inherent in <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the human society. He is also condemning human ignorance, warning against xenophobia, and asking philosophical questions {{about the nature of the}} universe, happiness and human destiny. Zajdel's works from his second period - late 1970s and 1980s - and represent the genres of social and dystopian fiction. In his works, he envisions totalitarian states and societies leaving under extreme forms of mass surveillance.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{was perceived}} as a signifier of social identity, with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses, much to the higher-class ladies' disapproval. The questions of servants in crinoline and the related social concerns were raised by George Routledge in an etiquette manual published in 1875, where he criticised London housemaids for wearing hoops at work. As the girls knelt to scrub the doorsteps, Routledge described how their hoops rose to expose their lower bodies, inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers-by. Routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their fashionable garments for their leisure periods, and dress appropriately for their work. However, this was challenged by some servants who saw <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty, and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines.|$|E

5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is closely {{associated}} with humans. They {{are believed to have}} become associated with humans around 10,000 years ago. Subspecies P. d. bactrianus is least associated with humans and considered to be evolutionarily closer to the ancestral noncommensal populations. Usually, it is regarded as a pest, since it consumes agricultural products and spreads disease to humans and their domestic animals. Even birdwatchers often hold it in little regard because of its molestation of other birds. In most of the world, the house sparrow is not protected by law. <b>Attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> house sparrows include the trapping, poisoning, or shooting of adults; the destruction of their nests and eggs; or less directly, blocking nest holes and scaring off sparrows with noise, glue, or porcupine wire. However, the house sparrow can be beneficial to humans, as well, especially by eating insect pests, and attempts at the large-scale control of the house sparrow have failed.|$|E
5|$|When Empress Dowager Deng died, Emperor An (r.106–125 AD) was {{convinced}} by the accusations of the eunuchs Li Run (李閏) and Jiang Jing (江京) that Deng {{and her family}} had planned to depose him. An dismissed Deng's clan members from office, exiled them and forced many to commit suicide. After An's death, his wife, Empress Dowager Yan (d.126 AD) placed the child Marquess of Beixiang on the throne {{in an attempt to}} retain power within her family. However, palace eunuch Sun Cheng (d.132 AD) masterminded a successful overthrow of her regime to enthrone Emperor Shun of Han (r.125–144 AD). Yan was placed under house arrest, her relatives were either killed or exiled, and her eunuch allies were slaughtered. The regent Liang Ji (d.159 AD), brother of Empress Liang Na (d.150 AD), had the brother-in-law of Consort Deng Mengnü (later empress) (d.165 AD) killed after Deng Mengnü resisted Liang Ji's <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> her. Afterward, Emperor Huan employed eunuchs to depose Liang Ji, who was then forced to commit suicide.|$|E
5|$|Women {{had limited}} access to formal {{education}} and girls benefited less than boys from {{the expansion of the}} parish school system. Some women were taught reading, domestic tasks, but often not writing. In noble households some received a private education and some female literary figures emerged from the seventeenth century. Religion may have been particularly important as a means of expression for women and from the seventeenth century women may have had greater opportunities for religious participation in movements outside of the established kirk. Women had very little legal status {{at the beginning of the}} period, unable to act as witnesses or legally responsible for their own actions. From the mid-sixteenth century they were increasingly criminalised, with statutes allowing them to be prosecuted for infanticide and as witches. Seventy-five per cent of an estimated 6,000 individuals prosecuted for witchcraft between 1563 and 1736 were women and perhaps 1,500 were executed. As a result, some historians have seen this period as characterised by increasing concern with women and <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> and constrain them.|$|E
