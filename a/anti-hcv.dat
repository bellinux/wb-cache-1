50|$|Liver kidney microsomal type 1 {{antibody}} is an autoantibody {{associated with}} autoimmune hepatitis. It {{is one of}} the several subtypes of anti-liver-kidney microsome antibodies that are known. LKM-1 antibodies associated with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis recognize P450 2D6, a cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase. The frequent association of anti-LKM-1 antibodies and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and the probable existence of an infectious and autoimmune form of anti-LKM-1-associated hepatitis, requiring different therapeutical strategies, necessitates the exact determination of anti-LKM-1 specificities. Therefore, we compared various antibody tests (immunofluorescence, ELISA with recombinant P450 2D6, and Western blot with recombinant and natural antigens and agargel double diffusion) with sera of 27 anti-LKM-1-positive chronic active hepatitis (CAH) patients, with 61 sera harbouring anti-mitochondrial antibodies, 100 sera each from HCV-RNA-positive and HCV-RNA-negative patients, and 50 sera of healthy persons. Western blot techniques using recombinant MS2-polymerase P450 2D6 fusion protein were found to be the most sensitive and specific method for anti-LKM-1 antibody determination in routine laboratory. The recently recognized association of anti-LKM-1 antibody and HCV infection was confirmed by the results of this study. In <b>anti-HCV</b> and HCV-RNA-positive patients with anti-LKM-1 antibodies there was a preponderance of males with higher mean age and lower antibody titres. The results support the hypothesis of the existence of an autoimmune as well as an infectious (HCV triggered) subgroup of anti-LKM-1-positive hepatitis.|$|E

Eleven patients (12 %) were <b>anti-HCV</b> (+). Of these, eight (73 %) had antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) indicating prior hepatitis B infection; one patient was hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (+). All staff members were <b>anti-HCV</b> (-), although seven (19 %) of them were anti-HBc (+).

Because of the inadequate supply of cadaver kidneys for transplantation, we adopted a policy to transplant kidneys from <b>anti-HCV</b> donors into <b>anti-HCV</b> positive recipients. During the period between March 1990 and December 1992, 24 <b>anti-HCV</b> positive dialysis patients received a kidney from <b>anti-HCV</b> positive donors (group I) and 40 <b>anti-HCV</b> positive patients received a kidney from <b>anti-HCV</b> negative donors (group II).

Pre-transplantation 17 of 24 (71 %) patients in group I and 31 of 40 (79 %) of patients in group II had serum HCV RNA. Post-transplantation follow-up was 26 ± 8 months and 30 ± 10 months in groups I and II, respectively. During follow-up, elevated ALT levels were present in 7 of 24 (29 %) and 16 of 40 (40 %) of patients in groups I and II, respectively (P > 0. 05).

However, frequency of seroreversion remains unknown in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) /HCV-coinfected patients. We describe <b>anti-HCV</b> dynamics among HIV-infected {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) following acute HCV infection and reinfection. Primary acute HCV infection was assumed when a subject was <b>anti-HCV</b> negative prior to the first positive HCV RNA test. <b>Anti-HCV</b> was measured at least annually in 63 HIV-infected MSM, with a median follow-up of 4. 0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2. 5 - 5. 7 years). Time from HCV infection to seroconversion, and from seroconversion to seroreversion, was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Longitudinal <b>anti-HCV</b> patterns were studied using a random-effects model to adjust for repeated measures. Median time from HCV infection to seroconversion was 74 days (IQR, 47 - 125 days). Subjects who cleared HCV RNA (n = 36) showed a significant decrease in <b>anti-HCV</b> levels (P <. 001). Among 31 subjects with sustained virologic response (SVR), <b>anti-HCV</b> became undetectable during follow-up in 8; cumulative incidence of seroreversion within 3 years after seroconversion was 37 % (95 % confidence interval, 18 %- 66 %).

40|$|Background/Aims: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA testing can be {{performed}} using qualitative or quantitative assays, {{and it is still}} unclear which is more useful as a primary test in patients positive for <b>anti-HCV.</b> The present study evaluated the usefulness of <b>anti-HCV</b> signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/CO ratio) for predicting HCV RNA results. Methods: Patients on whom a qualitative HCV RNA test was performed due to a positive <b>anti-HCV</b> enzyme immunoassay were enrolled. Patients were divided into viremia and no-viremia groups according to HCV RNA results. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of <b>anti-HCV</b> S/CO for a diagnosis of viremia. Results: In total, 487 patients were enrolled. HCV RNA was positive in 301 subjects (61. 8 %). Age, serum ALT level, and <b>anti-HCV</b> S/CO ratio were significantly different between the viremia and no-viremia groups. By ROC curve analysis, <b>anti-HCV</b> S/CO ratio (area, 0. 989; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 981 to 0. 998) accurately predicted the presence of viremia, with a cutoff value of 10. 9 (sensitivity, 94. 4 %; specificity, 97. 3 %). Conclusions: <b>Anti-HCV</b> S/CO ratio was found to be highly accurate at predicting HCV viremia.

In contrast, {{the significance of this}} antibody in HCV infection is unclear and data regarding end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are lacking. Methods. We tested sera from 78 ESRD patients (66 chronic dialysis patients, 12 renal allograft recipients) showing <b>anti-HCV</b> IgG antibody, for serum <b>anti-HCV</b> IgM core antibody. A specific solid-phase enzyme-linked immunoassay (HCV IgM EIA, Abbott) was used.

Prevalence of <b>anti-HCV</b> IgM core antibody was 22 % (17 / 78). We observed association between prevalence of <b>anti-HCV</b> IgM core antibody and fre-quency of HCV RNA in the serum. Thus 15 of 45 (33 %) sera containing HCV RNA also contained <b>anti-HCV</b> IgM, while two of 33 (6 %) HCV RNA negative sera showed <b>anti-HCV</b> IgM core antibody (/> = 0. 01).

40|$|Background and aims: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{represents}} a major worldwide {{public health problem}} requiring global action for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of this infection. HCV {{is the leading cause}} of chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma and it is responsible for about 350, 000 deaths yearly. <b>Anti-HCV</b> assays remain the first choice for screening HCV infection in most clinical laboratories. The <b>anti-HCV</b> VIDAS® (bioMérieux, Marcy L’Etoile, France) test has been recently launched and we aimed to evaluate its performance compared with other widely used methods. Materials and methods: Routine <b>anti-HCV</b> screening of clinical samples was carried out on the ARCHITECT® i 2000 SR platform (Abbot Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA); out of 8876 samples tested from October 2012 to May 2013, 70 sera with low positive <b>anti-HCV</b> results (1 ≤S/CO< 8) were collected. These samples were tested for the presence of <b>anti-HCV</b> antibodies using <b>anti-HCV</b> VIDAS® and INNO-LIATM HCV score assays (Innogenetics NV, Ghent, Belgium). Results and conclusions: Positive <b>anti-HCV</b> results were obtained in 61. 4 % and 41. 4 % of sera tested with VIDAS® and INNO-LIATM, respectively. Concordance between methods was 63. 2 % for ARCHITECT® and VIDAS®, 42. 6 % for ARCHITECT® and INNO-LIATM, and 79. 4 % for VIDAS® and INNO-LIATM. <b>Anti-HCV</b> VIDAS® demonstrated superior specificity compared to the <b>anti-HCV</b> test ARCHITECT®; therefore, this assay has been introduced in our routine analysis as a second level screening test to select samples to be subjected to confirmatory anti- HCV immunoblot...|$|E
40|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of recurrent hepatitis C following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) may be difficult. We evaluated the diagnostic significance of IgM anti-hepatitis C virus (<b>anti-HCV)</b> core antibodies in 27 patients undergoing OLT because of HCV-associated cirrhosis. Serial serum samples collected {{before and after}} OLT were tested {{for the presence of}} IgM <b>anti-HCV</b> core antibodies. Results were compared with the histological evidence of liver damage, the presence, level, and genotype of serum HCV RNA and the degree of immunosuppression. All patients underwent recurrent HCV infection. Recurrent hepatitis was diagnosed histologically in 21 patients an average of 48 weeks after OLT (range 2 - 209 weeks) : 18 had persistence or (re-) appearance of the IgM <b>anti-HCV</b> core after OLT, one lost the IgM <b>anti-HCV</b> core after OLT, and two never secreted IgM <b>anti-HCV</b> core either before or after OLT. The remaining six patients did not develop recurrent hepatitis after a follow-up of 44 - 241 weeks from OLT; in these patients, IgM <b>anti-HCV</b> core either disappeared (1 case) or decreased (1 case) after OLT or were persistently negative throughout the study (4 cases). Thus, 18 / 21 patients with recurrent hepatitis, but only one of six without recurrent hepatitis, secreted IgM <b>anti-HCV</b> core after OLT (P < 0. 05). The IgM <b>anti-HCV</b> core levels were not correlated with the level or genotype of serum HCV RNA or the degree of immunosuppression. In conclusion, secretion of IgM <b>anti-HCV</b> core antibodies after OLT seems associated with recurrence of HCV-associated liver disease and may have diagnostic significance...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Conventional {{tests for}} {{antibody}} to hepatitis C virus (HCV) require considerable time before results are available. The {{aim of this}} study is to examine the accuracy of a new quick test (SM-HCV Rapid Test) for the detection of antibody to hepatitis C virus with reference to the well-established third generation enzyme immunoblot assay (EIA- 3; Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL). METHODS: A total of 290 subjects (100 patients with chronic hepatitis C infections, 95 patients with other chronic liver diseases, 95 healthy subjects) were recruited. Thirty microliters of serum was tested for <b>anti-HCV</b> by SM-HCV Rapid Test according to the manufacturer's instruction. Liver function tests and serum HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were measured. RESULTS: In the 100 patients positive for <b>anti-HCV</b> by E 1 A- 3, 98 of these patients were also positive for <b>anti-HCV</b> by SM-HCV Rapid Test. In the 95 patients with other chronic liver diseases, 94 samples were negative for <b>anti-HCV</b> by both EIA- 3 and SM-HCV Rapid Test. The remaining one patient was positive for <b>anti-HCV</b> by the EIA- 3 but negative by the SM-HCV Rapid Test. In the 95 controls, which were negative for <b>anti-HCV</b> by EIA- 3, all were also negative for <b>anti-HCV</b> by SM-HCV Rapid Test and HCV RNA by PCR. Using EIA- 3 as the gold standard screening test for <b>anti-HCV,</b> the sensitivity and the specificity of SM-HCV Rapid Test were 98 % and 100 %, respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of SM-HCV Rapid Test were 100 % and 97. 9 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SM-HCV Rapid Test is a reliable test with high sensitivity and specificity. The <b>anti-HCV</b> result can be available within a very short period of time. It is a useful screening test for <b>anti-HCV.</b> © 2001 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Outcome of HCV {{infection}} after renal transplantation. The {{fate and}} significance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after renal transplantation (TP) remain debated. We therefore evaluated the incidence and outcome of HCV infection in 120 kidney graft recipients both {{at the time of}} TP and 54 ± 28 (13 to 123) months later using ELISA-II and RIBA-II immunoblot. Furthermore, the presence of <b>anti-HCV</b> antibodies at follow-up was correlated with HCV viremia, as detected by the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and with chronically abnormal ALT levels. At the time of TP, 17 patients (14. 2 %) had <b>anti-HCV</b> antibodies. Compared to <b>anti-HCV</b> (-) patients, <b>anti-HCV</b> (+) patients had a longer duration of pre-TP dialysis (P < 0. 001) and had received more pre-TP blood transfusions (P < 0. 01). After an average follow-up of 48. 5 ± 24. 7 (21 to 97) months, all these patients remained <b>anti-HCV</b> (+) but only 10 were still RIBA “reactive” due to the loss of reactivity against the 5 - 1 - 1, C 100 and C 33 (but not the C 22) antigens. Five initially <b>anti-HCV</b> (-) patients had become (+) at follow-up. Among the 22 patients <b>anti-HCV</b> (+) at follow-up, 20 had HCV-RNA detectable by PCR but only 10 had elevated ALT. Ten out of 13 HBsAg (-) patients with elevated ALT were <b>anti-HCV</b> (+). Our study indicates that disappearance of ELISA-II <b>anti-HCV</b> antibodies is rare in kidney recipients and that HCV infection may also occur after TP. <b>Anti-HCV</b> antibodies are likely to reflect a persisting infection as suggested by the frequent detection of HCV-RNA. However, a substantial proportion of transplanted patients with HCV infection have normal ALT levels. HCV infection emerges as the main cause of liver dysfunction in kidney graft recipients...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{significance}} of immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen was studied in 60  patients with HCV infection after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction.  METHODS—Patients were followed {{up for a}} mean of 28  months after transplantation. Sera collected three months before transplantation, and one and 12  months after transplantation were analysed for <b>anti-HCV</b> core IgM (HCV-IgM EIA 2. 0  assay). After OLT protocol biopsies, procedures were performed routinely every six months. Semiquantitative histopathological assessment of allograft hepatitis was performed using Knodell's score. The results were correlated with clinical features, liver histology findings, and virological features, such as genotype and viraemic levels assessed by a branched DNA assay.  RESULTS—One year after liver transplantation, 29 / 60 (48 %) patients had chronic hepatitis on graft biopsy. The presence of <b>anti-HCV</b> core IgM one month (p= 0. 004) and 12  months (p= 0. 003) after OLT {{was positively correlated with}} recurrence of chronic hepatitis. The positive predictive value of <b>anti-HCV</b> core IgM detected one month after transplantation was 0. 88.  A significant relationship was observed between severity of graft disease and presence of <b>anti-HCV</b> core IgM 12  months after transplantation. The mean Knodell score was 8. 9  in <b>anti-HCV</b> core IgM positive patients compared with 3. 6  in those who were <b>anti-HCV</b> core IgM negative (p= 0. 001). The presence of IgM <b>anti-HCV</b> did not correlate with serum HCV RNA level or HCV genotype.  CONCLUSION—We confirm that the presence of <b>anti-HCV</b> core IgM after OLT is a marker of HCV induced graft damage. The recurrence and severity of HCV hepatitis in patients undergoing OLT for HCV cirrhosis is related to the presence of <b>anti-HCV</b> core IgM after liver transplantation. These findings have diagnostic relevance and confirm that measurement of IgM <b>anti-HCV</b> core may help to better monitor the treatment of HCV recurrence after transplantation.    Keywords: hepatitis C; orthotopic liver transplantation; <b>anti-HCV</b> core IgM; immunopathogenesi...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCentral Africa is {{considered}} to be an area of high endemic hepatitis C infection. To determine the prevalence of <b>anti-HCV</b> antibodies, HCV RNA, and the genotype distribution in Cameroon, 1, 494 pregnant women attending antenatal care units in Yaounde, Cameroon were screened for HCV infection. <b>Anti-HCV</b> antibodies were detected with a 3 rd generation ELISA (Monolisa <b>anti-HCV</b> plus version 2, BioRad, Richmond, CA). All <b>anti-HCV</b> antibody-positive sera were then tested with another 3 rd generation ELISA (AxSYM) HCV version 3, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and subsequently for HCV RNA (Amplicor HCV, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Genotype was determined by phylogenetic analysis of the NS 5 b gene. Seventy-three pregnant women were found to be <b>anti-HCV</b> antibody positive by the first ELISA, but only 28 were <b>anti-HCV</b> positive by both ELISA. The prevalence of <b>anti-HCV</b> antibodies was thus 1. 9 % (28 / 1, 494) (95 % CI: 1. 3 - 2. 7 %). 21 / 28 (75 %) of the positive samples by both ELISA were HCV RNA positive. The 45 samples that were HCV antibody negative by the second ELISA were also HCV RNA negative. The HCV subtypes identified were 1 a (24 %), 2 f (38 %) and 4 f (38 %). In contrast to previous studies, <b>anti-HCV</b> antibodies were rare among pregnant women in Cameroon.
