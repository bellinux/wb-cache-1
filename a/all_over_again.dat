5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I Could Do It <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Again,</b> I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If I Could Do It <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Again...</b> but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E
5|$|The Toy Story {{films and}} {{characters}} will always hold {{a very special}} place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. With Toy Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody and the gang from Andy's room, {{we thought it would be}} great to let audiences experience the first two films <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> and in a brand new way.|$|E
5|$|The climax {{is reached}} on Dr. Impossible's island, as he {{attempts}} to start a controlled Ice Age, making him Earth's ruler and only source of energy. He almost succeeds, using the hammer formerly belonging to the supervillain The Pharaoh to defeat the New Champions. CoreFire suddenly returns but is also unsuccessful against Dr. Impossible. Lily, who had quit the team earlier, eventually returns and defeats Dr. Impossible. Lily reveals that she is actually Erica Lowenstein, Dr. Impossible's childhood crush before his transformation and frequent kidnapee when she was the girlfriend of CoreFire. In the final chapter, Dr. Impossible ponders what it truly means to conquer the world, and whether such a feat can really be achieved, as he prepares for yet another escape from custody to start the cycle <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> with a new plan.|$|E

25|$|Then the master, having cooled down would {{apologize}} for his roughness, speak {{kind words of}} encouragement, and we would begin <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> with enthusiasm.|$|E
25|$|Mendoza seems hopelessly trapped. Can she {{survive to}} the 19th century <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> or is her {{immortality}} as suspect as other things have become? Twice {{now she has}} met her demon lover. She knows he will come for her again.|$|E
25|$|Foreigners {{who have}} {{obtained}} a Singapore licence are supplied with a limited-duration licence which {{needs to be}} renewed between one month before expiry to three years after expiry.

25|$|In the {{tradition}} of the prevailing Southeast Asian administrative model, every new high king had to establish his authority with the vassals <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> This was already a difficult task when vassals were situated in the same geographic region but nearly impossible with faraway lands, given inherent difficulties in bringing serious warfare to those lands.|$|E
25|$|In some Vaishnava Puranas, Vishnu {{takes the}} form of Rudra or {{commands}} Rudra to destroy the world, thereafter the entire universe dissolves and along with time, everything is reabsorbed back into Vishnu. The universe is then recreated from Vishnu <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> starting a new Kalpa. Other texts offer alternate cosmogenic theories, such as one where the universe and time are absorbed into Shiva.|$|E
25|$|Respecting one's {{health and}} {{physical}} well-being {{was one of the}} foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It must, I tell you!" [...] {{repeated}} Caroline. [...] "If it had <b>all</b> {{to begin}} <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> {{it would be}} very different. O, if it was but this time last year!" ...|$|R

I'm tired of it!" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{disaster}} in Hobyo shocked Italian policymakers in Rome. It was the Adwa fiasco of the First Italoâ€“Ethiopian War <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> and Italy's plans for East Africa were unraveling before their very eyes. Blame soon fell on Governor De Vecchi, whose perceived incompetence was blamed for Omar's rise. Rome instructed De Vecchi {{that he was}} to receive the reinforcement from Eritrea, but that the commander of the Eritrean battalions was to assume the military command and De Vecchi was confined to Mogadishu and limited to an administrative role. The commander was to report directly to Rome, bypassing De Vecchi entirely.|$|E
25|$|Frank is a wheeler-dealer {{who likes}} to {{think of himself as}} a 'big player' in the {{business}} world, but in reality he {{is little more than a}} wily conman. He is a smooth-talker and full of charm, but his actions are often thoughtless and he tends to run instead of facing up to his responsibilities, leaving his loved ones to pick up the pieces. His love affair with Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) stems back to his teens, and he can never quite let her go, always breaking her heart, disappearing, and returning to break it <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Mr Osborne, Amelia, Jos, George and Dobbin go to Pumpernickel (Weimar in Germany), where they {{encounter}} the destitute Becky. Becky has fallen in life. She lives among card sharps and con artists, drinking heavily and gambling. Becky enchants Jos Sedley <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> and Amelia is persuaded to let Becky join them. Dobbin forbids this, and reminds Amelia of her jealousy of Becky with her husband. Amelia feels that this dishonours {{the memory of her}} dead and revered husband, and this leads to a complete breach between her and Dobbin. Dobbin leaves the group and rejoins his regiment, while Becky remains with the group.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some day I {{will tell}} you, when I {{have the courage}} to go <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it <b>again.</b> It is partly my own fault, but it is more my miserable fortune. But {{wherever}} the wrong lies, it has at last become intolerable to me. I cannot endure it any longer and live. I must go away, I must fly from it." ...|$|R
50|$|Since 2001 Strife played several {{shows and}} tours <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the globe <b>again,</b> {{including}} a Japan tour with Floorpunch in 2011, {{a tour of}} South America, a European tour, and some dates in Mexico.|$|R
60|$|The goat protested {{against the}} amateur, {{and there was}} a scuffle, in which Scott {{snatched}} up the baby. Then it was <b>all</b> to do <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> and William laughed softly and merrily. She managed, however, to feed two babies, and a third.|$|R
25|$|Several {{cars were}} {{conceived}} by Henry Ford from {{the founding of}} the company in 1903 before the Model T was introduced. Although he started with the Model A, there were not 19 production models (A through T); some were only prototypes. The production model immediately before the Model T was the Model S, an upgraded version of the company's largest success to that point, the Model N. The follow-up was the Ford Model A (rather than any Model U). The company publicity said this was because the new car was such a departure from the old that Henry wanted to start <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> with the letter A.|$|E
25|$|In March 1754, Hanthawaddy {{did what}} {{they should have done}} two years before, and sent the entire army. It would have been 1751â€“1752 <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> except that they had to face Alaungpaya instead of an effete dynasty. At first, the {{invasion}} went as planned. The Hanthawaddy forces led by Upayaza, the heir-apparent and Gen. Talaban defeated the Konbaung armies led by Alaungpaya's sons Naungdawgyi and Hsinbyushin at Myingyan. One Hanthawaddy army chased Hsinbyushin to Ava, and laid siege to the city. Another army chased Naungdawgyi's army, advancing as far as Kyaukmyaung a few miles from Shwebo, where Alaungpaya was residing. The Hanthawaddy flotilla had complete control of the entire Irrawaddy River.|$|E
25|$|As {{the islands}} slowly {{moved away from}} the hotspot, by the motion of sliding plates as {{described}} by the theory of plate tectonics, the magma supply is cut, and the volcano goes dormant. Meanwhile, the process repeats <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> this time forming a new island, on and on until the hotspot collapses. The theory was developed to explain the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, where historic islands could be traced to the northwest in the direction that the Pacific Plate is moving. The early theory put these fixed sources of heat for the plumes deep within the Earth; however, recent research has led scientists to believe that hotspots are actually dynamic, and able to move on their own accord.|$|E
50|$|D.R.I. {{embarked}} {{on yet another}} tour in 2004 that would take them <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the US and <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Europe <b>again.</b> After completing the tour, they {{decided it was time}} to start working with Beer City on the Live At CBGBâ€™s CD and DVD and the reissue of the Crossover album. The Live At CBGBâ€™s DVD and CD was reissued and is available on Beer City Records.The reissue of Crossover was delayed due to Spike's illness (see below).|$|R
60|$|After breakfast Jack and I {{retired to}} my room, where, the weather being {{unfavourable}} for our fishing excursion, I went <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it <b>again</b> in detail. After that I sent Jack off to amuse {{himself as he}} chose, and, seizing a quire of foolscap, mended a pen, squared my elbows, and began to write this remarkable account {{of the reason why}} I did not become a sailor.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, don't tell me so!' almost angrily exclaimed the Squire. 'Jem Frost marry! He has no {{business}} {{to think of it}} these ten years! He ought to be minding his grandmother and sister. To marry on that school would be serving poor Mrs. Frost exactly as his poor absurd father did before him, and she is too old to have <b>all</b> that <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> I thought he was of a different sort of stamp.' ...|$|R
25|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of the Mongols, Eger began to flourish <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> Lambert, the bishop of Eger, received a permit from BÃ©la IV for the building a stone fortress. So the nearly destroyed town revived and reached the peak of its medieval development in the l4th and 15th centuries. During this period the forests which spread to the limits of the town were cleared for the most part, and vines were planted in their place. More and more town-houses were built in the settlement. Roads were constructed among which the ones in the inner town were narrow and twisting but those leading to the northern mining towns were wider. The versions surrounding settlements such as Almagyar and CziglÃ©d were built up along with Eger.|$|E
25|$|Ruskin {{was born}} at 54 Hunter Street, Brunswick Square, London (demolished 1969), south of St Pancras railway station. His {{childhood}} was characterised by the contrasting influences {{of his father and}} mother, both fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son's Romanticism. They shared a passion for the works of Byron, Shakespeare and especially Walter Scott. They visited Scott's home, Abbotsford in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance. Margaret Ruskin, an Evangelical Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the King James Bible from beginning to end, and then to start <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and stories had a profound and lasting effect on his writing.|$|E
25|$|After returning, Jason {{began to}} suffer from {{life-threatening}} headaches, seizures and amnesia. Sam is there for Jason when he eventually loses his memory {{as a result of}} his illness. Sam convinces Jason to undergo treatment with the help Dr. Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough). He and Sam fall in love <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> and he proposes to her a second time before he begins his treatment. After the treatment, Jason gets his memory back and remembers his life with Sam, but the procedure causes a brain aneurysm. Jason initially refuses to have surgery to repair the damage, and he and Sam move to Hawaii to live out his last days peacefully. However, Jason realizes that he wants to live to be with Sam, and returns to Port Charles to have the surgery, which ended up saving his life.|$|E
