5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> designs and backgrounds had to be created for the wilderness scenes. The backgrounds were designed by animator Debbie Silver. The design of the forest ranger was based on then-Vice President Al Gore. In the episode, Marge watches an old film which includes a comment from naturalist John Muir. The impression of Muir was done by Dan Castellaneta, who originally based the voice on an impersonator he met at Yosemite National Park. However, the producers asked {{him to make the}} voice older and crazier.|$|E

This network has sometimes been linked with local anarchist-related groups, squats, cultural/social/left-wing centers. Most of the concerts of punk bands in Greece have no, or minimal, entrance fee {{and many of them}} are arranged according to DIY ethics.|$|R
25|$|Also, {{there is}} a {{vocabulary}} spurt between 18–24 months, which includes fast mapping. Fast mapping is the babies' ability to learn <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> things quickly. The majority of the babies' new vocabulary consists of object words (nouns) and action words (verbs).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Bulgaria was powered {{with the spirit}} of freedom, {{revolution}} and exaltation – the perfect background for creating rock music. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> names and bands sprang up, bringing fresh air and sweeping away the old music controlled and censored by the Communist authorities.|$|E
25|$|In 1861, as the American Civil War broke out, the Confederate Army had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> recruits.

5000|$|In Icons of Rock, Scott Schinder {{calls the}} song [...] "a sophomoric, double-entendre-laden ode to masturbation". Robert Christgau remarked that the song [...] "permitted <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> twelve-year-olds <b>new</b> {{insight into the}} moribund concept of 'dirty'".|$|R
25|$|Ballymoney has {{expanded}} {{in recent years}} and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> houses have been built. This is primarily as a result of high house prices in the Coleraine/Portstewart/Portrush 'Triangle' areas shifting first-time buyers to the less expensive Ballymoney area. Ballymoney is located on the main road between Coleraine and Ballymena, with good road and rail connections to the main cities in Northern Ireland, Belfast and Derry.|$|E
25|$|The next {{album was}} delayed {{for almost three}} years as the band {{was looking for a}} new record label after {{finishing}} their deal with Delerium. In the meantime, they launched Metanoia (1998), a compilation of improvisations recorded during the Signify sessions, some of which were later shaped into songs. Finally, they signed to Snapper/K-Scope and the album Stupid Dream (1999) was issued. The album was a departure in style from all their previous works, in favour a more song-oriented direction, as a consequence this alienated some older fans but brought <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> ones. Its follow-up, Lightbulb Sun (2000), assured the fan base and solidified the ground of its predecessor. For this one, they worked with Dave Gregory of XTC, who provided string arrangements. A collection of EP tracks and out-takes from the previous two albums was launched a year after under the title of Recordings (2001).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} part of the decade, sales were strong, thanks in no small part to the company's history of {{building}} small cars, which came into vogue in 1961. In both 1960 and 1961, Ramblers ranked in third place among domestic automobile sales, up from third on the strength of small-car sales, even in the face of <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> competition. Romney's strategic focus was very successful as reflected in the firm's healthy profits year after year. The company became completely debt-free. The financial success allowed the company to reach an agreement on August 26, 1961 with the United Auto Workers for a profit sharing plan that was new in the automobile industry. Its new three-year labor contract also included generous annual improvement pay increases, as well as automatic cost-of-living raises. However, in 1962, Romney resigned to run for Governor of Michigan. His replacement was Roy Abernethy, AMC's successful sales executive.|$|E
50|$|The inter-connectivity and {{interactivity}} of the internet, {{as well as}} {{the fight}} between corporate interests, governmental interests, and public interests that gave birth to the web today, fascinate and inspire <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> current <b>new</b> media art.|$|R

50|$|On January 1, 2009, HPR3 again {{switched}} formats {{and names}} becoming HPR3: The Alternative Country Channel.

25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult is a very difficult thing to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> Americans.|$|E
500|$|Writer James Wong was {{disappointed}} with the episode, feeling that he [...] "didn't {{do a great job}} on the script. We wanted to do a show that's all about paranoia and a conspiracy theory, but at the end I felt like we didn't really gain <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> ground or learn <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> things. I think we played a lot of texture instead of substance." [...] Series creator Chris Carter on the other hand claimed the episode {{was one of the most}} popular first-season episodes and thought the teaser and the scene with Mulder meeting Deep Throat at a shark tank were memorable. He also praised Jerry Hardin's performance in the episode, finding that he lent the show the [...] "believability" [...] that it needed.|$|E
500|$|Asked in November 2008 {{what the}} current status of the new album was, bassist Rex Brown told Billboard.com that Down had been [...] "writing {{constantly}} on the road. We still have all these ideas, and we play <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> stuff at sound check, just to feel it out. Hopefully, we can get back in the studio in the fall and work on something." ...|$|E

500|$|When The Lion King was green-lit, its {{concept and}} story were not well {{received}} by studio employees. [...] To guarantee {{the release of}} at least one successful film, Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg divided the studio into two separate projects: The Lion King and Pocahontas (1995), with Pocahontas expected to be the more successful of the two. [...] Because of this assumption, the majority of the studio's more seasoned animators gravitated towards Pocahontas because The Lion King was deemed a [...] "risk", while less experienced animators were assigned to work on The Lion King. [...] Co-director Rob Minkoff received this positively, saying that this decision [...] "gave <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>newer</b> animators <b>a</b> chance to step up to leadership roles." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{song was}} first {{released}} onto the internet on Valentine's Day 2012 through SoundCloud.

500|$|In 2005, Chow {{announced}} {{that there would}} be a sequel to Kung Fu Hustle, although he had not settled on a female lead. [...] "There will be <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> characters in the movie. We'll need <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> actors. It's possible that we'll look for people abroad besides casting locals". [...] In January 2013 during an interview Chow admitted that plans for making Kung Fu Hustle 2 have been put on hold. [...] "I was indeed in the midst of making the movie, but it is currently put on hold in view of other incoming projects". Production of Kung Fu Hustle 2 was delayed while Chow filmed the science fiction adventure film CJ7. As a result, Kung Fu Hustle 2 was slated for a 2014 release. By 2017, Chow already completed The Mermaid and [...] Due to his focus in behind-the-scenes production and haven't made an appearance since CJ7, it was suspected he stopped acting. However, he clarified he still wants to act, but haven't found a role for suited for him. Kung Fu Hustle II remains incomplete.|$|E

500|$|Spielberg courted Jack Nicholson for {{the role}} of Edward Bloom, Sr. and towards this end, had August compose two {{additional}} drafts for Nicholson's part. August recalls: [...] "There was this thought that there wasn't enough for Jack Nicholson to do in the movie so we built new sequences. Pieces got moved around, but it wasn't <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> stuff being created. It ended up being a really good intellectual exercise in my explaining and defending and reanalyzing pieces of the story." [...] Spielberg eventually left Big Fish when he became distracted with Catch Me If You Can (2002), and DreamWorks also backed out of the film.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone fully {{retracted}} [...] "A Rape on Campus" [...] {{and removed the}} article from its website. However, Coco McPherson, {{who is in charge}} of Rolling Stone's fact-checking operation, said, [...] "I one-hundred percent do not think that the policies that we have in place failed." [...] Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana was also cited on the Columbia report: [...] "It's not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don't think we need to necessarily institute <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> ways of doing things." [...] Jill Geisler in the Columbia Journalism Review reacted to Dana's statement by saying, [...] "At a time when humility should guide a leader's comments, that quote carries the aroma of arrogance." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Thing You Love Most" [...] is {{the first}} episode to feature Mary Margaret's loft, which is filmed on a small sound stage in Vancouver; most of the first season's {{interior}} shots are also filmed in the city, while many exterior shots are of nearby Steveston, British Columbia. The production team led by set decorator Mark Lane and production designer Michael Joy designed the residence to seem [...] "locked in time a little bit, so there's not <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> stuff." [...] They included working class antiques such as a Hoosier cabinet, an old gas stove, and a Bakelite radio. The loft {{was meant to be}} located above a store and near a lumber mill and water, so the crew also designed it to feel like a fish cannery.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> {{record is}} heavily layered {{and it felt}} like too much for the four of us to do. We need another member to get them at their full impact. I dunno, we're kind of bored of each other. We just need to add some fresh meat.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{conceived}} and developed {{many of the}} tracks while touring in Europe in early 1997 and said the sound bore some European influences.
