5|$|Earth has {{undergone}} periodic climate {{shifts in the}} past, including four major ice ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperature.</b> Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include {{the positions of the}} continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{currents}} only {{affect the}} top few hundred meters (yards) of the sea, {{but there are}} also large-scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses. A main deep ocean current flows through all the world's oceans and is known as the thermohaline circulation or global conveyor belt. This movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature. At high latitudes, the water is chilled by the low <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperature</b> and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out. Both these factors make it denser and the water sinks. From the deep sea near Greenland, such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. When it reaches the Antarctic, it is joined by further masses of cold, sinking water and flows eastwards. It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Here it is gradually warmed, becomes less dense, rises towards the surface, and loops back on itself. Some flows back into the Atlantic. It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed.|$|E

As major carbon reducers and carbon and soil methane storages, their destruction contributes to increasing global energy trapping, atmospheric gases.

25|$|The {{process of}} {{artificial}} or 'oven' drying consists basically of introducing heat. This may be directly, using natural gas and/or electricity or indirectly, through steam-heated heat exchangers. Solar energy {{is also an}} option. In the process, deliberate control of temperature, relative humidity and air circulation creates variable conditions to achieve specific drying profiles. To achieve this, the timber is stacked in chambers, which are fitted with equipment to control <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperature,</b> relative humidity and circulation rate (Walker et al.', 1993; Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996).|$|E
25|$|Since many {{hydrogenation}} reactions such as hydrogenolysis {{of protecting}} {{groups and the}} reduction of aromatic systems proceed extremely sluggishly at <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure, pressurised systems are popular. In these cases, catalyst is added to a solution of reactant under an inert atmosphere in a pressure vessel. Hydrogen is added directly from a cylinder or built in laboratory hydrogen source, and the pressurized slurry is mechanically rocked to provide agitation, or a spinning basket is used. Heat may also be used, as the pressure compensates for the associated reduction in gas solubility.|$|E
25|$|Eruption column heights are {{a useful}} way of {{measuring}} eruption intensity since {{for a given}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperature,</b> the column height {{is proportional to the}} fourth root of the mass eruption rate. Consequently, given similar conditions, to double the column height requires an eruption ejecting 16 times as much material per second. The column height of eruptions which have not been observed can be estimated by mapping the maximum distance that pyroclasts of different sizes are carried from the vent—the higher the column the further ejected material of a particular mass (and therefore size) can be carried.|$|E
50|$|The warmer <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{observed}} {{over the}} past decades are expected {{to lead to a}} more vigorous hydrological cycle, including more extreme rainfall events.

40|$|Thermal {{observations}} of Mars are reviewed focusing on surface and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Data obtained {{indicate that the}} effect of increasing dust in the atmosphere is to reduce diurnal temperature variation at the surface, while enhancing atmospheric thermal variation. Atmospheric thermal effects can be induced by global dust storms even in regions of polar night. Maximum temperatures occur near the equator in summer or at local sites with sunward facing slopes, where low surface thermal inertias make it possible to achieve values up to about 310 K. Radiation and convection in the daytime affect <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperatures</b> near the surface, which are limited by radiation at night. Results of thermal observations confirm that Mars' thermal state and climate can significantly vary from year to year, due to the variation in dust activity...|$|R
25|$|Another {{fingerprint}} {{of human}} effects on climate {{has been identified}} by looking at a slice through the layers of the atmosphere, and studying the pattern of temperature changes from the surface up through the stratosphere (see the section on solar activity). The earliest fingerprint work focused on changes in surface and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperature.</b> Scientists then applied fingerprint methods to {{a whole range of}} climate variables, identifying human-caused climate signals in the heat content of the oceans, the height of the tropopause (the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, which has shifted upward by hundreds of feet in recent decades), the geographical patterns of precipitation, drought, surface pressure, and the runoff from major river basins.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., OSHA lists vinyl {{chloride}} as a Class IA Flammable Liquid, with a National Fire Protection Association Flammability Rating of 4. Because of its low boiling point, liquid VCM will undergo flash evaporation (i.e., autorefrigerate) upon its release to atmospheric pressure. The portion vaporized will form a dense cloud (more {{than twice as}} heavy as the surrounding air). The risk of subsequent explosion or fire is significant. According to OSHA, the flash point of {{vinyl chloride}} is −78°C (−108.4°F). Its flammable limits in air are: lower 3.6 volume% and upper 33.0 volume%. The explosive limits are: lower 4.0%, upper 22.05 by volume in air. Fire may release toxic hydrogen chloride (HCl) and carbon monoxide (CO). VCM can polymerise rapidly due to heating and {{under the influence of}} air, light and contact with a catalyst, strong oxidisers and metals such as copper and aluminium, with fire or explosion hazard. As a gas mixed with air, VCM is a fire and explosion hazard. On standing VCM can form peroxides, which may then explode. VCM will react with iron and steel in the presence of moisture. Vinyl chloride is a gas at normal <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure.|$|E

[...] The mesotron subsequently became the known as the [...] " [...] meson", which was shortened to [...] "muon". Just before the Copenhagen conference, Blackett suggested that observed variations of cosmic ray intensity with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperature</b> could be an indication that mesotrons are unstable, and he held intense discussions with Rossi on this subject.

500|$|The {{asteroid}} collision theory, {{which was}} brought to wide attention in 1980 by Walter Alvarez and colleagues, links the extinction event {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period to a bolide impact approximately 66million years ago. Alvarez et al. proposed that a sudden increase in iridium levels, recorded around the world in the period's rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact. The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a bolide [...] wide hit in the vicinity of the Yucatán Peninsula (in southeastern Mexico), creating the approximately [...] Chicxulub Crater and triggering the mass extinction. Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the impact event. Some scientists propose that the meteorite impact caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth's <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperature,</b> while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun). Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid, being down to hours rather than years.|$|E
500|$|Io has an {{extremely}} thin atmosphere consisting mainly {{of sulfur dioxide}} (...) , with minor constituents including sulfur monoxide (...) , sodium chloride (...) , and atomic sulfur and oxygen. The atmosphere has significant variations in density and temperature with time of day, latitude, volcanic activity, and surface frost abundance. The maximum atmospheric pressure on Io ranges from 3.3 to 3 pascals (Pa) or 0.3 to 3 nbar, spatially seen on Io's anti-Jupiter hemisphere and along the equator, and temporally {{in the early afternoon}} when the temperature of surface frost peaks. Localized peaks at volcanic plumes have also been seen, with pressures of 5 to 40  Pa (5 to 40 nbar). Io's atmospheric pressure is lowest on Io's night side, where the pressure dips to 0.1 to 1 Pa (0.0001 to 0.001 nbar). Io's <b>atmospheric</b> <b>temperature</b> ranges from the temperature of the surface at low altitudes, where sulfur dioxide is in vapor pressure equilibrium with frost on the surface, to 1800 K at higher altitudes where the lower atmospheric density permits heating from plasma in the Io plasma torus and from Joule heating from the Io flux tube. The low pressure limits the atmosphere's effect on the surface, except for temporarily redistributing sulfur dioxide from frost-rich to frost-poor areas, and to expand the size of plume deposit rings when plume material re-enters the thicker dayside atmosphere. The thin Ionian atmosphere also means any future landing probes sent to investigate Io will not need to be encased in an aeroshell-style heatshield, but instead require retrothrusters for a soft landing. The thin atmosphere also necessitates a rugged lander capable of enduring the strong Jovian radiation, which a thicker atmosphere would attenuate.|$|E
