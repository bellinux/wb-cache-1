25|$|In 1966, Bettelheim was {{particularly}} interested in China. He helped the Union of Young Communists (Marxist–Leninist) with theoretical planning, without being directly affiliated with the organization. In his capacity as President of the Franco-Chinese Friendship Association (Association des amitiés Franco-Chinoises), he visited the People's Republic of China several times, in order to study new methods of industrial development created by the Cultural Revolution. After the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, Bettelheim was very critical of the new leaders (Hua Guofeng and Deng Xiaoping) who began to abandon Maoist principles, and replacing them with <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> modernization which Bettelheim considered reactionary and authoritarian.|$|E
25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. <b>A</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> the poor is understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E
500|$|Newman {{incorporates}} concepts from post-structuralist thought such as post-humanism and anti-essentialism into classical anarchism. Unlike May, whose post-anarchism is {{a combination}} of the two, Newman attempts to move beyond both anarchism and post-structuralism. He proposes that [...] "by using the poststructuralist critique one can theorize the possibility of political resistance without essentialist guarantees: <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> postanarchism … by incorporating the moral principles of anarchism with the postructuralist critique of essentialism, {{it may be possible to}} arrive at an ethically workable, politically valid, and genuinely democratic notion of resistance to domination".|$|E

500|$|Smith {{argues that}} Val Plumwood is {{incorrect}} {{to declare the}} resituation of animals into ethical terms as supererogatory {{as opposed to the}} necessary resituation of humans into ecological terms, as the two tasks are linked. Smith rejects the culture/nature dichotomy, and suggests that <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> recognition is an appropriate way to think about relationships. She draws upon feminist and ecofeminist literature to conceive of recognition theory beyond intersubjective self/other relations, allowing recognition beyond a human self, a concept which she challenges. Smith seeks to show that recognition theories should not be considered [...] "soft" [...] or [...] "naive" [...] as accounts of justice, and instead that they offer an appropriate mode for thinking about ecological and animal injustices.|$|E

2500|$|.....psychoanalysis can {{and should}} make a basic {{contribution}} to <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> autonomy. For, each person's self-understanding is {{a necessary condition for}} autonomy. One cannot have an autonomous society that would fail to turn back upon itself, that would not interrogate itself about its motives, its reasons for acting, its deep-seated [...] tendencies. Considered in concrete terms, however, society doesn't exist outside the individuals making it up. The self-reflective activity of an autonomous society depends essentially upon the self-reflective activity of the humans who form that society.|$|E
2500|$|Ruskin's social view broadened from {{concerns}} about the dignity of labour to consider wider issues of citizenship, and notions of the ideal community. Just as he had questioned aesthetic orthodoxy in his earliest writings, he now dissected the orthodox political economy espoused by John Stuart Mill, based on theories of laissez-faire and competition drawn {{from the work of}} Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus. In his four essays, Unto This Last, Ruskin rejected the division of labour as dehumanising (separating labourer from his product), and argued that the [...] "science" [...] of political economy failed to consider the social affections that bind communities together. Ruskin articulated an extended metaphor of household and family, drawing on Plato and Xenophon to demonstrate the communal and sometimes sacrificial nature of true economics. For Ruskin, all economies, and all societies are ideally underwritten by <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> social justice. Ruskin's ideas influenced the concept of the [...] "social economy" [...] characterised by networks of charitable, co-operative and other non-governmental organisations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{style of}} afro-textured hair {{continues}} to be politicized in contemporary society. [...] "These issues of style are highly charged as sensitive questions about [...] very 'identity'." [...] Whether an individual decides to wear their hair in its natural state or alter it, all Black hairstyles convey a message. In several post-colonial societies, the value system promotes 'white bias', and [...] "ethnicities are valorized according to the tilt of whiteness — [...] functions as the ideological basis for status ascription." [...] In turn, in this value system, [...] "African elements — be they cultural or physical — are devalued as indices of low social status, while European elements are positively valorized as attributes enabling individual upward mobility". This value system {{is reinforced by the}} systematic racism that was, and still is, often hidden from the public eye in Western society. Racism 'works' by encouraging the devaluation of self-identity by the victims themselves, and that re-centering of a sense of pride is a prerequisite for <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> resistance and reconstruction.|$|E

2500|$|Women Strike for Peace {{played a}} crucial role in {{bringing}} down the House Un-American Activities Committee(HUAC). From the beginning of the WSP in 1961 the FBI had the group under surveillance due to fear that communism had spread to the mothers of America. WSP approached the committee hearings differnetly than those summoned before them. In November of 1962 the leaders of the group were subpoenaed to the HUAC. After the subpoenas were distributed to the women WSP released the information the media before the HUAC could issue a press release, as the committee used the news media to discredit the organizations. When under question the women used their status as mother to argue their moral high ground, as mothers arguing for peace were the most loyal American. Another strategy that differed from those before them was the use of a large quantity of WSP members to volunteer to tesitfy at the hearings, effectively showing that the group had nothing to hid. Political theorist Jean Bethke Elshtain determined that the WSP's performance at the HUAC was a success due to the [...] "deconstructive power of <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> humor, irony, evasion, and ridicule". The use of motherhood and family as a tool for the attack on the congressional hearings show the [...] "familial-cold war consensus" [...] would soon crumble.|$|E
