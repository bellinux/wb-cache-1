5|$|Gibbs used Swiss Pilatus P-2 army {{training}} planes {{standing in}} for Messerschmitt Bf-109s. He built a device {{based on an}} internal combustion engine to simulate gunfire, which was safer <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than firing blanks. Baking soda was applied to Connery to create Henry's bullet wound. Vinegar was applied to create the foaming effect as {{the water from the}} Grail washes it away.|$|E
5|$|Italian silk cloth {{was very}} expensive, {{as much a}} result {{of the cost of the}} raw {{material}} as of the production costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved unable to keep up with the exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded lighter <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> materials. These materials were used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes.|$|E
5|$|As travel became easier, faster, <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive,</b> Germans {{started to}} see unity in factors other than their language. The Brothers Grimm, who {{compiled}} a massive dictionary known as The Grimm, also assembled a compendium of folk tales and fables, which highlighted the story-telling parallels between different regions. Karl Baedeker wrote guidebooks to different cities and regions of Central Europe, indicating places to stay, sites to visit, and giving a short history of castles, battlefields, famous buildings, and famous people. His guides also included distances, roads to avoid, and hiking paths to follow.|$|E
50|$|Modern OTLs {{are often}} more reliable, sound better, <b>and</b> are <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than many transformer-coupled valve approaches.|$|R
50|$|Interest grew in {{statistical}} models for machine translation, which became more common <b>and</b> also <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> in the 1980s as available computational power increased.|$|R
5000|$|Since it is {{constructed}} using foil instead of mirrors, {{it is expected}} to be more lightweight, <b>and</b> therefore <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> to launch, than a traditional telescope.|$|R
5|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are affected}} by wind shear. Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those {{at the top of}} blade travel, and this in turn affects the turbine operation. This low level wind shear can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two bladed turbine when the blades are vertical. The reduced wind shear over water means shorter <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> wind turbine towers can be used in shallow seas.|$|E
5|$|Another {{design was}} {{requested}} of Brine, {{but this time}} for a smaller <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> building. In 1818, the Keys purchased the building {{in which they had}} formerly met, moving the library to the Grammar School. The new plans were agreed upon by all concerned, but there continued to be disagreements between the British Treasury department and the Keys over how to fund the project. The Treasury believed that the cost should be covered by Manx taxes, but the Keys argued that this tax would be excessive. The two parties eventually each agreed to pay some of the £1039-10-0d cost, and the project was approved on 31 May 1819, just under 30 years after the first discussions. The building was completed in less than two years, and the Keys started using the building in January 1821.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Dugan {{produced}} the Model E, the E standing for economy. This half-rack-sized automixer was much smaller <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than previous ones. It could be linked with another Model E to control up to 16 channels; two units could be mounted side-by-side in only 1U of rack space. The Model E's popularity came with many critical requests for features, and in May 2008 the Model E-1 was introduced; an incremental improvement {{to replace the}} Model E. It allowed ADAT Lightpipe interconnections between linked units and a digital mixing console, helpful with Yamaha, Mackie and other digital audio gear containing ADAT inputs and outputs. Its user interface was a simple web browser page, accessible by computer connected with Category 5 cable.|$|E
50|$|Mitry-Mory is very {{convenient}} to Paris <b>and</b> a <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> {{place to live}} for those who work in Paris but prefer the commute by train or road.|$|R
5000|$|Inflating experience. An {{employer}} claims {{workers are}} more experienced {{than they actually}} are {{in order to make}} them seem <b>less</b> risky <b>and</b> therefore <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> to cover.|$|R
50|$|Kamora is a {{brand of}} coffee liqueur {{produced}} in Mexico. It is slightly <b>less</b> sweet, <b>and</b> also <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than its main competitor Kahlúa. It is 20% alcohol by volume (40 proof).|$|R
5|$|Berkman {{spent his}} last years eking out a {{precarious}} living {{as an editor}} and translator. He and his companion, Emmy Eckstein, relocated frequently within Nice in search of smaller <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> quarters. Aronstam, who had {{changed his name to}} Modest Stein and attained success as an artist, became a benefactor, sending Berkman a monthly sum to help with expenses. In the 1930s his health began to deteriorate, and he underwent two unsuccessful operations for a prostate condition in early 1936. After the second surgery, he was bed-ridden for months. In constant pain, forced to rely on the financial help of friends and dependent on Eckstein's care, Berkman decided to commit suicide. In the early hours of June28, 1936, unable to endure the physical pain of his ailment, Berkman tried to shoot himself in the heart with a handgun, but he failed to make a clean job of it. The bullet punctured a lung and his stomach and lodged in his spinal column, paralyzing him. Goldman rushed to Nice to be at his side. Berkman recognized her but was unable to speak. He sank into a coma in the afternoon, and died at 10o'clock that night.|$|E
25|$|Such {{reactions}} {{more commonly}} employ the Grignard reagents methylmagnesium halides, {{which are often}} equally effective, <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> or more easily prepared in situ.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Boeing {{proposed}} repackaging P-8 {{systems in}} the smaller <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> Bombardier Challenger 600 series business jet, as the Boeing Maritime Surveillance Aircraft (MSA), instead. In 2014, Boeing also offered a JSTARS replacement based on the Boeing 737-700, rather than the P-8's 737-800.|$|E
50|$|Pneumatic web guide {{systems are}} {{typically}} easier to install, operate <b>and</b> are <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than more complex hydraulic and electronic systems. Pneumatic servo controllers are considered explosion-proof, especially in dusty or contaminated environments.|$|R
50|$|Market {{consolidation}} {{and expansion}} has permitted service providers to offer faster <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensives</b> services with typical speeds {{of up to}} 24 Mbit/s downstream (subject to ISP and line length). They can offer products at sometimes considerably lower prices, due to not necessarily having {{to conform to the}} same regulatory requirements as BT Wholesale: for example, 8 unbundled LLU pairs can deliver 10 Mbit/s over 3775 meters for half the price of a similar Fibre connection.|$|R
50|$|Single Weave Cotton: This {{is lighter}} <b>and</b> {{typically}} <b>less</b> <b>expensive.</b> It {{is often used}} for hot weather training. Being lighter weight (typically between 300-550 g/m2), this weave is not as durable as a heavier fabric.|$|R
25|$|Traditional {{techniques}} like {{injection moulding}} {{can be less}} expensive for manufacturing polymer products in high quantities, but additive manufacturing can be faster, more flexible <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> when producing relatively small quantities of parts. 3D printers give designers and concept development teams the ability to produce parts and concept models using a desktop size printer.|$|E
25|$|The Chromebook 3 is {{distinct}} from and distinguished from the similarly named Samsung Series 3 in several respects: newer (released 2016), different architecture (Intel Celeron N3050 instead of Exynos 5 Dual ARM Cortex), thinner (0.7"), <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> (about $100 less than the Series 3); while remaining a full implementation of ChromeOS.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} 20th {{century and}} {{early years of the}} 21st century saw rapid advancements in telecommunications, {{computing}} hardware and software, and data encryption. The availability of smaller, more powerful <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> computing equipment made electronic data processing within the reach of small business and the home user. These computers quickly became interconnected through the Internet.|$|E
5000|$|Because DMD only {{requires}} a stable, reliable red laser to read {{information from the}} disk, the manufacturing processes for both disks and drives is much simpler <b>and</b> much <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than other alternatives, like Blu-ray or HD DVD.|$|R
50|$|For niobium this {{behavior}} was known {{since the beginning}} of the 20th century. Niobium is more abundant in nature than tantalum <b>and</b> is <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> but the high melting point of 2744 °C hindered the development of niobium electrolytic capacitors.|$|R
50|$|Debt restructurings are {{typically}} handled by professional insolvency and restructuring practitioners, <b>and</b> are usually <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> a preferable alternative to bankruptcy.|$|R
25|$|Typically, the IF center {{frequency}} fIF is {{chosen to be}} less than the desired reception frequency fRF. The choice has some performance advantages. First, it is easier <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> to get high selectivity at a lower frequency. For the same bandwidth, a tuned circuit at a lower frequency needs a lower Q. Stated another way, for the same filter technology, a higher {{center frequency}} will take more IF filter stages to achieve the same selectivity bandwidth. Second, it is easier <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> to get high gain at a lower frequency. When used at high frequencies, many amplifiers show a constant gain–bandwidth product (dominant pole) characteristic. If an amplifier has a gain–bandwidth product of 100MHz, then it would have a voltage gain of 100 at 1MHz but only 10 at 10MHz. If the IF amplifier needed a voltage gain of 10,000, then it would need only two stages with an IF at 1MHz but four stages at 10MHz.|$|E
25|$|The bubble top on the KR200 was {{simplified}} {{over that}} of the KR175 {{by the use of}} a larger curved glass windshield that formed A-pillars with the side window frames. This allowed the bubble to be simpler and more compact than the KR175 bubble, and it was consequently easier <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> to produce. The windshield wiper, manual on the KR175, was electric on the KR200.|$|E
25|$|In May 1991, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) {{installed}} a web press at the Washington, DC printing facilities {{to test a}} new way of printing $1 bills. BEP officials hoped that the test would replace the sheet fed intaglio presses by switching to a possibly quicker <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> method of printing. Alexander-Hamilton Web Currency Press was a true web currency press.|$|E
50|$|Associated {{would double}} in size thanks to Roger's next design, the 1:12-scale RC12 {{electric}} onroad racer, debuted in 1978. Simpler <b>and</b> far <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than the gas powered RC100, the RC12 is credited {{for much of}} the hobby's growth as a sport.|$|R
50|$|Low-alcoholic brews such {{as small}} beer date {{back at least}} to Medieval Europe, where they served as a less risky {{alternative}} to water (which often was polluted by feces and parasites) <b>and</b> were <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than the full strength brews used at festivities.|$|R
50|$|Engineers use many {{methods to}} {{minimize}} logic functions, {{in order to}} reduce the circuit's complexity. When the complexity is less, the circuit also has fewer errors <b>and</b> <b>less</b> electronics, <b>and</b> is therefore <b>less</b> <b>expensive.</b>|$|R
25|$|Acela carried {{more than}} 3.4 million {{passengers}} {{in fiscal year}} 2015; {{second only to the}} slower <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> Northeast Regional, which had over 8 million passengers in FY 2015. Its 2015 revenue of $585 million was 25% of Amtrak's total. (Another 25% came from Northeast Regional traffic, and roughly 25% each for long-distance trains, and state-supported corridor services {{throughout the rest of the}} country).|$|E
25|$|The company {{claims that}} the battery packs have an {{expected}} lifespan of 1500 hours and cost US$7000 each, with the aircraft carrying 3-5 battery packs, giving two to two and half hours endurance. The batteries can be recharged in 3–4 hours from a 220v outlet. The company projects {{that by the time}} the first customers require replacement battery packs that improved <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> ones will be available.|$|E
25|$|The weight {{reduction}} {{from the}} SWT {{was accomplished by}} eliminating portions of stringers (structural stiffeners running {{the length of the}} hydrogen tank), using fewer stiffener rings and by modifying major frames in the hydrogen tank. Also, significant portions of the tank were milled differently so as to reduce thickness, and the weight of the ET's aft solid rocket booster attachments was reduced by using a stronger, yet lighter <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> titanium alloy.|$|E
5000|$|CableCards are {{available}} from every US digital cable provider <b>and</b> are always <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than renting a set-top-box; usually less than $3 per month.|$|R
50|$|Claw meat is {{the dark}} pink meat {{that comes from}} the {{swimming}} fins and claws of the crab. It has a stronger taste, <b>and</b> is <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than the white color meat grades. It is often used in soups, where the strong taste comes through.|$|R
50|$|Rueda (Castile and León) located west of Ribera del Duero, {{producing}} notable reds <b>and</b> whites typically <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> {{than those}} of its more famous neighbours.|$|R
