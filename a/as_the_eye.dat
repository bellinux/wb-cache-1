5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within the}} body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and respiratory tract.

When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E

5|$|While slowly {{crossing}} Guam, Pamela produced {{winds of}} over 185km/h (115mph) {{across the entire}} island over a six-hour period, causing widespread heavy damage. Typhoon-force winds were reported for 18hours, and tropical storm-force winds were reported for 30hours. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> was crossing the island, the winds rapidly vacillated between gusts of 150km/h (90mph) to calmness {{in the span of}} a few minutes; this created a large pressure gradient that caused additional damage. The typhoon dropped a total of 856mm (33.7in) of rainfall, including 690mm (27in) in a 24-hour period, on the island. This contributed to May 1976 being Guam's wettest month on record.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{was first}} observed near Cape Verde on September16. On September21, the Hurricane Hunters observed a circulation, which indicated a tropical depression had formed {{east of the}} northern Leeward Islands. It moved to the west-northwest, becoming Tropical Storm Helene on September23. The next day Helene became a hurricane, aided by an anticyclone aloft. It moved around a large ridge, bringing its center toward the southeastern United States. As the hurricane approached the Carolinas, the hurricane rapidly intensified <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> became visible on radar, and Helene reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) {{on the morning of}} September27. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to the northeast, and Helene came within 10mi (15km) of the coast of North Carolina. It slowly weakened, {{and at the same time}} its size expanded. On September29, Helene became extratropical as it was moving over Newfoundland. The remnants continued to the northeast, later turning to the southeast and dissipating on October4 just west of Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|Although the eye feature became {{obscured}} and banding features {{appeared to}} be dissipating six hours after becoming a hurricane, the NHC predicted rapid intensification. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> became visible on satellite imagery early on August23, winds increased to 100mph (155km/h), and Fausto became a Category 2 hurricane. Although the convective cloud tops had warmed slightly late that day, wind speeds continued to increase, and intensity estimates made at the University of Wisconsin were as high as 145mph (230km/h), though the National Hurricane Center was in agreement with estimates from all three Dvorak Technique agencies (the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB), the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), and the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA)), which estimated winds at 115mph (185km/h). Based on this, Hurricane Fausto had intensified into a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> moved onshore in Florida, the {{convection}} in the eyewall strengthened due {{to increased}} convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In the Gulf of Mexico, the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north. Andrew steadily re-intensified over the Gulf of Mexico, reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25. As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest. This caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest, and winds decreased as Andrew approached the Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to the west-southwest upon {{entering}} the basin, Evrina gradually weakened <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> gradually dissipated. It soon encountered the same cooler waters of the southern Indian that affected previous storms Chikita and Davina. By April2, Evrina had weakened below tropical cyclone status, just 30hours after it was at peak intensity. Around that time, the circulation became exposed from the deepest convection, and the track shifted more to the west. On April5, Evrina weakened to tropical depression status. Two days later, the system turned toward the south, moving in a circular track around the island of Rodrigues while remaining far enough away not to cause any effects. On April8, the circulation turned to the east, dissipating two days later {{to the south of}} Rodrigues.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} of December, the ITCZ was active across the {{southern}} Indian Ocean, northeast of Madagascar. A circulation developed on December16, which preceded {{the development of a}} tropical disturbance on December17. Moving to the west-northwest, the system slowly developed before shifting to the southwest. On December19, the system intensified into a moderate tropical storm while passing 75km (45mi) north of Madagascar. After briefly developing an eye feature, the satellite presentation degraded due to land interaction. Convection increased as the storm progressed through the Mozambique Channel, and the Madagascar Meteorological Service named it Benedicte on December20. The organization improved {{over the next few days}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> feature became better defined. On December23, Benedicte intensified to tropical cyclone status, reaching peak winds of 135km/h (85mph). That day, the storm turned westward toward the Mozambique coast, weakening as it approached land. Benedicte made landfall on central Mozambique on December24 and turned northward, straddling the border with Malawi. The storm dissipated on the next day, with only a remnant area of clouds present on satellite imagery by December26.|$|E
5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E
5|$|On July13, Typhoon Nangka {{began moving}} northward toward Japan through {{a break in}} the ridge. The typhoon {{completed}} an eyewall replacement cycle, and according to the JTWC attained a secondary peak of 195km/h (120mph). The re-intensification was also aided by a decrease in wind shear, but was short-lived due to drier air from the north and west. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> became more ragged, the winds continued to decrease. At 14:00UTC on July16, Nangka made landfall along the Japanese island of Shikoku near Muroto, Kōchi, still at typhoon status. Four hours later, the typhoon weakened into a severe tropical storm, and after crossing the Seto Inland Sea, Nangka made a second landfall on Honshu near Kurashiki, Okayama at 21:00UTC. The convection greatly weakened as it crossed Honshu into the Sea of Japan, and the storm deteriorated further due to lower water temperatures. At 12:00UTC on July17, the JMA downgraded Nangka to a tropical depression, and early the next day the JTWC discontinued advisories. On July18, Nangka dissipated in the central Sea of Japan.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Jeanne {{remained}} over Puerto Rico {{for about}} eight hours, during which it maintained its eye feature and well-defined inner core of convection. It intensified over the Mona Passage, and attained hurricane status as it struck the eastern {{tip of the}} Dominican Republic on September 16. Continuing slowly west-northwestward near the coast, Jeanne quickly weakened to tropical storm status, and by 24hours after landfall its convection had deteriorated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> feature dissipated. Late on September 17, it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as a tropical depression, after having dropped torrential rainfall across Hispaniola. Catastrophic flooding and mudslides were experienced in Haiti, including in the coastal city of Gonaïves, and over 3,000deaths were reported in the country.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many of the}} {{convective}} bands {{were already}} located over the Yucatán Peninsula, Hurricane Dean continued to intensify until the eye made landfall. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> moved over Mexico {{near the town of}} Majahual in the Costa Maya area, the NHC estimated surface level winds of 175mph (280km/h), making Dean the first storm to make landfall as a Category5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. At the same time, a dropsonde reading from the hurricane's eye estimated a central pressure of 905mbar, making Dean the third most intense landfalling Atlantic storm in history (after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Gilbert of 1988) and tying Dean with Camille and Mitch as the seventh most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. The landfall itself occurred in a sparsely populated area of the Costa Maya region of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo near 18.7N 87.8W at 0900UTC August21 and brought with it a storm surge of 12–18ft (3.7–5.5m). A weather station at Chetumal (the capital of Quintana Roo, Mexico) reported 6.65in (17cm) of rainfall during Hurricane Dean's landfall. As expected, the landfall caused significant weakening of the storm; the eye filled and the cold cloud-tops warmed. The land severely disrupted the storm's organization, and by the time Dean crossed the Yucatán Peninsula it had weakened to a Category1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|At 1200UTC on 1 April, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{issued its}} first {{advisory}} on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 26S. At 0000UTC on 2 April, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) warning centre in Perth classified the low as Tropical Cyclone Inigo. The storm quickly intensified as it tracked southwestward, aided by low wind shear and strong divergence. An eye featured gradually organised, and early on 3 April the BOM classified Inigo as a severe tropical cyclone with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Later that day, the cyclone underwent rapid intensification <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> became increasingly better defined. On 4 April, Inigo attained Category5 status on the Australian cyclone scale, and at 0600UTC it reached peak winds of 240km/h (150mph) {{and an estimated}} minimum pressure of 900hPa (mbar) while located about 950km (590mi) north of Onslow, Western Australia. Around the same time, the JTWC assessed Inigo as a powerful cyclone with 1-min winds of 260km/h (160mph). With a minimum pressure of 900hPa, Inigo tied Cyclone Gwenda of the 1998–99 season as the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian cyclone region.|$|E
