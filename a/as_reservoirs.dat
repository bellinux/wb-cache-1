5|$|Some species, {{notably the}} Australian {{paralysis}} tick, are also intrinsically venomous {{and can cause}} tick paralysis. Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick's ovaries, {{in which case the}} larval ticks are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont ticks transmit the rickettsial disease heartwater which can be particularly devastating in cattle.

25|$|In {{shellfish}} and algae farms, biofouling species tend {{to block}} nets and cages and ultimately outcompete the farmed species for space and food. Bacterial biofilms start the colonization process by creating microenvironments that more favorable for biofouling species. In the marine environment, biofilms {{could reduce the}} hydrodynamic efficiency of ships and propellers, lead to pipeline blockage and sensor malfunction, and increase the weight of appliances deployed in seawater. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} biofilm can be a reservoir for potentially pathogenic bacteria in freshwater aquaculture. As mentioned previously, biofilms can be difficult to eliminate even when antibiotics or chemicals are used in high doses. The role that biofilm plays <b>as</b> <b>reservoirs</b> of bacterial fish pathogens regarding has not been explored in detail but it certainly deserves to be studied.|$|E
25|$|Jamshedpur {{is located}} at the {{confluence}} of Kharkai and Subarnarekha Rivers. Subarnarekha is the principal river of Jamshedpur, which flows from west to south-eastern part of the territory. Many small rivers, especially the tributaries, join the Subarnarekha river in this area. Kharkai flows from the south and joins the Subarnarekha river at a place called Domuhani. The two rivers are the major sources of drinking water and groundwater for the city. Several lakes of varying size are also located near the fringes of the city. The major of them being the Dimna lake located in between the Dalma range and the Sitarampur reservoir situated beside Kharkai river. It's also a major tourist spot in the region. Both of them also act <b>as</b> <b>reservoirs</b> for drinking water in the city.|$|E

25|$|Three {{conditions}} must {{be present}} for oil reservoirs to form: a source rock rich in hydrocarbon material buried deep enough for subterranean heat {{to cook it}} into oil, a porous and permeable reservoir rock for it to accumulate in, and a cap rock (seal) or other mechanism that prevents it from escaping to the surface. Within these reservoirs, fluids will typically organize themselves like a three-layer cake {{with a layer of}} water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it, although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs. Because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water, they often migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known <b>as</b> <b>reservoirs)</b> by impermeable rocks above. However, the process is influenced by underground water flows, causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an oil field forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping.|$|E
25|$|Sacred groves are {{scattered}} all over the country, and are referred to by different names in different parts of India. Sacred groves occur in a variety of places – from scrub forests in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan maintained by the Bishnois, to rain forests in the Western Ghats of Kerala. Himachal Pradesh in the north and Kerala in the south are specifically known for their large numbers of sacred groves. The Kodavas of Karnataka alone maintained over 1000 sacred groves in their region. The Gurjar people of Rajasthan have a unique practice of neem (Azadirachta indica) planting and worshipping as abode of God Devnarayan.Thus, a Gurjjar settlement appears like a human-inhabited sacred grove. Similarly Mangar Bani, last surviving natural forest of Delhi is protected by Gurjars of nearby area. 14,000 sacred groves have been reported from all over India, which act <b>as</b> <b>reservoirs</b> of rare fauna, and more often rare flora, amid rural and even urban settings. Experts believe that the total number of sacred groves could be as high as 100,000.|$|E
500|$|Citing {{evidence}} from an ancient work by Zheng Xuan (127–200), Su believed that physicians {{of the ancient}} Zhou Dynasty (1046–256 BC) used realgar as a remedy for ulcers. As believed in Su's day, the [...] "five poisons" [...] used by Zhou era physicians for this purpose {{were thought to be}} cinnabar, realgar, chalcanthite, alum, and magnetite. Su made systematic descriptions of animals and the environmental regions they could be found, such as different species of freshwater, marine, and shore crabs. For example, he noted that the freshwater crab species Eriocher sinensis could be found in the Huai River running through Anhui, in waterways near the capital city, as well <b>as</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and marshes of Hebei. Su's book was preserved and copied into the Bencao Gangmu of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) physician and pharmacologist Li Shizhen (1518–1593).|$|E

500|$|The walls {{enclosed}} {{many buildings}} {{related to the}} temple's function. Some enclosures contain satellite chapels dedicated to deities associated with the temple god, including mammisis celebrating {{the birth of the}} god's mythological child. The sacred lakes found in many temple enclosures served <b>as</b> <b>reservoirs</b> for the water used in rituals, as places for the priests to ritually cleanse themselves, and as representations of the water from which the world emerged. Mortuary temples sometimes contain a palace for the spirit of the king to whom the temple was dedicated, built against the temple building proper. The temple of Seti I at Abydos incorporates an unusual underground structure, the Osireion, which may have served as a symbolic tomb for the king. Sanatoria in some temples provided a place for the sick to await healing dreams sent by the god. Other temple buildings included kitchens, workshops, and storehouses to supply the temple's needs. Especially important was the pr-ˁnḫ or [...] "house of life", where the temple edited, copied, and stored its religious texts, including those used for temple rituals. The house of life also functioned as a general center of learning, containing works on non-religious subjects such as history, geography, astronomy, and medicine. Although these outlying buildings were devoted to more mundane purposes than the temple itself, they still had religious significance; even granaries might be used for specific ceremonies.|$|E
