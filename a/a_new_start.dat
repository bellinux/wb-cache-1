The shrine has been reconstructed every 20years and in 1953 it was the 59th iteration.

In 1965 when Tange and Kawazoe published the book Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture, he likened the building to a modernist structure: an honest expression of materials, a functional design and prefabricated elements.|$|E
5|$|Palmetto Leaves is {{a memoir}} and travel guide written by Harriet Beecher Stowe about her winters {{in the town}} of Mandarin, Florida, {{published}} in 1873. Already famous for having written Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), Stowe came to Florida after the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865). She purchased a plantation near Jacksonville as a place for her son to recover from the injuries he had received as a Union soldier and to make <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>start</b> in life. After visiting him, she became so enamored with the region she purchased a cottage and orange grove for herself and wintered there until 1884, even though the plantation failed within its first year. Parts of Palmetto Leaves appeared in a newspaper published by Stowe's brother, as a series of letters and essays about life in northeast Florida.|$|E
