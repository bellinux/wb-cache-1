5|$|Historically, among certain Asian and Native <b>American</b> <b>cultures</b> {{the family}} {{structure}} {{consisted of a}} grandmother and her children, especially daughters, who raised their own children together and shared child care responsibilities.

25|$|From their {{earliest}} {{presence in}} North America, White Americans have contributed literature, art, cinema, religion, agricultural skills, foods, science and technology, fashion and clothing styles, music, language, legal system, political system, {{and social and}} technological innovation to <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b> White <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> derived its earliest influences from English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish settlers and is quantitatively the largest proportion of <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b> The overall <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> reflects White <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b> The culture has been developing since long before the United States formed a separate country. Much of <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> shows influences from English culture. Colonial ties to Great Britain spread the English language, legal system and other cultural attributes.|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} of iridium is intertwined {{with that of}} platinum and the other metals of the platinum group. Native platinum used by ancient Ethiopians and by South <b>American</b> <b>cultures</b> always contained {{a small amount of}} the other platinum group metals, including iridium. Platinum reached Europe as platina ("silverette"), found in the 17th century by the Spanish conquerors in a region today known as the department of Chocó in Colombia. The discovery that this metal was not an alloy of known elements, but instead a distinct new element, did not occur until 1748.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar is a near-threatened {{species and}} its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and {{fragmentation}} of habitat. While {{international trade in}} jaguars or their parts is prohibited, the cat is still frequently killed by humans, particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in South America. Although reduced, its range remains large. Given its historical distribution, the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous indigenous <b>American</b> <b>cultures,</b> {{including those of the}} Maya and Aztec.|$|E
5|$|Although civilizations in Central America {{attained}} {{a relatively high}} level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations {{in the development of}} musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South <b>American</b> <b>cultures</b> of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.|$|E
50|$|African <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> is {{also known}} as black culture in the United States and the {{identity}} of African <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> is rooted in the historical experience of the African American people. It is rooted in Africa, and is a blend of sub-Saharan African and Sahelean cultures. Due to aspects of African <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> that were accentuated by the slavery period, African <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> is dynamic. Within the African <b>American</b> <b>culture,</b> race or physical differences led to mass murder, and violence against racial groups. These occurrences may affect an individual’s perception of their African <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b> In America, Black and White differences are the most significant groupings largely because of American history. The US was founded on the principle of “all men are equal” and yet slavery existed. This is what resulted in the American Dilemma. Thus, due to historical reasons, and because they are often stereotyped, African Americans have difficulty assimilating with their <b>culture</b> and <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|R

5|$|Four Native <b>American</b> <b>cultures</b> {{are known}} to have lived in the area during the last 10,000years. The first known group, the Nevares Spring People, were hunters and gatherers who arrived in the area perhaps 9,000years ago (7000BC) when there were still small lakes in Death Valley and {{neighboring}} Panamint Valley. A much milder climate persisted at that time, and large game animals were still plentiful. By 5,000years ago (3000BC) the Mesquite Flat People displaced the Nevares Spring People. Around 2,000years ago the Saratoga Spring People moved into the area, which by then was probably already a hot, dry desert. This culture was more advanced at hunting and gathering and was skillful at handcrafts. They also left mysterious stone patterns in the valley.|$|E
5|$|The Apologetic Summary History of the People of These Indies (Spanish Apologética historia summaria de las gentes destas Indias) {{was first}} written as the 68th {{chapter of the}} General History of the Indies, but Las Casas changed it into a volume of its own, {{recognizing}} that the material was not historical. The material contained in the Apologetic History is primarily ethnographic accounts of the indigenous cultures of the Indies – the Taíno, the Ciboney, and the Guanahatabey, but it also contains descriptions {{of many of the}} other indigenous cultures that Las Casas learned about through his travels and readings. The history is apologetic because it is written as a defense of the cultural level of the Indians, arguing throughout that indigenous peoples of the Americas were just as civilized as the Roman, Greek and Egyptian civilizations—and more civilized than some European civilizations. It was in essence a comparative ethnography comparing practices and customs of European and <b>American</b> <b>cultures</b> and evaluating them according to whether they were good or bad, seen from a Christian viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} {{is a sacred}} bird in some North <b>American</b> <b>cultures,</b> and its feathers, {{like those of the}} golden eagle, are central to many {{religious}} and spiritual customs among Native Americans. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many pow wow dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the Navajo Tradition an Eagle feather is represented to be a Protector, along with the Feather Navajo Medicine Man use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The Lakota, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The Choctaw considered the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.|$|E
