5|$|<b>Air</b> <b>breathing</b> {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air {{breathers}} and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most <b>air</b> <b>breathing</b> fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>air</b> <b>breathing</b> fish—facultative and non-facultative. Under normoxic {{conditions}} facultative fish can survive without having to breathe air {{from the surface of}} the water. However, non-facultative fish must respire at the surface even in normal dissolved oxygen levels because their gills cannot extract enough oxygen from the water.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>air</b> <b>breathing</b> {{freshwater}} teleosts use ABOs {{to effectively}} extract oxygen from air while maintaining {{functions of the}} gills. ABOs are modified gastrointestinal tracts, gas bladders, and labyrinth organs; they are highly vascularized and provide additional method of extracting oxygen from the air. Fish also use ABO for storing the retained oxygen.|$|E

500|$|Bowfin, {{like other}} physostomes such as bichirs (Polypteridae), gars (Lepisosteidae), and the {{lungfishes}} (Dipnoi), {{are capable of}} bimodal respiration. [...] They can extract oxygen from the water when breathing through their gills, and can also break the water's surface to breathe or gulp air through a small pneumatic duct connected from their foregut to the gas bladder. When performing low-level physical activity, bowfin obtain {{more than half of}} their oxygen from breathing air. [...] Bowfin have two distinct air-breathing mechanisms used to ventilate the gas bladder. Type I air breaths are consistent with the action of exhale-inhale stimulated by aerial or aquatic hypoxia to regulate O2 gas exchange; type II air breaths are by inhalation alone which is believed to regulate gas bladder volume for buoyancy control. Bimodal respiration helps bowfin survive and maintain their metabolic rate in hypoxic conditions. The rate of <b>air</b> <b>breathing</b> is higher in darkness, when the fish is more active.|$|E

2500|$|Many hypoxic environments {{never reach}} {{the level of}} anoxia and most fish are {{able to cope with}} this stress using {{different}} physiological and behavioural strategies. [...] Fish that use <b>air</b> <b>breathing</b> organs (ABO) tend to live in environments with highly variable oxygen content and rely on aerial respiration during times when there is not enough oxygen to support water-breathing. [...] Though all teleosts have some form of swim bladder, many of them are not capable of breathing air, and they rely on aquatic surface respiration as a supply of more oxygenated water at the surface of the water. [...] However, many species of teleost fish are obligate water breathers and do not display either of these surface respiratory behaviours.|$|E

60|$|Opening {{an inner}} door, M. Paul {{disclosed}} a parlour, or salon--very tiny, but I thought, very pretty.

He approached, he listened; the voice of Henrietta Temple floated to him on the <b>air,</b> <b>breathing</b> with a thousand odours. In a moment he was at her side, the squire's lady was standing by her; the gentlemen, for a moment arrested from a political discussion, formed a group in a distant part of the room, the rector occasionally venturing in a practised whisper to enforce a disturbed argument. Ferdinand glided in unobserved by the fair performer. Miss Temple not only possessed a voice of rare tone and compass, but this delightful gift of nature had been cultivated with refined art. Ferdinand, himself a musician, and passionately devoted to vocal melody, listened with unexaggerated rapture.|$|E
60|$|Lord Monmouth beheld his grandson. His {{comprehensive}} and penetrating glance took in every point with a flash.

And this was his child; the only one of his blood to whom he had been kind. It would be exaggeration to say that Lord Monmouth's heart was touched; but his goodnature effervesced, and his fine taste was deeply gratified. He perceived in an instant such a relation might be a valuable adherent; an irresistible candidate for future elections: a brilliant tool to work out the Dukedom. All these impressions and ideas, and many more, passed through the quick brain of Lord Monmouth ere the sound of Coningsby's words had seemed to cease, and long before the surrounding guests had recovered from the surprise which they had occasioned them, and which did not diminish, when Lord Monmouth, advancing, placed his arms round Coningsby with a dignity of affection that would have become Louis XIV., and then, in the high manner of the old Court, kissed him on each cheek.|$|E
