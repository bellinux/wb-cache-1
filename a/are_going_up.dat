25|$|The Indiana bat is an {{important}} predator within the Great Plains. The Indiana bat perpetuates biodiversity by consuming moths, mosquitoes, and flies under the night sky. This bat sleeps in abandoned caves and mines {{during the winter months}} for hibernation and under tree bark during the warmer seasons. This Indiana bat is endangered mainly due to human disturbance within the caves. However, help is underway to protect this species. Besides showing hospitality to these bats, gates <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to prohibit visitors from entering the caves and mines during the hibernation months. Studies are also ensuing to try and discover other factors diminishing the Indiana bat’s population.|$|E

500|$|Old Louisville is {{well known}} for its architecture, with styles ranging from Federal to Queen Anne. Very few antebellum {{buildings}} remain, and the most impressive buildings were built in the late 19th century. There are a few Italianate, Beaux-Arts and Second Empire-style houses, but Victorian styles dominate. Victorian Gothic styles are commonly seen. Many styles in Old Louisville are united by their use of red sandstone trim, which became popular by the 1880s {{to the point that the}} Courier-Journal said [...] "few new residences <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> in Louisville in which it is not being used". Another common Victorian style is the Richardsonian.|$|E

Still, it looks like things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> for the team. Currently, the Merritt Centennials have played 55 games with a record of 30-23-2-0. With 62 points it looks like they may be the next team to clinch a playoff spot but only time will tell.|$|E

2500|$|Today, the colonia, {{especially}} the Zona Rosa area, {{is a mix}} of wealth and poverty, old and new with many conflicting changes. New construction, most of it tall office and apartment buildings <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> along Paseo de la Reforma, with predictions that this will return the area to its former prestige. In the interior, new boutiques, restaurants, bars and nightclubs continue to open. The deterioration process from the 1980s has been partially reverted by city efforts in conservation of older buildings and tourism promotion. The colonia has thirteen branches of banks that offer international services such as currency exchange. There are also several language schools, clothing stores, malls, a crafts mall, international cuisine, museums, art galleries and hotels. Shopping and hotel options range from the very expensive to the very affordable. The 240-room Four Seasons Hotel is the most upscale hotel and restaurant in the area. The Champs Elysees is a restaurant with more than 40 years in business, located on Paseo de la Reforma between Estocolmo and Amberes streets. Its specialty is French food such as foie gras and duck confit. It has hosted the families of a number of Mexican presidents. Some of the oldest and most exclusive restaurants include Focolare, founded in 1953, La Gondola, founded in 1958 and Passy, also founded in 1958. However, the area also hosts a large number of fast food restaurants such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Dunkin’ Donuts and Little Caesar’s Pizza.|$|E
