The {{objective of this}} technique is to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> color to provide improved reproduction of CRT images that {{is good enough for}} most applications and easy to implement. It is based upon a one-dimensional look-up table for tone reproduction and a 3 -by- 3 matrix transformation for accurate hue reproduction of the additive primaries and requires matched white points. Introduction Users of desktop computer systems often design color images or graphics using a CRT display. Once these users obtain satisfactory color, they often desire hardcopy output. However <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> colors are seldom satisfactory matches to the colors as originally perceived on the CRT display. The cause of this problem is the lack of accurate, or any, colorimetric calibration of either the CRT display or the printer.

Based on previous researches, type two fuzzy logic is more effective than type 1 in handling uncertainties in a model.

40|$|Printing {{plate is}} carrier {{of an image}} which will be print out and {{multiply}} in the reproduction process. It consists of surfaces which will, by using a <b>printing</b> ink, transfer <b>the</b> digitally made image onto <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> substrate. Quality of the image and final imprint depend {{on a number of}} parameters which have to be monitored and <b>adjusted</b> during <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate making and reproduction processes. Quality control of printing plate can be conducted by observing <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> areas, made of photosensitive layer; or by observing the non-printing areas,made of aluminium-oxide. Quality of the image on <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate surface is usually controlled by using different devices for measuring the quality level of plates. These devices work on the principle of determining several parameters for monitoring <b>the</b> quality of <b>printing</b> plates, where, <b>the</b> most significant is, the surface coverage of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements. Beside those devices, market today offers a range of alternative methods which allow the determination and characterization of tones by using a software support for image analysis.

40|$|Printing {{is one of}} {{the easy}} and quick ways to make a {{stretchable}} wearable electronics. Conventional printing methods deposit conductive materials "on" or "inside" a rubber substrate. The conductors made by such printing methods cannot be used as device electrodes because of the large surface topology, poor stretchability, or weak adhesion between the substrate and the conducting material. Here, a method is presented by which conductive materials are <b>printed</b> in <b>the</b> way of being surface-embedded in the rubber substrate; hence, the conductors can be widely used as device electrodes and circuits. <b>The</b> <b>printing</b> process involves a direct printing of a metal precursor solution in a block-copolymer rubber substrate and chemical reduction of the precursor into metal nanoparticles. The electrical conductivity and sensitivity to the mechanical deformation can be controlled by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> number of <b>printing</b> operations. <b>The</b> fabrication of highly sensitive vibration sensors is thus presented, which can detect weak pulses and sound waves.

40|$|The {{development}} of tailored dosage forms provides {{a wide range}} of possibilities for meeting the needs of individual drug therapy. The personalized dosage forms improve the safety of drug treatment by decreasing the risk of overdosing and adverse reactions. Conventional drug preparations with fixed dose strengths are generally produced in large industrial scale. However, the tailored dosage forms for individual patients could be manufactured in small batches with specific materials, drug content and release profile. Therefore, alternative fabrication methods, such as printing technology, are being investigated for the customization of <b>the</b> dosage forms. <b>Printing</b> technology is a flexible method for the on-demand production of drug preparations with variable doses at the point-of-care. The thesis was aimed at investigating the feasibility of two-dimensional (2 D) <b>printing</b> technology for <b>the</b> fabrication of personalized dosage forms. In <b>the</b> 2 D <b>printed</b> dosage forms, a pharmaceutical ink is typically deposited and solidified on a planar carrier substrate according to a predefined pattern. The dosing accuracy and reproducibility of the inkjet-printed formulations could be controlled on the single droplet scale. Furthermore, tailoring the properties and the composition of the formulations allows obtaining drug delivery systems (DDS) with controlled drug release profiles and/or with multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The versatility of 2 D printing technology was demonstrated by preparing printed formulations either by inkjet or flexographic printing on planar edible substrates with different types of pharmaceutical inks. <b>The</b> <b>printed</b> formulations and their components were analyzed to allocate the crucial aspects in the development process and to improve the knowledge about the physicochemical properties, in vitro performance and stability of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> APIs. <b>The</b> printability of the inks and <b>the</b> specific <b>printing</b> parameters were closely related to the rheological properties of the drug solutions. The solid state of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> APIs was dependent on the ink composition, the ink incorporation capacity of the substrates, and the physicochemical properties of the APIs. Solid state analysis of the final dosage forms showed that the APIs were distributed uniformly in a crystalline or molecularly dispersed state. Furthermore, the flexographically prepared solid nanoparticulate systems exhibited an enhanced in vitro drug release due to the spatial distribution of the crystalline nanosuspension inks. The high dosing precision of <b>the</b> inkjet <b>printing</b> process was ensured by the stable jetting of the drug solutions. However, the dosing of nanosuspensions by flexographic imprinting was less accurate mainly because of the format of the ink transfer system. The dosing flexibility of the inkjet-printed pharmaceuticals could be regulated by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> resolution or <b>the</b> physical size of the dosage units. Furthermore, the implementation of non-destructive attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with multivariate data analysis showed high applicability for <b>the</b> quantification of <b>printed</b> pharmaceuticals. In addition to edible commercial substrates, the suitability of gelatin-based electrospun fiber matrices as carrier substrates for <b>the</b> fabrication of <b>printed</b> dosage forms was studied. Moreover, drug-loaded electrospun fiber mats were produced by stabilizing the amorphous state of a poorly water-soluble drug within the inner structure of these fibers. The use of drug-loaded fibrous substrates presented a unique approach for the preparation of dual DDS, where an API was inkjet-printed on the drug-loaded matrices that contained another API. The analysis of the designed combination DDS showed that both drugs exhibited an independent release behavior. The thesis presents an extensive overview on the main aspects of the {{development of}} personalized dosage forms by 2 D <b>printing</b> technology. <b>The</b> research improves the understanding of the key factors for successful tailoring and manufacturing of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> dosage forms, elaborates on the quality control aspects of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> process, and provides an insight into the essential properties and the performance of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> pharmaceuticals...|$|R

We discover that shear stress generated on the silicon rubber stamp surface facilitates delamination of the deposited r-GO thin film efficiently. A roll-to-roll apparatus is assembled to demonstrate <b>the</b> shear-induced transfer <b>printing</b> {{in a large scale}} printing system. Shear stress is applied on the stamp surface by rotating the stamp side roller faster than the substrate side roller. The hydrophobic surface is changed to hydrophilic by polydopamine modification for 15 minutes at 60 ˚C in order for r-GO thin film to be directly deposited on the rubber stamp. Roll-to-roll printing parameters such as evaporation time during deposition of r-GO, vertical deformation of stamp, RPM, and RPM ratio between two rollers are investigated and adjusted for successful transfer of r-GO. With <b>the</b> <b>adjusted</b> roll-to-roll <b>printing</b> parameters, r-GO thin film has been transferred successfully to glass and PET substrates at a printing rate of 5 mm/min.
