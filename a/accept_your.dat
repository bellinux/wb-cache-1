500|$|Once the {{election}} concludes, the Cardinal Dean summons the Secretary of the College of Cardinals and the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations into the hall. The Cardinal Dean then asks the pope-elect if he assents to {{the election}}, saying in Latin: [...] "Acceptasne electionem de te canonice factam in Summum Pontificem? (Do you <b>accept</b> <b>your</b> canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?)" [...] There is no {{requirement that the}} pope-elect do so and he is free to respond [...] "Non accepto" [...] (I do not accept).|$|E
500|$|When {{their efforts}} to get the Flood {{manuscript}} published failed, the Earps decided to appeal to Burns, whose own book was near publication. But he was not interested. His book {{was about to be}} published, free of the constraints imposed by a collaboration with Earp. Burns wrote them, [...] "I should not now care to undertake another book which, in part at least, would be upon much the same lines... I should have been delighted six months ago to <b>accept</b> <b>your</b> offer but it is too late now. My book has championed Mr. Earp's cause throughout and I believe will vindicate his reputation in Tombstone in a way that he will like." [...] When Burns turned them down, Josephine actively worked to stop the publication of his book, fearful that {{their efforts to}} publish Wyatt's biography would be thwarted as a result.|$|E
2500|$|Ham {{also drew}} a {{distinction}} between [...] "historical science" [...] and [...] "observational science", a distinction the Christian Science Monitor notes is unique to creation scientists. [...] "We observe things in the present, and we're assuming that has always happened in the past," [...] said Ham, adding, [...] "You've got a problem, because you weren't there." [...] During his rebuttal, Nye asked, [...] "Why should we <b>accept</b> <b>your</b> word for it that natural law changed 3,000 years ago {{and we have no}} record of it?" ...|$|E

"Yes, great king, a {{transgression}} overcame you in {{that you}} were so foolish, so muddle-headed, and so unskilled as to kill your father — a righteous man, a righteous king — {{for the sake of}} sovereign rulership. But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma, we <b>accept</b> <b>your</b> confession. For it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma & Discipline of the noble ones when, seeing a transgression as such, one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bishop Brown {{soon became}} acquainted with Brother Schuckardt {{and tried to}} persuade him to accept {{ordination}} from him. Later he proposed to consecrate Brother Schuckardt to the episcopacy in addition to ordaining him to the priesthood. After Bishop Brown had repented of having received consecration from the Old Catholics, Brother Schuckardt agreed to receive consecration from Bishop Brown: [...] "hese past months have been spent in intense soul searching and continuous prayer to know and follow God's holy will. Thus I could not give you a reply until I felt fairly certain in my heart and mind. Now, finally, in concluding our novena in honor of the Annunciation, I have come to a decision. It is with holy trepidation that I <b>accept</b> <b>your</b> offer..." [...] Between October 28 and November 1, 1971, Schuckardt was ordained and consecrated a bishop in a rented ballroom in Chicago, as they were not welcome in the churches of the Catholic Church.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{months after}} declaring his {{retirement}} from mixed martial arts, B.J. Penn {{announced that he}} would be returning to the octagon after repeated challenges made by welterweight prospect Rory MacDonald; stating, [...] "Rory, I <b>accept</b> <b>your</b> challenge!". Initially, Penn was expected to face Rory MacDonald on September 22, 2012 at UFC 152. [...] However, MacDonald pulled out of the bout after sustaining a cut to the forehead while training. Penn vs. MacDonald eventually took place on December 8, 2012 at UFC on Fox 5. [...] Penn lost the fight via unanimous decision. After the fight Dana White stated that he'd like to see B.J. Penn retire from mixed martial arts, although Penn has hinted a desire to return to the UFC's lightweight division. Following months of silence regarding his future, Penn spoke with Ariel Helwani in an interview for UFC on Fox, where he admitted that he was still undecided on his future, telling him that [...] "at this moment, my guess is probably a little better than yours, but I don't know, I'm enjoying what I'm doing." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 1965, Utzon gave Hughes a {{schedule}} setting out the completion dates {{of parts of}} his work for stage III. Utzon was at this time working closely with Ralph Symonds, a manufacturer of plywood based in Sydney and highly regarded by many, despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds's [...] "knowledge of the design stresses of plywood, was extremely sketchy" [...] and that the technical advice was [...] "elementary {{to say the least}} and completely useless for our purposes." [...] Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup's project engineer Michael Lewis as having [...] "other agendas". In any case, Hughes shortly after withheld permission for the construction of plywood prototypes for the interiors, and the relationship between Utzon and the client never recovered. By February 1966, Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees. Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff. The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation, Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes: [...] "If you don't do it, I resign." [...] Hughes replied: [...] "I <b>accept</b> <b>your</b> resignation. Thank you very much. Goodbye." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ros-Lehtinen {{has been}} a notable Republican voice in favor of LGBT rights. In a Winter 2013 {{interview}} with the Human Rights Campaign, she stated that her support for same-sex marriage was based on [...] "coming from Cuba, losing my homeland to communism, seeing the state control everything—I’m a person that believes in individual liberties and not having the government control everything.” When asked about her support for her son Rodrigo, a transgender LGBT rights advocate, Ros-Lehtinen commented that: It’s important for families to support their children and to support their children’s choices. It’s important {{to listen to your}} children, <b>accept</b> <b>your</b> children and have your children know that you love them unconditionally. It’s not “I love you, but…”—there’s [...] no “but.” “It’s just “I love you.” … To do otherwise is—you’re hurting yourself, you’re going to shun your child or grandchild. You’re going to say, “No, I have my views and my views are the perfect views and no one can have a different point of view. I’m right and everything else is wrong.” And that’s a lonely way to live. It just means you’ll be out of that person’s life, and who wants to be cut out of their child’s life? ...|$|E
2500|$|When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences {{released}} their longlist for the Academy Award for Best Original Score in December 2014, Birdman {{was absent}} from the list. The previous day, Sánchez received a note from the award committee explaining the decision, quoting rule fifteen of the 87th Academy Award Rules, noting [...] "the fact that the film also contains over {{a half an hour}} of non-original (mostly classical) music cues that are featured very prominently in numerous pivotal moments in the film made it difficult for the committee to <b>accept</b> <b>your</b> submission". Sánchez launched an appeal, and along with Iñárritu and the executive vice-president of Fox Music, they sent letters to Charles Fox, the chair of the Academy's music branch executive committee, asking that the committee reconsider their decision. One of the points they raised was that the committee incorrectly calculated the ratio of classical to original music, which after being clarified Sánchez thought he was [...] "on really solid ground". A response from Fox on December 19 however, explained that a special meeting of the music committee was held, and although its members had [...] "great respect" [...] for the score and considered it [...] "superb", they thought that the classical music [...] "was also used as scoring", [...] "equally contributes to the effectiveness of the film", and that the musical identity of the film was created by both the drums and classical music. Ultimately, they did not overturn their decision. Sánchez said that he and Iñárritu were not satisfied with the explanation.|$|E

2500|$|When the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong came {{to power}} in 1949, Puyi was repatriated to China after {{negotiations}} between the Soviet Union and China. Puyi was of considerable value to Mao, as Behr noted: [...] "In the eyes of Mao and other Chinese Communist leaders, Pu Yi, the last Emperor, was the epitome of all that had been evil in old Chinese society. If he could be shown to have undergone sincere, permanent change, what hope was there for the most diehard counter-revolutionary? The more overwhelming the guilt, the more spectacular the redemption-and the greater glory of the Chinese Communist Party". Furthermore, Mao had often noted that Lenin had Nicholas II, the last Russian emperor, shot together {{with the rest of the}} Russian imperial family, as Lenin could not make the last tsar into a communist; making the last Chinese emperor into a Communist was intended to show the superiority of Chinese communism over Soviet communism. Puyi was to be subjected to [...] "remodeling" [...] (known in the West as [...] "brain-washing") to make him into a Communist. Behr observed that the Chinese Communist system was brutal, as millions of people were executed as [...] "kulaks", [...] "traitors" [...] and [...] "landlords" [...] during Mao's first years in power, but it had a very different approach to crime from the West, quoting from Jean Pasqualini's book Prisonnier de Mao: [...] "Prison is not prison, but a school for learning about one's mistakes". Pasqualini wrote that the aim of remodeling in China was [...] "not so much to make you invent nonexistent crimes, but to make you <b>accept</b> <b>your</b> ordinary life, as you led it, as rotten and sinful and worthy of punishment ... self-accusation is one of the masterpieces of the penal system ... the prisoner takes care to build the case against himself as skillfully as he can ... When a prisoner has finally produced a satisfactory statement the government holds a document with which, depending on the emphasis of interpretation, it can sentence him to virtually any desired number of years. It is the prosecutor's dream". Puyi was never tortured, as Behr noted that [...] "in the Chinese approach to the redemption of criminals, kindness too could become a weapon-at times an extraordinary effective one".|$|E
