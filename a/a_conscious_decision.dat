5|$|To {{write his}} own batch of songs, Farrar looked through {{several of the}} over 3,000 {{handwritten}} lyrics that Guthrie's estate has preserved before incidentally focusing on his California period. The connection to Guthrie's Los Angeles years was accidental—Farrar simply chose lyrics that he found compelling and Nora pointed out that they came from a relatively brief period of her father's life when he lived in Los Angeles. He also made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to write instrumentation in a style more similar to Guthrie's than other tribute projects, such as The Klezmatics' klezmer-based Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah and Wonder Wheel. Farrar had never listened to the Bragg and Wilco material to ensure that his songwriting would not be influenced by it.|$|E

5|$|West made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> {{to abstain}} from the {{widespread}} recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was {{brought on by the}} alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

25|$|In 1605, {{his father}} succeeded to the throne, after {{crushing}} a rebellion by Prince Khusrau – Khurram remained {{distant from the}} court politics and intrigues {{in the immediate aftermath}} of that event, which was apparently <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> on Jahangir's part. As the third son, Khurram did not challenge the two major power blocs of the time, his father's and his step-brother's; thus he enjoyed the benefits of Imperial protection and luxury while being allowed to continue with his education and training. This relatively quiet and stable period of his life allowed Khurram to build his own support base in the Mughal court, which would be useful later on in his life.|$|E

25|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the first detection, policy- or {{decision-makers}} might have the opportunity to make <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> about composing and sending a message. The ambiguity and content of signals sent both to and from Earth would have profound implications for what actions needed to be taken. A PDP that did not take signal comprehensibility into account would not be flexible enough to inform appropriate action. The area of SETI research known as CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence), is concerned with how humankind should carry out this communication and, to some extent, representation problems such as whether a response should be with one collective voice or if anyone with access to a transmitter should have the right to communicate.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Loung {{graduated}} from high school, and in the fall, she entered Saint Michael's College with the financial assistance of a full four-year scholarship provided by the Turrell Scholarship Fund. During her college years, she made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to become an activist, and met her future husband. In early 1992, Loung studied at Cannes International College as part of Saint Michael's curriculum. During that time, she was reunited with her youngest brother Kim, who had fled Cambodia to Thailand and was brought to France via Germany {{with the help of}} his Aunt Heng in 1985.

25|$|In 1999, The Aquabats {{underwent}} a significant shift in style for their third studio album The Aquabats vs. the Floating Eye of Death! and its companion piece Myths, Legends, and Other Amazing Adventures, Vol. 2, further exploring the multi-genre eclecticism {{which had been}} hinted at with The Fury. <b>A</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> by the band to write more diverse material, these albums saw a near-complete forfeit of the brass-driven ska of their previous albums {{in favor of more}} guitar and synthesizer-structured songwriting, embracing a punk rock and new wave sound greatly influenced by Devo and Oingo Boingo, two of The Aquabats' biggest inspirations. The band also began widening their genre experimentation to encompass such disparate styles as electronica, synthpop and even hip-hop, elements which persist in their sound to present day.|$|E

25|$|After the Children of God album, Gira professed himself tired {{with the}} band's fearsome {{reputation}} for noise, feeling that their audience now had expectations {{that he had}} no intention of fulfilling. He made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to tone down the band's sound, introducing more acoustic elements and increasingly emphasizing Jarboe as a singer. The first results of this shift in direction were the two records recorded by Gira and Jarboe under the names Skin (in Europe) and World of Skin (in the US). The first, Blood, Women, Roses, featured Jarboe on lead vocals, and the second, Shame, Humility, Revenge, featured Gira on lead vocals. Both were recorded together in 1987, although Shame, Humility, Revenge was not released until 1988. These albums are full of slow, ethereal, melancholy, dirge-like songs, sounding like stripped down acoustic versions of the Children of God songs.|$|E
25|$|On {{all their}} {{projects}} since 1972 they worked exclusively with photographer Wolfgang Volz. At least five of their major projects were subjects of documentary films by Albert and David Maysles. Although, Jeanne-Claude and Christo worked as creative equals {{on all of}} their art projects, only Christo’s name appeared on the finished products. This was <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> by both Jeanne-Claude and Christo because of the prejudices against female artists in the art world. Jeanne-Claude said, “‘The decision to use only the name Christo was made deliberately {{when we were young}} because it was difficult for one artist to be established and we wanted to put all the chances on our side.’” Therefore, Jeanne-Claude took on the role as Christo’s manager in order to advance their success. The pair did not reveal Jeanne-Claude as the second half in the creative process until 1994.|$|E
25|$|If one accepts that Shakespeare made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to use Holinshed more {{frequently}} during his re-editing of True Tragedy, one must ask why {{he may have}} done so. True Tragedy is roughly one thousand lines shorter than 3 Henry VI, and whilst many of the differences are simple aesthetic changes and alternate phraseology (much of which is easily attributable to inaccurate reporting), one major {{difference between the two}} that runs throughout is how they each handle violence. On the whole, 3 Henry VI is far more restrained in its depiction of war, whereas True Tragedy has more explicit and sustained on-stage combat and more royal processions and celebrations after combat. Much more so than does 3 Henry VI, True Tragedy conforms to the so-called Tudor myth that the Wars of Roses were God's punishment for people straying from the path laid out for them, and His means of purging the country of evil and opening the way for the righteous Tudor dynasty to establish peace. Traditionally, this has been a common way of interpreting the entire octalogy; advocated and elaborated upon by critics as diverse as August Wilhelm Schlegel, Hermann Ulrici, Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Irving Ribner, M.M. Reese, Robert Rentoul Reed, and, most famously, E.M.W. Tillyard, with whom the phrase Tudor myth is now most associated.|$|E

40|$|Although many {{fairy tales}} feature small {{characters}} or things, Marie-Catherine d’Aulnoy’s {{evocation of the}} small {{is not just a}} consequence of her tales’ small scale but rather <b>a</b> self- <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to examine and exploit the limits of the genre. Although d’Aulnoy sometimes associates the small with deformity or inferiority, most often she evokes small things to admire their delicate beauty. I argue that in her descriptions of small objects, especially toys and jewels, d’Aulnoy celebrates the skill with which they have been made in a self-reflexive move that ascribes new value to her artfully crafted tales...|$|R
