5|$|In generic sense, {{vaccination}} {{works by}} priming {{the immune system}} with an 'immunogen'. Stimulating immune response, via use of <b>an</b> <b>infectious</b> agent, is known as immunization. The development of immunity to polio efficiently blocks person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which the pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of <b>an</b> <b>infectious</b> disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to risk of infection, cross-immunity may modulate {{the probability that}} <b>a</b> host becomes <b>infectious</b> and the duration that <b>a</b> host remains <b>infectious.</b>|$|R
30|$|Uveitis is an {{inflammatory}} {{process of the}} uvea, the vascular membrane of the eye that includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Clinically, it can be classified into two groups: (<b>a)</b> <b>infectious,</b> e.g., bacterial endophthalmitis, toxoplasmosis, or herpetic retinopathy, {{in which there is}} <b>an</b> obvious <b>infectious</b> etiology, and (b) non-infectious, in which the pathophysiology is presumed to be autoimmune or immune-mediated in nature [[1], [2]]. In the latter form, a uveal component, whether tissue damage or a microbial trigger, stimulates the generation of antigen-specific T cells and/or autoantibodies that are believed to play a pathogenetic role [[3]], hence the term autoimmune uveitis (AU).|$|R

5|$|Hepatitis C is <b>an</b> <b>infectious</b> disease {{caused by}} the {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack of genetic diversity in cheetahs is a cause of poor quality and production of sperm, and birth defects such as cramped teeth, kinked tails, and bent limbs. Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if <b>an</b> <b>infectious</b> disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the Wildlife Safari (Oregon, United States) died due to a peritonitis epidemic.|$|E
5|$|One-third of the world's {{population}} {{is thought to}} be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2016, there were more than 10 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.3 million deaths. This makes it the number one cause of death from <b>an</b> <b>infectious</b> disease. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries, and more than 50% in India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 5–10% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test. Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times.|$|E

Bangladesh Railway set up the hospital at Kumira in 1952 with a capacity of 150 beds. The capacity was reduced to 50 beds in 1994 as some focus was redirected to the Railway Hospital at Central Railway Building in Chittagong. Originally built to treat railway employees, the hospital now also treats people from the wider community. Malaria, dengue and other fevers, hepatitis, as well as respiratory infections including tuberculosis {{are some of the}} major health threats. The percentage of disabled in Sitakunda is reported to be the highest in Bangladesh, at 17% compared to the national average of 13%.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, Red Dead Redemption was {{acclaimed}} by many reviewers, with praise {{directed at}} the game's visuals, dynamically-generated music, voice acting, gameplay, and story. The game has shipped over 15 million copies and won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. It is widely {{considered one of the}} greatest video games of all time. After the game's release, several downloadable content additions were released; , later released as a standalone game, added a new single-player experience in which Marston searches for a cure for <b>an</b> <b>infectious</b> zombie plague that has swept across the Old West. A Game of the Year Edition containing all additional content was released in October 2011. A prequel, Red Dead Redemption 2, was announced in October 2016, and is scheduled to be released in Q2 2018.|$|E
5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to <b>an</b> <b>infectious</b> agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is <b>an</b> <b>infectious</b> disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E
5|$|When {{a colony}} is dying, for {{whatever}} cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a bee yard), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions {{for their own}} use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is <b>an</b> <b>infectious</b> disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E
