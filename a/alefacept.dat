5000|$|<b>Alefacept</b> reduces CD4+ T cell {{counts and}} may worsen the {{clinical}} course of HIV infections. It is therefore contraindicated {{in patients with}} HIV infections.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of action involves dual mechanisms. <b>Alefacept</b> inhibits the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by interfering with CD2 on the T cell membrane thereby blocking the costimulatory molecule LFA-3/CD2 interaction. Another mechanism is inducing apoptosis of memory-effector T lymphocytes. If the T cells were to become activated they would stimulate proliferation of keratinocytes resulting in the typical psoriatic symptoms. Therefore, <b>alefacept</b> leads to clinical improvement of moderate to severe psoriasis by blunting these reactions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Novel therapies against {{psoriasis}} are emerging. <b>Alefacept</b> {{is such a}} treatment. It selectively targets {{the memory}} effector population of T cells and thereby diminishes the psoriatic plaques. In some cases, however, the use of <b>alefacept</b> as a monotherapy is not sufficient. OBJECTIVE: In the present study we investigate the safety and efficacy of adding topical steroids to <b>alefacept</b> treatment during the initial 4 weeks. METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from all patients {{and the presence of}} specific T-cell subsets was assessed by flow cytometry. Fourteen patients were included and treated with 15 mg <b>alefacept</b> intramuscularly for a period of 12 weeks. Each of them was randomized to use either betamethasone-dipropionate cream or a vehicle cream during the first 4 weeks of the <b>alefacept</b> course. RESULTS: Additional topical corticosteroid treatment during the first 4 weeks of <b>alefacept</b> treatment does not have a beneficial effect on the clinical efficacy. Marked changes were seen in the absolute cell counts of various of the analysed T-cell subsets in peripheral blood after 12 weeks of <b>alefacept,</b> either with or without additional local steroid application. The CD 45 RO+, CD 8 +CD 45 RO+, CD 8 +CD 161 +, CD 4 +CD 25 +, CD 4 +CLA+ and CD 8 +CLA+ populations showed a statistically significant decrease immediately after the treatment period. Further analysis revealed that the addition of local steroid therapy to <b>alefacept</b> results in marked decreases of all T-cell subsets analysed in this study, in contrast to the addition of the vehiculum only. CONCLUSION: <b>Alefacept</b> selectively targets the CD 45 RO+ lymphocyte population, as well as some other subpopulations of lymphocytes. This effect is independent of the use of additional topical therapy during the first 4 weeks. The extent of the decrease, on the contrary, is dependent on the use of corticosteroids...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} weekly <b>alefacept</b> monotherapy 15 mg i. m. on epidermal hyperproliferation, keratinization, T-cell subsets and cells expressing NK receptors during 12 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, the addition of calcipotriol cream to <b>alefacept</b> treatment was studied and compared with <b>alefacept</b> monotherapy. METHODS: Five patients participated in this study, and used weekly <b>alefacept</b> 15 mg i. m. combined with calcipotriol cream up {{to a maximum of}} 100 g per week. Biopsies from two lesions (one treated and another lesion not treated with calcipotriol cream) were taken at week 0 and week 12. We investigated the number of T-cell subsets (CD 4, CD 8, CD 45 RO, CD 45 RA, CD 2, CD 25), cells expressing NK receptors (CD 94 and CD 161), the proliferation marker Ki- 67 and the keratinization marker keratin- 10. RESULTS: <b>Alefacept</b> monotherapy induced a statistically significant reduction of CD 4 +, CD 45 RO+ and CD 2 + cells in dermis and epidermis and CD 8 + cells in epidermis at week 12. Furthermore, the keratin- 10 positive epidermal surface was significantly increased at week 12. The combination of <b>alefacept</b> and calcipotriol cream induced a statistically significant reduction of only CD 4 + and CD 45 RO+ cells at week 12. CONCLUSIONS: The number of memory effector T-cells in the psoriatic lesion is significantly decreased by <b>alefacept,</b> and calcipotriol cream {{does not seem to have}} an additional effect on this reduction.

40|$|<b>Alefacept</b> {{treatment}} {{has been shown}} in several multicentre studies to result in prolonged post-treatment remission periods (median duration 241 days). This communication describes the clinical responses of 10 patients to multiple courses of 12 weekly intramuscular injections with <b>alefacept</b> given in combination with available antipsoriatic treatments. It was shown that in this group of 10 patients with moderate-severe psoriasis, 8 were no longer candidates for any more long-term continuous systemic treatment with methotrexate or acitretin, 7 had no options for UVB/PUVA courses and 8 were not suitable for treatment with cyclosporine. In 5 out of these 10 patients <b>alefacept</b> had resulted in a considerable long-term improvement with only mild disease expression, which lasted one year or longer. Patients indicated that these responses were outstanding as compared to the troublesome years before. Another patient reported a major improvement in the quality of life by reduction of itch. In two patients <b>alefacept</b> vastly enhanced the efficacy of dithranol treatment, as compared to previous treatments. Another patient was able to discontinue methotrexate without relapsing during <b>alefacept,</b> in contrast to severe rebound episodes following discontinuation of methotrexate in the past. The long-term responses of 8 out of the 10 patients described in this report indicate that <b>alefacept,</b> in the context of individualised care of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, can have an important contribution. In particular, the long-term response after stopping <b>alefacept</b> makes this treatment a valuable tool, achieving prolonged disease control in at least some patients with moderate to severe psoriasis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alefacept</b> is a {{chimeric}} protein combining CD 58 immunoglobulin-like domain 1 with human IgG 1 Fc. <b>Alefacept</b> mediates adhesion by bridging CD 2 on T cells to activating Fc receptors on effector cells, but the equilibrium binding parameters {{have not been}} determined. <b>Alefacept</b> mediated T cell killing by NK cells and adhesion between CD 2 - and CD 16 -expressing cells at an optimum concentration of 100 nM.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The {{effect of}} the {{established}} antipsoriatic treatment with topical calcipotriol (with a maximum of 100 g per week) in addition to systemic treatment with <b>alefacept,</b> a new biological agent for psoriasis, on epidermal cell populations in the psoriatic lesion was investigated {{using a combination of}} the Zenon labelling technique and microscopic image analysis. Epidermal cell populations were measured quantitatively with this sensitive method. PATIENTS/METHODS: Frozen sections of non-treated psoriatic epidermis and psoriatic epidermis treated with either <b>alefacept</b> intramuscular or <b>alefacept</b> intramuscular in combination with topical calcipotriol for 12 weeks were compared immunohistochemically. Antibodies against keratin 6, 10 and 15 were labelled with the Zenon technique, whereas antibodies against the Ki- 67 antigen and beta- 1 integrin were covalently Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) -labelled. Using image analysis, these markers were measured in the epidermis in a standardized manner. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of psoriasis with <b>alefacept</b> resulted in a good clinical response in several patients and in a normalization of epidermal expression of the immunohistochemical parameters for differentiation and proliferation. The addition of topical calcipotriol resulted in a faster clinical improvement with a similar overall clinical response and a similar response of epidermal cell populations as compared to treatment with <b>alefacept</b> monotherapy after 12 weeks of treatment. This study also suggests that the appearance of keratin 15 has a predictive value for the duration of remission. It can be concluded that the addition of a low-dose calcipotriol treatment does not contribute to the clinical efficacy of <b>alefacept,</b> both at the clinical level and with respect to markers for epidermal proliferation and differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Background Psoriasis is a chronic, {{relapsing}} {{skin disease}} that may require multiple treatment courses. <b>Alefacept</b> targets the memory T cells implicated in psoriasis pathogenesis. This open-label study evaluated {{the safety and}} tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of repeat courses of <b>alefacept</b> in {{men and women with}} chronic plaque psoriasis. This article reports the interim results of this ongoing study. Methods Patients (n  =  174) who participated in previous phase II studies of <b>alefacept</b> were included in this retreatment study. Intravenous <b>alefacept</b> (7. 5  mg) was administered once weekly for 12  weeks followed by 12  weeks of observation. Initial and subsequent retreatment courses were only given when, in the opinion of the investigators, disease had returned and necessitated treatment; CD 4 + T-cell counts had to be at or above the lower limit of normal. Results Adverse events were similar regardless of the retreatment course. No opportunistic infections, rebound of disease, or flares were reported. Low titers of anti-alefacept antibodies occurred in a few patients without related safety issues. Sixty-six per cent of patients achieved a ≥  50 % reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at any time after the first dose of retreatment course 1. Patients who received two retreatment courses (n  =  50) had consistent or improved responses after the second course; 64 % and 68 % of these patients achieved a ≥  50 % PASI improvement at any time after the first dose of retreatment courses 1 and 2, respectively. <b>Alefacept</b> selectively reduced memory T cells without cumulative effects.

40|$|AbstractTransfusion-related alloimmunization is {{a potent}} barrier to the {{engraftment}} of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells in patients with nonmalignant diseases (NMDs). Memory T cells, which drive alloimmunization, are relatively resistant to commonly used conditioning agents. <b>Alefacept,</b> a recombinant leukocyte function antigen- 3 /IgG 1 fusion protein, targets CD 2 and selectively depletes memory versus naive T cells. Three multiply transfused pediatric patients with NMD received a short course of high-dose i. v. <b>alefacept</b> (. 25 mg/kg/dose on days − 40 and − 9 and. 5 mg/kg/dose on days − 33, − 26, − 19, and − 12) before undergoing unrelated allogeneic transplant {{in the setting of}} reduced-intensity pretransplant conditioning and calcineurin inhibitor–based post-transplant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. <b>Alefacept</b> infusions were well tolerated in all patients. Peripheral blood flow cytometry was performed at baseline and during and after <b>alefacept</b> treatment. As expected, after the 5 weekly <b>alefacept</b> doses, each patient demonstrated selective loss of CD 2 hi/CCR 7 −/CD 45 RA− effector memory (Tem) and CD 2 hi/CCR 7 +/CD 45 RA− central memory (Tcm) CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells with relative preservation of the CD 2 lo Tem and Tcm subpopulations. In addition, depletion of CD 2 + natural killer (NK) cells also occurred. Neutrophil recovery was rapid, and all 3 patients had 100 % sorted (CD 3 /CD 33) peripheral blood donor chimerism by day + 100. Immune reconstitution (by absolute neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts) was comparable with a cohort of historical control patients. All 3 patients developed GVHD but are all now off immune suppression and > 2 years post-transplant with stable full-donor engraftment. These results suggest that <b>alefacept</b> at higher dosing can deplete both memory T cells and NK cells and that incorporating CD 2 -targeted depletion into a reduced-intensity transplant regimen is feasible and safe in heavily transfused patients...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of multiple courses of <b>alefacept</b> in combination with traditional psoriasis therapy {{for the treatment of}} chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP).

40|$|Chronic {{allograft}} rejection {{is a major}} {{impediment to}} long-term transplant success. Humoral immune responses to alloantigens are a growing clinical problem in transplantation, with mounting evidence associating alloantibodies {{with the development of}} chronic rejection. Nearly a third of transplant recipients develop de novo antibodies, for which no established therapies are effective at preventing or eliminating, highlighting the need for a nonhuman primate model of antibody-mediated rejection. In this report, we demonstrate that depletion using anti-CD 3 immunotoxin (IT) combined with maintenance immunosuppression that included tacrolimus with or without <b>alefacept</b> reliably prolonged renal allograft survival in rhesus monkeys. In these animals, a preferential skewing toward CD 4 repopulation and proliferation was observed, particularly with the addition of <b>alefacept.</b> Furthermore, alefacept-treated animals demonstrated increased alloantibody production (100 %) and morphologic features of antibody-mediated injury. In vitro, <b>alefacept</b> was found to enhance CD 4 effector memory T cell proliferation. In conclusion, <b>alefacept</b> administration after depletion and with tacrolimus promotes a CD 4 +memory T cell and alloantibody response, with morphologic changes reflecting antibody-mediated allograft injury.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{patients}} with {{moderate to severe}} chronic plaque psoriasis fail to respond to or are not appropriate candidates for conventional systemic therapies and/or phototherapy. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy, {{quality of life and}} safety of <b>alefacept</b> among the proportion of patients who participated in the phase III studies and who were not suitable candidates for conventional systemic psoriasis therapies or phototherapy. METHODS: The patient's historical responses at the baseline visit during the phase III studies of <b>alefacept</b> were used to identify a subpopulation in whom the use of methotrexate, ciclosporin, retinoids, ultraviolet B or psoralen plus ultraviolet A was ineffective or inappropriate. Endpoints included Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and adverse events. RESULTS: Most patients (69 %) who were treated with <b>alefacept</b> in the phase III programme were not candidates for > or = 1 of the above-mentioned therapies, and 41 and 21 % were not candidates for > or = 2 and > or = 3, respectively. A reduction in PASI of > or = 75 % was achieved by 27, 23 and 26 % of alefacept-treated patients who were not candidates for > or = 1, > or = 2 and > or = 3 conventional systemic psoriasis therapies or phototherapy, respectively (all p < or = 0. 001 vs. placebo). The corresponding results for PASI 50 were 53, 52 and 50 % (all p < or = 0. 001 vs. placebo).

Exogenous insulin requirements were lower (P = 0. 002) and rates of major hypoglycemic events were about 50 % reduced (P < 0. 001) in the <b>alefacept</b> group compared with placebo at 24 months. There was no apparent between-group difference in glycemic control or adverse events. <b>Alefacept</b> treatment depleted CD 4 + and CD 8 + central memory T cells (Tcm) and effector memory T cells (Tem) (P < 0. 01), preserved Tregs, increased the ratios of Treg to Tem and Tcm (P < 0. 01), and increased the percentage of PD- 1 +CD 4 + Tem and Tcm (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with newly diagnosed T 1 D, two 12 -week courses of <b>alefacept</b> preserved C-peptide secretion, reduced insulin use and hypoglycemic events, and induced favorable immunologic profiles at 24 months, well over 1 year after cessation of therapy.

40|$|Background Type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) {{results from}} autoimmune targeting of the pancreatic beta cells, likely mediated by effector memory T cells (Tems). CD 2, a T cell surface protein highly expressed on Tems, is {{targeted by the}} fusion protein <b>alefacept,</b> depleting Tems and central memory T cells (Tcms). We hypothesized that <b>alefacept</b> would arrest autoimmunity and preserve residual beta cells in newly diagnosed T 1 D. Methods The T 1 DAL study is a phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomised T 1 D patients 12 - 35 years old within 100 days of diagnosis, 33 to <b>alefacept</b> (two 12 -week courses of 15 mg IM per week, separated by a 12 -week pause) and 16 to placebo, at 14 US sites. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean 2 -hour C-peptide area under the curve (AUC) at 12 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00965458. Findings The mean 2 -hour C-peptide AUC at 12 months increased by 0. 015 nmol/L (95 % CI - 0. 080 to 0. 110 nmol/L) in the <b>alefacept</b> group and decreased by 0. 115 nmol/L (95 % CI - 0. 278 to 0. 047) in the placebo group, which was not significant (p= 0. 065). However, key secondary endpoints were met: the mean 4 -hour C-peptide AUC was significantly higher (p= 0. 019), and daily insulin use {{and the rate of}} hypoglycemic events were significantly lower (p= 0. 02 and p< 0. 001, respectively) at 12 months in the <b>alefacept</b> vs. placebo groups. Safety and tolerability were comparable between groups. There was targeted depletion of Tems and Tcms, with sparing of naïve and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Interpretation At 12 months, <b>alefacept</b> preserved the 4 -hour C-peptide AUC, lowered insulin use, and reduced hypoglycemic events, suggesting a signal of efficacy. Depletion of memory T cells with sparing of Tregs may be a useful strategy to preserve beta cell function in new-onset T 1 D...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Alefacept</b> {{treatment}} is highly effective in {{a select group}} patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and is an ideal candidate to develop systems to predict who will respond to therapy. A clinical trial of 22 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis treated with <b>alefacept</b> was conducted in 2002 - 2003, as a mechanism of action study. Patients were classified as responders or non-responders to <b>alefacept</b> based on histological criteria. Results of the original mechanism of action study have been published. Peripheral blood was collected {{at the start of}} this clinical trial, and a prior analysis demonstrated that gene expression in PBMCs differed between responders and non-responders, however, the analysis performed could not be used to predict response. Methods Microarray data from PBMCs of 16 of these patients was analyzed to generate a treatment response classifier. We used a discriminant analysis method that performs sample classification from gene expression data, via "nearest shrunken centroid method". Centroids are the average gene expression for each gene in each class divided by the within-class standard deviation for that gene. Results A disease response classifier using 23 genes was created to accurately predict response to <b>alefacept</b> (12. 3 % error rate). While the genes in this classifier should be considered as a group, some of the individual genes are of great interest, for example, cAMP response element modulator (CREM), v-MAF avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family (MAFF), chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (CLIC 1, also called NCC 27), NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP 1), and CCL 5 (chemokine, cc motif, ligand 5, also called regulated upon activation, normally T expressed, and presumably secreted/RANTES). Conclusions Although this study is small, and based on analysis of existing microarray data, we demonstrate that a treatment response classifier for <b>alefacept</b> can be created using gene expression of PBMCs in psoriasis. This preliminary study may provide a useful tool to predict response of psoriatic patients to <b>alefacept.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA) is {{an inflammatory}} joint disease associated with psoriasis. <b>Alefacept</b> (a lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA) - 3 Ig fusion protein that binds to CD 2 and functions as an antagonist to T-cell activation) {{has been shown}} to result in improvement in psoriasis but has limited effectiveness in PsA. Interleukin- 20 (IL- 20) is a key proinflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
