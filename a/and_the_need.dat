5|$|After {{the start}} of the civil war in 1983, a number of poets and fiction writers became active, {{focusing}} on subjects such as death, destruction, and rape. Such writings have no parallels in any previous Tamil literature. The war produced displaced Tamil writers around the globe who recorded their longing for their lost homes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for integration with mainstream communities in Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels, in {{the form}} of liquid fuels derived from plant materials, are {{entering}} the market, driven by factors such as oil price spikes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for increased energy security.

5|$|During the 1730s and 1740s, the Presbyterian Church {{was divided}} over {{the impact of}} the First Great Awakening. Drawing from the Scotch-Irish revivalist tradition, evangelical ministers such as William and Gilbert Tennent {{emphasized}} the necessity of a conscious conversion experience <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for higher moral standards among the clergy.|$|E

5|$|Fighter pilots {{received}} no instrument training until very {{late in the}} war, after the training course had already been curtailed because of fuel shortages <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to produce pilots more quickly to replace losses. Galland also did not make sure all-weather flying was incorporated into pilot training, which was of decisive importance in an effective air defence force.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels, however, used {{not only}} {{intimidation}} but also cajoling and generosity {{to achieve his}} goals. Ferdinand Marian requested compensation of 50,000 marks for taking {{on the role of}} Süß, an amount double anything he had received for previous roles. When asked to approve this amount, Goebbels did so citing the importance of the film <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for a high-caliber cast to ensure its success.|$|E
5|$|In February 1945, Purnell {{arranged}} for Commander Frederick Ashworth {{to go to}} Guam to brief Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz on the project.

Kilroy ran radio commercials on Christian and conservative radio stations {{in an attempt to}} appeal to family-values-oriented listeners.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1941, Hitler {{launched}} Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion}} of the Soviet Union. The expanding war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to control occupied territories provided the conditions for Himmler to further consolidate the police and military organs of the SS. Rapid acquisition of vast territories in the East placed considerable strain on the SS police organizations as they struggled to adjust to the changing security challenges.|$|E

5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} {{ceremony was}} held for the victims on July 31, 1944, at Port Chicago. Admiral Carleton H.

He gave Navy and Marine Corps Medals for bravery to four officers and men who had successfully fought a fire in a rail car parked within a revetment near the pier.

5|$|A year later, Catherine was {{banished from}} court, and her rooms {{were given to}} Anne. Anne was an unusually educated and {{intellectual}} woman for her time, and was keenly absorbed and engaged {{with the ideas of}} the Protestant Reformers, though the extent to which she herself was a committed Protestant is much debated. When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, Anne's influence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position. This was approved by the Pope, unaware of the King's nascent plans for the Church.|$|E
5|$|After {{conversion}} to M18 Hellcat self-propelled tank destroyers, the battalion moved into Germany, helping force a bridgehead over the Neckar River at the Battle of Heilbronn. After reaching Stuttgart it was reassigned to the 103rd Infantry Division, {{and with them}} reached Innsbruck in Austria by VE Day. After two weeks of occupation duties it was ordered to prepare for service in the Pacific; however, while it was reforming in the United States, the Japanese surrender was announced, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for more combat units ended. The battalion was demobilized in September 1945.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{government}} of Bhutan goes {{to great lengths to}} prevent outside influences from intruding on Bhutanese culture, Drukair is not immune to problems which affect the airline industry and the world community at large. In June 2008, citing hikes in the price of oil <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would under normal circumstances, whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E
