Her missions around this time were generally strategic bombing missions, however {{the effectiveness of these}} final missions were mixed, with some failing to achieve strategic results. She also provided close air support for UN troops for the final weeks of the war before an armistice was reached at Panmunjom in July 1953, ending major combat operations in Korea. During this time, the two sides often conducted costly attacks in order to strengthen their bargaining positions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> table.

25|$|The next Russo-Ottoman war in 1877 led {{to another}} European intervention, {{although}} this time <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> table. The Congress of Berlin blocked Russia from imposing the harsh Treaty of San Stefano on the Ottoman Empire. Despite its alliance with the French in the Crimean War, Britain viewed the Second Empire of Napoleon III with some distrust, especially as the emperor built up his navy, expanded his empire and took up a more active foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|This policy {{made the}} {{assumptions}} that an open conflict with India would {{not last long}} due to international pressure, and since East Pakistan was undefendable, the war-effort should be concentrated on occupying as large an area of Indian territory as possible as a bargaining tool <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> table. To this end, Gen. Tikka Khan had proposed an offensive into India, and the PAF's overriding priority was to give maximum support to this offensive. The initial plans for the offensive called {{for at least a}} temporary cover of air dominance by the PAF under which Khan's troops could conduct a lightning campaign deep into Western India before digging in and consolidating their positions. In order to achieve air dominance, Pakistan decided to launch an offensive counter air strike codenamed Operation Chengiz Khan on Indian airbases.|$|E

500|$|Indonesia, meanwhile, and {{especially}} her longtime president Sukarno, was vehemently {{opposed to the}} creation of the Federation. Sukarno opposed both the preservation of the 'imperialist' British presence in Southeast Asia, a region in which he aspired to be the supreme power, and the incorporating of the Borneo colonies into the new Federation, as his goal was to control the entire island. Indeed, through possession of the Kalimantan region, Indonesia already controlled the vast majority of the massive island. To improve Indonesia's position <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> table before the Federation was created, Sukarno initiated a period of Konfrontasi (Confrontation) with Malaysia. Consisting initially of frequent raids by Indonesian 'volunteers' into Malaysian territory, the conflict was not considered a war by either side, least of all by the Indonesians. In fact, when questioned on what exactly the Confrontation was, Foreign Minister Subandrio of Indonesia replied, [...] "Confrontation does not include war, because it can be carried on without war." ...|$|E
500|$|Pertaining to the above, {{it should}} be noted that Walter Brown was not rich; also that as Auerbach was as tough <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> table as he was on the {{practice}} court and in the locker room, it was always for the purpose of getting the most out of his players. In the summer of 1984, with much trepidation, Auerbach reluctantly signed former finals MVP Cedric Maxwell to a lucrative guaranteed contract to stay with the Celtics. Then, Auerbach's worst fears came true when Maxwell arrived that fall out of shape, and, suffering from various injuries, provided little contribution as the team lost a playoff for the first time ever to the Lakers in the 1985 Finals. [...] Two subsequent facts are perhaps most relevant in evaluating Auerbach's legacy: First, he was able to trade Maxwell to San Diego in exchange for former MVP Bill Walton, who was a major contributor to the team winning its 16th title in 1986, the last of Auerbach's career. Second, Maxwell continues to be embraced as a beloved member of the Celtics family, including having his number retired alongside the team's legendary greats.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the [...] Viet Minh had proclaimed {{independence}} {{under the}} Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in September 1945. This occurred after the withdrawal of Imperial Japan, which had seized control of the French colony during World War II. The military struggle started in November 1946 when France attempted to reassert control over Indochina with {{an attack on the}} northern port city of Haiphong. The DRV was recognised by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China (PRC). On the other hand, the western powers recognised the French-backed State of Vietnam, nominally led by Emperor Bảo Đại, but with a French-trained Vietnamese National Army (VNA) which was loyal to the French Union forces. In May 1954, after eight years of fighting, the French were surrounded and defeated in a mountainous northern fortress at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. France's withdrawal from Indochina was finalised in the Geneva Accords of July 1954, after two months of negotiations between Ho's DRV, France, the PRC and the Soviet Union. Under the terms of the agreement, Vietnam was temporarily divided at the 17th parallel north pending elections in 1956 to choose a national government that would administer a reunified country. The communist Viet Minh were left in control of North Vietnam, while the State of Vietnam controlled the south. French Union forces would gradually withdraw from Vietnam as the situation stabilised. Both Vietnamese sides were unsatisfied with the outcome at Geneva; Ngo Dinh Diem, Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam, denounced France's agreement and ordered his delegation not to sign. He stated [...] "We cannot recognise the seizure by Soviet China [...] [...] [...] of over half of our national territory" [...] and that [...] "We can neither concur in the brutal enslavement of millions of compatriots". North Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng expressed bitterness after his Soviet and Chinese backers threatened to cut support if he did not agree to the peace terms; Dong had wanted to press home the Viet Minh's military advantage so they could lay claim to more territory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> table.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the next}} {{generation}} high-speed wireless networks are expected to support multimedia applications (video, voice, and data). As such, {{it is important that}} these networks provide Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. Unlike wired networks, communication entities in wireless networks change their connectivity via handoff when user moves from one cell to another. Once a connection is admitted into the network, resources must be allocated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> level, for <b>the</b> duration of the connection. It is important to realize that, in a cellular network where the user may move through the network traversing a sequence of cells, this commitment cannot be only local to the cell in which the connection originated. If the connection is to be maintained after the user crosses the boundary between neighboring cells, the network must guarantee an appropriate level of resources in each new cell that the user traverses. In this paper a new resource allocation protocol for multimedia wireless networks is proposed that uses a combination of bandwidth reservation and bandwidth borrowing to provide QoS in terms of guaranteed bandwidth, call blocking, and call dropping probabilities...|$|R

500|$|The {{following}} equation represents covered {{interest rate}} parity, a condition under which investors eliminate exposure to {{foreign exchange risk}} (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) {{with the use of}} a forward contract [...] the exchange rate risk is effectively covered. Under this condition, a domestic investor would earn equal returns from investing in domestic assets or converting currency <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spot exchange rate, investing in foreign currency assets in a country with a different interest rate, and exchanging the foreign currency for domestic currency <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> forward exchange rate. Investors will be indifferent to the interest rates on deposits in these countries due to the equilibrium resulting from the forward exchange rate. The condition allows for no arbitrage opportunities because the return on domestic deposits, 1+id, is equal to the return on foreign deposits, (1+if). If these two returns weren't equalized by the use of a forward contract, there would be a potential arbitrage opportunity in which, for example, an investor could borrow currency in the country with the lower interest rate, convert to <b>the</b> foreign currency <b>at</b> today's spot exchange rate, and invest in the foreign country with the higher interest rate.|$|R
