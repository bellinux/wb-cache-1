5|$|The summit {{was held}} in the Olympic Sports Centre, Riga. Roads in the center of Riga were closed down and parking was not allowed at the airport or at several roads, out of fear for car bombs. About 9000 Latvian police {{officers}} and soldiers took care of the Summit's security, while more than 450 other airmen from seven European NATO countries were called upon to ensure a no-fly zone above the summit in an operation called Operation Peaceful Summit. This enhanced ongoing Baltic <b>Air</b> <b>Policing</b> activities with additional aircraft, communications and maintenance support.|$|E
5|$|The Command {{was kept}} {{busy in the}} late 1940s. Units {{were sent to the}} Middle East and Palestine as part of an <b>air</b> <b>policing</b> policy, in {{co-operation}} with the Israeli Air Force and Egyptian Air Force to prevent conflict between the two countries owing to the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. While there, they undertook a major operation, Operation Bobcat, to prevent illegal Jewish migrants coming into Palestine. In May 1948 the variety of aircraft was reduced despite increasing demand for operations. In May, Palestinians began attacking British military installations throughout the region. In the largest British post-war action, Operation Dawn (13 to 14 May 1948) was launched with the support of Coastal Command.|$|E
5|$|New NATO {{structures}} were also formed while old ones were abolished. In 1997, NATO reached {{agreement on a}} significant downsizing of its command structure from 65 headquarters to just 20. The NATO Response Force (NRF) was launched at the 2002 Prague summit on 21November, the first summit in a former Comecon country. On 19June 2003, a further restructuring of the NATO military commands began as the Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic were abolished and a new command, Allied Command Transformation (ACT), was established in Norfolk, United States, and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) became the Headquarters of Allied Command Operations (ACO). ACT is responsible for driving transformation (future capabilities) in NATO, whilst ACO is responsible for current operations. In March 2004, NATO's Baltic <b>Air</b> <b>Policing</b> began, which supported the sovereignty of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia by providing jet fighters to react to any unwanted aerial intrusions. Eight multinational jet fighters are based in Lithuania, the number of which was increased from four in 2014. Also at the 2004 Istanbul summit, NATO launched the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative with four Persian Gulf nations.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the history}} behind the Military <b>Police</b> brassard, many <b>Air</b> <b>Police</b> {{of the time}} {{felt that it was}} a poor {{insignia}} of authority. The brassard was prone to wrinkle extensively during the course of duty, and often slipped down the arm. As result, <b>Air</b> <b>Police</b> leadership requested a shield to replace the brassard.|$|R
50|$|In 1947, the United States Air Force {{separated}} from the Army, and the proud tradition of the Security Forces began. At first, the Security Forces were still called the Military police, and still wore the old Army arm band, or brassard. Soon the Military Police were renamed the <b>Air</b> <b>Police,</b> but they continued to wear the arm band. During this change the brassard was redesigned to show the words <b>Air</b> <b>Police</b> in yellow on a background of Air Force blue. Further editions of the brassard showed the same <b>Air</b> <b>Police</b> in dull gray on a background of dark blue.|$|R

He transferred to No. 1 Squadron at RAF Hinaidi in Iraq to undertake <b>air</b> <b>policing</b> duties in December 1925 and, having been promoted to flying officer on 31 January 1926, he transferred again this time to No. 6 Squadron at RAF Mosul also in Iraq in November 1926.|$|E
25|$|The Polish army's size is {{estimated}} at around 101,500 soldiers (2016). The Polish Navy primarily operates in the Baltic Sea and conducts operations such as maritime patrol, search and rescue for {{the section of the}} Baltic under Polish sovereignty, as well as hydrographic measurements and research. Also, the Polish Navy played a more international role as part of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, providing logistical support for the United States Navy. The current position of the Polish Air Force is much the same; it has routinely taken part in Baltic <b>Air</b> <b>Policing</b> assignments, but otherwise, {{with the exception of a}} number of units serving in Afghanistan, has seen no active combat since the end of the Second World War. In 2003, the F-16C Block 52 was chosen as the new general multi-role fighter for the air force, the first deliveries taking place in November 2006.|$|E
25|$|The Iceland Defense Force (IDF) was a {{military}} command of the United States Armed Forces from 1951 to 2006. The IDF, created {{at the request of}} NATO, came into existence when the United States signed an agreement to provide for the defense of Iceland. The IDF also consisted of civilian Icelanders and military members of other NATO nations. The IDF was downsized {{after the end of the}} Cold War and the U.S. Air Force maintained four to six interceptor aircraft at the Naval Air Station Keflavik, until they were withdrawn on 30 September 2006. Since May 2008, NATO nations have periodically deployed fighters to patrol Icelandic airspace under the Icelandic <b>Air</b> <b>Policing</b> mission. Iceland supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq despite much domestic controversy, deploying a Coast Guard EOD team to Iraq, which was replaced later by members of the Iceland Crisis Response Unit. Iceland has also participated in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Despite the ongoing financial crisis the first new patrol ship in decades was launched on 29 April 2009.|$|E

500|$|Trenchard {{also sought}} to secure {{the future of the}} RAF by finding a war-fighting role for the new Service. In 1920 he {{successfully}} argued that the RAF should take the lead during the operation to restore peace in Somaliland. [...] The success of this small air action then allowed Trenchard to put the case for the RAF's policing of the British Empire. Trenchard particularly argued for the RAF {{to take the lead in}} Iraq at the Cairo Conference of 1921 and in 1922 the RAF was given control of all British Forces in Iraq. [...] The RAF also carried out imperial <b>air</b> <b>policing</b> over India's North-West Frontier Province. [...] More controversially, in early 1920, he wrote that the RAF could even suppress [...] "industrial disturbances or risings" [...] in Britain itself. [...] The idea was not to Churchill's liking and he told Trenchard not to refer to this proposal again.|$|E
