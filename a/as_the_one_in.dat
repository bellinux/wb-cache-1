5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

The tomb of Li Xian features real fully stone doors, a tomb trend apparent in the Han and Western Jin dynasties that became more common {{by the time of the}} Northern Qi dynasty. The stylistic stone door of Lou Rui's tomb of 570 closely resembles that of Tang stone doors, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Li Xian's tomb.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the floods, the NWS utilized enhanced radar technology and computer models to better forecast flood events, {{as well as}} improved communications. Whereas in 1985, three different NWS agencies issued different warnings for the area affected in southwest Virginia, the NWS has since restructured to allow local offices, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Roanoke, to directly issue watches and warnings. The NWS also implemented increased flood prediction techniques across West Virginia {{in the years after}} the floods. As many West Virginia counties lacked a full-time emergency management director at the time, funding from the NWS provided 24‑hour weather radios for every county by the year 1987.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century the pursuit of {{witchcraft}} was largely {{taken over by the}} kirk sessions, and was often used to attack superstitious and Catholic practices in Scottish society. Most of the accused, 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the witch hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women. The most intense witch hunt was in 1661–62, which involved 664 named witches in four counties. From this point prosecutions began to decline, as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. There may also have been a growing scepticism, and with relative peace and stability the economic and social tensions that contributed to accusation may have reduced. There were occasional local outbreaks such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> East Lothian in 1678 and Paisley in 1697. The last recorded executions were in 1706, and the last trial was in 1727. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Witchcraft Act in 1736.|$|E
5|$|Several {{thousand}} animal {{bones were}} discovered in Mummy Cave. While {{the large majority of}} the bones could not be identified, researchers at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) were able to determine the biological origins of over two thousand bones. As at many other archeological sites in the region, significant numbers of Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis) and deer from the genus Odocoileus were identified. Of particular interest to biologists was the much larger number of sheep than deer: eighty-eight sheep and fifteen deer were identified. Such a prevalence of sheep over deer is highly unusual for archeological sites in the region, because deer are equally or more plentiful in areas such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> which Mummy Cave is located. This anomaly has led researchers at UTEP to propose that the site was used as a home base for hunters to operate at higher altitudes.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines {{were unable}} to respond {{effectively}} to the Muslim advance in Africa, because the two decades between 695 and 715 were a period of great domestic turmoil. They did react with raids of their own in the East, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> 709 against Egypt which captured the local admiral, but they also were aware of a coming onslaught: as Caliph al-Walid I (705–715) readied his forces for a renewed assault against Constantinople, Emperor Anastasios II (713–715) prepared the capital, and mounted an unsuccessful pre-emptive strike against the Muslim naval preparations. Anastasios was soon overthrown by Theodosius III (715–717), who in turn was replaced, just as the Muslim army was advancing through Anatolia, by Leo III the Isaurian (717–741). It was Leo III who faced the second and final Arab siege of Constantinople. The use of Greek fire, which devastated the Arab fleet, was again instrumental in the Byzantine victory, while a harsh winter and Bulgar attacks further sapped the besiegers' strength.|$|E
5|$|The National Road, {{the first}} road {{funded by the}} U.S. federal government, was {{authorized}} by the United States Congress in 1806, and ran from Cumberland, Maryland, to Vandalia, Illinois. Construction started in 1811, and by 1837 the road reached Vandalia. Many sites from the National Road remain along Alt US40, in particular the LaVale toll gate house, built in 1836. Following {{the completion of the}} National Road in 1837, the federal government ceded the road to the states to operate as a toll road, and toll gate houses such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> LaVale were built along its path in preparation for the transfer. Tolls continued to be collected along the National Road at the LaVale toll house until the late nineteenth century. The LaVale toll house is {{the first of its kind}} to be built along the National Road, and it is the last standing toll house along the National Road in Maryland. The LaVale toll house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The breed was {{originally}} a multipurpose horse, used for agriculture, cavalry and pulling diligences (a type of carriage). Because {{of a lack}} of support from a breeding syndicate, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> existence for the Mérens horse, once the need for a multipurpose breed declined, the population of the Castillonnais dwindled. Many horses were crossbred with draft horses, and the breed almost became extinct. The intervention of a group of supporters in 1980 saved the breed from extinction, and in 1992 L'Association Pyrénéenne Ariégeoise du Cheval Castillonnais (the Ariege Pyrenees Association of Castillonnais Horses) was formed, with support from several French government agencies and stud farms. Annually, in August, the association holds a small competition and sale for the breed in Castillon-en-Couserans, which also includes inspections to register horses for the breed studbook.|$|E

5|$|These suggest that, {{after the}} sacking of Jerusalem by AntiochusIV in 168BCE, {{at least part}} of the City of David to the south of the Temple Mount was rebuilt as a {{fortified}} Hellenistic quarter of Jerusalem. More than a citadel, it was a Macedonian colony where Jewish renegades and supporters of the new regime lived. This is also supported by archaeological evidence, including Rhodian amphorae handles and 18 box graves found on the eastern slope of the City of David. The latter are dated to the early 2nd century CE, and are uncharacteristic of Second Temple era Jewish burial practices, yet similar to other known Hellenistic graveyards such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Acre (Ptolemais).|$|E
