500|$|In 1934, Mitchell and {{the design}} staff decided to use a semi-elliptical wing shape to solve two {{conflicting}} requirements. The wing needed to be thin, to avoid creating too much drag, while still able to house a retractable undercarriage, plus armament and ammunition. An elliptical planform is the most efficient aerodynamic shape for an untwisted wing, leading to the lowest amount of induced drag. The ellipse was skewed so that the centre of pressure, which occurs at the quarter-chord position, aligned with the main spar, thus preventing the wings from twisting. Mitchell has sometimes been accused of copying the wing shape of the Heinkel He 70, which first flew in 1932; but as Beverley Shenstone, the aerodynamicist on Mitchell's team, explained: [...] "Our wing was much thinner and had quite a different section {{to that of the}} Heinkel. In any case it would have been simply <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> to have copied a wing shape from an aircraft designed for an entirely different purpose." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{reporter}} from the Sunday Mercury said [...] "What {{do we think}} might happen to a car overloaded with teenagers? It crashes, of course, and Sophie is badly injured." [...] Carena Crawford from All About Soap commented [...] "Wow, Neighbours {{was more than a}} little bit dramatic today with the big car crash putting Sophie's life in danger – will she survive?" [...] The writer went on to say that the accident would have [...] "far-reaching consequences for everybody" [...] and tried to work out who was to blame, before adding [...] "Whoever's fault it is, we can't wait to see what happens next!" [...] A reporter for the TVTimes stated [...] "With more road accidents in this patch of Oz than anywhere else in the world, Sophie is <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> when she piles into Chris's car, which is already overloaded with teenagers thanks to Andrew egging him on." [...] Dianne Butler, writing for news.com.au, thought the police did [...] "a half-baked investigation into the car crash", enabling Paul to sue Chris. The storyline was included in the Inside Soap Yearbook 2013 as one of [...] "The best bits of September". It was also named [...] "Crash of the month". The crash was nominated for Best Storyline in Digital Spy's end of year reader poll for 2012, it received 5.5% of the vote.|$|E

2500|$|Tate's {{version is}} about 800 lines shorter than Shakespeare's. Some of Shakespeare's {{original}} lines are left intact; some are modified slightly, or given to different speakers. In {{the words of}} Stanley Wells, Tate [...] "rather <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> by retaining as much of Shakespeare as he did, thereby inviting odious comparisons with verse that he wrote himself." [...] But Wells {{also points out that}} at the time that Tate was making his alterations, Shakespeare was not regarded as a master whose works could not be touched, but [...] "as a dramatist whose works, however admirable, required adaptation to fit them for the new theatrical and social circumstances of the time, as well as to changes in taste." ...|$|R

5000|$|No zuo no die (...) is a Chinese {{internet}} meme.

60|$|Archie, left alone, began for {{the first}} time to have serious doubts. He had allowed himself to be swayed by Mr. Sherriff's {{magnetic}} personality, but now that the other had removed himself he began to wonder if he had been entirely wise to lend his sympathy and co-operation to the scheme. He had never had intimate dealings with a snake before, but he had kept silkworms as a child, and there had been the deuce of a lot of fuss and unpleasantness over them. Getting into the salad and what-not. Something seemed to tell him that he was <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> with a loud voice, but he had given his word and he supposed he would have to go through with it.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{see that}} I {{could have done}} any more. I had put {{the whole thing in}} a {{nutshell}} for him. You would have thought he'd have seen the point, and that it would have made him brace up and get a hold on himself. But no. Off he went again in the same old way. I gave up arguing with him. I had {{a good deal of time}} on my hands, but not enough to amount to anything when it was a question of reforming dear old Bobbie by argument. If you see a man <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> and insisting on getting it, the only thing to do is to stand by and wait till it comes to him. After that you may get a chance. But till then there's nothing to be done. But I thought a lot about him.|$|E

6000|$|I {{was still}} engaged upon my breakfast when I heard {{the clatter of}} dishes and the landlady's {{footfall}} as she passed toward her new lodger's room.

[...] she cried, [...] "and <b>asking</b> your pardon <b>for</b> <b>troubling</b> you, but I'm feared o' the young leddy, sir; she is not in her room." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{rest of the}} {{flotilla}} {{that the}} four destroyers belonged to had their own adventures later. One of them, chasing or being chased, saw Goblin out of control just before Goblin and Shaitan locked, and narrowly escaped adding herself to that triple collision. Another loosed a couple of torpedoes at the enemy ships who were attacking Gehenna, which, perhaps, accounts for the anxiety of the enemy {{to break away from}} that hornets' nest as soon as possible. Half a dozen or so of them ran into four German battleships, which they set about torpedoing at ranges varying from half a mile to a mile and a half. It was <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> and they got it; but they got in return at least one big ship, and the same observant battleship of ours who identified Eblis's bird reported three satisfactory explosions in half an hour, followed by a glare that lit up all the sky. One of the flotilla, closing on what she thought was the smoke of a sister in difficulties, found herself well in among the four battleships. [...] "It was too late to get away," [...] she says, so she attacked, fired her torpedo, was caught up in the glare of a couple of searchlights, and pounded to pieces in five minutes, not even her rafts being left. She went down with her colours flying, having fought to the last available gun.|$|E

[...] She adds that [...] "with each blow that life delivers [...] bobs back up again, almost <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> more <b>trouble,</b> more pain, more suffering." [...] Dot is renowned for being a hypochondriac, her Christian faith and quoting from the Bible.

According to Kingsley, [...] "nothing shakes Dot's view that the world is good because the creator made it so. Her faith sustains her through the most appalling ordeals." [...] The character once expressed {{part of the reason for}} her faith on-screen in 2000, commenting to a vicar, [...] "I couldn't manage without my faith, not with the life I've had"; former executive producer of EastEnders, John Yorke, has stated that this is his favourite line of EastEnders' entire existence. Author Antony Slide has noted that Dot's religious beliefs have given her solace, but has given her an excuse to be prejudiced against her neighbours, and to deal with the criminal antics of her wayward son. He described her as a [...] "simpleminded woman whom one loved to hate".|$|R
