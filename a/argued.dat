5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully <b>argued</b> that the Gospel of John has elements {{in common with}} Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, <b>argued</b> that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown have <b>argued</b> that the pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.|$|E
5|$|American philosopher Louis Pojman has cited Pietism, {{political}} philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, {{the modern}} debate between rationalism and empiricism, {{and the influence}} of natural law as influences on the development of Kant's ethics. Other philosophers have <b>argued</b> that Kant's parents and his teacher, Martin Knutzen, influenced his ethics. Those influenced by Kantian ethics include philosopher Jürgen Habermas, political philosopher John Rawls, and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel criticised Kant for not providing specific enough detail in his moral theory to affect decision-making and for denying human nature. German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer <b>argued</b> that ethics should attempt to describe how people behave and criticised Kant for being prescriptive. Michael Stocker has <b>argued</b> that acting out of duty can diminish other moral motivations such as friendship, while Marcia Baron has defended the theory by arguing that duty does not diminish other motivations. The Catholic Church has criticised Kant's ethics as contradictory and regards Christian ethics as more compatible with virtue ethics.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case.

40|$|Moral {{reasoning}} is as fallible as reasoning {{in any other}} cognitive domain, but we often behave {{as if it were}} not.

My argument combines work in metaethics and moral intuitionism with recent developments in epistemology. I <b>argue</b> against any demands for deep self-sufficiency in moral reasoning. Instead, I <b>argue</b> that we need to take into account significant socially sourced information, especially as a check for failures on our own moral intuitions and reasoning. First, I <b>argue</b> for an epistemically plausible version of moral intuitionism, based on recent work in epistemic entitlement and epistemic warrant. Second, I <b>argue</b> that getting clear on the epistemic basis shows the defeasibility of moral judgment. Third, I <b>argue</b> the existence of moral disagreement is a reason to reduce our certainty in moral judgment. Fourth, I <b>argue</b> that this effect is not a violation of norms of autonomy for moral judgment...|$|R

5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He <b>argued</b> that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne <b>argued</b> that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and <b>argued</b> that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{contributing}} to the empirical turn in deliberative theory, by analysing the presence of <b>arguing</b> and bargaining in the working groups of the Council of the EU. To what extent is <b>arguing</b> an important mode of decision-making in the Council, what circumstances make <b>arguing</b> {{more likely to occur}} and what types of actors are most inclined to <b>argue?</b> The paper uses survey data on representatives from all EU member states. It also proposes a solution to one particularly difficult problem facing researchers who try to measure deliberation empirically, namely the distinction between <b>arguing</b> and cooperative forms of bargaining. It <b>argues</b> that the key for operationalising this distinction lies in studying the motivations for giving reasons. The results indicate that <b>arguing</b> is indeed common in the Council working groups, but also that there is substantial variation between different working groups and types of actors. Most <b>arguing</b> is found in intergovernmental policy areas and by the most powerful and well-connected actors. An important general argument coming out of these findings is that actors are {{more likely to engage in}} <b>arguing</b> when they feel confident and in control of the decision-making situation. Increasing the pressure by raising the degree of coercion and the risks involved with losing the outcome of the deliberations tend to draw the actors towards a bargaining mode.
