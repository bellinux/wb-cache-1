50|$|<b>Amoscanate</b> (INN), {{also known}} as nithiocyamine, is an {{experimental}} anthelmintic agent of the arylisothiocyanate class which {{was found to be}} highly effective in animals against the four major species of schistosomes which infect humans, and is also highly active against hookworm infection. However, significant liver toxicity was seen in lab animals at higher doses. The ether analogue of <b>amoscanate,</b> nitroscanate, is used in veterinary medicine as an anthelmintic.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{in vitro}} studies {{indicate}} that intestinal bacteria convert <b>amoscanate</b> (4 -nitro- 4 '-isothiocyanodiphenylamine), an antischistosomal drug, to a potent mutagen. The present study indicates that the implantation of germfree mice with Streptococcus equinus, isolated from the small intestine of conventional mice, restores the mutagenic activation of <b>amoscanate</b> in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The BH {{strain of}} Schistosoma mansoni {{was found to}} be highly susceptible, to hy cant hone (1 x 80 mg/kg), {{oxamniquine}} (1 x 100 mg/kg) niridazole (5 x 100 mg/kg), praziquantel (1 x 100 mg/kg), oltipraz (5 x 125 mg/kg) and <b>amoscanate</b> (1 x 300 mg/kg) and is therefore a good reference strain for chemotherapeutic trials. By contrast, the MPR- 1 strain was shown to have developed resistance to oxamniquine without ever having been dosed with oxamniquine. Other oxamniquine/hycanthone resistant strains were shown to have maintained their resistance and a strain believed to be partially resistant to oltipraz was evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The BALB/C mouse {{infected}} with Brugia pahangi has been evaluated {{as a model}} for the selection of filaricidal compounds with activity against immature worms. Mice were infected by the intraperitoneal inoculation of 50 infective larvae and candidate compounds were administered by the intraperitoneal (i. p.), subcutaneous or oral route once daily from day 4 to day 8 post infection. Animals were examined on days 29 to 32 post infection. Variation in the larval recoveries from undrugged mice within and between experimental groups limited the value of drug assessments based upon percentage worm recoveries. The infection rate of undrugged mice was 85 % over-all, range 60 to 100 %. Using the infection rate of drugged v. undrugged animals as the criterion of activity the test has been evaluated with a series of standard nematicidal compounds. Levamisole and the benzimidazole carbamates, mebendazole, flubendazole and fenbendazole given i. p. at 10 mg/kg daily were active in this screen whilst DEC, DEC-N-oxide, ivermectin, <b>amoscanate,</b> metrifonate and suramin were inactive at the dosages tested. No retardation of growth or morphological abnormalities were observed in worms from the drugged mice...|$|E
40|$|Schistosomiasis, a {{grave and}} {{debilitating}} disease of socioeconomic importance, is increasing in incidence despite concerted {{efforts to control}} and contain the disease in all the endemic areas. While a multipronged method of control using health education, sanitation and snail control has been used, chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis play {{the most important and}} crucial role in containing/preventing the transmission of the disease. Schistosomicides such as antimonials were introduced, as early as the 1990 s as the drugs of choice and continued to be used until the early 1960 s. The antimonials were administered intravenously, and produced severe side effects; the various variables that determined their effects at the site of action made their application difficult and adversely affected their use in large scale chemotherapy. The antimonials were then replaced by hycanthone and lucanthone which were administered intramuscularly. These drugs produced immediate side effects such as hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal disturbances, and were consequently withdrawn. It was then decided that the alternative was to produce synthetic drugs that could be administered orally. Niridazole, oxamniquine, and metrifonate were introduced as schistosomicidal agents, with drugs like oltipraz and <b>amoscanate</b> still at clinical trial phase. Therapeutic doses of drugs like hycanthone, niridazole and <b>amoscanate</b> have been found to cause many major side effects. A significant advance in the control of schistosomiasis chemotherapy is the introduction of a relatively safe, effective, broad spectrum oral helminthic agent, praziquantel. Studies have also shown that oxamniquine is as effective as praziquantel in eliminating intestinal S. mansoni infection, and metrifonate is as effective as praziquantel in eliminating urinary S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections. Praziquantel {{has been found to be}} effective in treating S. haematobium infections compared with metrifonate and more effective in treating S. mansoni infection when compared with oxamniquine. Because the drug is effective even when treating advanced hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, with few side effects, praziquantel is currently the drug of choice for the treatment of any kind of schistosomiasis. The only limitation is the cost which restricts its use in many developing countries. While effective, safe drugs for mass chemotherapy are being developed, the problem of therapeutic failure and drug resistance is being reported from certain developing countries. Under these circumstances, alternative drugs must be resorted to. Mass treatment, a crucial goal in the eventual control of schistosomiasis, awaits a well-tolerated and nontoxic drug that will ultimately prove to be effective where cure is definite. Until such a time, while eradication of the disease is a near impossibility, reducing the intensity of infection can ultimately reduce morbidity and even mortality.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} 60 -year {{review of}} antischistosomal drug discovery and development {{research in the}} People's Republic of China (P. R. China) is presented. In the 1950 s, three antimonials were developed, which, compared to potassium antimony tartrate-the treatment of choice against schistosomiasis at the time-showed equal efficacy but lower toxicity when administered orally or intramuscularly. Activity of furapromidum against Schistosoma japonicum {{was reported in the}} early 1960 s, and this drug became the first non-antimonial used in clinical treatment of schistosomiasis japonica. Subsequently, two additional nitrofuran derivatives (furadiamine and fuvinazole) were investigated in the laboratory and clinically. In the late 1960 s, niridazole and <b>amoscanate</b> were developed by western scientists, which encouraged Chinese researchers to synthesise and further modify the chemical structures of these compounds. However, the modified compounds were less efficacious but similarly toxic, which impeded their further development. The advent of the safe, highly efficacious broad-spectrum antischistosomal drug praziquantel, in the mid- 1970 s, eventually resulted in a change of the global schistosomiasis control strategy from a multi-pronged transmission control approach to drug-based morbidity control. Numerous studies were carried out in P. R. China to further the understanding of efficacy, mechanism of action and safety of praziquantel against S. japonicum. Efforts have also been made to develop antischistosomal drugs from Chinese traditional medicine, and research with cucurbitin (an amino acid isolated from pumpkin seeds), among other products, showed interesting in vitro and in vivo activities against S. japonicum. In the 1990 s, the artemisinins-originally reserved for malaria treatment-were developed as 'chemoprophylactic' agents against S. japonicum, which in turn led to a series of new developments of artemisinins and related compounds as broad-spectrum antischistosomal and anthelminthic therapies...|$|E
