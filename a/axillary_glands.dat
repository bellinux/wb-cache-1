40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that the risk of axillary osmidrosis is governed by a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 538 G>A in human ATP-binding cassette C 11 (ABCC 11) gene. However, little data are available for the expression of ABCC 11 protein in human <b>axillary</b> apocrine <b>glands</b> that produce apocrine sweat—a source of odor from the armpits. To determine the effect of the non-synonymous SNP ABCC 11 538 G>A (G 180 R) on the ABCC 11 in vivo, we generated transiently ABCC 11 -expressing transgenic mice with adenovirus vector, and examined the protein levels of each ABCC 11 in the mice with immunoblotting using an anti-ABCC 11 antibody we have generated in the present study. Furthermore, we examined the expression of ABCC 11 protein in human <b>axillary</b> apocrine <b>glands</b> extracted from <b>axillary</b> osmidrosis patients carrying each ABCC 11 genotype: 538 GG, GA, and AA. Analyses of transiently ABCC 11 -expressing transgenic mice showed that ABCC 11 538 G>A diminishes the ABCC 11 protein levels in vivo. Consistently, ABCC 11 protein was detected in the human <b>axillary</b> apocrine <b>glands</b> of the 538 GG homozygote or 538 GA heterozygote, not in the 538 AA homozygote.

40|$|The <b>axillary</b> <b>gland</b> of {{the marine}} turtle lies in the angle formed by the {{carapace}} and plastron. The gland is compound tubular and the secretions released by the various acini are conveyed to the exterior via a large excretory duct lined by stratified squamous non-keratinised epithelium. The main secretory areas are lined by holocrine cells, i. e. they degenerate on discharging their contents. The epithelium lining the short ducts which carry the holocrine secretions to the large excretory duct is invaginated regularly giving rise to shallow intraepithelial acini. The cells lining these acini are of two types, granular and mitochondrial. These cells communicate via complex infoldings of their lateral cell walls. The granular cells produce an acidic mucosubstance. The holocrine regions are embedded in {{a large amount of}} striated muscle and are separated from the latter by a band of collagen containing variable numbers of melanocytes. The short secretory ducts and large excretory duct have less muscle associated with them but there is a corresponding increase in the volume of collagen. When handled, the adult turtle ejects a milky fluid via the plastral pore. This pungent secretion is weakly acidic...|$|R

40|$|Breast cancer remains by far {{the most}} {{frequent}} cancer in women, for that matter it is the most frequent cancer in Belgium affecting both men and women. At the moment, more than 9000 cases are detected annually. The development of screening allows us, fortunately, to detect lesions and stages earlier, in that way locoregional treatmenthas considerably evolved. Since the seventies, radical mastectomy, which consists of the removal ofthe mammary gland, the <b>axillary</b> <b>glands</b> (lymph nodes) and sometimes the pectoral muscle, has been progressively replaced by conservatory treatment. This consists of a wide excision of the tumour with a safety resection margin, followed by a complete removal of the <b>axillary</b> <b>glands</b> (lymph nodes) then followed by a course of external radiotherapy testing treated six weeks daily on a five days week basis. During the nineties, in cases with certain precise indications, the complete axillary gland removal has been replaced by the removal of the first gland chain (lymph node chain) called "sentinel nodes". This technique avoids all morbidity associated to the complete lymph node removal. Finally, very recently, the classic external radiotherapy has been replaced by partial radiotherapy delivered exclusively in a few minutes during the surgical operation. Therefore, we can offer patients with early stage lesions a locoregional treatment carried out in one to two hours with an in-stay hospitalisation of two nights. This new technique manifestly offers a better locoregional control of the illness and very likely enhances (improves) their chances of recovery. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

Following recurrent relapse after botulinum toxin (BOTOX®) injections for axillary hyperhidrosis bilateral <b>axillary</b> sweat <b>gland</b> curettage was performed with immediate procedural success. At 6 month follow-up recurrent hyperhidrosis was reported affecting both axillae. A starch-iodine test showed a rim of persisting sweating at the periphery of both axillae.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The classic {{concept of}} <b>axillary</b> <b>glands</b> differentiates between eccrine glands, {{producing}} abundant clear, nonodorous sweat; and apocrine glands, excreting {{small amounts of}} turbid, odorous milky sweat. A third type of sweat glands, the "apoeccrine" glands, were recently identified. To define {{the different types of}} sweat glands and their location and number, the authors carried out a prospective histologic study on adult human axillary skin, including various immunohistochemical markers. METHODS: Forty-three consecutive Caucasian, subjectively normhidrotic patients, who underwent a surgical procedure in the axilla unrelated to the <b>axillary</b> <b>glands,</b> were included in the study. For verification of normhidrosis, the gravimetric test was carried out by measuring the amount of sweat secretion per minute. Then, a 1 x 1 -cm measuring piece of skin and subcutaneous tissue was excised in the apex of the axilla, divided into three samples [...] altogether, 129 samples [...] and processed for histologic examination. RESULTS: In the dermis, the authors found only very few eccrine (average, 0. 3 gland/cm in only 12 percent of all patients) and apocrine glands (average, 0. 1 gland/cm in only 4. 7 percent of patients), and no apoeccrine glands in any patient. In the subcutaneous tissue, the mean number of glands per centimeter squared was 10 for the eccrine glands, nine for the apocrine glands, and six for the apoeccrine glands. CONCLUSIONS: In the authors' Caucasian subjects, all or most of the sweat glands were found in the subcutaneous tissue near the border to the dermis and not in the dermis. For extremely hyperfunctioning sweat glands, the authors recommend less radical surgical methods, with the preservation of skin, based on the knowledge that most glands are localized in the subcutaneous tissue...|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{composition}} of secretions of skin glands in hominoid primates have apparently not been analyzed previously, {{except for the}} axillary secretions of humans. This paper reports on skin secretions of siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus), a species of gibbons or small apes from Southeast Asia. Secretions were collected and radioimmunoassays (RIA) were carried out in order to check {{for the presence of}} the following three steroid hormones: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), Androstenedione, and Testosterone. This study presents first evidence that high hormone concentrations occurring especially in the sternal area cannot be the result of a simple filtration of hormones out of the blood plasma, but must be the result of a more complex accumulation process. Particularly androstenedione appears to be highly concentrated in the sternal gland. Our findings further support the view that sternal glands in gibbons and <b>axillary</b> <b>glands</b> in humans and African apes may fulfil similar functions, and shed some light on the origin of the axillary organ. We speculate that the accumulation of steroid hormones in siamang skin glands {{may play a role in}} olfactory communication...|$|E

In the electron microscope sections, VIP-like immunoreactivity was localized to the nerve terminals containing large, dense-cored vesicles 100 – 140 nm in size. No synapses were found, however positively stained nerve terminals were located immediately outside the basement membrane but close to the glandular secretory and myoepithelial cells, blood vessels, and occasionally the mast cells.

50|$|Plague {{occurred}} in Russia in 1877-1889 {{in rural areas}} near the Ural Mountains and the Caspian Sea. Efforts in hygiene and patient isolation reduced {{the spread of the}} disease, with approximately 420 deaths in the region. Significantly, the region of Vetlianka in this area is near a population of the bobak marmot, a small rodent considered a very dangerous plague reservoir. The last significant Russian outbreak of Plague was in Siberia in 1910 after sudden demand for marmot skins (a substitute for sable) increased the price by 400 percent. The traditional hunters would not hunt a sick Marmot and it was taboo to eat the fat from under the arm (the <b>axillary</b> lymphatic <b>gland</b> that often harboured the plague) so outbreaks tended to be confined to single individuals. The price increase, however, attracted thousands of Chinese hunters from Manchuria who not only caught the sick animals but also ate the fat, which was considered a delicacy. The plague spread from the hunting grounds to the terminus of the Chinese Eastern Railway and then followed the track for 2,700 km. The plague lasted 7 months and killed 60,000 people.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundAxillary osmidrosis is {{characterized}} by unpleasant odors originating from the <b>axillary</b> apocrine <b>glands,</b> resulting in psychosocial stress. The main treatment modality is apocrine gland removal. Until now, of the various surgical techniques have sometimes caused serious complications. We describe herein the favorable outcomes of a new method for ablating apocrine glands by minimal subdermal shaving using sclerotherapy with absolute ethanol. MethodsA total of 12 patients underwent the procedure. The severity of osmidrosis was evaluated before surgery. Conventional subdermal shaving was performed on one side (control group) and ablation by means of minimal subdermal shaving and absolute ethanol {{on the other side}} (study group). Postoperative outcomes were compared between the study and control groups. ResultsThe length of time to removal of the drain was 1 day shorter in the study group than in the control group. There were no serious complications, such as hematoma or seroma, in either group, but flap margin necrosis and flap desquamation occurred in the control group, and were successfully managed with conservative treatment. Six months after surgery, we and our patients were satisfied with the outcomes. ConclusionsSclerotherapy using absolute ethanol combined with minimal subdermal shaving may be useful for the treatment of axillary osmidrosis. It can reduce the incidence of seroma and hematoma and allow the skin flap to adhere to its recipient site. It can degrade and ablate the remaining apocrine glands and eliminate causative organisms. Furthermore, since this technique is relatively simple, it takes less time than the conventional method...|$|R
40|$|The <b>axillary</b> <b>glands</b> of C. macrocephalus {{are large}} sacs of {{epidermal}} elements. Each gland {{is surrounded by}} a loose connective tissue sheath. This sheath is continuous with dermal intrusions into the peripheral portion of the gland which is thus partially partitioned into pockets. The periphery of the gland and the dermal partitions are lined with a basal epithelial layer from which supporting cells and immature secretory cells are proliferated. Supporting cells separate the secretory cells from one another. Mucin-producing cells are rare in the greater portion of the gland mass. Immature secretory cells possess haematoxylinophilic cytoplasm and are binucleate. Later, their cytoplasm becomes eosinophilic and the nuclei disappear. Their cell walls degenerate and the gland cells become liberated as spheres in the central region of the gland. The spheres rupture, releasing the secretory product. The gland cell cytoplasm contains principally protein and 3 -indolyl derivatives. Fresh crude axillary gland secretion and also freeze dried axillary gland secretion possess marked activity on isolated barnacle muscle preparations, causing tetanic contracture at concentrations in the organ bath as low as 10 μg per ml and 3 μg per ml respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of the secretory cell {{of human}} <b>axillary</b> <b>glands</b> {{has been described}} in detail by several authors. However, evidence about the mechanism of secretion in these glands remains largely theoretical. The present study was undertaken to determine whether pharmacologic stimulation would produce more precise information about this process. The results indicate that after epinephrine injection, the distribution, number, and morphology of cytoplasmic organelles do not change significantly. Apical cell membrane changes were seen most consistently, but not universally, at 4 hr and 24 hr after epinephrine injection. The dispersion of particles contained in the secretory granules was most clearly seen 10 min and 4 hr after injection and may occur {{in connection with the}} cytoplasmic filaments that are closely associated with the secretory granules. These filaments may {{play a major role in}} directing the activities of the secretory cells. Two discrete types of granules contain secretory particles: a third type of cytoplasmic inclusion is the initial formation of one type of secretory granule. Whereas mitochondria, which according to some authors are transformed into secretory granules, occasionally become enlarged when they occupy apical sites, no evidence of such secretory transformation was detected. These observation indicate that the mechanism of apocrine secretion is an extremely subtle process which can be clearly understand only with improved technology...|$|E
30|$|Holt–Oram {{syndrome}} (HOS, OMIM 142900) is {{a genetic}} condition characterized by radial ray hypoplasia and congenital heart defect {{often associated with}} progressive arrhythmias and dysmorphic features (Holt and Oram 1960; Harris and Osborne 1966). The syndrome is usually caused by point mutations or intragenic deletions of the TBX 5 gene, however in rare cases it results from larger deletions encompassing the entire TBX 5 coding sequence (Basson et al. 1997; Gruenauer-Kloevekorn and Froster 2003; Newbury-Ecob et al. 1996). Ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS, OMIM 181450) is a congenital malformation syndrome characterized by the ulnar hypoplasia of the upper limbs, usually comprising absent or hypoplastic 5 th and/or 4 th fingers, absent or hypoplastic ulna, underdevelopment of the apocrine glands resulting in the dysfunction of the mammary and <b>axillary</b> <b>glands,</b> hypogonadism with genital anomalies and delayed puberty in males, obesity, absence of axillary hair and tooth abnormalities (Schinzel 1987; Pallister et al. 1976). UMS {{also referred to as}} Schinzel syndrome or Pallister ulnar-mammary syndrome can result from either point mutations or deletions of the TBX 3 gene (Bamshad et al. 1997; Linden et al. 2009). Microdeletions of the 12 q 24.21 region comprising the two neighbouring TBX 5 and TBX 3 genes lead to the phenotype characterized by a combination of the clinical symptoms associated with both disorders (Borozdin et al. 2006; Alby et al. 2013; Bogarapu et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|GCDFP- 15, a {{glycoprotein}} {{identified in}} the cyst fluid of cystic breast disease, {{is considered to be}} a marker of apocrine differentiation. Studies on GCDFP- 15 localization in adult normal tissues are lacking, and no information on GCDFP- 15 expression during fetal development has been reported. We investigated GCDFP- 15 expression in a large series of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal human adult and fetal tissues using the monoclonal antibody BRST- 2. In normal adult tissues GCDFP- 15 expression was found in all apocrine, lacrimal, ceruminous and Moll's glands and in numerous serous cells of the submandibular, sublingual and minor salivary glands. The serous cells of nasal and bronchial glands were also positive; parotid and laryngeal glands showed rare immunoreactive cells. GCDFP- 15 -positive cells were observed in all cutaneous eccrine glands from different body sites. In fetal tissues immunoreactivity was observed in numerous acinous cells of all tracheal, bronchial and submandibular salivary glands. GCDFP- 15 positivity was identified in numerous cells of all <b>axillary</b> sweat <b>glands</b> and in rare cells of some sweat glands of the thorax, abdomen, back, leg and arm. In both apocrine and nonapocrine glands GCDFP- 15 was always localized in the secretory component. These data suggest that GCDFP- 15 is a glandular differentiation marker associated with apocrine secretion; that it is expressed in glands that have phylogenetic origins in common with apocrine glands (submandibular salivary and submucosal bronchial glands); and that eccrine cutaneous glands express GCDFP- 15 and thus might be referred to as mixed apocrine-eccrine glands. GCDFP- 15 is expressed during fetal development and may represent a common marker of embryologically linked glandular structures...|$|R
40|$|Genetic factors {{within the}} major {{histocompatibility}} locus (MHC) {{have been shown}} to influence body odors in mice. MHC-dependent preferences for body odors also have been reported in humans. The <b>axillary</b> <b>glands</b> are a key odor-forming organ in humans, and it is assumed that they provide behaviorally relevant odors. Volatile carboxylic acids are the most diverse class of known axillary odorants, and the pattern of these acids is genetically determined. These acids are released by an N(alpha) -acyl-glutamine-aminoacylase present in skin bacteria. We tested a hypothesis concerning whether or not the inherited individual-specific patterns of odorous acids are strongly influenced by polymorphic genes in the MHC. Axilla secretions were collected in 12 families, comprising 3 to 6 siblings, who had been typed for HLA-A, B, and DRB 1 loci. The samples were treated with N(alpha) -acyl-glutamine-aminoacylase, and the methyl esters of the released acids were analyzed with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToF MS). The patterns of the analytes were compared by distance analysis. The distance was lowest between samples taken from the same individual, confirming the presence of donor-specific odor-prints. A much higher distance was observed between siblings, but there were no differences among siblings sharing none, one, or both HLA-A,B,DRB 1 haplotypes. By applying principal component analysis, a clear clustering of samples taken from one individual was confirmed, but no clustering was observed for siblings sharing identical HLA-A,B,DRB 1 alleles. Thus, the genetically determined pattern of N-acyl-glutamine conjugates of volatile carboxylic acids, secreted in the human axilla, appears not to be determined by genes residing in the HLA complex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Two {{types of}} cerumen occur in humans: the wet type with brownish, sticky earwax, and the dry type {{with a lack}} of or reduced ceruminous secretion. The wet type is common in populations of European and African origin, while the dry type is {{frequently}} seen in Eastern Asian populations. An association between axillary odor and the wet-type earwax was first identified approximately 70 years ago. The data were based on a phenotypical analysis of the two phenotypes among the Japanese by a researcher or by self-declaration of the subjects examined, and were not obtained using definite diagnostic methods. Recently, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs 17822931) of the ABCC 11 gene as the determinant of the earwax types. In the present study, to determine whether the SNP can serve as a diagnostic marker for axillary osmidrosis (AO), we examined genotypes at rs 17822931 in 79 Japanese AO individuals. AO was defined here as a clinical condition of individuals with a deep anxiety regarding axillary odor and had undergone the removal of bilateral axillary apocrine glands. Results A comparison of the frequencies of genotypes at rs 17822931 in the 79 AO individuals and in 161 Japanese from the general population showed that AO was strongly associated with the wet earwax genotype. A total of 78 (98. 7 %) of 79 AO patients had either the GG or GA genotype, while these genotypes were observed in 35. 4 % (57 / 161) of the subjects from the general population (p - 24, by Fisher's exact test). Conclusion The strong association between the wet-earwax associated ABCC 11 - genotypes (GG and GA) and AO identified in this study indicates that the genotypes are good markers for the diagnosis of AO. In addition, these results suggest that having the allele G is a prerequisite for the axillary odor expression. In other words, the ABCC 11 protein {{may play a role in}} the excretory function of the axillary apocrine gland. Together, these results suggest that when an AO individual visiting a hospital is diagnosed with dry-type earwax by ABCC 11 -genotyping, surgical removal of their <b>axillary</b> <b>glands</b> may not be indicated. </p...|$|E
