5|$|The name of {{the fourth}} head as Kapila is {{interpreted}} in two ways. Taking the literal meaning of kapila as red, it is interpreted as meaning fierce or angry. The epithet kapila {{is associated with the}} fire god Agni and the solar deity Surya in early canonical texts. Another theory relates to Vishnu's sage avatar and founder of Samkhya philosophy, Kapila, who is described as having a wrathful nature <b>and</b> <b>cursing</b> the sons of Sagara to turn into ashes for insulting him. The head-dress jatajuta is typical of Brahmin sages like Kapila. The Agni Purana also describes the icon having four heads, without describing the nature of each. The iconographical treatises Aparajitapriccha and the Rupamandana mention that the fourth head is Shri (Lakshmi - the wife of Vishnu) and Stri (female) respectively, however no sculptures with a fourth female head have been discovered. The back face may be carved on the halo behind the central three heads in low relief or in a space between the halo.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} of the meic Somairle to establish the Benedictines on Iona completely contrasted the ecclesiastical actions of Somairle himself, and provoked a prompt and violent response from Colum Cille's familia. According to the Annals of Ulster, after Cellach, Abbot of Iona built the new monastery in 1204, a large force of Irishmen, led by the Bishops of Tyrone and Tirconell and the Abbots of Derry and Inishowen, made landfall on Iona and burnt the new buildings to the ground. The sentiments of the familia may well be preserved in a contemporary poem which portrays Colum Cille lamenting the violation of his rights, <b>and</b> <b>cursing</b> the meic Somairle. Unfortunately for the familia, the Benedictine presence on Iona was there to stay, and the old monastery of Colum Cille was nearly obliterated by the new monastery. Somairle's attempt to revive Iona brought him into conflict with secular and ecclesiastical power in northern Ireland. If Ragnall was indeed responsible for {{the foundation of the}} Benedictine monastery about four decades afterwards, it may indicate that he was following in his father's footsteps, and asserting himself as a king in the Isles.|$|E

40|$|Speech {{acts are}} of great {{importance}} primarily {{within the bounds of}} semantics and should be on the basis of mutually shared background information between hearer <b>and</b> speaker. <b>Curses</b> <b>and</b> prayers are commonly used in everyday language. Whenever someone does a favour to us, we may say a prayer to God for him/her. We may curse at someone for making us angry or sad. By and large, we express our inner feelings and attitudes towards the hearer through saying prayers or curses; therefore, they are involved in expressive speech acts. The present article delivers a special classification of prayers <b>and</b> <b>curses</b> which are as follows: a) prayers <b>and</b> <b>curses</b> which are closely associated with our culture, tradition and religion; b) prayers <b>and</b> <b>curses</b> which have been progressed and produced gradually and no specific cultural root can be traced for them. This type of speech acts is itself classified into two categories: the first one is composed of prayers <b>and</b> <b>curses</b> which are frequently used by children in different contexts and the second category comprises those prayers <b>and</b> <b>curses</b> which English speakers have in common with Persian speakers.  </p...|$|R

25|$|In Guugu-Yimidhirr, a {{traditional}} Australian Aboriginal language, special avoidance lexemes {{are used to}} express deference when {{in the presence of}} tabooed in-law relatives. In other words, speakers will either be completely prohibited from speaking to one’s mother-in-law or must employ “avoidance language” to one’s brother-in-law. The brother-in-law language involves a special set of words to replace regular Guugu-Yimidhirr words and the speaker must avoid words which could suggest reference to genitalia or bodily acts. This brother-in-law language therefore indexes a deferential social relationship of the brother-in-law to the speaker and is reflected in the appropriate social behavior of Guugu-Yimidhirr society. For example, one avoids touching tabooed in-laws, looking at them, joking with them, <b>and</b> <b>cursing</b> in their presence.|$|E
25|$|On 30 December 1971, Communist forces {{attacked}} Sala Phou Khoun, {{a strategic}} intersection in the Royalist rear; the counter for this would become Operation Maharat. The next day, the first Communist 130mm shells fell on Long Tieng. They {{blew up the}} main ammo dump, including its RLAF facilities. Vang Pao unexpectedly left his headquarters at the vital guerrilla base. His CIA advisers followed him to a smoky hut in Ban Song Sai, 21 kilometers to the southwest. There they found him ill, depressed, weeping, <b>and</b> <b>cursing</b> the lack of air support. He returned to Long Tieng with them. They took him to hospital on 4 January, to be admitted for treatment of viral pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|A year later, Jake asks Joey if {{he fought}} with Salvy at the Copacabana because of Vickie. Jake then asks if Joey {{had an affair}} with her; Joey refuses to answer, insults Jake, and leaves. Jake {{directly}} asks Vickie about the affair, and when she hides from him in the bathroom, he breaks down the door, prompting her to sarcastically state that she had sex with the entire neighborhood (including his brother, Salvy, and Tommy Como). Jake angrily walks to Joey's house, with Vickie following him, and assaults Joey in front of his wife and children. After defending his championship belt in a grueling fifteen-round bout against Laurent Dauthuille in 1950, he makes a call to his brother after the fight, but when Joey assumes Salvy is on the other end and starts insulting <b>and</b> <b>cursing</b> at him, Jake says nothing and hangs up. Estranged from Joey, Jake's career begins to decline slowly and he eventually loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their final encounter in 1951.|$|E
50|$|In the Bible, blessings <b>and</b> <b>curses</b> are related; {{the book}} of Deuteronomy prescribes that {{obedience}} to the Law of Moses brings Gods blessing.

[...] Darden had been married to Sheryl from 1972–1977 when they divorced.

500|$|The Siva temple is {{historically}} attested in grants and in local literature. The Kali temple {{is a popular}} sorcery <b>and</b> <b>cursing</b> shrine associated with animal sacrifices and spirit possession. Spirit possession of devotees was noted by the Jesuit priests who left behind records {{of it in the}} 16th century. The temple dedicated to the Sinhala deity Ayyanayake (Aiyyanar to the Tamils) is administered by a local Sinhalese family. The Buddhist temple Pushparamaya Vihara is a post-19th century CE addition. [...] The Ganesha temple, located to the south west of the main temple is the newest amongst the Hindu temples and was built during the early 19th century by artisans from South India.|$|E
500|$|After Poe's death, Griswold {{prepared}} an obituary {{signed with}} the pseudonym [...] "Ludwig". First printed in the October 9, 1849, issue of the New York Tribune, it was soon republished many times. Here he asserted that [...] "few will be grieved" [...] by Poe's death as he had few friends. He claimed that Poe often wandered the streets, either in [...] "madness or melancholy", mumbling <b>and</b> <b>cursing</b> to himself, was easily irritated, was envious of others, and that he [...] "regarded society as composed of villains". Poe's drive to succeed, Griswold wrote, was because he sought [...] "the right to despise a world which galled his self-conceit". Much of this characterization of Poe was copied almost verbatim {{from that of the}} fictitious Francis Vivian in The Caxtons by Edward Bulwer-Lytton.|$|E

500|$|The {{priests of}} the temple are known as Kapuralas and are {{believed}} to be descended from Vedda people. Veddas, too, have a claim on the temple, a nearby mountain peak and locality through a number of legends. There is a mosque and a few tombs of Muslim pious men buried nearby. The temple complex is also connected to other similar temples in Eastern Province dedicated to Murugan which are along the path of pilgrimage from Jaffna in the north to Kataragama in the south of the island; Arunagirinathar traversed this pilgrimage route in the 15th century. [...] The vicinity {{of the temple}} complex is used for secretive practices of sorcery <b>and</b> <b>cursing</b> peculiar to Sri Lanka. The entire temple complex was declared a holy place by the government of Sri Lanka in the 1950s; since then political leaders have contributed for its maintenance and upkeep.|$|E
500|$|The laws {{also set}} out crimes and their {{associated}} punishment. There were several crimes {{that carried the}} death penalty: treason, murder, witchcraft, arson, sodomy, rape, bestiality, adultery, <b>and</b> <b>cursing</b> or smiting one's parents. The actual exercise {{of the death penalty}} was fairly rare; only one sex-related crime resulted in execution, a 1642 incidence of bestiality by Thomas Granger. Edward Bumpus was sentenced to death for [...] "striking and abusing his parents" [...] in 1679, but his sentence was commuted to a severe whipping by reason of insanity. Perhaps the most notable use of the death penalty was in the execution of the Native Americans convicted of the murder of John Sassamon; this helped lead to King Philip's War. Though nominally a capital crime, adultery was usually dealt with by public humiliation only. Convicted adulterers were often forced to wear the letters [...] "A.D." [...] sewn into their garments, much in the manner of Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel The Scarlet Letter.|$|E
500|$|Greatly {{concerned}} {{by what he}} {{perceived to be the}} degeneracy of British society, Wilberforce was also active in matters of moral reform, lobbying against [...] "the torrent of profaneness that every day makes more rapid advances", and considered this issue and the abolition of the slave trade as equally important goals. At the suggestion of Wilberforce and Bishop Porteus, King George III was requested by the Archbishop of Canterbury to issue in 1787 the Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice, as a remedy for the rising tide of immorality. The proclamation commanded the prosecution of those guilty of [...] "excessive drinking, blasphemy, profane swearing <b>and</b> <b>cursing,</b> lewdness, profanation of the Lord's Day, and other dissolute, immoral, or disorderly practices". Greeted largely with public indifference, Wilberforce sought to increase its impact by mobilising public figures to the cause, and by founding the Society for the Suppression of Vice. This and other societies in which Wilberforce was a prime mover, such as the Proclamation Society, mustered support for the prosecution of those who had been charged with violating relevant laws, including brothel keepers, distributors of pornographic material, {{and those who did not}} respect the Sabbath. Years later, the writer and clergyman Sydney Smith criticised Wilberforce for being more interested in the sins of the poor than those of the rich, and suggested that a better name would have been the Society for [...] "suppressing the vices of persons whose income does not exceed £500 per annum". The societies were not highly successful in terms of membership and support, although their activities did lead to the imprisonment of Thomas Williams, the London printer of Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason. Wilberforce's attempts to legislate against adultery and Sunday newspapers were also in vain; his involvement and leadership in other, less punitive, approaches were more successful in the long-term, however. By the end of his life, British morals, manners, and sense of social responsibility had increased, paving the way for future changes in societal conventions and attitudes during the Victorian era.|$|E
