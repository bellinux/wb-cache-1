5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could <b>ascend</b> immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level, at which depth the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to <b>ascend</b> another 10 feet, to the new depth of critical supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E

40|$|Pay-per-bid auctions are {{a popular}} {{new type of}} Internet auction that is unique because a fee is charged for each bid that is placed. This paper uses a {{theoretical}} model and three large empirical data sets with 44, 614 <b>ascending</b> and 1, 460 descending pay-per-bid auctions to compare the economic effects of different pay-per-bid auction formats, such as different price increments and <b>ascending</b> versus descending auctions. The theoretical model suggests revenue equivalence between different price increments and descending and <b>ascending</b> auctions. The empirical results, however, refute the theoretical predictions: <b>ascending</b> auctions with smaller price increments yield, on average, higher revenues per auction than <b>ascending</b> auctions with higher price increments, but their revenues vary much more strongly. On average, <b>ascending</b> auctions yield higher revenues per auction than descending auctions, but results differ strongly across product categories.

40|$|ObjectivesThere is {{increasing}} attention to prophylactic {{replacement of the}} moderately dilated <b>ascending</b> aorta at aortic valve surgery. Moderate <b>ascending</b> aortic dilatation is common in adult patients with conotruncal anomalies. There are no data outlining actual risk of progressive <b>ascending</b> aortic dilatation or dissection to provide management guidelines. MethodsFrom December 1973 through January 2008, 81 consecutive adults (median age, 34 years; range, 18 [...] 59 years) with conotruncal anomalies underwent operation on the aortic root, <b>ascending</b> aorta, or aortic valve. Primary cardiac diagnoses included tetralogy of Fallot with or without pulmonary atresia in 60 patients, truncus arteriosus in 12, double-outlet right ventricle in 6, and other in 3. Indications for operation included aortic regurgitation in 69 patients, supracoronary <b>ascending</b> aneurysm in 16, aortic stenosis in 5, and other in 8. Median <b>ascending</b> aortic size was 45 mm (23 [...] 80 mm). ResultsOperations included isolated aortic valve repair/replacement in 63 patients, combined aortic valve replacement and reduction aortoplasty in 9, aortic root replacement in 7, and isolated <b>ascending</b> aortic replacement in 2. Four patients required reoperation during a median follow-up of 3. 8 years (maximum 31 years). There were no <b>ascending</b> aortic reoperations after previous reduction aortoplasties or supracoronary <b>ascending</b> aortic grafts, {{and there were no}} late aortic dissections. ConclusionsModerate <b>ascending</b> aortic enlargement is common among patients with conotruncal anomalies coming to operation, but aortic dissection is rare, as is subsequent need for aortic reoperation. Despite current enthusiasm for prophylactic operations on the <b>ascending</b> aorta in patients with acquired disease, these data suggest that the moderately dilated aorta in this setting may be observed...|$|R
