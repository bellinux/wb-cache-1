5|$|C. Rajagopalachari, a close {{associate}} of Gandhi, led the march which had close to 150 volunteers, {{most of whom}} belonged to the Indian National Congress. It began at Trichinopoly (now Tiruchirappalli) on 13 April 1930 and proceeded for about 150 miles towards the east before culminating at Vedaranyam, a small coastal town in the then Tanjore District. By collecting salt directly from the sea the marchers broke the salt law. As {{a part of the}} march, Rajagopalachari created awareness among the people by highlighting the importance of khādī <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>social</b> issues like caste discrimination. The campaign came to an end on 28 April 1930 when the participants were arrested by the police. Its leader Rajagopalachari was imprisoned for six months.

5|$|Human {{language}} has {{the properties of}} productivity and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. Language {{is thought to have}} originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality. This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>social</b> grooming and entertainment.|$|E

The strip based a number of its storylines on Johnston's real-life experiences with her own family, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>social</b> issues such as the midlife crisis, divorce, the coming out of a gay character, child abuse, and death.

5|$|With the O.T.O. {{now being}} revived in North America, Smith founded the Agape Lodge No. 1, based at his Hollywood home, {{and brought in}} 7 initiates to the Minerval level in September 1935.

The Agape Lodge held regular meetings, lectures, and study classes, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>social</b> events and a weekly Gnostic Mass open to the public. In February 1936 they held a Mass in honour of Wayne Walker, a proponent of New Thought who ran a group known as The Voice of Healing; they had hoped to attract Walker and his supporters to Thelema, but they were {{put off by the}} Lodge's sexual openness. Later that year, Smith and Jacobi's employer, the Southern California Gas Company, discovered their involvement in the Lodge, demoting Smith to bookkeeper and firing Jacobi. Angered, Jacobi left the Lodge altogether, while Smith shut down the group's private ritual activities for the next three years. As a result, the public attendance of the Gnostic Mass plummeted.|$|E
