As he looks <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror, Daniel sees Leo's reflection looking back at him.|$|E
25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency. Before {{the end of}} 1980, he was to kill a further five victims and attempt to murder one other, although {{only one of these}} victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims are vague, although he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and just how long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image as he looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror. On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme Fanfare for the Common Man before bursting into tears.|$|E
500|$|When Jerry is {{shopping}} for clothes with Elaine, {{he finds a}} suede jacket that he likes. He has doubts about buying the jacket because it is very expensive and has a candy stripe [...] He eventually decides to buy it. While Jerry is at home {{in his living room}} looking <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> a mirror with his jacket, Kramer comes in and likes the jacket, he is even more impressed when he discovers the price by reading the label. Kramer persuades Jerry to give him his old leather jacket as he will no longer be using it.|$|E

500|$|At the Palmer home, Leland smiles <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror. BOB {{stares back}} {{at him from the}} {{reflection}} and cackles madly. Leland dons a pair of latex gloves. Maddy comes downstairs complaining of a burning smell and sees Sarah unconscious on the floor. She sees Leland grinning at her, then sees BOB appear in Leland's place. She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy up the stairs, and drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic. He dances with and cries over her limp body, calling her [...] "Laura," [...] while Bob kisses her. Leland / BOB then becomes enraged and screams, [...] "Leland says you're going back to Missoula, MONTANA!" [...] as he rams her head into a glass picture frame, the words [...] "Missoula, Montana" [...] in the lower corner of the picture. Maddy collapses, bloodied and dead. A crazed Leland places a cutout of the letter [...] "O" [...] under the nail of Maddy's left ring finger.|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt {{was married}} to Sonia Forbes-Adam, the {{daughter}} of Reverend Sir Timothy Forbes Adam. The two met when Nesbitt went to the final call-back for Hamlet at Loughborough Hall in 1989, and they soon began dating. They split up for {{a year after the}} release of Hear My Song but reunited and married in 1994. They have since had two daughters, Peggy and Mary (both of whom appeared in the final two Hobbit movies as the daughters of Bard the Bowman). Nesbitt's three sisters all became teachers. In 2002, a Sunday tabloid published an interview with a legal secretary who claimed to have had a two-month affair with Nesbitt. Shortly afterwards, another tabloid story revealed an affair with a prostitute, who claimed Nesbitt had boasted of liaisons with his Cold Feet co-star Kimberley Joseph, and Amanda Brunker, a former Miss Ireland. Commenting on the publication of details about his personal life, Nesbitt has said he feared that he would lose his marriage, though the exposing of his [...] "dual life" [...] allowed him to [...] "take a long and considered look" [...] <b>at</b> <b>himself.</b> <b>In</b> October 2013, Nesbitt announced {{that he and his wife}} Sonia Forbes-Adam would separate from each other after 19 years. The couple says that the filming of The Hobbit Trilogy has forced the couple to live separately for the past two years. The split came as a mutual decision and the couple says that infidelity was not one of the reasons for their decision. He is the proud father of BUCS 10,000m women's record holder Jenny Nesbitt.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the verbal}} and {{physical}} abuse Erik suffers {{from his mother}} is chronicled in the opening chapters of the novel. After being forced to look <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> a mirror Erik becomes fascinated, believing that mirrors are capable of performing magic. [...] This fascination turns into an obsession and Erik quickly becomes a master of illusion, able to make people see only what {{he wants them to}} see. From a young age, Erik exhibits a strong interest in architecture and is privately tutored by a well-respected professor. [...] However, his strongest abilities lie in the subject of music and he is an incredibly talented composer and performer. [...] However, his mother does not encourage his pursuit of singing, claiming that his supernaturally beautiful voice cannot have been created by God.|$|E

60|$|She put a detaining {{hand through}} his arm again {{and gave it a}} little gentle squeeze. A huge feather almost rested on his shoulder, and the scent of eau-de-Cologne assailed his nostrils. He walked on in silent amazement <b>at</b> finding <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> such a position.|$|R

2500|$|The black {{minstrel}} performer was {{not only}} poking fun <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> but <b>in</b> a more profound way, he was poking fun at the white man. The cakewalk is caricaturing white customs, while white theater companies attempted to satirize the cakewalk as a black dance. Again, as LeRoi Jones notes: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{bricklayer}} nearly {{broke out}} again; but, obeying a glance from his wife, closed {{his lips and}} followed her obediently upstairs.

60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the glass. He wore {{no longer}} the well-cut clothes of Mr. Douglas Romilly's Saville Row tailor, but a {{ready-made}} suit of Schmitt & Mayer's business reach-me-downs, an American felt hat and square-toed shoes.|$|E
