25|$|Between 1990 and 1994, the ANC began {{preparing}} for the first democratic elections. It was an <b>adjustment</b> <b>period</b> and Mbeki {{played a crucial role}} in transforming the ANC into a legal political organisation. In 1991, the ANC was able to hold its first legal conference in the country after 30 years of being banned. The party now had the task of finding a middle ground for discussion between all the various factions: the returning exiles, the long-term prisoners and those who had stayed behind to lead the struggle. Mbeki was chosen as national chair while Cyril Ramaphosa was elected secretary general and the ANC's chief negotiator at the multiparty talks. Mbeki had up to this point been handling much of the diplomatic talks with the apartheid regime, and given his diplomatic experience and the level of bargaining that was expected, it came as a surprise that Mbeki was sidelined in favour of Ramaphosa.|$|E

40|$|Population and {{employment}} in the 50 United States {{are found to be}} non-stationary and cointegrated. Vector error correction (VEC) models exhibit dynamics with adjustment to shocks essentially completed in " 30 - 35 years".

These dynamic adjustment patterns support the hypothesis that relatively long <b>adjustment</b> <b>periods</b> and slow dynamics are probably the spurious results of using non-stationary levels of population {{and employment}} outside of a VEC model framework.

500|$|After a 1–4 {{start to}} the 2012–13 season, the Lakers {{replaced}} head coach Mike Brown with Mike D'Antoni. Gasol was struggling after seven games under D'Antoni, averaging 10.1 points and 8.0 rebounds while shooting 38.8 percent, and he was benched {{in the fourth quarter}} in multiple games. The team had difficulties getting Gasol involved in D'Antoni's offense, which historically had not had post players playing forward. Gasol ranked only 27th in the league in post-up points with 2.7 per game, down from prior seasons when he was fifth in 2010–11 and ninth in 2011–12. On November 18, 2012, in a win against the Houston Rockets, Gasol scored his 15,000th career point. Bothered by tendinitis in both knees since training camp, Gasol sat out eight games in December before returning to the starting lineup. Later, he was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis, but continued playing. General manager Mitch Kupchak told Lakers season-ticket holders the team needed Gasol to be more involved. On January 7, 2013, Gasol received a blow to the face from Denver's JaVale McGee {{in the fourth quarter of}} a 112–105 loss. He suffered a concussion, forcing him to miss the next five games. In his first game back, he came off the bench after having started his first 345 games with the Lakers. In the next game, he returned to the starting lineup and scored 25 points against Toronto, only his second 20-point game of the season. However, in the next game on January 21, D'Antoni moved Gasol to a reserve role and started Earl Clark, a change the coach considered permanent. On February 5 against the Brooklyn Nets, Gasol tore the plantar fascia of his right foot. Gasol had tweaked the fascia in the first half, but played through the soreness until he felt it pop when he tried to block a shot by Brook Lopez towards the end of the game. He returned over six weeks later on March 22 after missing 20 games, with D'Antoni returning him to the starting lineup over Clark. After a two-game <b>adjustment</b> <b>period,</b> Gasol's play was solid, and Bryant insisted that Gasol receive the ball in the post. D'Antoni stated that Gasol had played well since January, and attributed the forward's earlier struggles to injuries and the team's evolving offensive system. [...] "I have a lot more confidence in him now, and he's playing great", D'Antoni said. He finished the season with career lows in points (13.7) and field-goal percentage (.466), and his rebounds (8.6) were his lowest since his first season with Los Angeles. He was limited to career-low 49 games. However, he had three triple-doubles in his last seven games including the playoffs. Gasol was owed $19.3 million in 2013–14 in the final year of his contract, which would cost the Lakers around $50 million including luxury taxes. He became a free agent after the season.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt is {{desirable}} to maintain consistent dynamic behavior of WIP regulation in work systems with multiple modes of capacity adjustment (floaters, overtime, etc.) and different <b>adjustment</b> <b>periods,</b> delays and limits {{in the various}} modes. Coordination of these modes is {{necessary in order to}} keep optimal dynamic behavior. In this paper, a control-theoretic model of WIP regulation is presented first that accommodates multiple capacity adjustment modes with different <b>adjustment</b> <b>periods</b> (per shift, per day, per week, etc.) and different delays in implementing adjustments. Then an algorithm is presented for adapting WIP adjustment parameters in the presence of capacity adjustment limits and mode priorities so that a specified dynamic performance goal continues to be met. Results of simulations driven by industrial data are used to illustrate the effect of limits and performance goals on dynamic behavior, and conclusions are drawn regarding the effectiveness of adaptive regulation of WIP by coordinating multiple modes of capacity adjustment...|$|R

40|$|We analyse {{corporate}} {{balance sheet}} adjustment episodes in Germany and Japan, {{as well as}} a sample of 30 countries, using national account data. Corporate balance sheet adjustment tends to be long lasting and associated with a strong impact on current accounts, wages and investment. Adjustment episodes lead to significant changes in corporate balance sheet ratios with a buildup of liquidity and a reduction of leverage. The adjustment is generally achieved by reducing investment and increasing savings {{on the back of a}} falling wage share. A panel econometric exercise shows that balance sheet <b>adjustment</b> <b>periods</b> are triggered by macroeconomic downturns as well as balance sheet stress due to high debt, low liquidity and negative equity price shocks. ...|$|R

Based on a sectoral panel of eight new European member states in the period of 1998 to 2004 we perform a dynamic panel analysis al- lowing for individual <b>adjustment</b> <b>periods</b> across sectors. Results support our assumption that investment into the service sector, which is characterized by low installation costs, adjusts much faster to its desired level than manufactur- ing FDI. Furthermore, since services are mostly non-tradable, FDI into this sector is largely based on market-seeking motives while manufacturing FDI is also driven by international price competitiveness measured via real unit labor costs.

40|$|This is a {{paper on}} the Regional Convergence Hypothesis, applied to the Peruvian case during the 1978 – 1992 period. The {{research}} considers an important element, generally neglected by studies on economic growth: the spatial organization {{of the economy in}} regions. For that purpose, the empirical analysis has used spatial economic tools, applied to a panel model with fixed effects and SAR (1) errors. The findings show the absence of trends towards conditional convergence, which means that the Peruvian Departments as such lack steady growth paths in the medium term. The data also show that during the hyperinflation and structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>periods,</b> the less developed Departments presented slow down factors. Finally, the analysis shows that the public expenditure plays an important compensatory role of the decelerating and accelerating forces of growth, and that its impact is more favorable to growth when regions are considered, instead of the Departments.
