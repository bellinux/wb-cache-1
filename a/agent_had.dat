40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a multi-agent scenario with K ≥ 2 <b>agents</b> that <b>have</b> partial information about some random nature state, and that take actions in a repeated manner. Each <b>agent</b> also <b>has</b> imperfect {{observations of the}} other agents' past actions and the nature state realization. Our goal is to characterize the set of asymptotically implementable distributions on the agents' actions and the nature state. We solve this problem for general K when all <b>agents</b> <b>have</b> only causal nature state information (NSI) and for K = 2 when: one <b>agent</b> <b>has</b> causal NSI and the other <b>agent</b> <b>has</b> non-causal NSI; or in some special cases when both <b>agents</b> <b>have</b> non-causal NSI...|$|R
30|$|It can be {{observed}} from the comparison that, with an increasing quantity of neighbors, {{the ability of the}} uninformed agents to identify information improves. The more neighbors that one uninformed <b>agent</b> <b>has,</b> the earlier that agent will reach an equilibrium. Figure  2 shows that when one uninformed <b>agent</b> <b>has</b> only 2 neighbors, it takes him 1000 periods or even longer to achieve an equilibrium to identify honest informed agents from the dishonest agents, while when an uninformed <b>agent</b> <b>has</b> 6 or more neighbors, he can quickly reach equilibrium. If an uninformed <b>agent</b> <b>has</b> more information sources, he can identify the honest sources more efficiently and precisely through the confidence parameter.|$|R

The film's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada; Thompson was cast based on a tape which his <b>agent</b> <b>had</b> sent and a follow-up audition after the first actor cast in the lead was forced to pull out.

He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment <b>agent</b> <b>had</b> returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E
5|$|Initial police {{speculation}} {{was that}} Kinne had bribed guards {{to look the}} other way while she escaped the prison—an unusual blackout had been reported at the prison on the evening of and at the approximate time of her escape, and investigation showed that a door that should have been locked had been left unsecured—but further questioning of prison guards and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than it should have been. News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Kinne's escape, including that she had bribed prison guards, that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman, that Kinne's mother had been involved in the escape plan, that a former Mexican secret service <b>agent</b> <b>had</b> assisted in her escape, and that Kinne may have disguised herself as a man to effect her escape. A more modern theory speculates that the family of Francisco Parades Ordoñez had helped her escape and then killed her.|$|E
5|$|Joyce and Nora {{went into}} self-imposed exile, moving first to Zurich in Switzerland, where he ostensibly taught English at the Berlitz Language School through an agent in England. It later came to {{fact that the}} <b>agent</b> <b>had</b> been swindled; the {{director}} of the school sent Joyce on to Trieste, which was then part of Austria-Hungary (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in Pola, then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of Croatia). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians—having discovered an espionage ring in the city—expelled all aliens. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there. He remained in Trieste for most of the next ten years.|$|E

5|$|Babcock's {{first move}} as GM was {{drafting}} centre Rafael Araújo—selected eighth overall—in the 2004 NBA draft, {{in a move}} that was criticized by fans and analysts, considering highly touted swingman Andre Iguodala was drafted with the next pick. Babcock signed point guard Rafer Alston to a five-year deal. After Vince Carter's annual charity game, Babcock implicitly revealed to the media that Carter's <b>agent</b> <b>had</b> asked for a trade, confirming Carter's discontent. The Toronto Sun reported that Carter felt he was being misled by the Raptors' hierarchy during the General Manager search and had concluded {{that as long as the}} managerial structure at Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. remained intact, the Raptors would never be an elite team. Carter was finally traded mid-season, ending his six-year tenure. Toronto received Alonzo Mourning, forwards Eric Williams and Aaron Williams and two mid-to-late future first round picks from the New Jersey Nets. Mourning chose not to report to Toronto, forcing Babcock to buy out the remainder of his contract at a reported $10million, leaving him free to sign with the Miami Heat. Eric and Aaron Williams were supposed to add defensive toughness and rebounding, but were generally under-utilized for the entire season. Analysts had predicted Babcock got the bad end of the deal, and the trade eventually cost him his job.|$|E
5|$|The Giants went 8–4–1 in 1926, and {{withstood}} {{a challenge}} from an upstart American football league {{led by a}} team featuring Grange. Grange and his <b>agent</b> <b>had</b> formed the American Football League and placed their flagship team, the Yankees, in New York. According to a story by The New York Times published at the time, the Giants lost over $50,000 during the season. Grange's league lasted one season however, and was subsumed into the NFL. The Giants were so desperate to make money they allowed star Duluth Eskimos running back Ernie Nevers back into a close game after he was injured, even though by the rules they {{had the right to}} disallow his re-entrance, to please fans who had come to see him. The Yankees were subsumed into the NFL the next year and played most of their games on the road to avoid direct competition with the Giants. They folded in 1928, one year after Grange went back to playing for the Bears. The Giants paid a total of $21,000 in player salary in 1926, including paying all player expenses during the season, and player salaries ranged from $1,500 to $3,000. According to March, the attendance for the season was nearly equal to the 274,500 the team reported in their inaugural season. However, home attendance for games at the Polo Grounds dropped from 25,000 to 15,000 a game. The team's attendance on the road was significantly higher in their early history—the team averaged 57,000 in their three road games in 1925.|$|E

Although an undercover federal <b>agent</b> <b>had</b> helped procure a key ingredient for an illegal methamphetamine manufacturing operation, and assisted in the process, the Court followed its earlier rulings on the subject {{and found that the}} defendant had a predisposition to make and sell illegal drugs whether he worked with the government or not.|$|E

In the final episode of each season, one of the envelopes contained a black feather, which revealed the identity of the mole.|$|E
25|$|Another drug class {{originating}} from the NCI was the camptothecins. Camptothecin, {{derived from a}} Chinese ornamental tree, inhibits topoisomerase I, an enzyme that allows DNA unwinding. Despite showing promise in preclinical studies, the <b>agent</b> <b>had</b> little antitumour activity in early clinical trials, and dosing was limited by kidney toxicity: its lactone ring is unstable at neutral pH, so while in the acidic environment of the kidneys it becomes active, damaging the renal tubules. In 1996 a more stable analogue, irinotecan, won Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval {{for the treatment of}} colon cancer. Later, this agent would also be used to treat lung and ovarian cancers.|$|E
