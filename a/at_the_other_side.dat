Causes of damage may include trauma, surgery, tumours, and compression at the jugular foramen. Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome or poliomyelitis.|$|E

30|$|The GPS {{and gravity}} in situ {{observations}} of LMS area were made along roads, {{all of which}} were located in deep gorges among high mountains. <b>The</b> computed FGAs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> observation stations are undoubtedly of high accuracy. However, the computed FGAs associated with areas far away from observation stations are considered less accurate, because they are profoundly affected by the local topography (Fig.  3 a). More specifically, the variation of elevation will induce a change of gravity, and the magnitude is about 0.3086  mGal per meter. Accordingly, attempting to determine FGAs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>sides</b> of mountains or into deep gorges by conventional interpolation method (Kriging interpolation used in Fig.  3) can involve considerable error.|$|R

25|$|During the 19th century it {{was again}} home to many European traders, and housed many embassies, {{especially}} along the Grande Rue de Péra (today İstiklâl Avenue).

40|$|A time-reversal Bell test {{protocol}} is proposed. The quantum states are prepared by faraway separated partners {{and transferred to}} the third partner who carries out Bell basis measurement on them to post-select the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs. If some loopholes open, similar as that in normal Bell test, the Bell violation in the present protocol is apt to be interpreted with local hidden variable (lhv) theory. With some modifications on the protocol, <b>the</b> lhvs <b>at</b> both sides are prevented to exchange their information. Thus they only function locally and cannot affect the behaviors of <b>the</b> states <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>sides.</b> However, Bell violation can still be obtained in this case. It means that Bell violation is realized with the lhv theory excluded. Because high detection efficiency is not compulsory, this protocol can be realized with present technology.
