25|$|There are {{two classes}} of {{non-toxic}} <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>coatings.</b> The most common class relies on low friction and low surface energies. Low surface energies result in hydrophobic surfaces. These coatings create a smooth surface which can prevent attachment of larger microorganisms. For example, fluoropolymers and silicone coatings are commonly used. These coatings are ecologically inert but have problems with mechanical strength and long-term stability. Specifically, after days biofilms (slime) can coat the surfaces which buries the chemical activity and allows microorganisms to attach. The current standard for these coatings is polydimethylsiloxane, or PDMS, which consists of a non-polar backbone made of repeating units of silicon and oxygen atoms. The non-polarity of PDMS allows for biomolecules to readily adsorb to its surface in order to lower interfacial energy. However, PDMS also has a low modulus of elasticity that allows {{for the release of}} fouling organisms at speeds of greater than 20 knots. The dependence of effectiveness on vessel speed prevents use of PDMS on slow-moving ships or those that spend significant amounts of time in port.|$|E

40|$|Effective surface {{coatings}} for tissue-contacting medical devices should prevent both biofilm formation and infection. One method {{to achieve this}} aim is protein repellant polyethylene oxide (PEO) brush coatings loaded with antimicrobials. Previous {{research has demonstrated that}} the antimicrobial nisin adsorbs to PEO brush layers in multi-layer amounts and suggests that small peptides or proteins are capable of being loaded into an otherwise protein repellent brush. The work described in this thesis aimed to understand the influences of peptide structure and amphiphilicity on adsorption into brush layers and is a necessary step in the development of bioactive coatings. Optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy was used to investigate the adsorption of polyglutamic acid and the cationic amphiphilic peptide WLBU 2 to a PEO brush. Kinetic parameters were interpreted with respect to a model accounting for history-dependent adsorption, in order to evaluate rate constants for peptide adsorption and desorption, as well as the lateral clustering behavior of an absorbed or entrapped peptide. The WLBU 2 peptide was held within the brush even after sustained rinsing, whereas the desorption data suggested that polyglutamic acid would completely elute from the brush with time. These results indicate that small peptides are capable of becoming entrapped within PEO brushes and that amphiphilic peptides are held more tightly. The results presented here are compelling evidence of the potential to create <b>anti-fouling</b> surface <b>coatings</b> capable of storing and delivering therapeutics...|$|R

Two <b>coatings</b> with significantly different silver contents (7. 5 % and 20. 3 %) were tested.

Two different ageing mechanisms were observed, depending on the initial silver concentration in the film. For the sample exhibiting the low silver content (7. 5 %), the metal amount decreased at the surface in contact with the solution, due to the release of silver from the coating. As a result, aftera 2 -day exposure, silver nanoparticles located at the extreme surface were entirely released, whereas silver is still present in the inner part of the film. The coating thickness was not modified during ageing. In contrast, for the high silver content film (20. 3 %), the thickness decreased with immersion time, due to significant silver release and matrix erosion, assigned to a percolation-like effect.

40|$|Introduction: Fouling is {{a typical}} problem in {{compressors}} used for processing of hydrocarbon gasses and it is caused by solids adsorption onto the internal surfaces of the machinery. This phenomenon can influence {{the performance of the}} facility and, in some cases, it causes the stop or the failure of the system. Surface coating can be a suitable solution to this kind of problem. <b>Anti-fouling</b> and anti-wear <b>coatings</b> can be obtained by electroless-nickel plating technique. It allows for depositing very uniform and dense Ni-P alloy coatings on irregular shaped surface and on different kind of substrate. Materials and methods: Ni-P amorphous alloy was deposited on a steel substrate. The electroless plating bath is an acid solution and consists of a nickel source, a reducing agent (P compounds), stabilizing agents and a buffer. The temperature and the pH were continuously monitored during the deposition and kept constant. Plating parameters were optimized and several coatings were deposited. Nano-particles were added in order to improve the performance of the coating, in particular particles of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) were chosen to improve anti-fouling behavior while nano-zirconia particles were added to improve wear resistance. In order to prevent agglomeration of nano-ZrO 2, nano-particles were previously surface modified with methacrylic acid. Ni-P coatings were characterized through SEM imaging and EDS analysis. Coating thickness and roughness were measured. Top view and cross section Vickers hardness was evaluated. The morphology of the samples was compared through a surface profilometry analysis. The wettability was evaluated considering the drop contact angle for different fluids. Results: All deposited coatings (Ni-P, Ni-P with ZrO 2, Ni-P with PTFE, Ni-P with ZrO 2 and PTFE) are dense layers with a very good adhesion with the substrate. As expected the morphology of the coating follows the morphology of the substrate. SEM micrographies show an optimal dispersion and distribution of nano-particles. Nano-zirconia addiction allows for obtaining small values of roughness and high values of Vickers hardness. Nano-ZrO 2 and PTFE particles cause a reduction of drop contact angle for different fluid. In particular PTFE results to be more beneficial for a decrease of the wettability. Discussion: Electroless Nickel Plating technique was well optimized resulting in dense coatings and good rate of deposition.

40|$|In this thesis, {{challenges}} {{associated with}} the creation of anti-fouling surfaces and polymer-based electrolytes are addressed using a versatile polymer chemistry that affords control over material functionality through the manipulation of the polymer’s side chain composition. The polymers used in this thesis generally have a backbone comprised in-part or wholly of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) with pendant allyl side groups, to which various moieties can be attached using a straightforward thio-ene click. I describe the attachment of different side groups to design polymers with desirable properties, then characterize these polymers’ performance when used as <b>anti-fouling</b> surface <b>coatings</b> and electrolytic solutions. The development of high lithium cation transference number electrolytes, those in which the ionic conductivity is carried predominantly by the lithium ion instead of its counteranion, could limit concentration polarization that plagues current battery electrolytes. The typical approach for achieving high transference number electrolytes is to immobilize the anion on a polymer to limit anion motion. We designed a lithium neutralized PEO backbone with pendent sulfonate groups to use as a dry single ion conductor. Interestingly, these sulfonate functionalized materials self-assembled into very well ordered, small (2. 5 nm) lamellae, which result from aggregation and phase segregation of the attached ions from the polymer backbone. Unfortunately, given that the ions are not solvated (i. e., dissociated) by the polymer backbone, no conductivity was observed in these materials, including at high (120 °C) temperatures. The lack of ion dissociation suggests that a solvent with higher Lewis basicity or acidity than the PEO backbone is needed to disrupt the contact ion pairs and allow conductivity. Polyelectrolyte solutions were therefore prepared from the polyanion described above and a strong Lewis basic solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide. These solutions exhibited an excellent combination of high ionic conductivity and Li+ transference number (e. g., 1. 2 mS/cm and 0. 99, respectively, at 25 °C). In addition, this system is tunable (polyanion molecular weight and charge concentration can be manipulated), and provided a platform to explore the tradeoff between conductivity and transference number in liquid electrolytes with an unprecedented combination of both. Taking advantage of this tunability, I explored the effect of temperature, polymer molecular weight, solvent choice, and small molecule salt addition on the solution transport properties. Li+ transference number was found to be temperature independent, as expected for solutions that are fully dissociated at all temperatures measured. Scaling theories for molecular weight dependence of diffusion coefficients described the polymer behavior well but did not capture the behavior of the lithium cation, which was generally found to be independent of polymer molecular weight. Solutions made in a variety of solvents all displayed high cation transference number and high conductivity, but there was no simple relationship between solvent and electrolyte properties. Finally, when mixed into the polyelectrolyte solution, small molecule salts, such as LiTFSI, increase the solution conductivity, but at a substantial cost to Li+ transference number. In another application, I designed polymer materials that prevent marine fouling, the attachment of organisms to human-made structures in marine environments. Amphiphilic polymers {{have been shown to be}} effective as antifouling materials against a variety of organisms and organic compounds. We therefore designed a polymer platform to present sequence-specific peptoids at the surface of thin film coatings. These amphiphilic coatings were used to study the effect of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residue sequence on antifouling performance. The polymer platform had a polystyrene (PS) anchoring block, and a PEO presentation block to which peptoids were attached. We showed that fluorinated moieties are very surface active and direct the surface composition of the polymer thin film. The position and number of fluorinated groups in the polypeptoid was shown to affect both the surface composition and antifouling properties of the film. Specifically, the position of the fluorinated units in the peptoid chain changes the surface chemistry and the antifouling behavior, while the number of fluorinated residues affects the fouling release properties. In addition to the peptoid sequence, the specific composition of the polymer platform is an important consideration for film stability and surface presentation. The anchoring block molecular weight plays an important role in film stability, but also affects the overall film hydrophobicity, which adversely affects antifouling performance. It was found that the coatings using an entirely hydrophobic scaffold, polystyrene-b-poly(dimethyl siloxane), performed well against only one of the marine organisms studied (Ulva linza), but that hydrophilic coatings comprised of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) performed well against all marine organisms studied, including U. linza and Navicula. Finally, it was shown that perfluorooctane thiol attached directly to the polymer chain can direct surface presentation of the entire polymer system, thereby allowing improved anti-fouling film formation...|$|R

We are designing, preparing, and testing "ambiguous surfaces" chemically patterned at various length scales with different moieties whose chemical functions are selected to hinder settlement and improve fouling release, creating materials that can exceed the current performance of fouling release silicone coatings.

The construction of organic overlayers on semiconductor surfaces {{is important in the}} area of <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>coatings</b> as well as in organic electronic applications. Chapter 4 introduces a new route to polymer-covered silicon surfaces through a covalent Si-C linkage. ROMP of norbornene from a surface-attached ruthenium catalyst produces uniform polynorbornene overlayers with controlled thickness ranging from 10 Što 5. 5 ?m. The work discussed in Chapter 5 elaborates on surface-initiated ROMP by constructing thin-film top-contact field effect transistors with a polynorbornene dielectric layer. Chapter 6 explores the synthesis of polar-functionalized linear polymers from cyclopentene and cycloheptene derivatives. The challenge of polymerizing low-ring strain monomers via ROMP is also discussed. A method to a priori discern a monomer's ability to undergo ROMP is outlined in this chapter as well. Chapters 7 and 8 describe the synthesis of both regioregular and stereoregular polar-functionalized linear ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) co-polymers by the ROMP of rationally designed, symmetric monomers. These polymers were made with the goal of producing materials with enhanced oxygen barrier properties. Controlling material architecture imparts a dramatic effect on both the solution and solid state morphologies of EVOH and the synthetic challenges and results are discussed. Finally, Chapter 9 complements Chapters 7 and 8, and investigates the reason behind enhanced oxygen barrier properties of EVOH through molecular dynamics simulations. For EVOH polymers that differs only by the syn or anti orientation of neighboring diols, a clear difference is observed for the hydrogen bonding clusters. Moreover, the free volume accessible to any solute molecules is extremely low identified by a probe radius of less than 0. 6...|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{enhanced}} chemical {{vapour deposition}} was investigated for the deposition of bioactive surfaces which can be categorised into two functions. The first is in biosensor applications, immunoassay biodevices have been researched considerably but significant problems remain in particular non-specific adsorption. This work demonstrates a new method of reducing the non specific adsorption {{on the surface of}} cyclo olefin polymers for use as immunoassay biodevices. PECVD deposition of a silicon oxide bonding layer followed by an acrylic acid functional layer which contains carboxylic acid functional groups on cylic olefin polymers is achieved. The deposited film exhibits low non-specific adsorption of non target analytes and increased covalent attachment of target analytes. A comprehensive characterisation of the deposition is carried out and conclusions of the mechanisms involved in creating the surface are elucidated; surfaces are analysed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. The mechanisms behind the plasma deposition of acrylic acid are investigated and methods to increase carboxylic retention on the surface are considered, in particular the influence of background gas is investigated. The function of the second surface is in anti-fouling devices. The production of antifouling films is a key element for the development of biomedical materials such as medical devices and implants. <b>Anti-fouling</b> <b>coatings</b> favour the biological integration by limiting the interactions between the implants and physiological fluids. Proteins present in the blood will be the first components to become adsorbed {{on the surface of the}} biomaterial. Fibrinogen present in the blood is the major initiator of inflammatory reactions and is involved in blood clotting. By minimising fibrinogen adsorption it is possible to reduce the contribution of the biomaterial surface characteristics to thrombosis and inflammatory reactions. Here in, a method to reduce fibrinogen adsorption is discussed and a characterisation of the plasma phase used to deposit the antifouling coating is investigated and a study on the properties of the surface for antifouling is examined. Using HMDSO and oxygen ‘polymer-like’ and ‘silica-like’ surfaces can be deposited, silica-like depositions when compared to the polymer-like depositions displayed lower fibrinogen adsorption, 42 % compared to 23 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of vessel biofouling as a vector for the dispersal of non-indigenous marine species (NIMS) is only {{just beginning to}} receive international attention. At the time of commencing this study, there was a considerable lack of knowledge surrounding which vessels, hull locations, levels and types of biofouling pose the greatest biosecurity risk. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the nature, extent and survivorship of biofouling organisms on various vessel types at different hull locations and offers a pragmatic risk assessment approach for managing this threat. The results of this thesis found that the recruitment, persistence, distribution, abundance and species composition of biofouling on vessel hulls is influenced by many factors including: 1) the presence/absence, age and type of anti-fouling coating; 2) voyage duration and route; and 3) port residency period. Therefore, higher levels of biofouling (species richness, percentage cover, and biomass), including NIMS are more likely to accumulate and persist on vessels (and in hull locations) that: 1) lack and/or possess old, ineffective, damaged, inappropriate or unsuitable anti-fouling coatings; 2) spend prolonged periods stationary in ports; 3) travel at slow speeds (i. e. < 10 knots); 4) have short voyage durations; and 5) remain at similar latitudes. Prevention is clearly better than a cure, hence the correct application and maintenance of suitable <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>coatings</b> to the entire submerged hull surface of vessel hulls, including niche areas is the most cost-effective way of minimising the unwanted translocation of biofouling organisms and NIMS. However, the results of this thesis demonstrate that if biofouling organisms colonise and establish on a vessel's hull, voyage speed alone is not capable of providing a reliable secondary level of defence against the unwanted dispersal of NIMS. Clearly, the survivorship of biofouling organisms was highest amongst vessels that travelled at slow and medium speeds (e. g. < 10 knots). Therefore, given that accumulation of biofouling follows a successional process and NIMS are more likely to be associated with higher levels of biofouling, vessels that travel at slow and medium speeds are more likely to pose the greatest risk of translocating NIMS on a vessel by vessel scale. However, despite the observation that faster vessels reduce the diversity, quantity and quality of sessile biofouling organisms in laminar flow areas of the hull, a wide range of sessile, sedentary and mobile organisms were still cable of survival in areas protected from harsh hydrodynamically forces commonly referred to as niche areas, particularly within sea-chests...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. It was {{presented}} at the Second International Faecal Sludge Management Conference (FSM 2), 29 to 31 October 2012, Durban, South Africa. We are developing a toilet system that converts faecal material to an aqueous suspension of carbonised material that is safe to handle, and readily separated from the remaining liquid. It will also extract useful salts from the liquid. The system is aim to be the new generation universally appealing toilet and it will be of particular and urgent interest to areas where no (or very crude) sanitation exists. The system is designed to be self-sufficient in terms of energy input and to scale for a number of users in the range a few tens to a thousand or more. In parallel with our engineering development we are designing the system to provide users with a positive and comfortable experience. Hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) has received attention recently as a way to convert biomass - including sewerage - into coal like material. It involves heating the start material in water at high temperatures and pressures. Depending on the conditions used the process can produce hydrocarbon gases or liquids or coal like particles. Most HTC work involving sewerage treatment is currently aimed at replacing established large-scale treatment plants i. e. for places with well-developed sewerage services. Our system, using HTC, is aimed at bringing the process at a decentralized household (including combination of households) level so that the new generation toilet become accessible to all and particularly to those areas where none currently exists. Using HTC for toilets on continuous basis for such a small scale is the key innovation of our proposed system. We will describe our work to characterise the energetics of the HTC process in order to optimise the process in terms of total energy input and how we have used this information to develop a continuous system based on a plug flow reactor. The material produced by the system can be easily separated from the remaining liquid and used to generate heat and power (via a generator including solar) {{in order to maintain the}} process. The solids are safe to handle, and look, feel and smell much like coffee grounds. In situations where electrical (or renewable energy like solar) power is available the solid material can be used either as a fuel for heating and cooking, as a soil conditioner and possibly for carbon capture. We will discuss the possibility of including other waste material (food, sanitary waste etc.) into the system. In order to minimize the amount of water required to flush material away from the toilet bowl and to help maintain high sanitary standards we have been investigating <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>coatings</b> for the system. We will describe the results of studies of a nano-coating based on a responsive polymer that significantly enhances the rate at which water flushes away material that adheres to the toilet surface...|$|E
