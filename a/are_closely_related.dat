50|$|Though {{the family}} {{includes}} three genera of blind, subterranean, and troglobitic catfishes, Trogloglanis, Satan, and Prietella, {{none of these}} three genera <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related.</b> Instead, Satan <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to Pylodictis, Prietella to Noturus, and Trogloglanis possibly to Ictalurus, although it may not <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> {{to any of the}} other ictalurids.

5|$|The crag martins {{are four}} species of small {{passerine}} {{birds in the}} genus Ptyonoprogne of the swallow family. They are the Eurasian crag martin (P.rupestris), the pale crag martin (P.obsoleta), the rock martin (P.fuligula) and the dusky crag martin (P.concolor). They <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to each other, and have formerly sometimes been considered to be one species. They <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the Hirundo barn swallows and are placed in that genus by some authorities. These are small swallows with brown upperparts, paler underparts without a breast band, and a square tail with white patches. They can be distinguished from each other on size, the colour shade of the upperparts and underparts, and minor plumage details like throat colour. They resemble the sand martin, but are darker below, and lack a breast band.|$|E
5|$|The {{link between}} phylogenetic {{distance}} ("relatedness") and pathology is small, e.g. the O157:H7 serotype strains, which form a clade ("an exclusive group")—group E below—are all enterohaemorragic strains (EHEC), {{but not all}} EHEC strains <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related.</b> In fact, four different species of Shigella are nested among E. coli strains (vide supra), while E. albertii and E. fergusonii are outside this group.|$|E

5|$|A vector {{processor}} is a CPU or computer {{system that can}} execute the same instruction on large sets of data. Vector processors have high-level operations that work on linear arrays of numbers or vectors. An example vector operation is A = B × C, where A, B, and C are each 64-element vectors of 64-bit floating-point numbers. They <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to Flynn's SIMD classification.|$|E
5|$|At birth, infants {{are unable}} to wait for their wants {{and needs to be}} met and exhibit a {{defining}} lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification. Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to attention deficits and behavior problems.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum peckii {{is similar}} in appearance, but has an acrid taste, and clamp {{connections}} in its hyphae. Hydnellum spongiosipes is readily confused with H.ferrugineum, and several authors have historically considered the two species to be the same; molecular studies, however, indicate that the two fungi <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related,</b> but distinct. In contrast with H.ferrugineum, H.spongiosipes has a darker cap when young, darker flesh, and occurs in deciduous woods. Old fruit bodies of H.ferrugineum can be confused with those of Hydnellum concrescens.|$|E

5|$|Myriostoma {{had been}} {{classified}} in the family Geastraceae until 1973, when British mycologist Donald Dring placed it in the Astraeaceae based {{on the presence of}} trabeculae (stout columns that extend from the peridium to the central core of the fruit body) in the gleba, and the absence of a true hymenium. In his 1989 monograph, Stellan Sunhede returned it to the Geastraceae. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences has confirmed the traditional belief that Myriostoma and Geastrum <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Hydrophiinae, {{commonly}} known as sea snakes or coral reef snakes, are a subfamily of venomous elapid snakes that inhabit marine environments for {{most or all of}} their lives. Most are extensively adapted to a fully aquatic life and are unable to move on land, except for the genus Laticauda, which has limited land movement. They are found in warm coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to venomous terrestrial snakes in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The Mecoptera <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the Siphonaptera (fleas), and {{a little}} more distantly to the Diptera (true flies). They are {{somewhat}} fly-like in appearance, being small to medium-sized insects with long slender bodies and narrow membranous wings. Most breed in moist environments such as leaf litter or moss, and the eggs may not hatch until the wet season arrives. The larvae are caterpillar-like and mostly feed on vegetable matter, and the non-feeding pupae may pass through a diapause until favourable weather conditions occur.|$|E

5|$|The genus {{name was}} changed to Glyptemys in 2001. The bog turtle and the wood turtle, Glyptemys insculpta, had until then been {{included}} in the genus Clemmys, which also included spotted turtles (C.guttata) and western pond turtles (C.marmorata). Nucleotide sequencing and ribosomal DNA analyses suggested that bog turtles and wood turtles <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related,</b> but neither is directly related to spotted turtles, hence the separation of the genus Glyptemys.|$|E
5|$|The oxides and {{hydroxides}} of neptunium <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to its ions. In general, Np hydroxides {{at various}} oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before {{it on the}} periodic table such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on the periodic table will more readily undergo hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{student council}} {{is a group}} of {{students}} which provides a liaison between the teachers and students.

The three committees <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> and work together to preserve the peace on campus.|$|E
