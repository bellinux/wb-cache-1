5|$|There are 5 premaxillary {{teeth in}} both species, {{the fourth of}} {{which is about a}} third larger {{relative}} to the others. The maxilla has 12 distinct sockets in K. langenbergensis. Excluding the pseudocaniniforms, the maxillary tooth size remains roughly constant but gradually decreases after the pseudocaniniforms in both species; all tooth sockets after the twelfth <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> by a continuous trough.

A further {{sesquioxide}} Pb2O3 {{can be obtained}} at high pressure, along with several non-stoichiometric phases. Many of them show defective fluorite structures in which some oxygen atoms <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> by vacancies: PbO {{can be considered as}} having such a structure, with every alternate layer of oxygen atoms absent.|$|E
5|$|Only the aye-aye, the extinct giant aye-aye, and {{the largest}} of the extinct giant sloth lemurs lack a {{functional}} strepsirrhine toothcomb. In the case of the aye-aye, the morphology of the deciduous incisors, which are lost shortly after birth, indicate that its ancestors had a toothcomb. These milk teeth are lost shortly after birth and <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> by open-rooted, continually growing (hypselodont) incisors.|$|E

5|$|String theory extends {{ordinary}} {{particle physics}} by replacing zero-dimensional point particles by one-dimensional objects called strings. In the late 1980s, {{it was natural}} for theorists to attempt to formulate other extensions in which particles <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> by two-dimensional supermembranes or by higher-dimensional objects called branes. Such objects had been considered as early as 1962 by Paul Dirac, and they were reconsidered by a small but enthusiastic group of physicists in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} the Lorentz group on the space of field {{configurations}} (a field configuration is the spacetime history of a particular solution, e.g. the electromagnetic field in all of space over all time is one field configuration) resembles the action on the Hilbert spaces of quantum mechanics, except that the commutator brackets <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> by field theoretical Poisson brackets.|$|E
