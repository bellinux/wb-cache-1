Elizabeth was later quoted as referring to the Duchess as [...] "that woman", and the Duchess referred to Elizabeth as [...] "Cookie", because of her supposed resemblance to a fat Scots cook. Claims that Elizabeth remained embittered towards the Duchess were denied by her close friends; the Duke of Grafton wrote that she [...] "never said anything nasty about the Duchess of Windsor, except to say she really hadn't got <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> she was dealing with." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, Preston North End {{asked for}} {{permission}} to speak to Westley with the view to employing him as their new manager. Though the Hertfordshire club described the approach as [...] "unwelcome", permission was granted. After personal terms and a compensation package were agreed, Westley was announced as Preston's new manager on 13 January. His first game {{in charge of the}} club was a 2–0 home defeat against Leyton Orient on 21 January. After the game, it was revealed that Westley had told players the starting line-up for the game courtesy of a 2am text message {{on the day of the}} match. He picked up his first win as Preston manager in his fourth game in charge, securing a 1–0 home victory over Hartlepool United on 14 February 2012. Following Preston's 2–0 televised defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in March 2012, Westley stated that a Sheffield Wednesday player had informed him that four Preston players had leaked the Preston team and tactics to opposition players ahead of the match. Westley stated [...] "It doesn't surprise me. When you have got people in your own camp working against you it is tough". Preston won just two games out of the next 17 during the remainder of the campaign, and finished the season in 15th place. At the end of the season, Westley criticised the club's [...] "mediocre" [...] mentality, stating the squad have [...] "not got <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> it takes to get success".|$|E
500|$|Edward {{was created}} Duke of Windsor by his brother, George VI, {{prior to the}} marriage. However, letters patent, passed by the new king and {{unanimously}} supported by the Dominion governments, prevented Wallis, now the Duchess of Windsor, from sharing her husband's style of [...] "Royal Highness". George VI's firm view that the Duchess should not be given a royal title was shared by Queen Mary and George's wife, Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother). At first, the British royal family did not accept the Duchess and would not receive her formally, although the former king sometimes met his mother and siblings after his abdication. Some biographers have suggested that Wallis's sister-in-law, Queen Elizabeth, remained bitter towards her {{for her role in}} bringing George VI to the throne (which she may have seen as a factor in his early death) and for prematurely behaving as Edward's consort when she was his mistress. These claims were denied by Queen Elizabeth's close friends, such as the Duke of Grafton, who wrote that she [...] "never said anything nasty about the Duchess of Windsor, except to say she really hadn't got <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> she was dealing with." [...] On the other hand, the Duchess of Windsor referred to Queen Elizabeth as [...] "Mrs Temple" [...] and [...] "Cookie", alluding to her solid figure and fondness for food, and to her daughter, Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II), as [...] "Shirley", as in Shirley Temple. The Duchess bitterly resented the denial of the royal title and the refusal of the Duke's relatives to accept her as part of the family. Within the household of the Duke and Duchess, the style [...] "Her Royal Highness" [...] was used by those who were close to the couple.|$|E
