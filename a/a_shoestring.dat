5|$|Vanaja is a 2006 Indian Telugu-language drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Rajnesh Domalpalli on a story that constituted his Master of Fine Arts thesis at Columbia University. The film was made on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget using a cast of non-professional first-timers {{for two and a half}} months.|$|E
5|$|After {{three months}} of closure due to the Pawnee budget crisis and {{government}} shutdown, Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly informs her fellow employees that the parks department has been reopened, although on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget. State auditors Chris (Rob Lowe) and Ben (Adam Scott) announce they may only conduct existing park maintenance, but Leslie wants to offer better programs and services. Meanwhile, the always-optimistic Chris continues trying to convince Ann (Rashida Jones) {{to go on a}} date with him. Ann finds him too intense, but Leslie convinces her to accept a date and try to persuade Chris to increase the parks budget.|$|E
5|$|For the U.S. Air Force, {{this success}} was {{achieved}} by conducting <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> operation, one that was fourth in priority for American air assets behind operations in South Vietnam, Operation Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger. After the close-out of aerial operations over North Vietnam, Barrel Roll still remained in last place. During its existence the campaign had utilized an average of only {{ten percent of the}} Air Force's tactical air effort in Southeast Asia. During the 1972 Nguyen Hue PAVN offensive, the number of airstrikes over northern Laos was reduced to only five percent of the total.|$|E
5000|$|Not {{confusing}} was the across-the-board {{success of}} the single [...] "Mañana Campestre", which would be included in Tiempo de Resurrección, which also indicated the group's increasing tendency towards folk-symphonic rock. However, Santaolalla was able to maintain rock at <b>a</b> <b>shoestring's</b> length thanks to his distinguished electric guitar style.|$|R

5|$|Made on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> {{budget of}} , Kahaani was {{conceived}} and developed by Ghosh, who co-wrote the film with Advaita Kala. The crew often employed guerrilla-filmmaking techniques on Kolkata's city streets to avoid attracting attention. The film was {{noted for its}} deft portrayal {{of the city and}} for making use of many local crew and cast members. Kahaani explores themes of feminism and motherhood in male-dominated Indian society. The film also makes several allusions to Satyajit Ray's films such as Charulata (1964) and Aranyer Dinratri (1970).|$|E
5|$|Saria {{conceived}} Loev script {{while he}} was working on another project, and drew heavily from his personal experiences. It was eventually picked up for production despite Saria's own doubts on its viability. Principal photography took place at Mahabaleshwar, the UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Western Ghats in peninsular India, and Mumbai, in the summer of 2014. The film was shot within sixteen days by the cinematographer Sherri Kauk in 2K resolution. Made on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget, the film relied on crowdfunding and costcutting measures to meet its production costs.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the {{brothers}} started Ashby Computers and Graphics in the Leicestershire town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch with Lathbury and Tim's girlfriend, Carole Ward, whom he later married in 1985. They {{worked out of}} a four-room row house next-door to {{the brothers}}' family corner store and ran on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget for its first six months, in which they pooled their {{money to pay the}} bills. The company did not credit individuals on their releases, though they had individual roles in development: Chris and Lathbury programmed and Tim and Carole designed the graphics. Carole also served as the company's secretary. Ultimate Play the Game, as the company was publicly known, first licensed arcade cabinet conversion kits to companies before moving to the more profitable British home computer market.|$|E
50|$|Made on <b>a</b> {{non-union}} <b>shoestring</b> {{budget of}} $600,000, it {{was nominated for}} several awards when it was shown at film festivals in 1998., Though it failed to find a legitimate theatrical distributor, eventually, the film was self-released in just two theaters over the holiday weekend of July 4, 1999 and brought in $3,722.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} in Spain and made on <b>an</b> estimated <b>shoestring</b> budget of $24,000 according to Roger Ebert. Nava used English stage performers for a cast. Nava and Thomas, {{in order to save}} money, used costumes and props left over from Samuel Bronston's El Cid said Vincent Canby. Film locations include castles of ancient Segovia, Spain.|$|R
5000|$|Patrick Macias {{says that}} writer Masao Adachi, along with Wakamatsu, is {{responsible}} for much of Go, Go, Second Time Virgins thematic, political and stylistic concerns. According to Macias, this film, like other Wakamatsu films of the time, [...] "combined, in still unique manner, disjunctive New Wave style, existentialist dread, sex, sadism, and gore, all on <b>a</b> ridiculously <b>shoestring</b> budget." ...|$|R
5|$|Kubrick {{was raised}} in the Bronx, New York City, and {{attended}} William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. Although he only received average grades, Kubrick displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and film from a young age, and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school. After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he began making short films on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget, and made his first major Hollywood film, The Killing, for United Artists in 1956. This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas, the war picture Paths of Glory (1957) and the historical epic Spartacus (1960). His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew, and he was approached by Marlon Brando to film what would become One-Eyed Jacks (1961), though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself.|$|E
5|$|The school runs on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget as a {{tradeoff}} for its financial independence and accessibility to low-income students. Tuition is billed on {{a sliding scale}} based on what parents can afford. Revenue from rental properties and fundraising supplements tuition income. The Free School started a high school program in 2006. It later spun off as the Harriet Tubman Democratic High School and enrolls about 20 students in both self-directed and traditional classes. Alumni of the school have attended a variety of colleges. Journalists have noted the school's similarity to unschooling and homeschooling, and its work to that of prefigurative politics. The Albany Free School {{is one of the}} few schools remaining from the 1960s and 1970s free school movement. It inspired the program of the Brooklyn Free School.|$|E
5|$|The {{lease on}} Bryn Eglwys expired in 1942, but was {{extended}} {{on an annual}} basis. The October 1942 Bradshaw's Guide shows two return passenger trains operating only on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, taking 45 minutes in each direction. No passenger service was provided on other days. Overnight on 26 December 1946, several weakened support columns in the quarry gave way, resulting in a significant collapse; the quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately. Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway {{as long as he}} was alive and so, despite the closure of the quarry, the railway continued to run trains on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget. In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included. The reasons for this are unclear, but it is significant that all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom. Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week. In 1949 Haydn Jones, who owned the Aberllefenni Slate Quarry purchased 10 tons of rail from the recently lifted Corris Railway. On 2 July 1950 Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable, but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season, ending on 6 October.|$|E

3000|$|... “Our budget {{this year}} (2012 – 2013) is only US$ 15.763 million {{and next year}} I heard there {{is only going to}} be a 3 % increase. So, it is still <b>a</b> very small <b>shoestring</b> operation.” [...]...|$|R
50|$|Almost {{all of the}} {{infrastructure}} for the project (now known as the West Berkshire Groundwater Scheme) is still in place and maintained, albeit on <b>a</b> rather <b>shoestring</b> budget. But the lasting legacy of the scheme is that the catchment has been preserved as a near-natural groundwater system, almost totally unaffected by groundwater abstractions. This factor made it an ideal candidate for selection {{as one of the}} flagship research sites for the NERC LOCAR research project investigating permeable (i.e. groundwater dominated) catchments.|$|R
25|$|There {{was still}} theatre done on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring,</b> but several {{cultural}} entrepreneurs had raised the stakes {{to the point}} where a venue like Aurora (St Stephen's Church, Stockbridge) could hold its head up in any major world festival.|$|E
25|$|Filmed in 16mm on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget, {{the crew}} {{included}} Paul Josephson {{on camera and}} lighting, Craig Reynolds and Jay Cassidy on camera, and Jon Duff on sound recording. It was filmed mostly {{in a suburb of}} Detroit, Michigan from 1970 to 1971.|$|E
25|$|The same {{aircraft}} was also {{featured in a}} 1964 episode of Michael Bentine's BBC TV comedy programme, It's a Square World, about <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> airline {{with a staff of}} two.

5000|$|John Coates wrote that: [...] Of all {{the campaigns}} of the Second World War that can {{reasonably}} {{claim to have}} been fought on <b>a</b> logistic <b>shoestring,</b> New Guinea ranks high. The country's relative isolation, inhospitable terrain, enervating and malarious climate, and underdeveloped infrastructure meant that the maintenance and re-supply of military forces presented a continuing challenge. After a series of false starts, the Allies generally overcame their logistic difficulties; the Japanese did not. Therein lay the most important single factor in the campaign.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1970s Fenton was working {{regularly}} in television, becoming a popular choice of composer {{for dozens of}} television productions. These included <b>Shoestring,</b> <b>a</b> BBC police drama which ran for 21 episodes in 1979-1980, and Bergerac, which ran for a decade from 1981-1991, and for which he won a BAFTA in 1982.|$|R
2500|$|Early {{during the}} life of the series, some effort was made to {{slightly}} soften the original concept. For example, scenes were cut from the pilot episode, [...] "City of," [...] in which Angel tasted the blood of a murder victim; the episode that was originally written to be the second episode, [...] "Corrupt", was abandoned altogether. Writer David Fury explained, [...] "The network was shocked. They said 'We can't shoot this. This is way too dark.' We were able to break a new idea, we had to turn it over in three days." [...] Instead, the tone was lightened and the opening episodes established Angel Investigations as <b>an</b> idealistic, <b>shoestring</b> operation.|$|R
25|$|A Brand New You is {{considered}} a microbudget film and was produced on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring.</b> It was shot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the first feature film of married couple directors Kathryn Palmateer and Shawn Whitney. The film was hailed an filmmaking achievement by critics and garnered accolades for the director as a first feature.|$|E
25|$|The strong {{participation}} by AMC in Trans-Am and drag racing served to enhance its image, and notable was that its motorsports efforts were achieved on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget with the automaker racking up a respectable {{number of points}} against its giant competitors. For example, with an estimated 4.5million participants and 6million spectators, drag racing was the fastest growing segment of motorsport in the U.S. The marketing strategy was to appeal to buyers who otherwise would not give AMC a second glance.|$|E
25|$|Initially, no studio would {{finance the}} film {{because of its}} {{potentially}} controversial and off-beat subject matter. After Drugstore Cowboy received favorable critical raves and awards, studios started to show some interest. However, they all wanted their own versions made and not Van Sant's. This frustration prompted the filmmaker to attempt the feature on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget with a cast of actual street kids filling out the roles including Michael Parker and actor Rodney Harvey, {{who was going to}} play Scott.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of Buffy the Vampire Slayers success, Whedon was allowed the {{opportunity}} to make his 1999 spin-off series, Angel. David Greenwalt and Whedon collaborated on the pilot {{that was going to be}} developed for The WB Network. During the series' early expansion, efforts were made by the network to mitigate Whedon's original concept. [...] "Corrupt", a precociously optioned second episode, was entirely abandoned due to the gloominess written into the script. The tone was consequently softened, establishing in the opening episodes Angel Investigations as <b>an</b> idealistic, <b>shoestring</b> operation. It follows Angel, who works as a private detective in order to [...] "help the helpless".|$|R

25|$|In 1948, Clark was {{informed}} about a Mesolithic flint scatter {{that had been}} found in peaty deposits at Seamer Carr in North Yorkshire by an amateur archaeologist, John Moore. Clark visited this site, known as Star Carr, and realised that it may provide further evidence of a Mesolithic settlement. He oversaw three seasons of excavation at the site, in the summers of 1949, 1950, and 1951. The project was carried out on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget under the auspices of Cambridge University and the Prehistoric Society.|$|E
25|$|Peanuts {{had become}} a {{phenomenon}} worldwide by the mid-1960s, and the special was commissioned and sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company. It was written {{over a period of}} several weeks, and animated on <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget in only six months. In casting the characters, the producers went an unconventional route, hiring child actors. The program's soundtrack was similarly unorthodox: it features a jazz score by pianist Vince Guaraldi. Its absence of a laugh track (a staple in US television animation in this period), in addition to its tone, pacing, music, and animation, led both the producers and network to wrongly predict the project would be a disaster preceding its broadcast.|$|E
25|$|Shot {{in black}} and white with <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget in April 1969, Fassbinder's first feature-length film, Love is Colder than Death (1969) (Liebe ist kälter als der Tod), was a deconstruction of the American gangster films of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Fassbinder plays the lead role of Franz, a small-time pimp who is torn between his {{mistress}} Joanna, a prostitute played by Hanna Schygulla, and his friend Bruno, a gangster sent after Franz by the syndicate that he has refused to join. Joanna informs the police of a bank robbery the two men have planned. Bruno is killed in the shootout, but Franz and Joanna escape.|$|E
