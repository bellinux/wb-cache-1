These measurements are recorded on a length of a bamboo, which will serves as a kind of yardstick to create the layout of the house compound. The basic units are a depa (fathom), hasta (cubit), and musti (shaftment). Other variation are depa media (vertical version of depa), sedemak (hand), tampak (width of closed fist, with thumb hid) and lengkat (width between a tip of a thumb and the tip of the forefinger if stretched). Kaja-kangin concept is also used in construction. The first post to be erected in a pavilion is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> at the kaja-kangin corner. An offering platform is attached {{near the top of the}} kaja-kangin post. After the erection of this post, the rest of the posts are erected following clockwise direction. This clockwise principle of erecting posts is a principle repeated all over Indonesia.|$|E
500|$|The {{editorial}} duties at Wonder Stories and its related magazines {{were not}} always performed by the person who bore the title of [...] "editor" [...] in the magazine's masthead. From the beginning until the sale to Beacon Publications, Gernsback was listed as editor-in-chief; Lasser was variously listed as [...] "literary editor" [...] and [...] "managing editor", while Hornig was always listed as [...] "managing editor". Similarly, under Beacon Publications, the nominal editor (initially Leo Margulies) was not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> {{to work on the}} magazine. The following list shows who actually performed the editorial duties. More details are given in the publishing history section, above, which focuses on when the editors involved actually obtained control of the magazine contents, instead of when their names appeared on the masthead.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{steadily}} improved {{during their}} time in Hamburg, and this was noticed by other musicians who were there at the time. McCartney recalled, [...] "We got better and better and other groups started coming to watch us.

[...] The song was often played by the group, once being played for 90 minutes non-stop, with group members walking off stage to wash and drink before returning. Sutcliffe wrote a letter to his mother saying, [...] "We have improved a thousand-fold since our arrival and Allan Williams, who is here at the moment, tells us that there is no group in Liverpool to touch us." ...|$|E

500|$|Other {{writers have}} been more {{negative}} toward Lars. Jeff Gerstmann from GiantBomb considered his actions [...] "pretty dull," [...] and concluded that his inclusion in the {{leading role in the}} story mode was [...] "sloppy" [...] since, while players were able to choose any character to play with, Lars was <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> focused on during the fights. Lars was also listed by Destructoid as a runner-up for their worst haircuts in gaming. In the book The Language of Gaming, writer Astrid Ensslin commented that Lars had been criticized mostly by Western audiences because of the way his role in the Scenario Campaign mode is presented. GameSpy labeled Lars [...] "Captain Ridiculous" [...] owing to his [...] "absurd" [...] design, which they found resembled Michael Jackson. Nevertheless, they liked his gameplay mechanics, which made him a fast character, and allowed him to overpower his opponents. 1UP.com [...] also praised Lars' moves, mentioning their balance between speed and strength. Both 1UP and IGN AU considered his appearance ridiculous, comparing him with Final Fantasy protagonists, despite his integral role in the story. Nevertheless, both of them praised his moves. Similarly, GameFocus called Lars a [...] "dud" [...] and a [...] "Dragon Ball reject". Videogamer.com called Lars [...] "the emo," [...] adding that his hairstyle and cape are [...] "classic Tekken".|$|E

2500|$|Children of Bodom's {{first world}} tour began in 2003 and lasted until late 2004. The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the {{consolidation}} of the band in North America, but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons {{right in the middle}} of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that, [...] "Well, I try to be careful about what I say about him because there is no bad blood between us. He told me that he just got sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller and suddenly he made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. This whole situation involves a new girlfriend." [...] Griffin's guitarist Kai Nergaard was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in Moscow on 16 August.|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff {{was known}} for his {{technical}} ability, speed, acceleration, dribbling and vision, possessing an awareness of his teammates' positions as an attack unfolded. Despite his unimpressive stature and strength, Cruyff's tactical brain and reading of the game were exceptional. “Football consists of different elements: technique, tactics and stamina,” he told the journalists Henk van Dorp and Frits Barend, in one of the interviews collected in their book Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff. [...] "There are some people who might have better technique than me, and some may be fitter than me, but the main thing is tactics. With most players, tactics are missing. You can divide tactics into insight, trust and daring. In the tactical area, I think I just have more than most other players." [...] On the concept of technique in football, Cruyff once said: [...] "Technique is not being able to juggle a ball 1,000 times. Anyone can do that by practising. Then you can work in the circus. Technique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your team mate." [...] As Van Basten noted, “Johan is so technically perfect that even as a boy he stopped being interested in that aspect of the game. He could do everything when he was 20. That’s why he’s been very interested in tactics since he was very young. He sees football situations so clearly that he was <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> to decide how the game should be played.” In 1997, Dutch journalist Hubert Smeets wrote, [...] "Cruyff was the first player who understood that he was an artist, and the first who was able and willing to collectivise the art of sports." [...] Sports writer David Miller believed Cruyff superior to any previous player in his ability to extract the most from others. He dubbed him [...] "Pythagoras in boots" [...] for the complexity and precision of his passes and wrote, [...] "Few have been able to exact, both physically and mentally, such mesmeric control on a match from one penalty area to another." ...|$|E
