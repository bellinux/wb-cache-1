5|$|After the {{assassination}} of the King at the Stockholm opera in 1792, support for the liberal arts was withdrawn. Bellman, <b>already</b> in poor health from alcoholism, went into decline, drinking increasingly heavily. His drinking very likely contributed to his gout, which troubled him badly in 1790. He also caught tuberculosis: the disease had <b>already</b> killed his mother, and by the winter of 1792, he was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|And {{there were}} <b>already</b> {{problems}} with the system. The anti-personnel portion of the program had <b>already</b> failed. The presence and movements of enemy troops were to be detected by the utilization of small, wide-area Gravel mines that were to alert the acoustic sensors. Unfortunately, the mines rapidly deteriorated in the heat and humidity of Laos, nullifying their effectiveness. The focus of any interdiction campaign, therefore, would have to concentrate on PAVN supply transportation. The war against trucks was about to begin.|$|E
5|$|At the Potsdam Conference in Germany, Truman was {{informed}} that the Trinity test had been successful. He told Stalin, {{the leader of the}} Soviet Union, that the US had a new superweapon, without giving any details.

With the authorization to use the bomb against Japan <b>already</b> given, no alternatives were considered after the Japanese rejection of the Potsdam Declaration.|$|E
5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were <b>already</b> out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had <b>already</b> been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had <b>already</b> gone a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E

5|$|Following Erica's heavy rains, it was {{feared that}} the <b>already</b> {{existing}} dengue fever epidemic would become more widespread. Prior to Erica, there were <b>already</b> 437 cases of dengue fever in 2003 alone. The risk for leptospirosis was also increased by Erica. High winds and strong rains resulted in damages of at least US$15 million, particularly to schools. Two fatalities total were reported {{as a result of}} Erica.

5|$|If {{there is}} a clause both of whose {{variables}} are <b>already</b> set, {{in a way that}} falsifies the clause, then the algorithm backtracks to its most recent choice point, undoing the assignments it made since that choice, and reverses the decision made at that choice. If there is no choice point, or if the algorithm has <b>already</b> backtracked over the most recent choice point, then it aborts the search and reports that the input 2-CNF formula is unsatisfiable.|$|E
5|$|In Dexter (season 3), episode 10 ("Go Your Own Way"), {{the title}} {{character}} gains access to Miguel Prado's personal study by telling Prado's housekeeper, Norma, {{he wants to give}} Prado a best man gift of a García Márquez limited edition book Prado doesn't <b>already</b> have, that Dexter needs to see which books are <b>already</b> in Prado's library, and Norma should keep the gift and visit a secret.|$|E
