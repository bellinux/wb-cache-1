5|$|Some viruses {{store their}} entire genomes {{in the form}} of RNA, and contain no DNA at <b>all.</b> <b>Because</b> they use RNA to store genes, their {{cellular}} hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription. On the other hand, RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, require the reverse transcription of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized. RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals.|$|E

Burnett wrote: Oregonians were <b>all</b> honest, <b>because</b> {{there was nothing}} to steal; they were <b>all</b> sober, <b>because</b> there was no liquor to drink; there were no misers, because there was no money to hoard; and they were <b>all</b> industrious, <b>because</b> it was work or starve.|$|R

5|$|The {{meat and}} blubber of the {{dolphins}} caught {{has been found}} to have high levels of mercury, cadmium, the pesticide DDT, and organic contaminants like PCBs. The levels are high enough to pose a health risk for those frequently eating the meat and researchers warn that children and pregnant women shouldn't eat the meat at <b>all.</b> <b>Because</b> of the health concerns, the price of dolphin meat has decreased significantly.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{thought in}} Victorian healthcare concerning {{the transmission of}} contagious diseases was the miasma theory, which held that most communicable diseases were caused by the inhalation of contaminated air. This contamination could {{take the form of}} the odour of rotting corpses or sewage, but also rotting vegetation, or the exhaled breath of someone already diseased. Miasma was believed by most to be the vector of transmission of cholera, which was on the rise in 19th-century Europe. The disease was deeply feared by <b>all,</b> <b>because</b> of the speed with which it could spread, and its high fatality rates.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{right whale}} spends the summer months in the far Southern Ocean feeding, probably close to Antarctica. It migrates north in winter for breeding, and can be seen around the coasts of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay. Since hunting of the {{southern right whale}} ceased, stocks are estimated to have grown by 7% a year. The South American, South African and Australasian groups apparently intermix very little, if at <b>all,</b> <b>because</b> of the strong fidelity of mothers to their feeding and calving grounds. The mother passes these instincts to her calves.|$|E
50|$|In Tarot's {{universe}} magick is a {{real and}} very powerful force.

25|$|Gallo is also {{threatened}} by the Breton language revival, because Breton is gaining ground in territories that were not previously part of the main Breton-speaking area, and most of <b>all</b> <b>because</b> Breton appears as the national language of Brittany, thus leaving no place for Gallo.|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{crops in}} all of Queensland and all but the Riverina in NSW, which had needed some fine weather to finish, were almost {{completely}} destroyed by the excessive rainfall.

25|$|The Foreigner Talk (FT) {{hypothesis}} {{argues that}} a pidgin or creole language forms when native speakers attempt to simplify their language {{in order to address}} speakers who do not know their language at <b>all.</b> <b>Because</b> of the similarities found in this type of speech and speech directed to a small child, it is also sometimes called baby talk.|$|E
25|$|Queens of P. snelleni produce males before females, {{which is}} called protandrous production.

They mate in order to make diploid female offspring.|$|E

25|$|The fishery {{has yet to}} recover, and may {{not recover}} at <b>all</b> <b>because</b> of a {{possibly}} stable change in the food chain. Atlantic cod was a top-tier predator, along with haddock, flounder and hake, feeding upon smaller prey such as herring, capelin, shrimp and snow crab. With the large predatory fish removed, their prey has had a population explosion and have become the top predators.|$|E

After the First Battalion arrived in Bakloh, in 1866, the Second, Third, and Fourth Battalion of the regiment were raised in Bakloh.|$|E
25|$|Some of his assertions seem {{paradoxical}} {{and difficult}} to understand at first glance, {{not only because they}} are taken out of context, but above <b>all</b> <b>because</b> our habits of thought make us reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world instead of trying to attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.|$|E
