50|$|Insurgency: an organized, {{protracted}} political warfare tool {{designed to}} weaken the control and eliminate the legitimacy of an established government, occupying power, or other political authority. An insurgency is an internal conflict, and the primary struggle is to mobilize local populations for political control and gain popular support towards the insurgents' cause. Insurgencies include political and military objectives, with the end goal of establishing a legitimate, rival state structure. Insurgencies are unconventional military conflicts which incorporate a variety of methods, ranging from coercive tools like intimidation and assassination, to political tools like propaganda and social services. An insurgency's <b>approaches</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> could involve perpetual disorder and violence demonstrating the government's inability to provide security for the populace, weakening the government and killing or intimidating any effective opposition against the government, intimidating the population and discouraging its participation in - or support for - political or legal processes, controlling or intimidating police and military forces (which limits their {{ability to respond to}} insurgent attacks) or by creating government repression by provoking over-reactions by security or military forces.|$|E

Against this background, {{the significance of}} human-biometeorologically orientated urban planning strategies is increas-ing by which the impairment of thermal comfort for people in cities in the future can be minimised. Such strategies require quantitative information on factors determining human thermal comfort within different urban quarters.

We recorded EEG while children with ASD and typical peers played a computerized game involving peer rejection. Children with ASD reported ostracism-related distress comparable to typically developing children. Event-related potentials (ERPs) indicated a distinct pattern of temporal processing of rejection events in children with ASD. While typically developing children showed enhanced response to rejection at a late slow wave indexing emotional arousal and regulation, those with autism showed attenuation at an early component, suggesting reduced engagement of attentional resources in the aversive social context. Results emphasize the importance of studying the time course of social information processing in ASD; they suggest distinct mechanisms subserving similar overt behavior and yield insights relevant to development and implementation of targeted treatment <b>approaches</b> <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> measures of response to treatment...|$|R

The study of the writing and dissemination of the so-called Artes moriendi has a long tradition, which {{has its roots in}} the pioneering researches carried out by Annales historians, who –as we know– have inaugurated a series of studies, which could even have very different <b>approaches</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives,</b> and which are usually listed under the common label of ‘the history of death’. In particular, the first historians who studied the literature on well dying were Alberto Tenenti, who focused on the phase of the genre origins, and later on Roger Chartier and Daniel Roche, who specifically examined the French context in the modern age. Currently, despite the literal ‘explosion’ of the ‘historiography of death’, recorded since the early Nineties of the last century, the interest for a systematic study of the Artes moriendi –apart from important works such as the one carried out by Fernando Martínez Gil for Spain– is still poorly grown or, at best, as its the case with the Italian context, it is pursued in a circumscribed way, i. e. a latere of researches focusing on other types of sources, such as the wills, or on specific personalities whose literary production includes also a text on ars moriendi...|$|E

In view of its relevance and major investments in this area, there is great interest in different sectors of society to observe the impact of the IDE, its evolution and future scenarios.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} “new climate politics of decarbonisation” {{and the role}} of the state as a site for progressive climate action. This new politics concerns transformative social change aimed at moving society away from its current dependence on fossil carbon energy. A transition to low-carbon societal development hinges on restructuring and decarbonising those key systems, structures and practices that generate carbon emissions. Engaging with theoretical perspectives on the state in environmental governance and its role in steering policy change and enabling system transformations, I examine how the state can govern decarbonisation through exploring empirical examples across a wide range of policy sectors such as energy, transport and industry. Given the centrality of state authority in the organisation of modern society, a low carbon transition is conditioned on authoritative steering, long-term active support of state institutions and a diversified portfolio of policy <b>approaches</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives.</b> The material for this compilation thesis is drawn from the Swedish policy realm. The included papers analyse the development of arrangements for environmental governance, climate policy discourse and institutional conditions for governing low-carbon transitions by means of public policy in Sweden. A key insight across these papers is that the state remains a critical site for steering and enabling system transformations. A modern (environmental) welfare state, such as Sweden, holds untapped capacities to govern decarbonisation by progressively advancing and scaling up the efforts to reorient societal development. Thus, a decarbonising state can be made more actively engaged in steering and enabling processes of low-carbon transitions, and could explore new ways for orchestrating a wide range of low-carbon initiatives and developments...|$|E

30|$|Understanding the {{differences}} and similarities among alternative approaches to classifying forest community types across broad extents is important, {{especially in the}} face of global change drivers. The three classifications we examined here show the strongest similarity for forest types that are relatively restricted in range and vary little in tree species composition. But the classifications differ in other cases, such as for wide-ranging, general forest types. Those general patterns point to {{the differences}} among classifications in terms of their <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives.</b> The empirical classification was predicted best by environmental variables, and, along with the FIA classification, was highly related to a set of environmental variables measured at a range of scales. Coarse-grain climate variables were the most important for predicting the USNVC classification, but other variables related to the local environment were moderately important for that classification. Therefore, these classifications will all have utility for studies of multi-scale environmental correlates of forest communities, including under global change scenarios.|$|R
