25|$|An <b>anomalistic</b> <b>month</b> {{is longer}} than a sidereal month because the perigee moves in the same {{direction}} as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in nine years. Therefore, the Moon takes a little longer to return to perigee than to return to the same star.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} periods {{associated with the}} lunar orbit. The sidereal month is {{the time it takes}} to make one complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars. It is about 27.32 days. The synodic month is the time it takes the Moon to reach the same visual phase. This varies notably throughout the year, but averages around 29.53 days. The synodic period is longer than the sidereal period because the Earth–Moon system moves in its orbit around the Sun during each sidereal month, hence a longer period is required to achieve a similar alignment of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. The <b>anomalistic</b> <b>month</b> is the time between perigees and is about 27.55 days. The Earth–Moon separation determines the strength of the lunar tide raising force.|$|E

2500|$|It {{had been}} {{known for a long}} time that the motion of the Moon is not uniform: its speed varies.

2500|$|Saros : The {{best known}} eclipse cycle, {{and one of}} the best for {{predicting}} eclipses, in which 223 synodic months equal 242 draconic months with an error of only 51 minutes. [...] It is also close to 239 <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months,</b> which makes the circumstances between two eclipses one saros apart very similar.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{thing to}} {{consider}} is that {{the motion of the}} Moon is not a perfect circle. [...] Its orbit is distinctly elliptic, so the lunar distance from Earth varies throughout the lunar cycle. This varying distance changes the apparent diameter of the Moon, and therefore influences the chances, duration, and type (partial, annular, total, mixed) of an eclipse. [...] This orbital period is called the <b>anomalistic</b> <b>month,</b> and together with the synodic month causes the so-called [...] "full moon cycle" [...] of about 14 lunations in the timings and appearances of full (and new) Moons. The Moon moves faster when it is closer to the Earth (near perigee) and slower when it is near apogee (furthest distance), thus periodically changing the timing of syzygies by up to ±14 hours (relative to their mean timing), and changing the apparent lunar angular diameter by about ±6%. [...] An eclipse cycle must comprise close to an integer number of anomalistic months in order to perform well in predicting eclipses.|$|E
2500|$|The saros, {{a period}} of 6585.3211 days (14 common years + 4 leap years + 11.321 days, or 13 common years + 5 leap years + 10.321 days), is useful for {{predicting}} the times at which nearly identical eclipses will occur. Three periodicities related to lunar orbit, the synodic month, the draconic month, and the <b>anomalistic</b> <b>month</b> coincide almost perfectly each saros cycle. For an eclipse to occur, either the Moon must be located between the Earth and Sun (for a solar eclipse) or the Earth must be located between the Sun and Moon (for a lunar eclipse). This can happen only when the Moon is new or full, respectively, and repeat occurrences of these lunar phases result from solar and lunar orbits producing the Moon's synodic period of 29.53059 days. During most full and new moons, however, {{the shadow of the}} Earth or Moon falls to the north or south of the other body. Eclipses occur when the three bodies form a nearly straight line. [...] Because the plane of the lunar orbit is inclined to that of the earth, this condition occurs only when a full or new Moon is near or in the ecliptic plane, that is when the moon is at one of the two nodes (the ascending or descending node). The period of time for two successive lunar passes through the ecliptic plane (returning to the same node) is termed the draconic month, a 27.21222 day period. [...] The three-dimensional geometry of an eclipse, when the new or full moon is near one of the nodes, occurs every 5 or 6 months when the Sun is in conjunction or opposition to the Moon and coincidentally also near a node of the Moon's orbit at that time, or twice per eclipse year. Two Saros eclipses have the same appearance and duration due to the distance between the Earth and Moon being nearly the same for each event because the Saros eclipse cycle is also an integer of the <b>anomalistic</b> <b>month,</b> the period of the eccentricity of lunar orbit, 27.5545 days.|$|E
2500|$|Impacts by meteorites and comets are {{the only}} abrupt {{geologic}} force acting on the Moon today, though the variation of Earth tides {{on the scale of}} the Lunar <b>anomalistic</b> <b>month</b> causes small variations in stresses. Some of the most important craters used in lunar stratigraphy formed in this recent epoch. For example, the crater Copernicus, which has a depth of 3.76km and a radius of 93km, is believed to have formed about 900 million years ago (though this is debatable). The Apollo 17 mission landed in an area in which the material coming from the crater Tycho might have been sampled. The study of these rocks seem to indicate that this crater could have formed 100 million years ago, though this is debatable as well. The surface has also experienced space weathering due to high energy particles, solar wind implantation, and micrometeorite impacts. This process causes the ray systems associated with young craters to darken until it matches the albedo of the surrounding surface. However, if the composition of the ray is different from the underlying crustal materials (as might occur when a [...] "highland" [...] ray is emplaced on the mare), the ray could be visible for much longer times.|$|E

40|$|The Saros cycle {{has been}} known since antiquity and refers to the {{periodicity}} of eclipses. It is the least common multiple of three periods: the synodic, the draconic, and the <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months.</b> We show how to obtain these periods from Newton's laws with a precision greater than 0. 02 % using only the sidereal month and year as references...|$|R
25|$|Hipparchus's draconitic lunar motion {{cannot be}} solved by the lunar-four {{arguments}} that are sometimes proposed to explain his anomalistic motion. A solution that has produced the exact 5458/5923 ratio is rejected by most historians though it uses the only anciently attested method of determining such ratios, and it automatically delivers the ratio's four-digit numerator and denominator. Hipparchus initially used (Almagest 6.9) his 141 B. C. E. eclipse with a Babylonian eclipse of 720 B. C. E. to find the less accurate ratio 7160 synodic months = 7770 draconitic months, simplified by him to 716 = 777 through division by 10. (He similarly found from the 345-year cycle the ratio 4267 synodic <b>months</b> = 4573 <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months</b> and divided by 17 to obtain the standard ratio 251 synodic <b>months</b> = 269 <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months.)</b> If he sought a longer time base for this draconitic investigation he could use his same 141 B. C. E. eclipse with a moonrise 1245 B. C. E. eclipse from Babylon, an interval of 13645 synodic months = 148807 1/2 draconitic months ≈ 14623 1/2 <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months.</b> Dividing by 5/2 produces 5458 synodic months = 5923 precisely. The obvious main objection is that the early eclipse is unattested though that is not surprising in itself {{and there is no}} consensus on whether Babylonian observations were recorded this remotely. Though Hipparchus's tables formally went back only to 747 B. C. E., 600 years before his era, the tables were actually good back to before the eclipse in question because as only recently noted their use in reverse is no more difficult than forwards.|$|R

50|$|The <b>anomalistic</b> <b>month,</b> i.e. {{the mean}} {{period for the}} Moon's {{approximately}} monthly accelerations and decelerations in its rate of movement against the stars, had a Babylonian estimate of 27.5545833 days, to compare with a modern value 27.554551 days.|$|E
50|$|Eclipses only {{occur in}} the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the {{ascending}} or descending node of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is {{a little less than}} half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months</b> and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months</b> or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the earth and the series ends. Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the saros, the inex is {{not close}} to an integer number of <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months</b> so {{successive}} eclipses are not very similar in their appearance and characteristics. From the remainder of 0.67351, being near , every third eclipse will have a similar position in the moon's elliptical orbit and apparent diameter, so {{the quality of the}} solar eclipse (total versus annular) will repeat in these groupings of 3 cycles (87 years minus 2 months), called triads.|$|R
25|$|Triad: A triple inex, {{with the}} {{advantage}} {{that it has}} nearly an integer number of <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months,</b> which makes the circumstances between two eclipses one Triad apart very similar, but at the opposite latitude.

Saros 130, 133, 136, 139, 142 and 145, for example, all produce mainly total central eclipses.|$|R
50|$|Finally, the Moon's perigee {{is moving}} {{forwards}} or precessing in its orbit {{and makes a}} complete circuit in 8.85 years. The time between one perigee and the next is slightly longer than the sidereal month and known as the <b>anomalistic</b> <b>month.</b>|$|E

50|$|Because of the non-integer {{number of}} <b>anomalistic</b> <b>month</b> each eclipse varies in type, i.e. total vs. annular, and greatly varies in length.

50|$|The pre-Columbian Maya used a {{calculation}} {{in their own}} observations of eclipse cycles in which {{a period of three}} tritoses was approximated by 11960 days, based on 46 periods of their tzolk'in calendar (i.e. 46 × 260 days). The number of <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months</b> in a tritos (144.68), having a fraction near , means every third eclipse is in nearly the same position in the elliptical orbit, so eclipses will have similar timing and total versus annular quality.|$|R
50|$|Triad: A triple inex, {{with the}} {{advantage}} {{that it has}} nearly an integer number of <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months,</b> which makes the circumstances between two eclipses one Triad apart very similar, but at the opposite latitude.

50|$|The exeligmos is 669 synodic months (every eclipse cycle must be {{an integer}} number of synodic months), almost exactly 726 draconic months (which ensures the sun and moon are in {{alignment}} during the new moon), and also almost exactly 717 <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months</b> (ensuring the moon {{is at the same}} point of its elliptic orbit). The first two factors make this a long lasting eclipse series. The latter factor is what makes each eclipse in an exeligmos so similar. The near integer number of <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months</b> ensures that the apparent diameter of the moon will be nearly the same with each successive eclipse. The fact that it is very nearly a whole integer of days ensures each successive eclipse in the series occurs very close to the previous eclipse in the series.For each successive eclipse in an exeligmos series the longitude and latitude can change significantly because an exeligmos is over a month longer than a calendar year, and the gamma increases/decreases because an exeligmos is about three hours shorter than a draconic month. The sun's apparent diameter also changes significantly in one month, affecting the length and width of a solar eclipse.|$|R
5000|$|The Moon's orbit approximates an ellipse {{rather than}} a circle. However, the {{orientation}} (as well as the shape) of this orbit is not fixed. In particular, {{the position of the}} extreme points (the line of the apsides: perigee and apogee), makes a full circle (lunar precession) in about 3,233 days (8.85 years). It takes the Moon longer to return to the same apsis because it moved ahead during one revolution. This longer period is called the <b>anomalistic</b> <b>month,</b> and has an average length of [...] days (27 d 13 h 18 min 33.2 s). The apparent diameter of the Moon varies with this period, and therefore this type has some relevance for the prediction of eclipses (see Saros), whose extent, duration, and appearance (whether total or annular) depend on the exact apparent diameter of the Moon. The apparent diameter of the full moon varies with the full moon cycle which is the beat period of the synodic and <b>anomalistic</b> <b>month,</b> and also the period after which the apsides point to the Sun again.|$|E

50|$|The second {{precession}} {{is that of}} {{the major}} axis of the Moon's elliptical orbit (the line of the apsides from perigee to apogee), which precesses eastward by 360 degrees in approximately 8.85 years. This is the reason that an <b>anomalistic</b> <b>month</b> (the period of time that the Moon moves from the perigee to the apogee and to the perigee again) is longer than the sidereal month (the period of time when the Moon completes one revolution with respect to the fixed stars). This apsidal precession completes one rotation in {{the same time as the}} number of sidereal months exceeds the number of anomalistic months by exactly one, after about 3233 days (8.85 years).|$|E
50|$|Because synodic and <b>anomalistic</b> <b>months</b> {{differ by}} almost two days, perigee and full moon {{alignments}} will drift relative to one another. The beat {{period between the}} two is about 13.9443 synodic months (about 411.8 days). Thus approximately every 14th full moon will be a supermoon. However, halfway through the cycle the full moon will be close to apogee, and the new moons immediately before and after can be supermoons. Depending on the interpretation of the definition there may be between three and six supermoons per cycle.|$|R
5|$|Eclipses only {{occur in}} the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the {{ascending}} or descending node of the Moon.

Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active. The next solar eclipse will occur on February 15, 2018. It will be a partial solar eclipse visible from Antarctica and south South America.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first is}} {{described}} in Ptolemy's Almagest IV.2.
