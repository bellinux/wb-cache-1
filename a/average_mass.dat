Tellurium is about as abundant as iridium. In contrast to its low abundance in crustal rock, iridium is relatively common in meteorites, with concentrations of 0.5ppm or more. The overall concentration of iridium on Earth is thought to be much higher than what is observed in crustal rocks, but because of the density and siderophilic ("iron-loving") character of iridium, it descended below the crust and into Earth's core when the planet was still molten.|$|E

25|$|Locust swarms {{fly with}} the wind at roughly {{the speed of the}} wind. They can cover from 100 to 200 {{kilometers}} in a day, and will fly up to about 2,000 meters above sea level (thereafter, it becomes too cold). Therefore, swarms cannot cross tall mountain ranges such as the Atlas, the Hindu Kush or the Himalayas. They will not venture into the rain forests of Africa nor into central Europe. However, locust adults and swarms regularly cross the Red Sea between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and are even reported to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to the Caribbean in ten days during the 1987-89 plague. A single swarm can cover up to 1200 square kilometers and can contain between 40 and 80 million locusts per square kilometer (a total of around 50 to 100 billion locusts per swarm, representing 100,000 to 200,000 tons, considering an <b>average</b> <b>mass</b> of 2 grams per cricket).

Differences in <b>average</b> cell <b>mass</b> are shown to be associated with similar differences in average cell volume. Changes in volume associated with changes in thymine concentration are shown to be due primarily to differences in the width of cells. It is proposed that extension in length of the cell envelope occurs at a linear rate which is proportional to the growth rate and which doubles at the time of termination of rounds of replication. Changes in volume not associated with a change in growth rate are therefore accommodated by a change in cell width.
