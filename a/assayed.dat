5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently <b>assayed</b> by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{selecting}} {{for improvement}} in the <b>assayed</b> function simply generates improvements in the <b>assayed</b> function. To understand how these improvements are achieved, {{the properties of the}} evolving enzyme have to be measured. Improvement of the <b>assayed</b> activity can be due to improvements in enzyme catalytic activity or enzyme concentration. There is also no guarantee that improvement on one substrate will improve activity on another. This is particularly important when the desired activity cannot be directly screened or selected for and so a ‘proxy’ substrate is used. DE can lead to evolutionary specialisation to the proxy without improving the desired activity. Consequently, choosing appropriate screening or selection conditions is vital for successful DE.|$|E

25|$|When {{assaying}} epistasis {{within a}} gene, site-directed mutagenesis {{can be used}} to generate the different genes, and their protein products can be <b>assayed</b> (e.g. for stability or catalytic activity).

Epistasis is measured as the difference between the effects of the mutations together versus the sum of their individual effects. This can be expressed as a free energy of interaction.|$|E
40|$|To date, {{multiplexing}} cell-based <b>assay</b> {{is essential}} for high-throughput screening of molecular targets.

We described here the protocol of live-cell luciferase <b>assay</b> as a first step of multiplexing cell-based <b>assay</b> of drug-resistant cells which expresses firefly luciferase.

A standardized, easy to perform phagocytosis <b>assay</b> for pneumococci {{would be a great}} asset for the evaluation of the potential efficacy of (experimental) pneumococcal vaccines. Such an <b>assay</b> could replace the laborious phagocytosis <b>assay</b> of viable pneumococci (classical killing <b>assay).</b> Therefore, a newly developed phagocytosis <b>assay</b> based on flow cytometry (flow <b>assay)</b> was compared with the conventional killing <b>assay</b> and enzyme-linked immunosorbent <b>assay</b> (ELISA), using sera obtained from adults pre- and postvaccination with either a bivalent conjugate, a tetravalent conjugate, or the 23 -valent polysaccharide vaccine. Highly significant correlations were observed between flow <b>assay</b> phagocytosis titers, killing <b>assay</b> phagocytosis titers, and ELISA antibody titers for serotype 6 B and 23 F as well.

25|$|Experimental {{evidence}} {{also suggests}} that gene expression can oscillate with the period seen in dividing wild-type cells independently of the CDK machinery. Orlando et al. used microarrays to measure {{the expression of a}} set of 1,271 genes that they identified as periodic in both wild type cells and cells lacking all S-phase and mitotic cyclins (clb1,2,3,4,5,6). Of the 1,271 genes <b>assayed,</b> 882 continued to be expressed in the cyclin-deficient cells {{at the same time as}} in the wild type cells, despite the fact that the cyclin-deficient cells arrest at the border between G1 and S phase. However, 833 of the genes <b>assayed</b> changed behavior between the wild type and mutant cells, indicating that these genes are likely directly or indirectly regulated by the CDK-cyclin machinery. Some genes that continued to be expressed on time in the mutant cells were also expressed at different levels in the mutant and wild type cells. These findings suggest that while the transcriptional network may oscillate independently of the CDK-cyclin oscillator, they are coupled in a manner that requires both to ensure the proper timing of cell cycle events. Other work indicates that phosphorylation, a post-translational modification, of cell cycle transcription factors by Cdk1 may alter the localization or activity of the transcription factors in order to tightly control timing of target genes.|$|E

25|$|The simple {{observation}} that cells {{of a given}} type are similar in size, {{and the question of}} how this similarity is maintained, has long fascinated cell biologists. The study of cell size control in budding yeast began in earnest in the mid 1970s, when the regulation of the budding yeast cell cycle was first being elucidated by Lee Hartwell and colleagues. Seminal work in 1977 found that yeast cells maintain a constant size by delaying their entry into the cell cycle (as <b>assayed</b> by budding) until they have grown to a threshold size. Later worked refined this result to show that Start specifically, rather than some other aspect of the G1-S transition, is controlled by the size threshold.|$|E

40|$|The optimal {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) DNA quantitative <b>assay</b> {{for clinical}} use remains to be determined. We examined the sensitivity, linearity, and variability of a novel second-generation antibody capture solution hybridization <b>assay,</b> the Digene Hybrid Capture II <b>assay</b> (HCII), and compared it with another widely used solution hybridization <b>assay,</b> the branched-DNA (bDNA) <b>assay</b> (Quantiplex; Chiron Corp.). Our results showed similar and satisfactory <b>assay</b> linearity values, as well as interassay and intra-assay variability values, for both HCII and bDNA <b>assays</b> across different ranges of HBV DNA. Ninety-one percent of 102 serum samples from hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients showed concordant results with the two <b>assays.</b> The HCH <b>assay</b> was more sensitive than the bDNA <b>assay</b> by 1 dilution, with the lowest reading being 0. 9 pg/ml (3. 8 pg/ml by bDNA <b>assay).</b> The HBV DNA seropositivity rates for the 102 samples were 58, 67, and 97 % by bDNA, HCII, and nested PCR, respectively. While the relationship between results obtained with the bDNA <b>assay</b> and those with the HCII <b>assay</b> was nonlinear, with the bDNA <b>assay</b> yielding values 2. 83 ± 0. 92 -fold {{higher than those of}} the HCII <b>assay,</b> especially at high HBV DNA levels, a linear relationship was observed between the two sets of data after logarithmic conversion. The formula for interassay conversion of results was derived as follows: HBV DNA by HCII (picograms per milliliter) = 3. 19 x [HBV DNA by bDNA (megaequivalents per milliliter) ] 0. 866. The HCII <b>assay</b> was technically less complex and required a shorter <b>assay</b> time (4 h) than the bDNA <b>assay</b> (24 h). We conclude that the HCII <b>assay</b> compares favorably with the bDNA <b>assay</b> and offers the additional advantages of increased sensitivity and shorter <b>assay</b> time.

25|$|An {{alternative}} to selection is a screening system.
