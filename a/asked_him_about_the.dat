25|$|The most prominent, {{and arguably}} most influential, {{component}} of Kublai Khan's early life was his study and strong attraction to contemporary Chinese culture. Kublai invited Haiyun, the leading Buddhist monk in North China, to his ordo in Mongolia. When he met Haiyun in Karakorum in 1242, Kublai <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> philosophy of Buddhism. Haiyun named Kublai's son, {{who was born}} in 1243, Zhenjin (Chinese: True Gold). Haiyun also introduced Kublai to the formerly Daoist and now Buddhist monk, Liu Bingzhong. Liu was a painter, calligrapher, poet, and mathematician, and he became Kublai's advisor when Haiyun returned to his temple in modern Beijing. Kublai soon added the Shanxi scholar Zhao Bi to his entourage. Kublai employed people of other nationalities as well, for he was keen to balance local and imperial interests, Mongol and Turk.|$|E

After first hearing it, the singer said that she started to cry, noticing the vastness of the music, and she started writing the lyrics for [...] "Marry the Night". [...] "Marry the Night" [...] was originally recorded on the Bus Studio in 2010, but was later mixed at The Mix Room in Burbank, California by Dave Russell, assisted by Paul Pavao. Gaga described the song as a [...] "massive, gas-station, disco record", and she recorded it immediately after completing the lyrics.

500|$|In {{the second}} week of June Catesby met in London the {{principal}} Jesuit in England, Father Henry Garnet, and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> morality of entering into an undertaking which might involve the destruction of the innocent, together with the guilty. [...] Garnet answered that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account later admonished Catesby during a second meeting in July in Essex, showing him a letter from the pope which forbade rebellion. [...] Soon after, the Jesuit priest Oswald Tesimond told Garnet he had taken Catesby's confession, in the course of which he had learnt of the plot. [...] Garnet and Catesby met for a third time on 24July 1605, at the house of the wealthy catholic Anne Vaux in Enfield Chase. [...] Garnet decided that Tesimond's account had been given under the seal of the confessional, and that canon law therefore forbade him to repeat what he had heard. [...] Without acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot, Garnet attempted to dissuade Catesby from his course, to no avail. [...] Garnet wrote to a colleague in Rome, Claudio Acquaviva, expressing his concerns about open rebellion in England. [...] He also told Acquaviva that [...] "there is a risk that some private endeavour may commit treason or use force against the King", and urged the pope to issue a public brief against the use of force.|$|E

500|$|Garnet first {{appeared}} {{in front of the}} Privy Council on 13 February 1606. Present were John Popham, Edward Coke, Sir William Waad, and the Earls of Worcester, Northampton, Nottingham and Salisbury. [...] Superficially, they treated him with respect, removing their hats and addressing him as [...] "Mr Garnet", although they made fun of his relationship with Anne Vaux, claiming he was her lover, not her confessor. During his questioning he admitted some of his movements, and that he had received Catesby's letter on 6 November, but he denied being involved in the plot, whose members he did not name. [...] Garnet was convinced that his captors were interested only in the failed scheme and believed {{he might be able to}} clear his name, but the councillors also <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> doctrine of equivocation. [...] His own treatise on this topic, one of the [...] "heretical, treasonable and damnable books" [...] found amongst Francis Tresham's possessions, was laid on the council table before him. [...] Although it condemned lying, Garnet's treatise supported the notion that when questioned, for instance, on the presence of a priest in his house, a Catholic might [...] "securely in conscience" [...] answer [...] "No" [...] if he had a [...] "secret meaning reserved in his mind". [...] The occasions on which a Catholic might legitimately use equivocation, he supposed, were limited, but such replies could be taken as an example of insincerity or deviousness—especially to the king's council, who may not have wanted to see Garnet prove his case. [...] The council's view of equivocation was very different from Garnet's. [...] In their eyes, it was simple deceit.|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E
