5|$|July: Sun <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> drop Solaris-on-Itanium plans.|$|E
5|$|June: HP <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> {{announce}} partnership.|$|E
5|$|In August 2001, Microsoft Corporation, Hewlett-Packard <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> Corporation co-sponsored the {{submission}} of specifications for C# {{as well as}} the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) to the standards organization Ecma International.|$|E
50|$|Competitors {{included}} Nvidia's Quadro-branded and to {{some extent}} Tesla-branded product series <b>and</b> <b>Intel's</b> Xeon Phi-branded products.|$|R
50|$|In the {{education}} market, NComputing also competes with low-cost laptop solutions such as OLPC’s XO laptop <b>and</b> <b>Intel’s</b> Classmate PC.|$|R
50|$|XvBA is {{a direct}} {{competitor}} to NVIDIA's Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix (VDPAU) <b>and</b> <b>Intel's</b> Video Acceleration API (VA API).|$|R
5|$|NeXTSTEP's processor-independent {{capabilities}} {{were retained}} in Mac OS X, leading to both PowerPC <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> x86 versions (although only PowerPC versions were publicly available before 2006). Apple moved to Intel processors by August 2006.|$|E
5|$|October: Intel announces new {{releases}} of Intel C++ Compiler <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> Fortran Compiler for x86/x64, while Itanium support is only available in older versions.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} lack of {{software}} could be a serious problem for the future, Intel made thousands of these early systems available to independent software vendors (ISVs) to stimulate development. HP <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> brought the next-generation Itanium2 processor to market a year later.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> {{third parties}} have {{published}} benchmark results to substantiate performance leadership claims over other commercial, open source and AMD compilers <b>and</b> libraries on <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> non-Intel processors. <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> AMD have documented flags {{to use on}} the Intel compilers to get optimal performance on <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> AMD processors. Nevertheless, the Intel compilers {{have been known to}} produce sub-optimal code for processors from other vendors than Intel. For example, Steve Westfield wrote in a 2005 article at the AMD website: ...|$|R
50|$|EPOC32 was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} ARM family of processors, including the ARM7, ARM9, StrongARM <b>and</b> <b>Intel's</b> XScale, but can be compiled towards target devices using several other processor types.|$|R
50|$|On 25 July 2011, TilePro {{processor}} {{was found}} by Facebook to be 3-times more energy-efficient than Intel's x86, based on Facebook's experiments on servers using TilePro processor <b>and</b> <b>Intel's</b> x86.|$|R
5|$|Starting in November 2010, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of new product suites, the Intel Itanium Compilers were no longer bundled with the Intel x86 compilers in a single product. Intel offers Itanium tools <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> x86 tools, including compilers, independently in different product bundles.|$|E
5|$|BackRub {{is written}} in Java and Python and runs on several Sun Ultras <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> Pentiums running Linux. The primary {{database}} is kept on a Sun Ultra series II with 28GB of disk. Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg have provided {{a great deal of}} very talented implementation help. Sergey Brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable units to operate out of a FOB was the brigade's 74th Long-Range Surveillance (LRS) detachment. 74th LRS {{operated}} out of FOB Price {{near the town of}} Gereshk in the Helmand Province. LRS provided the 173rd Brigade command group with key recon <b>and</b> <b>intel</b> of the province, and held control of Helmand with a 5th Special Forces Group ODA element. Assisting the LRS and 5th Group ODA were elements of the 82nd Airborne, Iowa National Guard, and ANA. The LRS detachment and 5th Group ODA conducted many combined and individual operations to ensure the stability of the region. The LRS detachment was also tasked at times for recon <b>and</b> <b>intel</b> gathering for other brigade assets, and target acquisition and designation for U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, and RAF aircraft. The brigade returned to Italy in March 2006. Seventeen soldiers from the brigade died during this deployment.|$|E
50|$|System {{also has}} next compilators, {{libraries}} <b>and</b> development tools: <b>Intel</b> C/C <b>and</b> Fortran, <b>Intel</b> MKL, Vtune, HP-MPI and HP UPC.|$|R

50|$|This work {{is funded}} by NSF grants CSA 07-02724 and CNS 07-20772, <b>and</b> by <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> Microsoft through the UPCRC Illinois.|$|R
5|$|HP {{believed}} that it was no longer cost-effective for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary microprocessors, so it partnered with Intel in 1994 to develop the IA-64 architecture, derived from EPIC. Intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting microprocessor would be used by the majority of enterprise systems manufacturers. HP <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> initiated a large joint development effort with a goal of delivering the first product, Merced, in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The Itanium 2 {{processor}} {{was released}} in 2002, and was marketed for enterprise servers rather than for the whole gamut of high-end computing. The first Itanium2, code-named McKinley, was jointly developed by HP <b>and</b> <b>Intel.</b> It relieved many of the performance problems of the original Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by an inefficient memory subsystem. McKinley contains 221 million transistors (of which 25 million are for logic), measured 19.5mm by 21.6mm (421mm2) and was fabricated in a 180nm, bulk CMOS process with six layers of aluminium metallization.|$|E
5|$|The Itanium bus {{interfaces}} to {{the rest}} of the system via a chipset. Enterprise server manufacturers differentiate their systems by designing and developing chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Development of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> in 2002, but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.|$|E
5000|$|Forays into physics {{processing}} {{have also}} been made, though with Nvidia's buyout of PhysX [...] <b>and</b> <b>Intel's</b> buyout of Havok, plans are that this functionality will be combined with existing CPU or GPU technologies.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> PowerPC-based servers {{can serve}} images for <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> PowerPC-based clients.|$|R
50|$|ASRock is {{also the}} first and only {{manufacturer}} of a Mini ITX-sized X99 chipset-based motherboard, the X99E-ITX/ac. It supports Haswell-E <b>and</b> Broadwell-E <b>Intel</b> Core i7 <b>and</b> Haswell-EP <b>Intel</b> Xeon CPUs with CPU core support up to 18 cores.|$|R
5|$|The {{invention}} of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry. This in turn led {{to the establishment of}} many new technology companies and regions around the country such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became {{the first of a series}} of networks which evolved into the Internet.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the graphical updates, the game received an array of new features. A few new cheats were incorporated into the game's campaign, while keeping the same cheats <b>and</b> <b>intel</b> file collectibles from the original. The multiplayer initially remained largely unchanged in terms of content from Modern Warfare. Ten of the original maps were featured at launch, while the remaining six were released as a free update several weeks later, due to the developers being unable to meet the proposed deadline. The multiplayer began to receive support over the following months, during which {{a wide range of}} new content was released to bring it more in line with recent Call of Duty installments. From December 2016, a supply drop system was introduced along with an expanded array of customization items such as emblems, calling cards, and character skins, in {{addition to}} new varieties of weapon camouflage. Further guns and melee weapons were also incorporated in the time since release. Some of the content, including new game modes and variants of existing maps, were exclusive to the game's various temporary playlists and seasonal events.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, 2007, ST <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> {{created a}} joint venture in the memory {{application}} called Numonyx. This new company merged ST <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> Flash Memory activities.|$|E
50|$|In 2011 Clay re-worked Mick Rock’s classic {{music video}} for David Bowie’s ‘Life On Mars (song)’. The {{installation}} {{was a part}} of Vice Media <b>and</b> <b>Intel’s</b> ‘Creators Project’ series, traveling globally under the name ‘Life On Mars Revisited’.|$|R
50|$|More modern designs use {{point-to-point}} connections like AMD's HyperTransport <b>and</b> <b>Intel's</b> DMI 2.0 or QuickPath Interconnect (QPI). These implementations {{remove the}} traditional northbridge {{in favor of}} a direct link from the CPU to the Platform Controller Hub, southbridge or I/O controller.|$|R
50|$|Programmable {{microcontrollers}} and microcomputers {{like the}} Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, <b>and</b> <b>Intel’s</b> Galileo <b>and</b> Edison controllers, {{are easy to}} program and enable connected devices, and some open source. Combined with the cloud, they’re helping create the Internet of Things.|$|R
25|$|Lenovo <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> {{launched}} a new Classmate PC in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Major vendors of {{motherboards}} such as Abit, IBM, Dell, Apple, HP, <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> {{were affected}} by capacitors with faulty electrolytes.|$|E
25|$|Increase of {{possible}} threads to 64 {{is also an}} important point for modern parallel execution in actual AMD Ryzen <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> Xeon processors.|$|E
50|$|To {{provide the}} {{hardware}} environment {{to support this}} mix of virtualization and graphics technologies, Hewlett-Packard partnered with Parallels and Nvidia to develop the HP Z800, a high-end PC that include Nvidia’s Quadro FX GPUs <b>and</b> <b>Intel's</b> VT-d <b>and</b> Xeon processor.|$|R
50|$|High-end Intel Xeon {{processors}} {{that are}} on the LGA 775, LGA 1366, and LGA 2011 sockets and high-end AMD Opteron processors {{that are on}} the C32 and G34 sockets are DP (dual processor) capable, as well as the older Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9775 also used in an older Mac Pro by Apple <b>and</b> the <b>Intel</b> Skulltrail motherboard. AMD's G34 motherboards can support up to four CPUs <b>and</b> <b>Intel's</b> LGA 1567 motherboards can support up to eight CPUs.|$|R
50|$|Dell {{released}} the Mini 10n {{based on the}} Mini 10. The only difference between the 10n and the 10 (1012) is the installed OS has been changed to Ubuntu Moblin Remix Developer Edition, bridging Canonical's Ubuntu <b>and</b> <b>Intel's</b> Moblin graphical environment and Atom optimizations.|$|R
