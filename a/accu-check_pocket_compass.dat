I've got my <b>pocket</b> <b>compass</b> here, but we must have {{something}} to measure off the feet when we have found the peg.

6000|$|A {{good many}} miles had been covered, when Earl, {{happening}} {{to glance at}} his <b>pocket</b> <b>compass,</b> announced that they were sailing almost due southward. [...] "And that can't be right," [...] he said to Randy. [...] "We ought to be headed for the northwest." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{five miles}} I rode south, {{striking}} a tinder {{from time to}} time to look at my <b>pocket</b> <b>compass.</b> And then in an instant--I feel the pang once more as my memory brings back the moment--my horse, without a sob or staggers fell stone-dead beneath me! ...|$|R
60|$|All {{the remedy}} {{they had in}} this case was, to set on with their poles towards the shore, and to observe, by their <b>pocket</b> <b>compasses,</b> which way it lay; and this they laboured hard at, lest they should {{be lost in the}} night, and not know which way to go.|$|R
60|$|I felt in his pockets, {{one after}} another. A few small coins, a thimble, and some thread and big needles, {{a piece of}} pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a <b>pocket</b> <b>compass,</b> and a tinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair.|$|R
50|$|The town site of Moravia {{was laid}} out on June 27, 1850 and was {{recorded}} July 15, 1851. The surveying was done using a <b>pocket</b> <b>compass</b> and tapeline for measuring instruments.The old ridge road from Unionville, Iowa to Moravia and west to Iconium, Iowa was the Mormon Trail of 1846 from Nauvoo, Illinois to Salt Lake, Utah.|$|R
60|$|Into the {{sky with}} its {{twinkling}} stars swept the Dartaway, and Sam gave the direction to be taken by consulting the tiny <b>pocket</b> <b>compass</b> he carried. Of course these directions were crude, but they were better than nothing, and soon Tom cried out {{that he could make}} out the lights of a settlement in the dim distance.|$|R
60|$|As we had {{measured}} {{the distance from}} the township lines by counting the revolutions of our wagon-wheels, so now with <b>pocket</b> <b>compass</b> and a couple of laths, Charles and I laid out inner boundaries and claimed three quarter-sections, one for Frank and one each for ourselves. Level as a floor these acres were, and dotted with the bones of bison.|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} after this the Sudberry Family were {{particularly}} careful not to wander too far from their mountain home. Mr Sudberry forbade everyone, on pain of his utmost displeasure, to venture up among the hills without McAllister {{or one of his}} lads as a guide.

The captain and serjeant, however, each carried a <b>pocket</b> <b>compass,</b> an instrument without which few ventured far into the forests. Then the blows of the axes served as sounds to let the adventurers know their relative position, and, as they circled the place whence they issued, they gave the constant assurance of their own progress, and probable security.|$|R

60|$|The {{list was}} now filled, yet Foster Portney spent {{nearly an hour}} more in picking up such odds and ends as pins, needles, spools of thread, three good <b>pocket</b> <b>compasses,</b> and burning-glasses, a pocket {{notebook}} for each, with pencils and some writing-paper and envelopes. Finally he took them to a little shop on a side street, where each procured a monstrous knapsack of oiled canvas, having straps to be placed over the shoulders and an extra strap to come up over the front part of the head.|$|R
60|$|At {{four in the}} afternoon, the frigate's {{head was}} again turned west and, at ten o'clock, the boats for the landing party were lowered and, the men taking their places in them, rowed away for the shore, which was some two miles distant. The night was dark; but Mr. Lyons had with him a <b>pocket</b> <b>compass</b> and had, before embarking, taken the exact {{bearings}} of the battery, from the spot where they would land. He was therefore able to shape his course to a point half a mile in its rear.|$|R
60|$|The voyage, {{as it was}} {{undertaken}} {{with a great deal}} of ignorance and desperation, so really it was not carried on with much resolution or judgment; for we knew no more of the course we were to steer than this, that it was anywhere about the west, within two or three points N. or S., and as we had no compass with us but a little brass <b>pocket</b> <b>compass,</b> which one of our men had more by accident than otherwise, so we could not be very exact in our course.|$|R

50|$|From {{his early}} days at Harvard he {{purchased}} books from rare book sellers. He eventually specialized in two areas: early Americana and the works of Charles Dickens.He collected not only rare editions of Dickens's books, many in their original publications as periodical series, but also various ephemera such as speeches, addresses, original illustrations, mementos, and letters. Elkins also owned a desk that Dickens used, along with his postal scale and pen tray, his <b>pocket</b> <b>compass,</b> travelling lantern, and a bedside candlestick. In terms of rarity, the collection contains the Pickwick Papers in parts, of which Dickens inscribed the first fourteen to his young sister-in-law, Mary Hogarth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly, {{but pretty}} nearly so," [...] said Will. [...] "I had entertained the belief, presumptuous if you will, that I could {{find my way}} {{in any part of}} the {{wilderness}} by means of a sextant and <b>pocket</b> <b>compass,</b> and, to say truth, I don't feel quite sure that I should have failed, but before I had a sufficient opportunity of testing my powers, one of our baggage horses rolled down the bank of a creek and broke my sextant. In trying to save him I rolled down along with him and smashed my compass, so I have resigned the position of guide in favour of my friend here, who, being a native, seems to possess a mysterious power in the matter of finding his way." ...|$|R

5000|$|Taken up {{from trade}} as a troopship, Oronsay {{took part in}} the Norwegian Campaign, {{including}} Operation Alphabet, the secret evacuation of Narvik on 7 June 1940. Almost immediately afterwards, she participated in Operation Ariel, the evacuation of British troops from western France. On 17 June 1940, she was anchored in the Loire Estuary, embarking troops being ferried out from St Nazaire in destroyers and small boats. During an air-raid, a German bomb landed on the ship's bridge, killing several people, destroying the chart, steering and wireless rooms and breaking the captain's leg. Taking on survivors from [...] which had sunk nearby, Captain Norman Savage steered the ship home {{with the aid of a}} <b>pocket</b> <b>compass,</b> a sextant and a sketch map.|$|R
60|$|Next {{morning they}} got a fresh supply of bread and cheese, at a tiny village between Dudeldf and Bittburg and, leaving the latter place to the left, made {{straight}} for the frontier, across the hills. The road to the frontier ran through Bittburg; but {{they were afraid of}} keeping to it, as there were sure to be troops at the frontier. Several times they lost their way; but the <b>pocket</b> <b>compass</b> and map, which they had brought with them, stood them in good stead and, late in the evening, they arrived at the stream which forms the frontier. It was, fortunately, very low; for the cold had frozen up its sources. They had, therefore, little difficulty in crossing and, tired as they were, gave a cheer upon finding themselves in Luxembourg.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Arbuthnot," [...] said Bickley, [...] "these candles {{are burning}} low and we don't {{want to use}} up more if we can prevent it, for we may need what we have got very badly later on. Now, {{according}} to my <b>pocket</b> <b>compass</b> the mouth of this cave points due east; probably at the beginning it was orientated to the rising sun for purposes of astronomical observation or of worship at certain periods of the year. From {{the position of the}} sun when we landed on the rock this morning I imagine that just now it rises almost exactly opposite to the mouth of the cave. If this is so, to-morrow at dawn, for a time at least, the light should penetrate as far as the statue, and perhaps further. What I suggest is that we should wait till then to explore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Snow is {{a hell of}} a thing," [...] said Ross, by way of a foreword. [...] "It ain't, somehow, {{it seems}} to me, salubrious. I can stand water and mud and two inches below zero and a hundred and ten in the shade and {{medium-sized}} cyclones, but this here fuzzy white stuff naturally gets me all locoed. I reckon the reason it rattles you is because it changes the look of things so much. It's like you had a wife and left her in the morning with the same old blue cotton wrapper on, and rides in of a night and runs across her all outfitted in a white silk evening frock, waving an ostrich-feather fan, and monkeying with a posy of lily flowers. Wouldn't it make you look for your <b>pocket</b> <b>compass?</b> You'd be liable to kiss her before you collected your presence of mind." ...|$|R
50|$|On 14 May 1858, with {{financial}} backing from William Finke, Stuart {{set off on}} the first of his six major expeditions. His aim was to find minerals, a land which the Aborigines called Wingillpinin, and new grazing land in the north-west of South Australia. Stuart set out from John Chambers' station Oratunga, taking as companions two of Chambers' employees (a white man named Forster and a young Aboriginal man), half a dozen horses, and rations for six weeks, all provided by Chambers, a <b>pocket</b> <b>compass</b> and a watch. From the Flinders Ranges, Stuart travelled west, passing to the south of Lake Torrens, then north along the western edge of Lake Torrens. He found an isolated chain of semi-permanent waterholes which he named Chambers' Creek (now called Stuart Creek). It later became crucially important as a staging post for expeditions to the arid centre of the continent.|$|R
60|$|The last {{instructions}} I gave to our men were, {{that they}} should {{make the best of}} their way over the country beyond the mountains; {{that they should}} take the exact distances of places, and keep a journal of their march, set up crosses and marks at all proper stations; and that they should steer their course as near as they could between the latitude of 40°, where they would enter the country, and the latitude of 45° south, so that they would go an east-south-east course most of the way, and that wherever they made the shore they should seek for a creek or port where the ships might come to an anchor, and look out night and day for the ships; the signals also were agreed on, and they had two dozen of rockets to throw up if they discovered us at sea; they had all necessary instruments for observation also, and perspective glasses, <b>pocket</b> <b>compasses,</b> &c., and thus they set out, October 24th, 1715.|$|R
60|$|The {{trees in}} this forest were huge {{and of a}} variety of cedar, but did not grow closely together; also there was {{practically}} no undergrowth, perhaps for the reason that their dense, spreading tops shut out the light. As I saw afterwards both trunks and boughs were clothed with long grey moss, which even at midday gave the place a very ghostly appearance. The darkness beneath those trees was intense, literally we could not see an inch before our faces. Yet rather than stand still we struggled on, Hans leading the way, for his instincts were quicker than ours. The steep rise of the ground beneath our feet told us that we were going uphill, as we wished to do, {{and from time to time}} I consulted a <b>pocket</b> <b>compass</b> I carried by the light of a match, knowing from previous observations that the top of the Holy Mount lay due north.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the validity of a <b>pocket</b> <b>compass</b> needle goniometer (IncliMed®, University of Padua) to measure the thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis in adolescent. Material and methods: In a group of 128 adolescent the same clinician (FC) measured the thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis according to the goniometer technique and the Cobb angle on lateral spinal radiographs. The linear regression analysis and the Bland and Altman criteria were used for the data analysis. Results: A strong correlation existed between radiological and goniometer evaluation of the thoracic kyphosis (linear regression coefficient: b= 0. 897;p= 0. 000), but poor correlation existed at the lumbar lordosis evaluation (b= 0. 526;p= 0. 000); so we introduced a modification of the original traditional Cobb method of measurement with improved the linear regression coefficient (b= 0. 820, p= 0. 000). Conclusions: Our results confirm the clinical utility of goniometer assessment for the quantification of thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis in the adolescent...|$|R
6000|$|In those days--and here {{is where}} the trouble began--the state's domain was {{practically}} inexhaustible, and the old surveyors, with princely--yea, even Western American--liberality, gave good measure and over-flowing. Often the jovial man of metes and bounds would dispense altogether with the tripod and chain. Mounted on a pony that could cover something near a [...] "vara" [...] at a step, with a <b>pocket</b> <b>compass</b> to direct his course, he would trot out a survey by counting the beat of his pony's hoofs, mark his corners, and write out his field notes with the complacency produced {{by an act of}} duty well performed. Sometimes--and who could blame the surveyor?--when the pony was [...] "feeling his oats," [...] he might step a little higher and farther, and in that case the beneficiary of the scrip might get a thousand or two more acres in his survey than the scrip called for. But look at the boundless leagues the state had to spare! However, no one ever had to complain of the pony under-stepping. Nearly every old survey in the state contained an excess of land.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who goes there?" [...] cried a voice--such a voice! I swerved to {{the right}} and rode like a madman, but a dozen squirts of fire came out of the darkness, and the bullets whizzed all round my ears. That was no new sound to me, my friends, though I will not talk like a foolish conscript and say that I have ever liked it. But at least it had never kept me from {{thinking}} clearly, and so I knew that there was nothing for it but to gallop hard and try my luck elsewhere. I rode round the English picket, and then, as I heard nothing more of them, I concluded rightly that I had at last come through their defences. For five miles I rode south, striking a tinder {{from time to time to}} look at my <b>pocket</b> <b>compass.</b> And then in an instant--I feel the pang once more as my memory brings back the moment--my horse, without a sob or stagger, fell stone dead beneath me! ...|$|R
60|$|At last, having {{apparently}} rested themselves, the conference, if conference it was, {{came to an}} end, and Levi led the way, {{the other}} following, to the dead pine tree. Here he stopped and began searching, as though for some mark; then, having found that which he looked for, he drew a tapeline and a large brass <b>pocket</b> <b>compass</b> from his <b>pocket.</b> He gave {{one end of the}} tape line to his companion, holding the other with his thumb pressed upon a particular part of the tree. Taking his bearings by the compass, he gave now and then some orders to the other, who moved a little to the left or the right as he bade. At last he gave a word of command, and, thereupon, his companion drew a wooden peg from his pocket and thrust it into the sand. From this peg as a base they again measured, taking bearings by the compass, and again drove a peg. For a third time they repeated their measurements and then, at last, seemed to have reached the point which they aimed for.|$|R
5000|$|After Johnson's death, RCMP {{officials}} {{realized that}} he had travelled over 137 km away from his cabin in less than 3 days, burning approximately 42 MJ (10,000 kcal) a day. Seventy-five years later in 2007, forensics teams found that his tailbone was not actually symmetrical, causing his spine to curve left and right slightly. In addition, one foot was longer than the other. [...] An examination of Johnson's body yielded over $2,000 in both American and Canadian currency as well as some gold, a <b>pocket</b> <b>compass,</b> a razor, a knife, fish hooks, nails, a dead squirrel, a dead bird, a large quantity of Beecham's Pills and teeth with gold fillings that were believed to be his. During the entire chase, the Mounties had never heard Johnson utter a single word. The only thing they heard was Johnson's laugh after he shot Constable Edgar Millen. To this day people debate who he was, why he moved to the Arctic, or if he was actually responsible for interfering with the trap lines as alleged.|$|R
