"I {{listened to}} it on my crappy {{computer}} speakers and then I had to go find my headphones because as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> a few bars, I had to listen more closely and I got chills. I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone else have this song! It’s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they , 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song {{is never going to}} see the light of day.'

The whole is disorganized. But each individual fragment is in order, is a representative of a Higher Order. The Highest Order prevails even in the disintegration. The totality is present even in the broken pieces. More clearly present, perhaps, than in a completely coherent work. At least you aren't lulled into a sense of false security by some merely human, merely fabricated order. You have to rely on your immediate perception of the ultimate order. So in a certain sense disintegration may have its advantages. But of course it's dangerous, horribly dangerous. Suppose you couldn't get back, out of the chaos...' ...|$|E
2500|$|Melba's first {{recordings}} {{were made}} around 1895, recorded on cylinders at the Bettini Phonograph Lab in New York. A reporter from Phonoscope magazine was impressed: [...] "The next cylinder was labelled 'Melba' and was truly wonderful, the phonograph reproducing her wonderful voice in a marvellous manner, especially the high notes which soared away above {{the staff and}} were rich and clear." [...] Melba was less impressed: [...] "'Never again,' I said to myself <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the scratching, screeching result. 'Don't tell me I sing like that, or I shall go away and live on a desert island.'" [...] The recordings never reached the general public– destroyed on Melba's orders, it is suspected– and Melba would not venture into a recording studio for another eight years. Melba can be heard singing on several Mapleson Cylinders, early attempts at live recording, made by the Metropolitan Opera House librarian Lionel Mapleson in the auditorium there during performances. These cylinders are often poor in quality, but they preserve something {{of the quality of}} the young Melba's voice and performance that is sometimes lacking from her commercial recordings.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to his opposition to decentralization, the Yugoslav government removed Ranković from office in 1966 on various claims, including that he was spying on Tito. The process began with Tito ordering {{the investigation of the}} UDBA, however one of the most vocal and outspoken condemnations of Ranković came from members within the League of Communists of Serbia that was considered too extreme of a condemnation by Tito who held them in dismay, and was deeply unpopular amongst Serbs, who in general were supportive of Ranković. The major condemnation came from within the League of Communists of Serbia and particularly its provincial branch in Kosovo, the League of Communists of Kosovo, whose report declared that the security forces in Kosovo under the leadership of Ranković actively persecuted those of Albanian nationality and said that [...] "The ideological foundation of such policy under the competence of Serbia is nationalism and chauvinism." [...] Upon listening at a meeting to the claims of Rankovic's abuse of power and abuse of Albanians as reported by Veli Deva, the Secretary of Kosovo's Regional Committee; Mihailo Švabić, a Serbian member of the LCS Central Committee famously said that he was [...] "ashamed - as a communist, as a Serb, and as a man - <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the presentation of comrade Deva". Serbian Communist Spasenija Babović called for Ranković to be expelled from the party, and the LCS Central Committee agreed to this request.|$|E

He did not understand—Jenkins ascribed it to a failure of imagination—why passions were raised on both sides over the issue. He told the House of Commons in 1913, while complaining of the [...] "exaggerated language" [...] on both sides, [...] "I am sometimes tempted to think, as one <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> the arguments of supporters of women's suffrage, that there is nothing to be said for it, and I am sometimes tempted <b>to</b> think, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the arguments of the opponents of women's suffrage, that there is nothing to be said against it." ...|$|R
40|$|F OR A NUMBER OF YEARS I {{have been}} {{increasingly}} aware {{of an interesting}} characteristic of certain visual images arising spontaneously within myself <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> my patient's asso-ciations. In contrast {{to the majority of}} the visual associations I become aware of-those in which the pictured content can be traced either to the patient's descriptions or to an empathic parallel drawn from my own experience-these images con-tain details that are not immediately explicable. The visual-ized foreground events are appropriate enough to the material the patient talks about, but the background setting of the imagined scene is curiously elaborated in specific detail. The origin of the detail is, furthermore, surprisingly unfamiliar to me. It is as though the patient is responsible for the fore-ground action-the script of the event being described-while his analyst is unwittingly producing unfamiliar props, the static backdrops, which complete the visualized pictures of the patient's activity. As I began {{to pay more attention to}} these puzzling phenomena (presumably produced as part of the over-al...|$|R
40|$|I am {{reminded}} of Chicken Little’s famous mantra <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> some Supreme Court Justices’ reactions to the prospect of televising oral arguments. Their fears—such as Justice Kennedy’s warning that allowing {{cameras in the courtroom}} may change the Court’s dynamics—are, in my opinion, overblown. And some comments, most notably Justice Souter’s famous exclamation in a 1996 House subcommittee hearing that “the day you see a camera come into our courtroom, it’s going to roll over my dead body,” make it sound as if the Justices have forgotten that our nation’s court system belongs to the public, not merely the nine Justices who sit atop it. I write this essay in order to give my own perspective. Having served as a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals for nearly twenty-eight years, I believe that I am {{in a unique position to}} understand the concerns raised by televising oral arguments. I can make this guarantee—televising the Supreme Court’s oral arguments will not produce the disastrous results predicted by some frightened Justices; rather, it will yield positive results. Most notably, it will increase the public’s knowledge of the appellate process...|$|R

40|$|In October 2015, a large {{international}} study titled Students, Computers and Learning (OECD, 2015) {{reported that}} access to computers had no significant impact on students’ proficiency in reading, math, and science.

The report’s authors appropriately acknowledged that “building deep conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking requires intensive student-teacher interactions, and technology sometimes distracts from this valuable human engagement. ” Nevertheless, schools districts are rapidly adopting 1 : 1 laptop initiatives coupled with blended learning models aimed at increasing the amount of time students spend working independently at a computer at home and school. Proponents of blended argue that the model helps teachers customize digital lessons designed to meet individual needs and allow learners to work at their own pace.

50|$|American Record Guide, 1/2011, by MAGIL SCHOECK Violin Sonatas Ursula Badgasarjanz (violin), Gisela Schoeck (piano) Gallo 1249, 50 minutes Othmar Schoeck (1886-1957) {{was one of}} Switzerland’s leading composers in {{the first}} half of the 20th Century. These works for violin show the {{influence}} of Brahms and a good deal of technical proficiency. While Schoeck lacked the trailblazing imagination of the very greatest composers, his themes are lovely, his harmonic knowledge has an impressive range, and his material is expertly worked out. These are satisfying works, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> them <b>I</b> never feel that they are lacking. Of the three works presented here, the First and Second Violin Sonatas are the best. The Second is more harmonically fluid, but the First has stronger themes and is more affecting. The Variations, without opus number, don’t hold my interest as well. They are from 1905, the earliest of the three works, so that comes as no surprise. Swiss violinist Ursula Bagdasarjanz recorded these pieces for Swiss radio in 1961. The composer’s daughter Gisela plays the piano and does a very fine job. The sound is a bit dry, and I wish the piano were a bit more forward, but these are very good readings.|$|R
