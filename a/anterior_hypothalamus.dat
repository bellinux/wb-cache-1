5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the diencephalon, {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the circadian rhythm, control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The <b>anterior</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock. In the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep. Whilst awake the brain consumes {{a fifth of the}} body’s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.|$|E
25|$|Some {{light was}} thrown on the {{mechanisms}} on sleep onset {{by the discovery}} that lesions in the preoptic area and <b>anterior</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> lead to insomnia while those in the posterior hypothalamus lead to sleepiness. Apart from this, {{it was found that}} lesions in oral pontine and midbrain reticular formation lead to loss of cortical activation. This was further narrowed down to show that the central midbrain tegmentum is the region that plays a role in cortical activation. Thus, sleep onset seems to arise from activation of the <b>anterior</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> along with inhibition of the posterior regions and the central midbrain tegmentum. Further research has shown that the hypothalamic region called ventrolateral preoptic nucleus produces the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA that inhibits the arousal system during sleep onset.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) oral administration on neuroendocrine function by investigating the modulation exerted by DHEA administration on allopregnanolone and beta-endorphin (beta-EP) central and peripheral levels in ovariectomized rats. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING(S) : Experimental research environment. ANIMAL(S) : Female Wistar rats (n = 48). INTERVENTION(S) : Forty rats were ovariectomized and received an oral treatment with either placebo or 0. 5, 1, or 2 mg/kg/day of DHEA. After euthanization, beta-EP levels were measured in hippocampus, <b>hypothalamus,</b> <b>anterior</b> pituitary, neurointermediate pituitary, and plasma. Allopregnanolone and DHEAS levels were measured in hippocampus, <b>hypothalamus,</b> <b>anterior</b> pituitary, adrenal glands, and serum. Serum E(2) concentration was also measured. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ester (DHEAS), E(2), beta-EP, and allopregnanolone levels. RESULT(S) : Dehydroepiandrosterone administration increased DHEAS content in all organs and serum, except for anterior pituitary, where no significant changes occurred. DHEA administration in ovariectomized animals did not significantly increase E(2) circulating levels. DHEA administration induced an increase in allopregnanolone and beta-EP content in hippocampus, <b>hypothalamus,</b> and <b>anterior</b> pituitary and in serum or plasma. CONCLUSION(S) : Dehydroepiandrosterone administration in ovariectomized animals increased allopregnanolone and beta-EP central and peripheral levels, which suggests that this compound {{may play a role}} as a neuroendocrine mediator, possibly substantiating the beneficial effects of postmenopausal DHEA therapy on the central nervous syste...|$|R

In 1990, Swaab and Hofman reported that the suprachiasmatic nucleus in homosexual men was significantly larger than in heterosexual men. Then in 1995, Swaab et al. linked brain development to sexual orientation by treating male rats both pre- and postnatally with ATD, an aromatase blocker in the brain. This produced an enlarged SCN and bisexual behavior in the adult male rats. In 1991, LeVay showed that part of the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) known as the 3rd interstitial nucleus of the <b>anterior</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> (INAH 3), is nearly twice as large (in terms of volume) in heterosexual men than in homosexual men and heterosexual women.|$|E

Some of the projections from the medial septal area are cholinergic; the rest are GABAergic or glutamatergic.

50|$|In a 2009 small fMRI experiment, Mary Helen Immordino-Yang {{and colleagues}} at the Brain and Creativity Institute studied strong {{feelings}} of compassion for social and physical pain in others. Both feelings involved an expected change in activity in the anterior insula, <b>anterior</b> cingulate, <b>hypothalamus,</b> and midbrain, but they also found a previously undescribed pattern of cortical activity on the posterior medial surface of each brain hemisphere, a region involved in the default mode of brain function, and implicated in self-related processes. Compassion for social pain in others was associated with strong activation in the interoceptive, inferior/posterior portion of this region, while compassion for physical pain in others involved heightened activity in the exteroceptive, superior/anterior portion. Compassion for social pain activated this superior/anterior section, to a lesser extent. Activity in the anterior insula related to compassion for social pain peaked later and endured longer than that associated with compassion for physical pain. Compassionate emotions in relation to others has effects on the prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal cortex, and the midbrain. Feelings and acts of compassion {{have been found to}} simulate areas known to regulate homeostasis, such as insular cortex and hypothalamus.|$|R

DESIGN: Female Wistar rats (N = 64) were included: 48 rats were ovariectomized, 8 cycling rats were included as controls, and 8 cycling rats were treated with placebo. The ovariectomized animals were divided into six groups: untreated rats and those that received 14 -day oral treatment with either placebo, estradiol valerate (E 2 V) 0. 05 mg/kg/d, or tibolone (0. 1, 0. 5, or 2 mg/kg/d. beta-EP levels were assessed in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, hippocampus, <b>hypothalamus,</b> <b>anterior</b> pituitary, neurointermediate pituitary, and plasma, whereas allopregnanolone levels were measured in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, hippocampus, <b>hypothalamus,</b> <b>anterior</b> pituitary, adrenal glands, and serum. RESULTS: The administration of tibolone (0. 5 and 2 mg/kg/d) in ovariectomized rats induces a significant increase of allopregnanolone in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, hippocampus, hypothalamus, whereas in serum a significant increase of allopregnanolone occurs only with the dose of 2 mg/kg/d, {{a significant decrease in}} allopregnanolone levels occurs in the adrenal glands. No changes occurred in the anterior pituitary. Tibolone doses of 0. 5 and 2 mg/kg/d induced a significant increase in beta-EP content in the frontal lobe, hypothalamus, and neurointermediate lobe; and, at doses of 2 mg/kg/d, in the parietal lobe, anterior pituitary, and plasma, without changes in the hippocampus. Compared with E 2 V, 0. 5 mg/kg/d tibolone showed a similar effect on allopregnanolone and beta-EP in most brain regions.

AIM: Evaluation of the effects of 2 -weeks treatment with testosterone (T), Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and estradiol valerate (E 2 V) on brain and serum allopregnanolone (AP) in gonadectomized rats of both sexes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AP levels were measured in frontal and parietal lobe, hippocampus, <b>hypothalamus,</b> <b>anterior</b> pituitary, and in serum. METHODS: Eight groups of Wistar female and eight groups of Wistar male rats were included. For each sex, one group of fertile and one group of gonadectomized rats were employed as control receiving placebo. The others groups received subcutaneous T at the dose of 10 microg/kg/day and 100 microg/kg/day for female rats, and 1 mg/kg/day and 5 mg/kg/day for male rats, or DHT at the doses of 1 microg/kg/day, 10 microg/kg/day, and 100 microg/kg/day for females, and 0, 1 microg/kg/day, 1 mg/kg/day and 5 mg/kg/day for males, or E 2 V (0. 05 mg/Kg/day). RESULTS: Ovariectomy (OVX) and orchidectomy (OCX) induced a significant decrease in AP in all brain areas analyzed, as well as in serum. In OVX rats, T replacement, as well as E 2 V, significantly increased AP content in all brain areas and in plasma. In OCX, T and E 2 V did not actively result in influencing AP concentration in frontal and parietal lobe, while it produced a significant rise in AP levels in the hippocampus, <b>hypothalamus,</b> <b>anterior</b> pituitary, and serum. Conversely, DHT replacement had no affect on AP levels anywhere or at any administered dose, either in males or in female rats. CONCLUSIONS: Gender difference and T therapy affect brain AP synthesis/release during the reproductive aging. This effect becomes particularly evident in the brain of ovariectomized animals, where the content of this specific neurosteroid is much more responsive than male animals to testosterone replacement...|$|R

40|$|In an fMRI experiment, {{participants}} {{were exposed to}} narratives based on true stories designed to evoke admiration and compassion in 4 distinct categories: admiration for virtue (AV), admiration for skill (AS), compassion for social/psychological pain (CSP), and compassion for physical pain (CPP). The goal was to test hypotheses about recruitment of homeostatic, somatosensory, and consciousness-related neural systems during the processing of pain-related (compassion) and non-pain-related (admiration) social emotions along 2 dimensions: emotions about other peoples' social/psychological conditions (AV, CSP) and emotions about others' physical conditions (AS, CPP). Consistent with theoretical accounts, the experience of all 4 emotions engaged brain regions involved in interoceptive representation and homeostatic regulation, including anterior insula, <b>anterior</b> cingulate, <b>hypothalamus,</b> and mesencephalon. However, the study also revealed a previously undescribed pattern within the posteromedial cortices (the ensemble of precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and retrosplenial region), an intriguing territory currently known for its involvement in the default mode of brain operation and in self-related/consciousness processes: emotions pertaining to social/psychological and physical situations engaged different networks aligned, respectively, with interoceptive and exteroceptive neural systems.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Drospirenone is {{the unique}} {{progestin}} derived from 17 -spironolactone used for contraception and hormone therapy. Few {{data are available}} concerning the effects of drospirenone on {{the central nervous system}} and neuroendocrine milieu. The opioid beta-endorphin and the neurosteroid allopregnanolone are considered markers of neuroendocrine functions, and their synthesis and activity are regulated by gonadal steroids. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effect of a 2 -week oral treatment with drospirenone, estradiol valerate, and combined therapy of drospirenone + estradiol valerate on central and peripheral beta-endorphin and allopregnanolone levels in ovariectomized female rats. DESIGN: Seven groups of Wistar ovariectomized rats received oral drospirenone (0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 mg/kg per day), estradiol valerate (0. 05 mg/kg per day), or drospirenone (0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 mg/kg per day) + estradiol valerate (0. 05 mg/kg per day). One group of fertile and one group of ovariectomized rats were used as controls. beta-endorphin levels were measured in frontal and parietal lobes, hippocampus, <b>hypothalamus,</b> <b>anterior</b> and neurointermediate pituitary, and plasma, and allopregnanolone content was assessed in frontal and parietal lobes, hippocampus, <b>hypothalamus,</b> <b>anterior</b> pituitary, adrenal glands, and serum. RESULTS: Ovariectomy induced a significant decrease in beta-endorphin and allopregnanolone content in all brain areas analyzed and in circulating levels, whereas it increased allopregnanolone content in the adrenal gland. Estradiol valerate replacement increased beta-endorphin and allopregnanolone levels in all brain areas analyzed and in plasma/serum. Drospirenone treatment significantly increased beta-endorphin levels in all brain areas analyzed (with the only exception being the parietal lobe), whereas it produced no effect on allopregnanolone levels. The addition of drospirenone to estradiol valerate did not modify the effects of estradiol valerate on beta-endorphin or allopregnanolone levels. Drospirenone showed an additive and synergistic effect with estradiol in the neurointermediate lobe on beta-endorphin synthesis.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the potential action of Nestorone (alone or in combination with estradiol valerate) on the level of allopregnanolone and of the opioid beta-endorphin in selected brain areas. Wistar ovariectomized rats were given 0. 05 mg/(kg day) of estradiol valerate (E 2 V) or subcutaneous Nestorone at three dose levels: low dose (10 microg/(kg day)), antiovulatory dose (50 micro/(kg day)) and high dose (250 microg/(kg day)) with and without E 2 V. E 2 V therapy reversed the reduction of allopregnanolone and beta-endorphin induced by ovariectomy anywhere was analyzed except for the adrenal gland. Nestorone showed no effect on allopregnanolone concentration in serum or any part of the brain tissue when given alone while it had a synergistic increasing effect in allopregnanolone concentration in some parts of the brain (hippocampus, <b>hypothalamus,</b> <b>anterior</b> pituitary and serum) when given at high dose of 250 microg/(kg day) in combination with E 2 V. At lower doses it possesses a synergistic effect with E 2 V only in the hippocampus (at 50 microg/(kg day)) and in the anterior pituitary (at 10 and 50 microg/(kg day)). Nestorone administered alone at any dose led to significant increase in beta-endorphin levels in the hippocampus only while, in the high dose group, there was a significant increase in endorphin levels in <b>anterior</b> pituitary and <b>hypothalamus</b> in addition to hippocampus as compared to ovariectomized control rats. In addition, only the highest dose of Nestorone added to estrogen increased beta-endorphin levels of hippocampus and plasma. Thus the lower doses of Nestorone alone or in combination with estrogen do not seem to exert any great effect on both allopregnanolone and beta-endorphin. It is only the highest dose of Nestorone that increases allopregnanolone and beta-endorphin levels in selected brain areas, which are the hippocampus, the <b>hypothalamus,</b> the <b>anterior</b> pituitary and serum/plasma. This suggests that Nestorone at the antiovulatory dose levels may not alter the positive effects of estrogen treatment on mood and behaviour...|$|R
