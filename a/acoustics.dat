40|$|A {{method is}} {{provided}} for making localized decisions and taking localized actions {{to achieve a}} global solution. In an embodiment of the present invention, <b>acoustic</b> impedances for impedance-tunable <b>acoustic</b> segments are adjusted. A first <b>acoustic</b> segment through an N-th <b>acoustic</b> segment are defined. To start the process, the first <b>acoustic</b> segment is designated as a leader and a noise-reducing impedance is determined therefor. This is accomplished using (i) one or more metrics associated with the <b>acoustic</b> wave at the leader, and (ii) the metric(s) associated with the <b>acoustic</b> wave at the N-th <b>acoustic</b> segment. The leader, the N-th <b>acoustic</b> segment, {{and each of the}} <b>acoustic</b> segments exclusive of the leader and the N-th <b>acoustic</b> segment, are tuned to the noise-reducing impedance. The current leader is then excluded from subsequent processing steps. The designation of leader is then given one of the remaining <b>acoustic</b> segments, and the process is repeated for each of the <b>acoustic</b> segments through an (N- 1) -th one of the <b>acoustic</b> segments...|$|R

5|$|After {{the release}} of The Jazz Singer, all the major film {{companies}} were racing to hire audio engineers so they could record and reproduce sound for film. Through common acquaintances at Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI) within Western Electric, Hilliard was contacted and hired by United Artists Studios (UA) in Hollywood, California in 1928 because of his studies in physics, engineering and <b>acoustics.</b> Having left his Masters studies behind in Minnesota, Hilliard, not yet 28 years old, supervised all sound recording for Coquette, UA's first talking motion picture. Western Electric provided recording equipment, but the specific techniques for achieving best sound on film had to be developed by hard work and imagination. Hilliard's ground-breaking methods later became industry standards.|$|E
5|$|Beechwood Theater, {{a replica}} of the Little Theater on Broadway, was {{included}} in Wells Bosworth's design of the primary school building because Vanderlip particularly wanted his own theater. Beechwood Theater, with 256 gold velvet seats, was designed by Winthrop Ames around 1917. Details were closely examined upon construction; the lighting equipment, the scene lofts and fly gallery, and the dressing rooms were well-designed and state-of-the-art. The stage floor was designed especially for dancing, and the <b>acoustics</b> and theater proportions made varieties of productions possible.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, Hilliard {{returned}} to entertainment <b>acoustics</b> with Altec Lansing. Improving on the Shearer Horn System, Hilliard worked with Jim Lansing and Blackie Blackburn {{to develop the}} loudspeaker system of the 20th century: the Voice of the Theatre (VOTT). Arriving in the marketplace in 1945, it offered better coherence and clarity at high power levels. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences immediately began testing its sonic characteristics; they made it the movie theater industry standard in 1955. Production of the long-lived VOTT continued into the 1990s.|$|E

In November, when his designs for both the pavilion and bridge were unveiled, Gehry already had the basic design for the bandshell, but said the bridge's design was very preliminary and not well-conceived because funding for it was not committed. The BP Pedestrian Bridge is designed to serve as a buffer against street noise, helping the pavilion's <b>acoustics.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Groupers are {{important}} components {{of commercial and}} recreational fisheries. Current methods of diver-based grouper census surveys could potentially benefit from development of remotely sensed methods of seabed classification. The goal {{of the present study}} was to determine if areas of high grouper abundance have characteristic <b>acoustic</b> signatures. A commercial <b>acoustic</b> seabed mapping system, QTC View Series V, was used to survey an area near Carysfort Reef, Florida Keys. <b>Acoustic</b> data were clustered using QTC IMPACT software, resulting in three main <b>acoustic</b> classes covering 94 % of the area surveyed. Diver-based data indicate that one of the <b>acoustic</b> classes corresponded to hard substrate and the other two represented sediment. A new measurement of seabed heterogeneity, designated <b>acoustic</b> variability, was also computed from the <b>acoustic</b> survey data in order to more fully characterize the <b>acoustic</b> response (i. e., the signature) of the seafloor. When compared with diver-based grouper census data, both <b>acoustic</b> classification and <b>acoustic</b> variability were significantly different at sites with and without groupers. Sites with groupers were characterized by hard bottom substrate and high <b>acoustic</b> variability. Thus, the <b>acoustic</b> signature of a site, as measured by <b>acoustic</b> classification or <b>acoustic</b> variability, is a potentially useful tool for stratifying diver sampling effort for grouper census. <b>Acoustic</b> signatures of the seafloor: tools for predicting grouper habita...|$|R

50|$|In the half-century {{since the}} first {{experiments}} directly leading {{to the development of}} <b>acoustic</b> microscopes, at least three basic types of <b>acoustic</b> microscope have been developed.

More recently <b>acoustic</b> microscopes based around picosecond ultrasonics systems have demonstrated <b>acoustic</b> imaging in cells using sub-optical wavelengths working with ultrasonic frequencies into the multi-GHz.
