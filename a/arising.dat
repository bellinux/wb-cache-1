DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.|$|E

After a few days of peace, the <b>Arisen</b> treks back to Gran Soren. Along the way, several details are revealed. The sky has been blotted out and replaced with greenish gray clouds that rain ash, and all normal monsters have been replaced with much stronger versions. After the <b>Arisen</b> reaches Gran Soren, it is revealed that half of it has collapsed, leaving a gaping hole. The <b>Arisen</b> goes to meet the duke, and is surprised to see that the duke has turned into a frail old man. It is revealed that the duke made a deal with Grigori to make himself immortal, but without Grigori, the deal is now forfeited. The duke attacks, blaming the <b>Arisen</b> for his condition, but he is swiftly beaten. Guards arrive, and the duke accuses the <b>Arisen</b> of placing a curse on him and of making a deal with Grigori. The <b>Arisen</b> is then hunted by the guards. The <b>Arisen</b> is chased to the hole in the town, where creatures begin to fly out of the hole, with one bumping the <b>Arisen</b> into the hole.|$|R
