5|$|<b>A</b> <b>persistent</b> thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common {{clinically}} significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. <b>A</b> <b>persistent</b> sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E

5|$|A left-arm medium-pace seam bowler, Toshack was {{a member}} of the first-choice team, and played in the first four Test matches before succumbing to <b>a</b> <b>persistent</b> knee injury. Toshack {{contained}} the English batsmen with leg theory in between the new ball bursts of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall. He took 11 wickets in the Tests; his most notable performance was the 5/40 he took in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's. However, his knee failed in the first innings of the Fourth Test when he took 1/112. He was unable to bowl in the second innings and missed the Fifth Test, marking the end of his Test career.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>persistent</b> folktale on Sumatra and Borneo and {{in popular}} culture, is that male orangutans display sexual {{attraction}} to human women, {{and may even}} forcibly copulate with them. The only serious, but anecdotal, report of such an incident taking place, is primatologist Birutė Galdikas' report that her cook was sexually assaulted by a male orangutan. This orangutan, though, was raised in captivity and may have suffered from a skewed species identity, and forced copulation is a standard mating strategy for low-ranking male orangutans.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>persistent</b> {{shortage}} of coinage {{in all of}} the colonies prompted Massachusetts to establish a mint on May 27, 1652, and begin production of coins from its silver reserves.

Although this did not become an issue while Endecott was governor, it eventually became a source of controversy with the crown, and the mint had apparently ceased operations around 1682.|$|E

Whalley scored his first goal of the season against Oxford United, deep in injury time, to seal a 2–0 victory for new manager Paul Hurst in his first home league match in charge. After becoming a first-team regular under Hurst, and helping Shrewsbury avoid relegation once again in 2016–17, Whalley signed a two-year contract extension in May 2017.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Ernest {{was one of}} two intense {{tropical}} cyclones in the 2004–05 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. The eighth {{tropical disturbance}} of the season, Ernest formed from <b>a</b> <b>persistent</b> area of thunderstorms in the central Indian Ocean. It initially moved southwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Ernest on January20 while moving into the Mozambique Channel. After hitting Mayotte, the storm quickly intensified to reach peak winds of 165km/h (105mph 10minute winds) off the western coast of Madagascar. Ernest weakened slightly before striking the southwest portion of that country on January23, producing widespread flooding and gusty winds. The next day the cyclone became extratropical before dissipating on January25.|$|E
