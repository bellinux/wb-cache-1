25|$|Skin or Hide (amiq sg amiik dual amiit pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, amir in Cup'ig). Traditionally, {{clothing}} {{may be made}} of {{a variety}} of skins, including bearded seal skin (maklaarem amia), hair-seal skin (nayiim amia), two-year-old spotted sea skin (useqniim amia), walrus skin (asverem amia), caribou skin (tuntum amia), calfskin (kuluviim amia), bearskin (carayiim amia), wolfskin (keglunrem amia), wolverine skin (terikaniam amia), oldsquaw duck skin (allgiaraam amia), swan skin (qugyuum amia) fish skins (neqet amiit), and others. Traditionally, virtually all parkas worn by the Nunivaarmiut were made from the skins of seals, caribou, or birds; the skins of reindeer have been used in more recent times. Mink and fox skins were also utilized in the past, the latter occasionally for the ruff since it was too thin to be durable enough for men's parkas. Mainland furs that have been used in recent times but not in the past include ground squirrels received from the people of Nelson Island who, in turn, obtained them from the Kuskokwim River, and wolverine used primarily for trim. Muskrat skins (single layer) and <b>Arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> (double layer) were used for winter parkas because these furs are light in weight but very warm. However, caribou (or its domesticated cousin, the reindeer, introduced to Alaska in the 1890s) is also quite warm and also more durable, making it perhaps the most desired material for winter clothing. Historically, ground squirrel, muskrat, and caribou were commonly used for clothing.|$|E
25|$|After the leporids, {{the next}} most {{significant}} group in the diet of golden eagles is the ground squirrels. They comprise about 11.2% of the prey taken by this species across the range. In areas where leporids are scarce, this group of rodents seems to become more prominent. In {{many parts of the}} golden eagle's range, ground squirrels are rare or absent, such as the British Isles, the Iberian Peninsula and some portions of central Eurasia. Nonetheless, all of the large Spermophilus group, all species of prairie dog, all four species of antelope squirrel and all the species of marmot has been found as golden eagle prey. Nests in Denali National Park in Alaska included, among a sampling of 690 remains, contained 84.2% Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii). Studies in Alaska have shown that the other major prey species in Alaska, the willow ptarmigan and the snowshoe hare, follow an 8 to 11 year population cycle. The locally abundant ground squirrels have less dramatic population variations and come out of hibernation in mid to late May (shortly after the eagles return from migration). The Alaskan <b>Arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> appears to be eaten supplementally in peak years but then fill the primary niche when the ptarmigan and hare populations crash. In Alberta, Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus) (occasionally supplemented by other species like yellow-bellied marmots) were the primary prey species, making up 84% of the diet of eagles nesting there. In the French Alps, the most significant prey species is the Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) at 68.9% out of a sampling of 198 from 6 nests. This is also the main prey species in the Italian Alps above the tree line, comprising 49.7% of a sample size of 79 from 12 nests. In the Caspian Sea area of Kazakhstan, yellow ground squirrels (Spermophilus fulvus) are the most important mammalian prey at 23.4% of a sampling of 468 from 36 nests. Along Coastal California, California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) replace black-tailed jackrabbits (which are scarce there) as the primary prey species. In Washington state, where the golden eagle inhabits mainly forest openings made by humans, the yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) is the main prey species, making up 41.8% of a sampling of 47 from 2 nests and 40.3% of a sampling of 315 from 74 nests. In many other areas, ground squirrels are secondary prey, usually ranking after lagomorphs in dietary significance. This is especially true in the contiguous Western United States outside of Washington state and coastal California where they often register as second, third or even fourth most represented family by remains. Prairie dogs feature only as supplemental prey for breeding golden eagles but wintering eagles reportedly prey heavily on colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Although rare, tree squirrels have turned up as prey in some eagle nests in both North America and Eurasia.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>{{squirrel}}</b> has a beige and tan {{coat with}} a white-spotted back. This squirrel has a short face, small ears, a dark tail and white markings around its eyes. Arctic ground squirrels undergo a coat change from summer to winter. Summer coats include red/yellow colorations along the cheeks {{and sides of}} the animal. In fall, these red patches are replaced with silvery fur. The average length of an <b>Arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> is approximately 39 cm. Since Arctic ground squirrels undergo drastic seasonal changes in body mass, it is difficult [...] to give an average mass, but for adult females it is close to 750 g, however, males generally are around 100 g heavier than females.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>{{squirrel}}</b> (Spermophilus parryii or Urocitellus parryii) is {{a species}} of ground squirrel native to the Arctic.

50|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> hibernates over winter {{from early}} August to late April in adult females and from late September to early April for adult males, {{at which time}} it can reduce its body {{temperatures}} from 37 C to as little as -3 C.

40|$|Throughout much of North America’s boreal forest, the {{cyclical}} fluctuations of snowshoe hare populations (Lepus americanus) may cause other herbivores to become entrained in similar cycles. Alternating apparent competition via prey switching followed by positive indirect effects are the mechanisms behind this interaction. Our {{purpose is to}} document {{a change in the}} role of indirect interactions between sympatric populations of hares and <b>arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Urocitellus parryii plesius), and to emphasize the influence of predation for controlling <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> numbers. We used mark-recapture to estimate the population densities of both species over a 25 -year period that covered two snowshoe hare cycles. We analysed the strength of association between snowshoe hare and <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> numbers, and the changes to the seasonal and annual population growth rates of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> over time. A hyperbolic curve best describes the per capita rate of increase of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> relative to their population size, with a single stable equilibrium and a lower critical threshold below which populations drift to extinction. The crossing of this unstable boundary resulted in the subsequent uncoupling of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> and hare populations following the decline phase of their cycles in 1998. The implications are that this sustained Type II predator response led to the local extinction of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels.</b> When few individuals are left in a colony, <b>arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> may also have exhibited an Allee effect caused by the disruption of social signalling of approaching predators...|$|R
50|$|<b>Arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> live {{individually}} in burrow systems. Mating occurs between mid-April and mid-May (depending on latitude) after winter hibernation. Mating includes male-male {{competition for}} access to females, and litters are typically sired by multiple males. Gestation is approximately 25 days, and results in a litter of 5 to 10, 10 g hairless pups. After 6 weeks the pups are weaned and {{this is followed by}} rapid growth to prepare for the upcoming winter.|$|R
50|$|The {{ability of}} an animal to {{recognize}} its kin can {{be the difference between}} life and death for a mother’s children. If she recognizes her children properly, she will give her children food and avoid feeding non-familial children. Richard Dawkins hypothesized that an animal had the ability to recognize kin and non-kin based on its own scent and defined this phenomenon as the ‘armpit effect.’In an effort to find evidence for the ‘armpit effect,’ Warren G. Holmes and Paul W. Sherman conducted a three-year study on two species of squirrels: <b>Arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Spermophilus peryii) and Belding's <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Spermophilus belding).|$|R

40|$|We present {{evidence}} for a novel member of the hepadnavirus family that is endemic in wild <b>arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Spermophylus parryi kennicotti) in Alaska. This virus, designated arctic squirrel hepatitis virus (ASHV), was initially detected in the livers of animals bearing large hepatic nodules by nucleic acid hybridization with hepadnavirus probes and in plasma by cross-reactivity with antibodies to hepadnavirus surface and core antigens. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 3, 302 -bp-long ASHV genome was determined and {{compared with those of}} <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> hepatitis virus (GSHV) and woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV); all sequences were organized into four open reading frames, designated pre-C/C, pre-S/S, pol, and X. Despite roughly equivalent variability among the three rodent hepadnaviruses (around 16 % base and 19 % amino acid exchanges), ASHV appeared to be more closely related to GSHV than to WHV in phylogenetic analysis. Accordingly, preliminary studies of the pathology of ASHV infection suggested that ASHV may be a less efficient oncogenic agent than WHV. About one-third of aged animals maintained in captivity, including virus-infected as well as uninfected squirrels, developed large liver nodules, consisting of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas or nonmalignant lesions characterized by drastic microvesicular steatosis. ASHV-infected <b>arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> may serve as a new model with which to analyze the contribution of hepadnavirus- and host-specific determinants to liver pathology and tumorigenesis...|$|R
40|$|In {{sedentary}} animals, {{the choice}} of a suitable home site is critical to survival and reproductive fitness. However, habitat suitability may vary with predation risk. We compared habitat use of <b>Arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Spermophilus parryii plesius) living in the boreal forest under conditions of fluctuating predation pressure. In our study area, predators show ten-year cycles in numbers that track that of their primary prey, the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). In 1993, we compared burrows that continued to be occupied following the period of intense predation during the hare decline of 1990 - 1992 with those that became vacant, and with random locations. We contrasted these sites to those in a predator exclosure where predation pressure was minimized. Burrows on control sites were located on sloped sites with high visibility. Burrows that remained occupied during the period of intense predation {{were more likely to be}} in open areas with fewer fallen trees than burrows that became vacant. We used discriminant functions derived from the control sites and found that 89 % of the burrows on the predator exclosure were classified as being similar to the random locations on control sites. We conclude that the distribution of <b>Arctic</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> in the boreal forest is a direct function of predator presence...|$|R
