2500|$|The UFDD has {{suffered}} by internal dissensions that have ultimately {{given birth to}} the UFDD-Fondamentale led by Abdelwahit About and Acheikh ibn Oumar. This {{was caused by the}} expulsion in April 2007 from the movement of the UFDD vice-president ibn Oumar, whose Arab elements have {{played a key role in}} the battles that took place in late 2006. But when Acheikh asked for a major space for his men in the movement's organization, he was replaced by Nouri with <b>Adoum</b> Hassab Allah and his Ouaddaian fighters. Thus the UFDD is considered to be dominated by the Toubous, as claimed also by a former cadre of the movement, Habib Dinguess, who has said that Anakaza clan members have taken full control of the movement, in particular those linked to the old Habré regime, first of all Guihini Koreï, once head of the Documentation and Security Directorate (DDS), Habré's secret police. The UFDD awnsered that Dinguess claims were [...] "ridiculous and shameful" [...] and part of a campaign [...] "to denounce all those that oppose Déby as linked to Habré, or Anakaza or Gorane" [...] and added that Korei was only one of many cadres in the movement.|$|E

2500|$|To {{put an end}} to the {{conflict}} among the Chadian government and the rebels the first to propose himself as a mediator was in April 2007 the former president Goukouni Oueddei, who said he would contact both Nouri and Timane Erdimi, leader of the Rally of Democratic Forces, an idea that Déby said to agree on. Eventually talk peaces sponsored by the Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi began in Tripoli on June 23 between the Chadian government, whose delegation was led by Infrastructure Minister <b>Adoum</b> Younousmi, and a rebel one, which included a delegation formed by Mahamat Nouri for the UFDD, Timane Erdimi for the Gathering of Forces for Change (the former RaFD), Hasssan al-Djineidi for the Chadian National Concord (CNT) and Aboud Mackaye for the UFDD-F. Through these talks a preliminary peace agreement was signed on October 3, which was criticized by part of the rebels as being too vague regarding the terms for disarmament and reintegration of their respective forces into the Chadian military. Further negotiations brought on October 25 to a final peace agreement signed on October 25 in Sirte, at the presence of Déby, Gaddafi and the Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. As part of the deal, the rebels and the government have agreed to an immediate ceasefire, a general amnesty and the right for the rebels to join the military and the insurgent groups to become political parties. and the [...] "total respect for the Chadian constitution." [...] While signing the accord, Nouri has moved objections to the government request that the rebels disarm before being reintegrated into the national army.|$|E
