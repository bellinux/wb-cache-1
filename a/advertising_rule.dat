40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{economic}} models of varying complexity have been studied by using the qualitative theory of nonlinear dynamical systems theory. The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to analyze an economic model which is as simple as possible but exhibits sufficient nonlinearity to admit chaotic orbits. A firm's market share is assumed to be influenced only by a simple threshold <b>advertising</b> <b>rule.</b> It turns out that such a simple rule may create complex behavioural patterns, i. e., periodic orbits of any length and even chaotic, seemingly unpredictable time paths. By using the package LOCBIF we are able to investigate for which model parameters chaos arises and how the transition from stable equilibrium to chaos occurs...|$|E

Advertisements and advertorials that incorporate the geographical location of the customer {{have the potential to}} breach <b>advertising</b> <b>rules,</b> standards and codes of conduct in many legislatures. For instance, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) requires all advertisements to be honest, truthful and not mislead. Since the promoter will not know the final wording of the advertisement in every case, it cannot undergo a proper compliance check. A claim such as: [...] "location woman loses 10 pounds with our new diet plan." [...] is clearly false, since it could not be substantiated for the majority of geographies where the advertisement might appear. Claims based on LBA have been ruled misleading by the ASA on a case-by-case basis.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{challenge}} funds to promote {{economic and social}} development continues to grow, but {{has been the subject of}} relatively little research. This paper develops a definition of what challenge funds are and how they differ from other development funding mechanisms, taking into account their purpose, financial terms, agency relationships, screening processes, selection mechanisms, implementation and risk sharing characteristics. A challenge fund provides grants or subsidies with an explicit public purpose between independent agencies with grant recipients selected competitively on the basis of <b>advertised</b> <b>rules</b> and processes who retain significant discretion over formulation and execution of their proposals and share risks with the grant provider. This paper draws on a review of fifty challenge funds being operated by international agencies in order to explore variation in their characteristics. A distinction is drawn between business oriented 'enterprise' challenge funds and civil society or social development challenge funds, and between relatively 'light touch' and 'hands-on' approaches to their management.

Marc Ellis, director of Charlie's, later called for an overhaul of the <b>advertising</b> <b>rules</b> noting that the same panel who banned the commercial had initially certified that the commercial met all advertising standards. The ban eventually became part of a larger discussion about the difference between content allowed in programming versus advertisement.|$|R

Consequently, a business intent on improving its overall performance should be orientated towards developing new customer relations and deepening existing relations. This maxim becomes a paradox in the legal profession due to its historical underpinnings that epitomized conservatism as opposed to commercialism, as the basis for its nobility. For a long time, advocates were banned from advertising their legal businesses to the public. Advertising was considered unprofessional and advocates had to rely on reputation to attract clients. In Kenya, the ban on advertising of legal services was lifted on 29 th March 2012 and the right to advertise legal services operationalized two years thereafter vide the Advocate (Marketing & <b>Advertising)</b> <b>Rules</b> 2014. On account of the importance of advertising in client acquisition and retention, this study sought to explore the advertising strategies adopted by advocates in Nairobi County. The objectives of the study were to ascertain the motivation behind advocates in Nairobi County advertising their legal services to the public; determine the advertising strategies adopted by advocates in Nairobi County; and establish the challenges faced by advocates in Nairobi County when advertising their legal services to the public. An exploratory qualitative research design was therefore used in the investigation. A sample, made-up of twenty-one (21) participants, was selected from advocates within Nairobi County using purposive sampling and evaluated through inference using thematic analysis. The study established that: one of the motivations behind advocates in Nairobi County advertising their services to the public was stimulation of the uptake of legal services by the public; advocates relied on both the informative and persuasive advertising strategies to attract and retain clients; and advocates were facing challenges due to the business versus professionalism tension. Hence, the study recommended the amendment of the Advocate (Marketing & <b>Advertising)</b> <b>Rules</b> 2014 {{to level the playing field}} for legal business between advocates due to the inherent advantage it currently confers on established advocates‘ vis-à-vis new advocates...|$|R
