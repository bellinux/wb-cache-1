Likewise, it is possible to resort to the contentious-administrative appeal to review the mere material actions of the Administration.

40|$|Rapid {{economic}} development has induced urbanization in China. Urbanization and deurbanization strategies co-exist {{in most of}} China's mountain regions. Urbanization typically occurs in famous scenic spots and {{in the vicinity of}} macro engineering works, while de-urbanization is implemented in large areas by the government to protect the natural environment. Over-urbanization has considerable impacts on the esthetic qualities of many mountain tourist resorts and sometimes even destroys the natural state of landscapes and ecosystems. <b>Administrative</b> gaps and <b>omissions</b> of the central government in managing the development of mountain parks and world heritage sites are responsible for over-urbanization in mountains. The search by local governments for short-term economic benefits is also a driving force of over-urbanization. The present article recommends that regulations and laws be developed to effectively assess and monitor the state of parks and world heritage sites in mountains. Institutions with sufficient authority must be set up to legally supervise and protect the natural state of parks and heritage sites in mountains, {{for the benefit of the}} Chinese people and the entire world...|$|R

A break through international law document which addressed the issue of access to justice in environmental matters was the so-called Aarhus Convention adopted in 1998. The Aarhus Convention is a binding environmental treaty that requires its signatories to grant citizens in their respective countries access to environmental information, participation in decision-making in environmental matters and judicial redress where the two previous rights or other environmental law have been violated. The idea behind the Convention is that involving citizens in protecting the environment will improve environmental protection as they often have a keen interest and decisions in the environmental field directly affect their quality of life. By now the Convention has been ratified by 44 parties, including the EU. Therefore, the obligation of the Czech Republic to ensure that its national legislation provides citizens the right to challenge acts in breach of environmental law in courts arises not only [...] ...|$|R
