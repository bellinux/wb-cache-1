5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. It had a pair of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s. This pitched Odontogriphus {{into the middle of the}} debate about whether Wiwaxia was closer to the mollusc or the annelid lineage, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>frank</b> exchange of views.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{combined}} operations {{between the}} Franks and the Mongols were again {{made for the}} following winter offensives, in 1301 and 1302. But in mid-1301 the island of Ruad was attacked by the Egyptian Mamluks. After a lengthy siege, the island surrendered in 1302 or 1303. The Mamluks slaughtered many of the inhabitants, and captured the surviving Templars {{to send them to}} prison in Cairo. In late 1301, Ghazan sent letters to the pope asking him to send troops, priests, and peasants, to make the Holy Land <b>a</b> <b>Frank</b> state again.|$|E

5|$|Adamle {{attended}} Ohio State University {{and was on}} the 1942 Ohio State Buckeyes freshman team, {{but left}} school prior to the 1943 season to fight in World War II. After serving in the U.S. Air Force in the Mediterranean Theatre of War, he returned to Ohio State for the team's 1946 season—his only season with the varsity Buckeyes. Playing as a center in a November game against the Northwestern Wildcats, Adamle intercepted <b>a</b> <b>Frank</b> Aschenbrenner pass in the third quarter and returned it 38 yards. He had another interception {{in the fourth quarter of}} the 39–27 Buckeyes victory. Ohio State finished the season with a 4–3–2 record and Adamle was selected to play in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the National Football League (NFL) champion and a selection of the best college players from around the country.|$|E

After they took a 7–0 lead on an 85-yard drive, the Cadets extended it to 13–0 {{by the end of the}} first quarter when Jimmy Scruggs scored on a touchdown reception. The Informals responded with a pair of second-quarter touchdowns to make the halftime score 13–12. Touchdowns were scored on <b>a</b> <b>Frank</b> MacAlpine run and on a 21-yard Whitey Blanchiak reception from Barton Greer. Alabama then scored the go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter on a 55-yard interception return for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-final, Chelsea faced local rivals Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley. The {{first half}} was even, {{with both sides}} enjoying long spells of possession, until Didier Drogba put Chelsea ahead just before the break. Chelsea scored {{at the start of}} the second half. However, Juan Mata's goal that did not appear to cross the line, but referee Martin Atkinson awarded the goal. Gareth Bale put Tottenham back in it with a goal shortly after a Petr Čech {{challenge}} on Emmanuel Adebayor. Despite the goal, Tottenham never took control of the game and Ramires scored in the 77th minute, followed minutes later by <b>a</b> <b>Frank</b> Lampard free kick, and a Florent Malouda strike in the fourth minute of added time. This secured Chelsea's place in their first FA Cup Final since their 2010 triumph over Portsmouth.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen briefly {{appeared}} on the World Wrestling Federation program {{in the summer of}} 1994 on WWF Monday Night Raw; capitalizing on Frank Drebin. Nielsen (and George Kennedy) were hired as sleuths to unravel the mystery of The Undertaker who had disappeared at January's Royal Rumble event. At SummerSlam 1994, in a Naked Gun parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, they were standing on a case). Although they did not find The Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had been shut) and thus, they solved the mystery. In 1990, Nielsen appeared as <b>a</b> <b>Frank</b> Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for Red Rock Cider.|$|E
5|$|No.71 Wing {{continued}} operations {{until the}} last day of the Pacific War, flying its final mission involving thirty Beauforts only hours before news arrived of the Allied victory on 15August 1945. No.74 Wing was disbanded in Port Moresby the same day. No.71 Wing squadrons subsequently dropped leaflets to remaining pockets of Japanese resistance, making them aware of the surrender; the wing was disbanded at Tadji in January 1946. No.84 Wing suffered morale problems following the end of the war owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation; as a result, the wing's commanding officer sent Northern Command headquarters <b>a</b> <b>frank</b> report, its tone earning a rebuke from Walters. No.84 Wing left Bougainville in February 1946 and disbanded in Melbourne the next month.|$|E
5|$|Galland's time in Argentina {{was running}} out. For his services, {{he was awarded}} a pilot's wings badge and the title Honorary Argentine Military Pilot. Later that year Galland left South America. By that time, he had begun writing his autobiography, The First and the Last (Die Ersten und die Letzten), and it was {{published}} in 1954 by Franz Schneekluth. It was a best-seller in 14 languages and sold three million copies. It was very well received by the RAF and USAF as <b>a</b> <b>frank</b> and honest statement. Galland returned to Germany and was approached by a commissioner for Chancellor Konrad Adenauer for the purpose of joining the new Bundeswehr now that West Germany was to join NATO as a military power. Galland joined with Steinhoff, and went over the proposal. However, France objected to West Germany's proposal for a pan-European defence pact and chose to go its own way. That changed the organisation structure of the German armed forces. Galland got on with his life as the months rolled by. In 1956 Josef Kammhuber, the leader of the German Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) during the war, became the new commander-in-chief of the Bundesluftwaffe. Galland now accepted he had been turned down as a potential leader of, or in, the new air force. Galland suspected that it was more to do with his technically illegal departure from Germany in 1948 and his association with Argentina, a state which was on poor terms with the United States, the dominant partner of NATO.|$|E

5|$|In 1967–68, {{his second}} season, {{injuries}} limited Orr to just 46 {{games in which}} he scored 11 goals and had 20 assists. Prior to the season, Orr had injured his right knee during a charity game in Winnipeg during the summer requiring five weeks in a cast. In December, <b>a</b> <b>Frank</b> Mahovlich check caused a fracture of Orr's collar bone and a shoulder separation. Orr returned in January in time {{to play in the}} NHL All-Star Game, his first of eight appearances overall. Orr had to sit out five games afterwards due to soreness in his left knee. In February, he had to leave a game against Detroit after his left knee went stiff. He would receive the first of his many operations on the knee, repairing ligament and removing cartilage. Orr did return to finish the season, but required an operation during the off-season to remove a bone chip. Despite the injuries, Orr won the first of a record eight consecutive Norris trophies and was named to the NHL's First All-Star team and finished fourth in the voting for the Hart Trophy.|$|E
5|$|In February 1945, Walters was {{promoted}} to acting air commodore and took over from Air Commodore Lukis as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Northern Command, directing its operations in New Guinea, New Britain and Bougainville {{until the end of}} the war. Headquartered at Madang in Papua New Guinea, Northern Command had previously been a large mobile formation known as No.9 (Operational) Group but had evolved into a garrison force, its mobile function supplanted by No.10 (Operational) Group (later First Tactical Air Force). Northern Command's operational formations included No.71 Wing in northern New Guinea, No.74 Wing at Port Moresby, and No.84 Wing on Bougainville. No.71 Wing, commanded by Group Captain Val Hancock, supported the Australian 6thDivision during the Aitape–Wewak Campaign, despite ordnance deficiencies that at one stage led to its squadrons arming their Bristol Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs. No.84 Wing suffered shortages in pilots and equipment during the Bougainville Campaign, and morale problems following the end of the war owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation; as a result, the wing's commanding officer sent Northern Command headquarters <b>a</b> <b>frank</b> report, the tone of which earned a rebuke from Walters. In September, Walters represented the RAAF at the Japanese surrender ceremonies in Wewak.|$|E
