40|$|Portugal has one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{highest rates}} <b>of</b> {{childhood}} obesity in Europe. Few studies have explored {{the relationship between}} parents’ perceptions of their residential neighbourhood (safety concerns and <b>amenities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> built <b>environment)</b> and their children’s weight status. This study aims to examine the associations between parents’ perceptions of their residential neighbourhood and overweight/obesity among their children. Methods: Anthropometric measures of height and weight were taken for 2690 children in preschools and elementary schools in Porto. Body mass index (kg/m 2) was calculated, and the International Obesity Taskforce (IOTF) cut-offs were used. Parents completed the ‘Environmental Module’ standard questionnaire <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Physical Activity Prevalence Study. Chi-square tests and the logistic regression model adjusted for age, gender, maternal education and school cluster were {{used to examine the}} associations between parents’ perceptions of their residential neighbourhood and overweight/obesity among their children. Results: In this sample, 31. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children were overweight (including obese). Significant associations were found between child obesity and the following residential environmental characteristics: <b>the</b> odds <b>of</b> children being obese were lower if their parents believed that it was safe (low/no crime rate) to walk/cycle at night (OR = 0. 65, 95 % CI = 0. 54 – 0. 79) and during the day (OR = 0. 70, 95 % CI = 0. 55 – 0. 86) and that it was easy and pleasant (pedestrian safety) to walk in their neighbourhoods (OR = 0. 73, 95 % CI = 0. 58 – 0. 90) and when local sidewalks were well maintained and unobstructed (OR = 1. 18, 95 % CI = 1. 01 – 1. 40). Conclusion: Parental perceptions of neighbourhood safety and <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> local sidewalks are significantly associated with obesity values...|$|R
40|$|A journal {{article on}} the impact on <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> urban {{agriculture}} in Zimbabwe. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increasingly widespread practice of urban agriculture in <b>the</b> City <b>of</b> Harare on <b>the</b> natural biodiversity was investigated. Vegetation surveys noting species presence-absence and abundance were undertaken in seven field areas, identifying <b>the</b> components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural vegetation <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> clay soil-type areas developed on basic rock, and the sandy soil-type areas developed on granite, that typify the city. Change {{brought about by the}} increasingly widespread practice of urban agriculture was determined, and knock-on effects for other aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's ecology were investigated. Most open space areas in Harare are vlei land. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) illustrated significant differences in <b>the</b> species composition <b>of</b> uncultivated vlei areas with distance from the vlei channel, reflecting change in <b>the</b> water-logging conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil. A higher diversity of faunal species, and larger species count, prior to cultivation was also noted. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> cultivation on <b>the</b> vegetation were a change in species composition (with the natural vegetation being replaced by mainly alien arable weeds), <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spatial diversity in species presence and dominance, a significantly reduced ground cover, and a loss <b>of</b> habitat diversity. <b>The</b> implications <b>of</b> these changes for <b>the</b> <b>amenity</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city <b>environment</b> is discussed. <b>The</b> need for a more sensitive management of open-land areas within Harare, while <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> their conservation as areas of viable natural ecological diversity is still available, is highlighted...|$|R
