5|$|The {{last of the}} sirenian {{families}} to appear, Trichechidae, apparently arose from early dugongids in the late Eocene or early Oligocene. It is a monophyletic taxa. In 1994, the family was expanded to not only include the subfamily Trichechinae (Potamosiren, Ribodon, and Trichechus), but also Miosireninae (Anomotherium and Miosiren). The <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> and the West Indian manatee are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the Amazonian manatee.|$|E
5|$|The meat, oil, bones, {{and skin}} of {{manatees}} are valuable items. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, African manatees are sold to zoos, aquariums, and online as pets, sometimes being shipped internationally. Though illegal, lack {{of law enforcement}} in these areas induce poaching. Some residents of West African countries, such as Mali and Chad, depend on the oil of the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> to cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions. Hunting is the largest source of mortality in Amazonian manatees, {{and there are no}} management plans except for in Colombia. Amazonian manatees, especially calves, are sometimes illegally sold as pets, but there are several institutions that care for and rescue these orphans, with the possibility of their releasing into the wild. The body parts of Dugongs are used as medicinal remedies across the Indian Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Manatees {{inhabit the}} shallow, marshy coastal areas and rivers of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico (T. manatus, West Indian manatee), the Amazon basin (T. inunguis, Amazonian manatee), and West Africa (T. senegalensis, West <b>African</b> <b>manatee).</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{behaviors}} of <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> provoke humans to hunt them. When manatees become tangled in fishing nets, they can damage them. People {{in countries such}} as Sierra Leone believe that killing the manatees to reduce the specie's size lowers the chances of the fishing nets requiring expensive repairs. In addition, <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> can destroy rice crops by drifting into fields during the rainy season.|$|R
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> can {{be found}} in West African regions: Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. Manatees are found in {{brackish}} waters to freshwater: in oceans, rivers, lakes, coastal estuaries, reservoirs, lagoons, and bays on the coast. <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> rarely inhabit waters with a temperature below 18°C (64°F).|$|R
25|$|Several {{species of}} turtles, and the slender-snouted, Nile and dwarf {{crocodile}} are {{native to the}} Congo River Basin. <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> inhabit the lower parts of the river.|$|R
25|$|There {{are still}} some patches of {{permanent}} swamp forest on the Dibamba river, but many others have been cleared and drained for oil palm plantation. The river's fauna are not well protected; particularly endangered is the <b>African</b> <b>Manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis).|$|E
25|$|While this {{conservation}} {{effort is}} focused on manatees in Puerto Rico, the PRMCC also assists in programs for West Indian manatees in British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Turks and Caicos, and Venezuela, and for endangered sister species, such as the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis) in Colombia and Peru, and the West <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis) in Taiwan and Gabon, Africa. These international partnerships have taken the PRMCC's scientists, veterinarians and technicians around the globe to provide assistance and support in rescue, rehabilitation, and population research projects.|$|E
500|$|Sirenians are {{referred}} to as [...] "sea cows" [...] because their diet consists mainly of seagrass. They ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although they will feed on just the leaves if this is not possible. Manatees, in particular the West Indian manatee, are known to consume over 60 different freshwater and saltwater plants, such as shoalweed, water lettuce, muskgrass, manatee grass, and turtle grass. Using their divided upper lip, an adult manatee will commonly eat up to 10%-15% of their body weight, or , per day, which requires the manatee to graze for several hours per day. However, 10% of the diet of the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> is fish and mollusks. Manatees have been known to eat small amounts of fish from nets. As opposed to bulk feeding, dugongs target high-nitrogen grasses to maximize nutrient intake, and, although almost completely herbivorous, dugongs will occasionally eat invertebrates such as jellyfish, sea squirts, and shellfish. Some populations of dugongs, such as the one in Moreton Bay, Australia, are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates such as polychaetes or marine algae when their supply of seagrasses decrease. In other dugong populations in western and eastern Australia, there is evidence that dugongs actively seek out large invertebrates. Populations of Amazonian manatees become restricted to lakes during the July–August dry season when water levels begin to fall, and are thought to fast during this period. Their large fat reserves and low metabolic rates – only 36% of the usual placental mammal metabolic rate – allow them to survive for up to seven months with little or no food.|$|E
50|$|The {{areas with}} the highest manatee populations are Guinea-Bissau, the lagoons of Côte d'Ivoire, the {{southern}} portions of the Niger River in Nigeria, the Sanaga River in Cameroon, the coastal lagoons in Gabon, and the lower parts of the Congo River. As part of a study completed in Côte d'Ivoire to assess {{where the majority of}} <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> favor living, a sample of <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> was radio-tagged and tracked. The tracking observed most of the sample in coastal lagoons, mangroves, and other herbaceous growths. They were also found in the grassy estuaries of big rivers with mangroves and in protected coastal spots with less than 3 m of water containing both mangroves and marine macrophytes.|$|R
5000|$|Many of the <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> that venture up the Niger River {{starve to}} death. At certain times each year, the Niger River dries up {{due to the}} hot {{temperatures}} and lack of rain. Many manatees migrate there during the rainy season. When the water dries up the manatees are unable to get to other bodies of water.|$|R
50|$|Surveys of {{the park}} have shown a diverse {{mammalian}} and avian fauna. Over 94 species of mammals {{have been found in}} the park, and more can be inferred. Important species found in the park include giant pangolins, West African chimpanzees, Gambian mongooses (a rare, endemic species that seems to be well represented in the park), kob, and spot-necked otters. lions and <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> have also recently been confirmed. The African elephant once existed in the park but is currently extinct there.|$|R
2500|$|Manatees (family Trichechidae, genus Trichechus) are large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous {{marine mammals}} {{sometimes}} known as sea cows. There are three accepted living species of Trichechidae, representing {{three of the}} four living species in the order Sirenia: the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), and the West <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis). They measure up to [...] long, weigh as much as , and have paddle-like flippers. The etymology of the name is dubious, with connections having been made to Latin [...] "manus" [...] (hand), and to a word sometimes cited as [...] "manati" [...] used by the Taíno, a pre-Columbian people of the Caribbean, meaning [...] "breast". Manatees are occasionally called sea cows, as they are slow plant-eaters, peaceful and similar to cows on land. They often graze on water plants in tropical seas.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{believed}} that all of ancient Africa possessed a multitude of water-spirit traditions before the first contact with Europeans. Most of these were regarded as female. Dual natures {{of good and evil}} were not uncommon, reflecting the fact that water is an important means of providing communication, food, drink, trade, and transportation, but it can drown people, flood fields or villages, and provide passage to intruders. Van Stipriaan suggests that she may be based on the West <b>African</b> <b>manatee,</b> which is an idea that has been proposed by scientists of the Ghanaian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR); in fact, [...] "Mami Wata" [...] is a common name for this animal in the region. Jill Salmons argues that the mermaid image may have come into being after contact with Europeans. The ships of traders and slavers often had carvings of mermaid figures on their prows, for example, and tales of mermaids were popular among sailors of the time. On the other hand, white is traditionally associated with the spirit world in many cultures of Nigeria. The people of the Cross River area often whiten their skin with talcum or other substances for rituals and for cosmetic reasons, for example.|$|E
50|$|According to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> is endangered. CITES {{states that}} trade in any {{species on the}} list, {{including}} the <b>African</b> <b>manatee,</b> is to be carefully monitored and terminated. Laws exist to protect the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> in every country in which it lives, but these laws are not well enforced. Due to this mass lack of enforcement and minimal education, the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> population is being steadily depleted.|$|E
50|$|There {{are even}} more threats to the <b>African</b> <b>manatee's</b> habitat and life: urban and {{agricultural}} development, increased damming, and increased use of hydroelectric power in the rivers of countries like Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. Thick congestion of boats in waterways may cause the manatees to have deadly run-ins with the vessels. However, even natural occurrences, such as droughts and tidal changes, can often strand manatees in unsuitable habitats. Some are killed accidentally by fishing trawls and in nets which are intended for catching sharks.|$|R
5|$|Weather {{disasters}} {{and other natural}} occurrences are also sources of mortality. The West Indian manatee and Dugong face risks from hurricanes and cyclones, which are predicted to increase in the future. These storms may also damage seagrass populations. Exposure to brevetoxin from Karenia brevis during a red tide event are also sources of mortality; {{they may be able}} to be exposed to brevetoxin after a red tide has subsided, as it could settle on seagrasses. <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> can become stranded during the dry season when rivers and lakes become too small or dry up completely.|$|R
50|$|Fauna include forest elephants, {{primates}} (chimpanzees, monkey {{species such}} as black colobus), antelopes (sitatunga, blue duiker, etc.), West <b>African</b> <b>manatees,</b> sea turtles, dolphins, crocodiles, alligator, many fish species, terrestrial and water bird species.The red-capped mangabey {{was reported to be}} common in the reserve in 1972.The endangered red-eared nose-spotted guenon was reported in the Lombé part of the reserve in densities of 2-3 groups per square kilometers, but populations had dropped elsewhere due to hunting.Animals in the reserve are poorly protected and poaching is widespread.Central chimpanzees in the reserve are threatened by hunters.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis), {{also known}} as the West <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> or sea cow, is a species of manatee that is mostly herbivorous. African {{manatees}} inhabit much of the western region of Africa - from Senegal to Angola. Although scientists do not {{know a great deal about}} this species, they hypothesize that the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> is very similar to the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).|$|E

5000|$|Lake Chad is {{the remnant}} {{of a former}} inland sea, paleolake Mega-Chad. At its largest, {{sometime}} before 5000 BC, Lake Mega-Chad was the largest of four Saharan paleolakes, and is estimated to have covered an area of 1000000 km2, larger than the Caspian Sea is today, and may have extended as far northeast as within 100 km of Faya-Largeau. [...] At its largest extent the river Mayo Kébbi represented the outlet of the paleolake Mega-Chad, connecting it to the Niger River and the Atlantic. The presence of <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> in the inflows of Lake Chad is an evidence of that history.|$|R
40|$|Extract] The role of {{sirenians}} in aquatic ecosystems {{is largely}} a function of their feeding ecology. Sirenians are large herbivorous aquatic mammals that often congregate and, being mammals, have high energetic requirements relative to other marine herbivores. An adult dugong can weigh from 250 to 600 kg¹, while the West Indian and West <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> both range between 350 and 1, 400 kg². Consequently, sirenians consume significant amounts of aquatic vegetation. They also display dietary preferences in regard to plant species, individual plants, and parts of plants⁴⁻⁵. Thus dugongs and manatees {{have the capacity to}} alter the nutritional quality and species composition of the plant communities upon which they feed⁶...|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> {{was officially}} {{declared}} a species under the Trichechus senegalensis taxon in 1795 by naturalist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link. No subspecies of this taxon are known. Although African manatees live in both coastal areas and isolated inland areas, genetic evidence suggests {{no significant differences}} between the two populations. The <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> falls under the genus Trichechus with only two other species, the Amazonian manatee and the West Indian manatee, which are also sirenians.|$|E

However, even natural occurrences, such as droughts and tidal changes, often strand manatees in an unsuitable habitat. Some are killed accidentally by fishing trawls and nets intended for catching sharks. The Amazonian manatee is at risk from pollution, accidental drowning in commercial fishing nets, and the degradation of vegetation by soil erosion resulting from deforestation. Additionally, the indiscriminate release of mercury in mining activities threatens the entire aquatic ecosystem of the Amazon Basin.|$|R
5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|R

5|$|Despite being mostly solitary, {{sirenians}} congregate {{in groups}} while females are in estrus. These groups usually include one female with multiple males. Sirenians are K-selectors, so, despite the longevity, females give birth {{only a few}} times during their life and invest considerable parental care in their young. Dugongs generally gather in groups of less than a dozen individuals for one to two days. Since they congregate in turbid waters, little is known about their reproductive behavior. The males are often seen with scars, and the tusks on dugongs grow in first for males, suggesting they are important in lekking. They have also been known to lunge at each other. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, ranging anywhere from six to seventeen years. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2 to 7 years. Manatees can reach sexual maturity as early as two to five years of age. Manatee gestation length is around one year, and then they lactate for one to two years. West Indian <b>manatees</b> and <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> can breed year-round, and a female will mate with multiple male partners. Amazonian manatees have a breeding season, usually mating when the river levels begin to rise, which varies from place to place.|$|R
