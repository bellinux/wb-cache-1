50|$|Carterocephalus palaemon (<b>arctic</b> <b>skipper)</b> {{butterflies}} eat the nectar from C. purpurascens flowers, {{and their}} caterpillars {{feed on the}} shoots. Ovis canadensis (bighorn sheep) are known to graze this grass.|$|E
50|$|It {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in northern and central Europe although {{not found in}} Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Denmark, and only found very locally in Spain, the UK, and Greece. Its range extends across Asia and Japan and also into North America (where it {{is known as the}} <b>Arctic</b> <b>skipper),</b> across southern Canada and the parts of northern United States including New England, the Great Lakes area and the northwestern States, as far south as northern California.It is generally considered a woodland butterfly and breeds in and around damp woodland, favouring clearings and woodland paths and seems to have a particular attraction to blue woodland flowers.|$|E
500|$|To captain {{the ship}} and act as the expedition's second-in-command Nansen chose Otto Sverdrup, an {{experienced}} sailor who had taken part in the Greenland crossing. Theodore Jacobsen, who had experience in the <b>Arctic</b> as <b>skipper</b> of a sloop, signed on as Fram's mate, and a young naval lieutenant, Sigurd Scott Hansen, took charge of meteorological and magnetic observations. The ship's doctor, and the expedition's botanist, was Henrik Blessing, who graduated in medicine just before Fram's sailing date. Hjalmar Johansen, an army reserve lieutenant and dog-driving expert, was so determined to join the expedition that he agreed to sign on as stoker, the only position by then available. Likewise Adolf Juell, with 20 years' experience at sea as mate and captain, took the post of cook on the Fram voyage. [...] Ivar Mogstad was an official at Gaustad psychiatric hospital, but his technical abilities as a handyman and mechanic impressed Nansen. The oldest man in the party, at 40, was the chief engineer, Anton Amundsen (no relation of Roald). The second engineer, Lars Pettersen, kept his Swedish nationality from Nansen, and although it was soon discovered by his shipmates, {{he was allowed to}} remain with the expedition, the only non-Norwegian in the party. The remaining crew members were Peter Henriksen, Bernhard Nordahl and Bernt Bentzen, the last–named joining the expedition in Tromsø at very short notice.|$|R
