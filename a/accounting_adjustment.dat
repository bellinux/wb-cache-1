However, the restatement may contain information that is used to reassess the future cash flows and credibility of the firm. It is found that the earnings restatements elicit a strong negative market response. Moreover, the market response is conditioned on the content of the earnings restatements. The market-imposed penalty is more severe when the restatement is attributed to an adjustment in revenue, when it is forced by the auditor or the SEC, and when the revised earnings level is lower than two proxies used to measure expected earnings. ...|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{outcomes}} of open economy macroeconomics refers to a crucial importance of an investment-saving relation affecting a current account determination.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{transition}} of accounting from IFRS to the Czech accounting regulations. There is currently no <b>accounting</b> <b>adjustment</b> that would provide a conceptual basis for the entity that has to transit to Czech accounting regulations. The thesis was therefore focused on practical examples to demonstrate how transfer to Czech accounting regulations {{can be carried out}} even in terms of valuation. This thesis is divided into three chapters, where the first chapter {{deals with the}} issue of harmonization of accounting systems, and the main reasons for the period in which the transition will be realized. The second chapter is primarily focused on the general review of IFRS 1 which is to serve as template to set the rules for the transition from IFRS to Czech accounting regulations. This thesis focuses on the comparison and content of financial statements, the accounting principles and regulations and, namely, on valuation approaches of both accounting systems. The practical application uses model situations to demonstrate possible solutions of transition from IFRS to Czech accounting regulations.

40|$|Recent audit {{research}} has indicated that junior auditors tend to use e-mail for client inquiries. Additionally, audit firms have expressed concerns regarding the ability of junior auditors to communicate professionally. In this study, I investigate whether receiving an auditor inquiry via e-mail differentially affects client responses as compared to more traditional modes of inquiry and whether those responses are affected by the auditor’s professional tone. In an experiment, experienced business professionals respond to a request for information from an auditor regarding a potential <b>accounting</b> <b>adjustment.</b> I varied the communication mode of the request (e-mail, audio, or visual) and the professional tone of the communication (more vs. less professional tone) and then measured the extent to which participants revealed information that either supported or did not support the client’s accounting position. I find that an auditor e-mail inquiry results in client responses that are more biased towards items that support the client’s position as compared to audio or visual inquiries. In addition, I find that clients respond in a more biased manner when the inquiry is worded in a less professional tone as compared to a more professional tone and that this tendency may be exacerbated when they receive the request via e-mail. Further underscoring the implications of these findings for audit outcomes, I find that clients are less likely to agree with an auditor’s proposed income-decreasing adjustment if the client did not personally reveal applicable information to the auditor...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the impact of current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> on the {{tradable}} and nontradable sector in member countries of currency union - Euro zone. The current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> associated with the adjustment of the net export's deficit caused by the drop in the domestic absorption evokes the increase in the relative price of the nontradable sector. The paper discusses this hypothesis within framework of the Portuguese current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment,</b> which is the result of European financial integration in catching-up countries. The common monetary policy and common currency cannot offset the negative impact of nontradable price increase within the internal expenditure switching effect and also can not support exporters within the external expenditure effect [...] The Portuguese current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> was not followed by the currency depreciation and the tradable price increase.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Congress changed the law governing the use of appropriation accounts in 1990 because it found that the Department of Defense (DOD) may have spent {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars for purposes that Congress had not approved. The 1990 law provided that, 5 years after the expiration of the period of availability of a fixed-term appropriation, the appropriation account be closed and all remaining balances canceled. After closing, the appropriation account could no longer be used for obligations or expenditures for any purpose. DOD has started the process of correcting the illegal or improper closed <b>account</b> <b>adjustments</b> made during fiscal year 2000. However, this will require substantial effort and, according to DOD, estimates will not be complete before the end of fiscal year 2002. DOD had upgraded its system control features by the end of fiscal year 2001 to preclude many of the wholesale adjustments that GAO had previously identified. Because its system enhancements were done in stages, including some near the end of fiscal year 2001, DOD continued to make large amounts of illegal and otherwise improper closed <b>account</b> <b>adjustments</b> during the year. However, given the intensity of staff efforts to address these issues, it did not expect to complete the correct accounting for transactions found to be in error until September 2004. A lack of fundamental controls and management oversight over the closed accounts was the primary reason DOD was making so many closed <b>account</b> <b>adjustments.</b> DOD's action to resolve its problems with closed <b>account</b> <b>adjustments</b> is beginning to produce positive short-term results. However, if DOD fails to sustain these positive results, Congress could require DOD to validate and report to the Congress all closed <b>account</b> <b>adjustments.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{standard}} model of international transfer is augmented by {{the introduction of}} firm heterogeneity. The increase in aggregate exports in response to the transfer reflects extensive and intensive adjustments, as the sales of new exporting firms (extensive margin) contribute to the current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> along with the sales of existing exporting firms (intensive margin). The relative size of the intensive and extensive margins of the adjustment is determined by the size dispersion of firms. The model calibrated to the observed distribution of firm sizes shows that the intensive margin is the predominant channel of the current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The dampening effect of the extensive margin has therefore very little impact on the exchange rate adjustment. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{episodes of}} current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> in industrial countries {{over the past}} 30 years. We find that they were typically associated with a sizeable slowdown in domestic growth and a large exchange rate depreciation. There was no discernable change {{in the nature of}} capital flows in the period just prior to an adjustment, {{with the possible exception of}} non-residents' holdings of currency and deposits. This suggests that a current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> may be an endogenous event - responding to the resolution of domestic imbalances - rather than an exogenous event where the size of the current account deficit itself precipitates the adjustment in the domestic economy and the exchange rate. Econometric evidence suggests that global developments trigger the adjustment, possibly because they trigger the unwinding of the domestic imbalances. We find that the bulk of the ex post adjustment of the financial account was in private sector flows, primarily on the part of foreign investors. Finally, we document some notable differences in the adjustment of the current account in the United States in 1987 compared with that observed in the other episodes.

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about {{prospects}} for U. S. current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment,</b> including the possibility of what is sometimes referred to as a "disorderly correction": a sharp fall in the exchange rate that boosts interest rates, depresses stock prices, and weakens economic activity. This paper assesses some of the empirical evidence bearing on the likelihood of the disorderly correction scenario, drawing on the experience of previous current <b>account</b> <b>adjustments</b> in industrial economies. We examined the paths of key economic performance indicators before, during, and after the onset of adjustment, building on the analysis of Freund (2000). We found little evidence among past adjustment episodes of the features highlighted by the disorderly correction hypothesis. Although some episodes in our sample experienced significant shortfalls in GDP growth after the onset of adjustment, these shortfalls were not associated with significant and sustained depreciations of real exchange rates, increases in real interest rates, or declines in real stock prices. By contrast, it was among the episodes where GDP growth picked up during adjustment that the most substantial depreciations of real exchange rates occurred. These findings do not preclude the possibility that future current <b>account</b> <b>adjustments</b> could be disruptive, but they weaken the historical basis for predicting such an outcome.

The analysis shows that, even if foreigners’ net demand for U. S. assets continues to increase significantly, the current account deficit is likely to fall steeply in the not too distant future. Second, the paper uses international evidence to explore the likelihood of an abrupt decline in capital flows into the United States. Third, it {{analyzes the}} international evidence on current account reversals, to investigate the potential consequences of a sudden stop of capital inflows.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the {{exchange}} rate regime on the current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> process. In a first step, the present analysis assesses previous empirical work supporting the predominant view that more flexible exchange rate regimes facilitate current <b>account</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Using a FGLS estimator with fixed effects and panel corrected standard errors, the author draws upon the methodological approaches of two pertinent papers. The data set encompasses data for 171 countries for the 1970 to 2008 period. According to the fixed effects estimations, evidence in favor of the "conventional wisdom" does not prove to be robust. After pointing out fundamental weaknesses of the fixed effects estimator within this context, the author performs a dynamic panel estimation using a System GMM estimator fully developed in Blundell and Bond (1998). The results of this approach stand in contrast to the previous estimations, providing solid empirical evidence in favor of the predominant view. A monotonic relationship between exchange rate regime flexibility and the rate of current account reversion can be observed, indicating faster current account convergence for more flexible regimes. By employing an estimator that is more germane to the issue under investigation, the paper fills an important gap between economic common sense and its underlying empirics.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new theory}} of international economics by introducing Heckscher-Ohlin features of intra-temporal trade into an intertemporal trade approach of current account. To do so, we consider a dynamic general equilibrium model with tradable sectors of different factor intensities, which allows for substitution between intertemporal trade (current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment)</b> and intra-temporal trade (goods trade). An economy's response to a shock generally involves {{a combination of a}} change in the composition of goods trade and a change in the current account. Flexible factor markets reduce the need for the current account to adjust. On the other hand, the more rigid the factor markets, the larger the size of current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> relative to the volume of goods trade, and the slower the speed of adjustment of the current account towards its long-run equilibrium.
