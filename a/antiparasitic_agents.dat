40|$|Due to {{the high}} use of {{antibiotics}} and antiparasitics {{for the treatment of}} livestock, there is concern about the potential impacts of the release of these compounds into freshwater ecosystems. In this context, the present study quantified the acute toxicity of two antibiotics (sulfadiazine and sulfadimidine), and three <b>antiparasitic</b> <b>agents</b> (flubendazole, fenbendazole, ivermectin) for nine freshwater invertebrate species. These experiments revealed a low degree of toxicity for the sulfonamide antibiotics, with limited implications in the survival of all test species at the highest test concentrations (50 and 100 mg/L). In contrast, all three <b>antiparasitic</b> <b>agents</b> indicated {{on the basis of their}} acute toxicity risks for the aquatic environment.

40|$|Animals {{adapt to}} the {{variability}} of the external environment and to their changing internal needs not only by generating homeostatic physiological responses, but also by operating in the external environment. In this study, we determined whether sheep with a gastrointestinal parasite infection increased intake of a low-quality food containing a natural <b>antiparasitic</b> <b>agent</b> (tannins) relative to non-parasitized sheep. Four groups of lambs (n = 8 lambs/group) were assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial design with parasitic burden (P = parasites; NP = no parasites) and the offer of a supplement containing tannins (yes, no) as the main factors. Parasitized lambs ate more of the tannin-containing food than non-parasitized lambs for the first 12 days of the study, when parasite burdens were high, but differences became smaller and disappeared {{toward the end of}} the study when parasite burdens decreased.

40|$|Introduction. Orbital myiasis is the {{infestation}} of {{the orbital}} tissues by fly larvae or maggots. Compromise of periorbital tissues by malignant disease, surgery, ischemia, or infection may predispose {{the patient to}} orbital myiasis. Case Report. A 73 -year-old male patient with neglected recurrent basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid invasive into the orbit presented with complaints of intense itching and crawling sensation with maggots wriggling and falling from the wound of left orbit. The patient improved following manual removal of the maggots along with oral Ivermectin treatment. Recurrence of the basal cell carcinoma was confirmed by punch biopsy from the wound and extended exenteration of the orbit followed by reconstructive surgery was done. Conclusion. Orbital myiasis is a rare and preventable ocular morbidity that can complicate the malignancies resulting in widespread tissue destruction. The broad spectrum <b>antiparasitic</b> <b>agent,</b> Ivermectin, {{can be used as}} noninvasive means to treat orbital myiasis. In massive orbital myiasis and those associated with malignancies, exenteration of the orbit must be seriously considered...|$|R

The study enrolled 2490 HIV-infected persons in Lima, Peru, and 230 were microscopy positive for Cryptosporidium infection. Specimens from 193 participants were available for genotyping. They had C. hominis (141 persons), C. parvum (22 persons), C. meleagridis (17 persons), C. canis (6 persons), C. felis (6 persons), and C. suis (1 person) infection. Although microscopy results showed that Cryptosporidium infections were associated with diarrhea, only infections with C. canis, C. felis, and subtype family Id of C. hominis were associated with diarrhea, and infection with C. parvum was associated with chronic diarrhea and vomiting. These results demonstrate that different Cryptosporidium genotypes and subtype families are linked to different clinical manifestations.

40|$|The {{antifungal}} {{activity of}} the nucleoside analog 3 *-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin) was studied in a murine model of invasive candidiasis. When protected from deamination by either deoxycoformycin or coformycin, {{both of which are}} adenosine deaminase inhibitors, cordycepin exhibited potent antifungal efficacy, as demon-strated by prolongation of survival and a decrease in CFU in the kidneys of mice treated with cordycepin plus an adenosine deaminase inhibitor. The antifungal effect was seen with three different Candida isolates: Candida albicans 64, a relatively fluconazole-resistant clinical isolate of C. albicans (MIC, 16 mg/ml), and the flucon-azole-resistant Candida krusei. Cordycepin and related compounds may provide another avenue for the discovery of clinically useful antifungal drugs. It has recently been shown that the nucleoside analog 39 -deoxyadenosine (also known as cordycepin), when protected against conversion to 39 -deoxyinosine by the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA), exhibits specific cytotoxic activity against leukemia cells expressing terminal deoxynucleotidyl trans-ferase (1).
