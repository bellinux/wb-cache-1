5|$|The spores of C.stercoreus {{are roughly}} spherical and {{relatively}} large, with typical dimensions of 20–35x20–25µm, although great variability in spore size has been noted. The spores are sessile (growing {{directly from the}} surface of the basidium, without attachment via a sterigmata), and <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the basidia after it collapses and gelatinizes. This is accompanied by the gelatinization of the inner walls of the peridiole.|$|E
5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s, {{the number}} of {{municipalities}} in Bergen County had reached 70, where it still stands. After the 1920s, the legislature did not create many new municipalities, but local officials used zoning to affect land use, making annexation less attractive. Because of boroughitis, the township {{as a form of}} government all but disappeared from Bergen County. One that remains is South Hackensack, the remnants of Lodi Township that no seceding borough wanted. Its three pieces <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> each other by several miles.|$|E

5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
5|$|The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are {{club-shaped}} {{with long}} stalks. They typically hold 4 spores that are sessile, that is, attached {{directly to the}} surface of the basidium, rather than by a short stalk (a sterigmata). Spores measure about 15 to 20µm long by 8 to 12µm wide. They are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, and notched at one end. During development, the spores <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize along with other cells lining the inner walls of the peridiole. The spores expand in size somewhat after being detached from the basidia.|$|E

5|$|After rodents, bats are {{the largest}} order of mammals, making up about 20% of mammal species. There are 1,240 bat species which are {{traditionally}} recognized to belong to two suborders of bats: Megachiroptera (megabats), and the Microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats). Not all megabats are larger than microbats. Microbats use echolocation, but megabats do not, {{with the exception of}} the genus Rousettus. Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. The ears of microbats do not close to form a ring; the edges <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> each other at the base of the ear. Megabats eat fruit, nectar, or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and good visual acuity, while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highway}} heads north from the {{channels}} surrounding {{the west end}} of South Oyster Bay, it runs along {{the west side of the}} Norman J. Levy Park and Preserve and the Merrick Road Park Golf Course, both of which <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the Meadowbrook by a small creek. The golf course leads to nearby exitM9, a cloverleaf interchange with Merrick Road (unsigned County Route27 or CR27) in the Freeport section of Hempstead. Not far to the north is exitM8, another cloverleaf serving NY27 (East Sunrise Highway). After crossing the adjacent Babylon Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, the parkway continues north across East Meadow Park to reach exitM7, a cloverleaf interchange with the Babylon Turnpike (unsigned CR7A). After exitM7, the Meadowbrook makes a slight turn to the northwest as it traverses Roosevelt Preserve County Park.|$|E
5|$|Cold {{cyclones}} {{are stronger}} aloft {{than at the}} Earth's surface, or stronger {{in areas of the}} troposphere with lower pressures, per the thermal wind relationship and the hypsometric equation. The hypsometric equation dictates that colder atmospheres have less room between pressure surfaces, which corresponds to the concept of lower atmospheric thickness, and the thermal wind relation indicates that in this situation, the wind increases with height. It also means that an isolated pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. Because of its cold center, the center shows an area of thickness minimum. Since the temperature at any given radius is similar and parallel to the orientation of the pressure gradient, and therefore the wind, it is barotropic in nature. The movement of cold-core cyclones can be erratic since they <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the main belt of the Westerlies, which would otherwise steer them progressively to the east.|$|E

5|$|Han van Meegeren {{knew that}} white lead was used during Vermeer’s time, {{but of course}} he had to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade, which had changed {{significantly}} since the 17th century. During Vermeer’s time, Dutch lead was mined from deposits located in the Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and in the content of trace elements found in the ores. Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony, while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony, as those elements <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the lead during the modern smelting process.|$|E
5|$|Route 70 {{crosses the}} Pennsauken Creek into Evesham Township, Burlington County, running east through more {{commercial}} areas within the Marlton {{section of the}} township.

After the Marlton Circle, the road heads east passing through some more commercial areas and then into residential neighborhoods that <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the road by trees, narrowing into a two-lane undivided road. It continues into a mix of suburban development and rural woods and farms as it crosses into Medford Township, coming to a crossroads with CR 618. From this intersection, Route 70 continues east through the Medford area, passing a couple shopping centers before crossing CR 541. After the CR 541 intersection, the route leaves the suburban development and runs through a mix of woodland and farmland with occasional homes. It enters Southampton Township, where the road enters more wooded surroundings before coming to U.S. Route 206 at the Red Lion Circle.|$|E
5|$|The blacktip shark is an {{extremely}} fast, energetic predator that is usually found in groups of varying size. Segregation by sex and age does not occur; adult males and nonpregnant females are found apart from pregnant females, and both <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> juveniles. In Terra Ceia Bay, Florida, a nursery area for this species, juvenile blacktips form aggregations {{during the day and}} disperse at night. They aggregate most strongly in the early summer when the sharks are youngest, suggesting that they are seeking refuge from predators (mostly larger sharks) in numbers. Predator avoidance may also be the reason why juvenile blacktips do not congregate in the areas of highest prey density in the bay. Adults have no known predators. Known parasites of the blacktip shark include the copepods Pandarus sinuatus and P. smithii, and the monogeneans Dermophthirius penneri and Dionchus spp., which attach the shark's skin. This species is also parasitized by nematodes in the family Philometridae, which infest the ovaries.|$|E
