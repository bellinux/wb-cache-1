More recently, it invaded the Caribbean islands and the western hemisphere. Intriguingly, the current CHIKV outbreak in the Caribbean {{is caused by the}} Asian CHIKV genotype, which differs from the La Réunion LR 2006 OPY 1 isolate belonging to the Indian Ocean lineage. Here, we adopted a systematic and comparative approach against LR 2006 OPY 1 to characterize the pathogenicity of the Caribbean CNR 20235 isolate and consequential host immune responses in mice. Ex vivo infection using primary mouse-tail fibroblasts revealed weaker replication efficiency by CNR 20235 isolate. In the CHIKV mouse model, CNR 20235 infection induced an enervated joint pathology characterized by moderate edema and swelling, independent of mononuclear cell infiltration. Based on systemic cytokine analysis, localized immune-phenotyping and gene expression profiles in the popliteal lymph node and inflamed joints, two pathogenic phases were defined for CHIKV infection: early acute (2 - 3 dpi) and late acute (6 - 8 dpi). Reduced joint pathology during early acute phase of CNR 20235 infection was associated with a weaker pro-inflammatory Th 1 response and natural killer (NK) cells activity. The pathological role of NK cells was further demonstrated as depletion of NK cells reduced joint pathology in LR 2006 OPY 1. Taken together, this study provides evidence that the Caribbean CNR 20235 isolate has an enfeebled replication and induces a less pathogenic response in the mammalian host. The introduction of CHIKV in the Americas has heightened the risk of large-scale outbreaks due to the close proximity between the United States and the Caribbean. Immune-pathogenicity of the circulating Caribbean CHIKV isolate was explored, where it was demonstrated to exhibit reduced infectivity resulting in <b>a</b> <b>weakened</b> <b>joint</b> pathology. Analysis of serum cytokine levels, localized immune-phenotyping, and gene expression profile in the organs revealed that a limited Th 1 response and reduced NK cells activity could underlie the reduced pathology in the host. Interestingly, higher asymptomatic infections were observed in the Caribbean compared to the La Réunion outbreaks in 2005 - 2006. This is the first study that showed an association between key pro-inflammatory factors and pathology-mediating leukocytes with a less severe pathological outcome in Caribbean CHIKV infection. Given the limited information regarding the sequela of Caribbean CHIKV infection, our study is timely and will aid the understanding of this increasingly important disease...|$|E

40|$|Multi-material {{structures}} pose {{an attractive}} option for overcoming {{some of the}} central challenges in lightweight design. An exceptionally high potential for creating cost-effective lightweight solutions is attributed to the combination of steel and aluminum. However, these materials are also particularly difficult to join due to their tendency to form intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The growth of these compounds is facilitated by high temperatures and long process times. Due to their high brittleness, IMCs can severely <b>weaken</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint.</b> Thus, it is only possible to create durable steel-aluminum joints when the formation of IMCs can be limited to a non-critical level. To meet this goal, a new joining method has been designed. The method {{is based on the}} combination of a continuous wave (pw) and a pulsed laser (pw) source. Laser beams from both sources are superimposed in a common process zone. This makes it possible to apply the advantages of laser brazing to mixed-metal joints without requiring the use of chemical fluxes. The double beam technology was first tested in bead-on-plate experiments using different filler wire materials. Based on the results of these tests, a process for joining steel and aluminum in a double-flanged configuration is now being developed. The double flanged seams are joined using zinc- or aluminum-based filler wires. Microsections of selected seams show {{that it is possible to}} achieve good base material wetting while limiting the growth of IMCs to acceptable measures. In addition, the results of tensile tests show that high joint strengths can be achieved...|$|R
