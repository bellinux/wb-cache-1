40|$|Methotrexate (MTX) and N-(phosphonacetyl) - -aspartate (PALA) are two {{agents to}} which {{cellular}} resistance can be conferred by gene amplification, {{but they do}} not generally show cross resistance. However, combined treatment with these two agents produced drug resistant cells in the B 16 melanoma cell line at a much higher frequency than would be expected if resistance to the two agents was totally independent. An isolated doubly resistant clone, B 16 -F 1 MP, showed a high frequency of resistance to pyrazofurin and ouabain, which are also agents to which resistance can be conferred by gene amplification. Thus MTX combined with PALA selected cells with an ‘amplificator’ phenotype (an increased ability to amplify parts of the genome). These B 16 -F 1 MP cells had a decreased ability to form experimental lung metastases compared with the parent line but this difference was not found in baby hamster kidney cells with the <b>amplificator</b> phenotype. The mechanism underlying drug resistance may need to be considered when designing combination chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Private Utility and Public Utility in the Landscape-Environmental Evolution. The contraposition {{between public}} and private {{interest}} is a political common place, certainly not typical of today. It can also be observed that while there is the great convincement that the public and private utility are in conflict for what concerns urban landscape and industrial areas, there has been, and partially there is even today, the silent convincement that in the agricultural areas the public and the private goods correspond. Maybe {{this is due to the}} fact that we have been used for many centuries to an extraurban landscape forged by agriculture, so it seems to us as the only right landscape in that area, and therefore it is considered beautiful. On the other hand we know well that modern agriculture has bought to relevant environmental damages, and that the high agricultural industrialization does not only harm the beauty, the variety and the harmony of landscape, but sometimes it ruins also the geological infrastructures. Without trying wishfully to hand out reports, the aim of this work is to prepare the setting for equilibrated evaluations and, mostly, not only one-sided. In particular the <b>amplificators</b> that work at the perception and formation of landscape are compared. The possible causes of the evolution are therefore outlined, both for what concerns those that work casually, that those derived from known and organised decisions...|$|R

Com o propósito de estabelecer a prevalência de infecções por esses agentes em reserva ecológica, localizada naquela área, pesquisou-se a presença de anticorpos, bem como suas possíveis associações com características individuais e familiares dos investigados. MÉTODOS: Pesquisaram-se anticorpos para os antígenos dos vírus Rocio (ROC), Ilhéus (ILH), encefalite de St. Louis (SLE), encefalites eqüinas do leste (EEE), oeste (WEE) e venezuelana (VEE), em 182 pessoas pertencentes a 58 famílias residentes na Estação Ecológica de Juréia-Itatins, utilizando-se testes de inibição de hemaglutinação e neutralização com redução de placas. Usou-se Mac-Elisa para pesquisar anticorpos IgM para os vírus ROC, ILH e EEE. RESULTADOS: Foi observada a presença de anticorpos para todos os arbovírus testados, com exceção do vírus WEE. A prevalência total de anticorpos foi 26, 9 % (21, 4 % para alfavírus e 12, 6 % para flavivírus). Não foram encontrados anticorpos IgM. Entre as várias características pesquisadas dos indivíduos e de suas famílias, a idade, a ocupação, a naturalidade e o hábito de entrar na mata mostraram-se estatisticamente associados a infecções por arbovírus (p OBJECTIVE: Serological {{inquires}} {{conducted in}} the Ribeira Valley, S. Paulo State, Brazil, showed an intense circulation of pathogenic arboviruses in the region. The goal was to verify the prevalence of arboviral infections in people living at the local ecological, and its potential association with these population' individual and familiar characteristics. METHODS: The study was carried out among 182 persons of 58 families to identify the presence of antibodies to the following viruses: Rocio (ROC), Ilheus (ILH), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEE), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE). Inhibition hemagglutination test and plaque reduction neutralization test were the laboratory assays of choice. MAC-ELISA was used to identify IgM antibodies to ROC, ILH and EEE viruses. RESULTS: The prevalence of antibodies was 26. 9 % (21. 4 % to alphavirus and 12. 6 % to flavivirus). There were no antibodies to WEE virus. IgM antibodies were not observed suggesting no recent infection in study population. Among the characteristics investigated, age, occupation, place of birth and the habit of going into the forest were shown to be statistically associated with arboviral infection (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: It was observed an intense circulation of pathogenic arboviruses, especially VEE. It seems the habit of going into the forest {{is the most important}} factor to this population exposure to the mosquito vectors of arboviruses. The results suggest the need of further investigation to clarify the role of birds as arbovirus infection <b>amplificators</b> indoors...|$|R
40|$|Lasers {{utilization}} in biomedical {{areas is}} a growing area, {{in spite of the}} collateral thermal damage that they can cause in the surrounding tissue. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze, in vitro, the ablative interaction of a femtosecond and high power laser, the amplified Ti:sapphire laser (830 nm), impinging in the hard tissue, in particular, the rabbit bone tissue. A principal oscillator and an <b>amplificator</b> compose this laser system (CPA technique). The extracted pulses peaking at 830 nm, after the temporal compression, present 51 fs, 1000 Hz and energy of ~ 0, 7 mJ. The M 2 quality factor was 2. 0, and the laser was focused by 20 cm focus lens. A computerized translation table x, z was also used for the movement of the samples. We determined an ablation threshold fluency of 0, 54 J/cm 2 and the ablation threshold intensity of 9, 26 TW/cm 2. Using the Optical Coherent Technique, we analyzed the ablation volume as a function of the intensity and then verified that the intensity the maximum ablation rate is found at four times the ablation limier intensity. With the SEM analysis, we observed the cavities produced with shape edges, at sub micrometric order, sharp design and high cut precision. Thermal damages were not observed in any of the samples...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{variability}} of water chemistry {{on a daily}} scale is rarely addressed {{due to the lack}} of records. Appropriate tools, such as typologies and dimensionless indicators, which permit comparisons between stations and between river materials, are missing. Such tools are developed here for daily concentrations (C), specific fluxes or yields (Y) and specific river flow (q). The data set includes 128 long-term daily records, for suspended particulate matter (SPM), total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved and total nutrients, totalling 1236 years of records. These 86 river basins (103 - 106 km 2) cover a wide range of environmental conditions in semi-arid and temperate regions. The segmentation [...] truncation of C-q rating curves into two parts at median flows (q 50) generates two exponents (b 50 inf and b 50 sup) that are different for 66 % of the analysed rating curves. After segmentation, the analysis of records results in the definition of nine major C-q types combining concentrating, diluting or stable patterns, showing inflexions, chevron and U shapes. SPM and TDS are preferentially distributed among a few types, while dissolved and total nutrients are more widely distributed. Four dimensionless indicators of daily variability combine median (C 50, Y 50), extreme (C 99, Y 99) and flow-weighted (C*, Y*) concentrations and yields (e. g. C 99 /C 50, Y*/Y 50). They vary over two to four orders of magnitude in the analysed records, discriminating stations and river material. A second set of four indicators of relative variability [e. g. (Y*/Y 50) /(q*/q 50) ], takes into account the daily flow variability, as expressed by q*/q 50 and q 99 /q 50, which also vary over multiple orders of magnitude. The truncated exponent b 50 sup is used to describe fluxes at higher flows accounting for 75 % (TDS) to 97 % (SPM) of interannual fluxes. It ranges from − 0 * 61 to + 1 * 86 in the database. It can be regarded as the key <b>amplificator</b> (positive b 50 sup) or reductor (negative b 50 sup) of concentrations or yields variability. C 50, Y 50, b 50 sup can also be estimated in discrete surveys, which provides a new perspective for quantifying and mapping water quality variability at daily scal...|$|E
