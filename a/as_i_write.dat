500|$|In 1847 Felix Mendelssohn {{attended}} a London performance of Robert – an opera which musically he despised – {{in order to}} hear Jenny Lind's British debut, {{in the role of}} Alice. The music critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked at me, as if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Books and {{characters}} in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character Slappy the Dummy {{was inspired by the}} literary classic The Adventures of Pinocchio. Some of Stine's ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea for the book The Haunted Mask after his son, Matt, had a Halloween mask that he had trouble getting off. Stine also uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, [...] "Luckily, I have a great memory. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> a story, I can remember {{what it feels like to}} be afraid and panicky". Stine states that he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets the title lead him to a story.|$|E
60|$|All {{that was}} written when {{the facts of the}} case were well known, and now the story shall be taken up <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> it when a boy.|$|R
6000|$|Vain solace! Memory {{standing}} near [...] Cast down her eyes, {{and in her}} throat [...] Her voice seem'd distant, and a tear [...] Dropt on the letters [7] <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Grand Pianola Music (1982): Adams commented, [...] "Dueling pianos, cooing sirens, Valhalla brass, thwacking bass drums, gospel triads, and a Niagara of {{cascading}} flat keys all {{learned to}} cohabit <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> the piece." ...|$|R
500|$|Austen {{wrote in}} her first {{surviving}} letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was [...] "very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man". She called him her [...] "friend" [...] and explained that on this account Cassandra must be anxious {{to know more about}} her new [...] "friend". Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote she expected an [...] "offer" [...] from her [...] "friend" [...] and that [...] "I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat", going on to write [...] "I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence" [...] and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: [...] "The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> at this melancholy idea".|$|E
500|$|Matt Tuck {{spoke to}} Daniel Marez of Metal Hammer in March 2009 about the band's {{progress}} on writing and recording their third album. Tuck stated {{that there were}} four or five songs that were finished and that [...] "usually we write and record 14 tracks that I then have to write vocal lines for, but this time I’m trying to write the vocals <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> the music." [...] Bullet for My Valentine confirmed in August 2009 that they were aiming for an early 2010 release for the new album, while Tuck stated that the upcoming record is [...] "a lot more mature-sounding, it's a lot more classic. It'll {{stand the test of}} time [...] than both the previous things we've done." [...] In a January 2010 interview with Rock Sound, Tuck stated explained details for the album: it would be titled Fever, and the 11-track record would have a sound closer to The Poison rather than Scream Aim Fire and contain no ballads.|$|E
500|$|Mendelssohn met {{and worked}} with Lind many times, and started an opera, Lorelei, for her, based on {{the legend of the}} Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was {{unfinished}} at his death. He is said to have tailored the aria [...] "Hear Ye Israel" [...] in his oratorio Elijah to Lind's voice, although she did not sing this part until after his death, at a concert in December 1848. In 1847 Mendelssohn attended a London performance of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable– an opera which musically he despised– in order to hear Lind's British debut, in the role of Alice. The music critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked at me, as if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mlle. Lind's genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success".|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> signed, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> {{the lamp}} went out, leaving us in {{darkness}}, {{and through the}} darkness once more I heard that sound of laughter echoing {{in the air above}} the house.|$|R
6000|$|The playwright {{remained}} on his guard. [...] "Well, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> you, <b>I</b> {{had a couple}} of plays accepted and helped to produce them. There's nothing more wearing than producing a play. The anxiety is killing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Anal Cunt's 1997 album I Like It When You Die {{contained}} the track [...] "You're in a Coma". Putnam's {{reaction to the}} resulting irony {{of being in a}} coma was published in the Boston Phoenix: [...] "Actually, it turned out it was just as gay <b>as</b> the song <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> nine years ago - being in a coma was just as fuckin' stupid <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> it was." ...|$|R
500|$|Still, Balzac {{believed}} that keeping her letters was dangerous and, {{in a moment}} of characteristic impulse, threw them into the fire. He described it to her as [...] "the saddest and most frightful day of my life... I am looking at the ashes <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> to you, and I tremble seeing how little space fifteen years takes up." [...] On 5 September 1847 he left Paris to join {{her for the first time}} in Wierzchownia. They spent several happy months together, but financial obligations required his presence in France. The Revolution of 1848 began one week after his return. Back in Wierzchownia, Hańska lost 80,000 francs due to a granary fire, and her time was consumed with three lawsuits. These complications, and Balzac's constant debt, meant that their finances were unstable, and she hesitated anew at the idea of marriage. In any case, a wedding would be impossible without approval from the Tsar, which he did not grant until spring of 1850. On 2 July 1849 Russian authorities responding to Balzac's request in December 1847 to marry Hańska stated that he could do so, but that Hańska could not keep her land.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with series creator Reki Kawahara, the author noted that the female characters in Sword Art Online were not based on anyone he knew personally, with him stating [...] "I don't usually make a character, setting, or anything before I start writing. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> the story, the girls become what they are now. So, somehow, I don't know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters {{to be strong and}} capable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mendelssohn {{was present}} at Lind's London debut in Robert le Diable, and his friend, the critic H. F. Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose {{enjoyment}} of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked at me, as if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mademoiselle Lind's genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success". Mendelssohn worked with Lind on many occasions and wrote the beginnings of an opera, Lorelei, for her, based on {{the legend of the}} Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was unfinished at his death. He included a high F sharp in his oratorio Elijah ("Hear Ye Israel") with Lind's voice in mind.|$|E
60|$|I endured it stoutly, but {{inwardly}} <b>I</b> was shaken, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> to Philip, {{giving him}} full {{details of what}} had been said and what answers I had returned, what bitter draughts I had been forced to swallow.|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked over}} me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote.</b> [...] "That will do," [...] she said, when I had done. [...] "Thank God, Mackellar, I have you to lean upon! But what {{can it be}} now? What, what can it be?" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{conversation}} gave me {{food for}} reflection during a week. I was troubled about Mr. Swain, {{and what he}} had said as to not living kept running in my head <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> or figured. For I had enough to hold me busy.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with series creator Reki Kawahara, the author noted that the female characters in Sword Art Online were not based on anyone he knew in the real world, with him stating [...] "I don’t usually make a character, setting, or anything before I start writing. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> the story, the girls become what they are now. So, somehow, I don’t know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters {{to be strong and}} capable." [...] Kawahara also added that he wrote the series to demonstrate that he views online gaming not as a social ill or escape from real life, and thus decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels. In another interview with Anime News Network, interviewer Lynzee Lamb noted that Asuna is a [...] "very strong, capable female character", likening her to Genji's mother in The Tale of Genji, to which Kawahara agreed.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 October 2009, May wrote a fanclub {{letter on}} his website stating that Queen had no {{intentions}} to tour in 2010 {{but that there}} was a possibility of a performance. He was quoted as saying, [...] "The greatest debate, though, is always about when we will next play together as Queen. At the moment, in spite of the many rumours that are out there, we do not have plans to tour in 2010. The good news, though, is that Roger and I have a much closer mutual understanding these days—privately and professionally ... and all ideas are carefully considered. Music is never far away from us. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>write,</b> there is an important one-off performance on offer, in the USA, and it remains to be decided whether we will take up this particular challenge. Every day, doors seem to open, and every day, we interact, perhaps more than ever before, with the world outside. It is a time of exciting transition in Rock music and in 'The Business'. It's good that the pulse still beats". On 15 November 2009, May and Taylor performed [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] live on the British TV show The X Factor alongside the finalists.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{works out}} [...] "about a third" [...] of the {{finished}} arrangement of a song as he's writing it, leaving the rest to studio experimentation. As he writes in 1990: [...] "Making an instrumental track is a whole experience. It starts after you have written a song. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> a song, I write some of the instrumental piano and pluck some of the different notes for the arrangement. It's impossible to lay the whole arrangement on the piano but you play just {{enough to get the}} overall feelin’ of the record. It is an art in itself. I always get that bigger picture of my records at my piano before I record them. I go in there prepared." [...] From the very beginning, Wilson handled most stages of the group's recording process, despite Nik Venet being credited for producing their early recordings. He preferred mixing live as performances were recorded, as opposed to mixing after the fact. He was open to changes suggested by others while recording, often taking advice and even incorporating apparent mistakes if they provided a useful or interesting alternative. On Surfin' U.S.A. (1963), Brian began doubletracking. As was practiced by other record producers from the 1960s, most of his mixes ended up in single-channel monaural, believing that varied stereo speaker placement took his control over the sound image away to the listener.|$|E
60|$|Just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> {{the last}} words of the {{enclosed}} little story for the Christmas number just now, Edward brought in your letter. Also one from Forster (tell him) which I have not yet opened. <b>I</b> will <b>write</b> again--and write to him--from Florence. I am delighted to have news of you.|$|R
60|$|I {{sat down}} mechanically. Mamma began dictating. <b>I</b> cried <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> it. <b>I</b> know now how very shameful and wrong {{it was of}} me; but I was only eighteen, and I was {{accustomed}} to do as mamma told me in everything. She had a terrible will, you know, and a terrible temper.|$|R
60|$|Although Bacheller {{declined}} {{to go into}} partnership with me we had a gorgeous trip, {{and that was the}} main object so far as the other fellows were concerned, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> an article on the caverns of Cacawamilpa which paid my expenses I was content.|$|R
60|$|At this, of course, I laughed out--I laugh still <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> it.|$|E
60|$|TO PLATO, the owl, {{who looks}} over my {{shoulder}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write,</b> and who knows all about the woods.|$|E
60|$|His name--. How {{my heart}} beats <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> it--no, I cannot write it, I will whisper it--it is Otto Dinkelspiel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> {{you in my}} letter, I {{was engaged}} to make as {{thorough}} an examination as possible of the living conditions and housing of the operatives {{in the city of}} Hampton. I'm sure you'd be interested in hearing something of the situation we found." ...|$|R
60|$|Of Framley Parsonage I {{need only}} further say, that <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> it <b>I</b> became {{more closely than}} ever acquainted with the new shire which I had added to the English counties. I had it all in my mind,--its roads and railroads, its towns and parishes, its members of Parliament, and the {{different}} hunts which rode over it. I knew all the great lords and their castles, the squires and their parks, the rectors and their churches. This was the fourth novel of which I had placed the scene in Barsetshire, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> it <b>I</b> made {{a map of the}} dear county. Throughout these stories there has been no name given to a fictitious site which does not represent to me a spot of which I know all the accessories, <b>as</b> though <b>I</b> had lived and wandered there.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> think <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> more spontaneously it {{came from}} a more {{personal}} state of mind. Some one who is smarter than me said [...] "All art is created from a place between megalomania and self loathing." [...] It's a roller coaster between the two and it hasn't gotten any easier.|$|R
60|$|To-day, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write,</b> {{hundreds}} more are expected; and to-morrow {{and the next}} day more, and so on for many days.|$|E
60|$|A {{sad story}} in truth. Although it {{happened}} {{so many years ago}} I weep <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> it--I weep as Umbelazi wept.|$|E
60|$|I got {{an answer}} from Leicester, where the Colonel resided, within two days. I have it before me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write,</b> and copy it verbatim.|$|E
60|$|And I do {{hope that}} you may have found {{pleasure}} in considering their lives and their works <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have done. For <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> of their behavior and pondered upon it, meseemed they offered a very high example that anyone might follow to his betterment who lives in this world where so much that is ill needs to be amended.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not kind at all," [...] I said, [...] "I {{was very}} glad {{to think that there}} was a place I seemed to know {{something}} of, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> the address down in my pocket-book at the time, I had no trouble in finding it. Have you given up your old occupation?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Mellencamp concluded: [...] "I {{related to}} that song ever since I was like 17 years old". Sad Clowns: Mellencamp told Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone magazine: [...] "As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> that, <b>I</b> looked up and said, 'Thanks, Ray.' Because I know it's a Ray Davies song, like 'Sunny Afternoon' - a self-deprecating song".|$|R
