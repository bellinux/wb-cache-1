[...] Additionally, the energetic and flamboyant {{way in which}} Lumiere, a suave, French-accented candelabra, is personified and portrayed throughout [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] has often been likened to French entertainer Maurice Chevalier. The Washington Post commented, [...] "The model for Lumiere {{seems to have been}} Maurice Chevalier, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> so choice, and so deftly executed, that it places him immediately among the top rank of Disney characters." [...] American actor and singer Jerry Orbach, who provided the voice of Lumiere, himself admitted to People that the character was very much him doing a deliberate impersonation of Chevalier.|$|E
500|$|The duty {{of laying}} tefillin rests upon Jewish males {{after the age}} of {{thirteen}} years. Although women are exempt from the obligation, some early codifers allowed them to do so. Moses Isserles (16thcentury), however, strongly discourages it. Historically, the mitzvah of tefillin was not performed by women, but the ritual was apparently kept by some women in medieval France and Germany. Traditions exist of some prominent women laying tefillin. Rashi's daughters allegedly wore tefillin, as did the wife of Chaim ibn Attar and the female Hasidic Rebbe known as Maiden of Ludmir. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> gaining a following among women affiliated to the Conservative movement. In 2013 SAR High School in Riverdale, New York began allowing girls to wrap tefillin during Shacharit-morning prayer; it is probably the first Modern Orthodox high school in the U.S. to do so. The wearing of tefillin by members of Women of the Wall at the Western Wall caused consternation from the rabbi in charge of the site until a Jerusalem District Court judge ruled in 2013 that doing so was not a violation of “local custom.” ...|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} short {{trailers}} for [...] "Trampoline", getting gradually longer in length, teased different {{sections of the}} instrumental and music video. Each teaser features the Demonstration insignia, which is a horizontal red stripe going through {{the centre of the}} artwork. The first teaser was five seconds long and simply a synth and sub drop. The second is seventeen seconds long and shows a hanging microphone, accompanied by slightly more of the track. The third shows a hooded Tinie, accompanied by a different section of the track. At the end Tinie says [...] "yeah". The fourth and final trailer was released a day prior to the premiere of the track, and includes part of the chorus. It shows Tinie walking up to the camera and grinning. The album artwork and artwork for each of the singles feature the red stripe, and even the colour two-tone vinyl has a red stripe going across it. The stripe also features on the physical disc. Tinie teamed up with Warner Music Group to develop the Tinie Tempah: Rap Demonstration app for the iTunes Store, released on 5 February 2014. The app uses recordings of Tempah's mouth rapping the album in its entirety, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that you can rap along to it.|$|E

6000|$|... (Seeing {{questions}} {{rising to}} lips.) Hold your little tongues, children; it's very late, and you'll make me forget what I've to say. Fancy yourselves in pews, for five minutes. There's {{one point of}} possible good in the conventual system, which is always attractive to young girls; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> a very dangerous one;-- 0the notion of a merit, or exalting virtue, consisting in a habit of meditation on the [...] "things above," [...] or things of the next world. Now it is quite true, that a person of beautiful mind, dwelling on whatever appears to them most desirable and lovely in a possible future, will not only pass their time pleasantly, but will even acquire, at last, a vague and wildly gentle charm of manner and feature, which will give them an air of peculiar sanctity {{in the eyes of}} others. Whatever real or apparent good there may be in this result, I want you to observe, children, that we have no real authority for the reveries to which it is owing. We are told nothing distinctly of the heavenly world; except that it will be free from sorrow, and pure from sin. What is said of pearl gates, golden floors, and the like, is accepted as merely figurative by religious enthusiasts themselves; and whatever they pass their time in conceiving, whether of the happiness of risen souls, of their intercourse, or of the appearance and employment of the heavenly powers, is entirely the product of their own imagination; and as completely and distinctly a work of fiction, or romantic invention, as any novel of Sir Walter Scott's. That the romance is founded on religious theory or doctrine;--that no disagreeable or wicked persons are admitted into the story;--and that the inventor fervently hopes that some portion of it may hereafter come true, does not in the least alter the real nature of the effort or enjoyment.|$|E
6000|$|It must {{be remembered}} that for some years before Panda's death the Zulus had not been engaged in any foreign war. When Cetywayo ascended the throne, it was the general hope and {{expectation}} of the army, and therefore of the nation, that this period of inaction would come to an end, and that the new king would inaugurate an active foreign policy. They did not greatly care in what direction the activity developed itself, provided it did develop. It must also be borne in mind that every able-bodied man in the Zulu country {{was a member of}} a regiment, even the lads being attached to regiments as carriers, and the women being similarly enrolled, though they did not fight. The Zulu military system was the universal-service system of Germany brought to an absolute perfection, obtained by subordinating all the ties and duties of civil life to military ends. Thus, for instance, marriage could not be contracted at will, but only by the permission of the king, which was generally delayed until a regiment was well advanced in years, when a number of girls were handed over to it to take to wife. This regulation came into force because it was found that men without home ties were more ferocious and made better soldiers, and the result of these harsh rules was that the Zulu warrior, living as he did under the shadow of a savage discipline, for any breach of which there was but one punishment, death, can hardly be said to have led a life of domestic comfort, such as men of all times and nations have thought their common right. But even a Zulu must have some object in life, some shrine at which to worship, some mistress of his affections. Home he had none, religion he had none, mistress he had none, but in their stead he had his career as a warrior, and his hope of honour and riches to be gained by the assegai. His home was on the war-track with his regiment, his religion the fierce denunciation of the isanusi,[*] and his affections were fixed on the sudden rush of battle, the red slaughter, and the spoils of the slain. [...] "War," [...] says Sir T. Shepstone, in a very remarkable despatch written about a year before the outbreak of the Zulu war, [...] "is the universal cry among the soldiers, who are anxious to live up to their traditions, [...] . <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> gaining ground among the people that their nation has outlived the object of its existence." [...] Again he says, [...] "The engine (the Zulu military organisation) has not ceased to exist or to generate its forces, although the reason or excuse for its existence has died away: these forces have continued to accumulate and are daily accumulating without safety-valve or outlet." ...|$|E

6000|$|XI. For that period, then, we must build; not, indeed, {{refusing to}} {{ourselves}} {{the delight of}} present completion, nor hesitating to follow such portions of character as may depend upon delicacy of execution to the highest perfection {{of which they are}} capable, even although we may know that in the course of years such details must perish; but taking care that for work of this kind we sacrifice no enduring quality, and that the building shall not depend for its impressiveness upon anything that is perishable. This would, indeed, be the law of good composition under any circumstances, the arrangement of the larger masses being always a matter of greater importance than the treatment of the smaller; but in architecture there is much in that very treatment which is skilful or otherwise in proportion to its just regard to the probable effects of time: and (which is still more to be considered) there is a beauty in those effects themselves, which nothing else can replace, and which it is our wisdom to consult and to desire. For though, hitherto, we have been speaking of the sentiment of age only, there is an actual beauty in the marks of it, such and so great as to have become not unfrequently the subject of especial choice among certain schools of art, and to have impressed upon those schools the character usually and loosely expressed by the term [...] "picturesque." [...] It is of some importance to our present purpose to determine the true meaning of this expression, as it is now generally used; for there is a principle to be developed from that use which, while it has occultly been the ground of much that is true and just in our judgment of art, has never been so far understood as to become definitely serviceable. Probably no word in the language (exclusive of theological expressions), {{has been the subject of}} so frequent or so prolonged dispute; yet none remained more vague in their acceptance, and it seems to me to be a matter of no small interest to investigate the essence of that idea which all feel, and (to appearance) with respect to similar things, and yet which every attempt to define has, as I believe, ended either in mere enumeration of the effects and objects to which the term has been attached, or else in attempts at abstraction more palpably nugatory than any which have disgraced metaphysical investigation on other subjects. A recent critic on Art, for instance, has gravely advanced the theory that the essence of the picturesque consists in the expression of [...] "universal decay." [...] It would be curious to see the result of an attempt to illustrate this idea of the picturesque, in a painting of dead flowers and decayed fruit, and equally curious to trace the steps of any reasoning which, on such a theory, should account for the picturesqueness of an ass colt as opposed to a horse foal. But there is much excuse for even the most utter failure in reasonings of this kind, since the subject is, indeed, one of the most obscure of all that may legitimately be submitted to human reason; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> itself so varied in the minds of different men, according to their subjects of study, that no definition can be expected to embrace more than a certain number of its infinitely multiplied forms.|$|E
