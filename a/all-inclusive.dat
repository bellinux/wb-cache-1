5|$|The December 2002 Global and <b>All-Inclusive</b> Agreement devoted Chapter VII to {{the armed}} forces. It stipulated that {{the armed forces}} chief of staff, and the chiefs of the army, air force, and navy were not {{to come from the}} same warring faction. The new 'national, {{restructured}} and integrated' army would be made up from Kabila's government forces (the FAC), the RCD, and the MLC. Also stipulated in VII(b) was that the RCD-N, RCD-ML, and the Mai-Mai would become part of the new armed forces. An intermediate mechanism for physical identification of the soldiers, and their origin, date of enrolment, and unit was also called for (VII(c)). It also provided {{for the creation of a}} Conseil Superieur de la Defense (Superior Defence Council) which would declare states of siege or war and give advice on security sector reform, disarmament/demobilization, and national defence policy.|$|E

(The members of a species cannot produce viable, fertile offspring with members of other species). Mayr's definition has gained wide acceptance among biologists, but does not apply to organisms such as bacteria, which reproduce asexually.|$|E

Messages from that conference were later published as a book entitled The <b>All-Inclusive</b> Christ. In the ensuing years, Lee was invited to speak to Christian groups throughout the United States. His messages delivered during shorter conferences and longer trainings were printed in The Stream magazine, published by The Stream Publishers (later renamed Living Stream Ministry).|$|E
25|$|General {{admission}} to the game is free, and the main concourse concessions are open, but {{there are several ways}} for fans to pay a ticket price for an upgraded experience. For the friends and family that want to get as close to the action as possible, the league sells {{admission to}} the Cardinals Club. The infamous green seats (typically off-limits during amateur games) provide a front-row viewing experience directly behind home plate. The <b>all-inclusive</b> ticket comes with the full amenities of any pro gameday. It grants access to an internal bar/restaurant, {{with a wide range of}} food and beverages that can be delivered to the guest's seats while they watch.|$|E

The women's houses include Ann Tweedale, Glenwood, Twin Pines, Maclure, Stewart, Devonshire, and Shoemaker. All cooperative houses are governed under the Purdue Cooperative Council which {{is led by}} Purdue University students who live in these houses. The cooperative system allows for a much lower cost of living than other types of housing, averaging $2900 annually with <b>all-inclusive</b> monthly rent ranging from $250-$625 varying by house.

25|$|In {{addition}} to cutting its {{ties with the}} Second International, the 1920 Annual Conference of the ILP directed its executive to contact the Swiss Socialist Party {{with a view to}} establishing an <b>all-inclusive</b> international which would join the internationalist left wing socialist parties with their revolutionary socialist brethren of the new Moscow international. A further set of questions were asked of the Comintern in letter dated 21 May 1920 by ILP Chairman Richard Wallhead and National Council member Clifford Allen. The Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) was asked for its positions on such matters as demands for rigid adherence to its program, applicability of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Soviet system to Great Britain, and its view on the necessity of armed force as a universal principle.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{the estate}} of Joe Shuster estate filed suit to recover Shuster's {{copyright}} interest in Superman, Superboy, and other characters. DC Comics counter-sued, arguing the 1992 agreement barred any such claim. In 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California held in DC Comics v. Pacific Pictures Corp., No. CV 10-3633 ODW (RZx), 2012 WL 4936588 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 17, 2012), that the 1992 agreement's broad, <b>all-inclusive</b> language was more than adequate to cover the Superman and Superboy copyrights in which Shuster had an interest. Thus, the estate was barred from seeking their termination under the Copyright Act. Whatever interest Shuster had in Superboy stayed with DC Comics. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the Shuster family's appeal in October 2014, leaving the district court's ruling intact.|$|E
25|$|All-you-can-eat seats, {{also called}} <b>all-inclusive</b> sections, are blocs {{of seats in}} a Major League Baseball or Minor League Baseball park in which seat holders are {{entitled}} to unlimited hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, peanuts, soft drinks, and bottled water before and during a game. Typically located in less desirable areas of the ballpark, such as the bleachers and upper decks, all-you-can-eat (AYCE) seats are priced approximately 50% higher than seats in the same section, but are viewed by patrons as a bargain considering the added cost of ballpark food. The first AYCE section was introduced at Dodger Stadium in 2007. The trend spread to 19 of the 30 major league parks by 2010 and numerous minor league parks by 2012. In 2008 AYCE seats were also inaugurated in numerous NBA and NHL arenas and at several NASCAR tracks.|$|E

25|$|Catherine did {{initiate}} {{some changes}} to serfdom, though. If a noble {{did not live}} up to his side of the deal, then the serfs could file complaints against him by following the proper channels of law. Catherine gave them this new right, but in exchange they could no longer appeal directly to her. She did this because {{she did not want to}} be bothered by the peasantry, but did not want to give them reason to revolt, either. In this act, though, she unintentionally gave the serfs a legitimate bureaucratic status they had lacked before. Some serfs were able to use their new status to their advantage. For example, serfs could apply to be freed if they were under illegal ownership, and non-nobles were not allowed to own serfs. Some serfs did apply for freedom and were, surprisingly, successful. In addition, some governors listened to the complaints of serfs and punished nobles, but this was by no means <b>all-inclusive.</b>|$|E
25|$|As soon as Court Line began {{diverting}} Horizon customers {{onto its}} planes, British Caledonian (BCal) threatened having Horizon compulsorily wound up if Court Line {{did not agree}} to settle Horizon's outstanding debts of over £100,000. BCal's threat forced Court Line to sub-charter a fully crewed BCal One-Eleven jet for Horizon's flying programme and to provide it with additional business. In addition to BCal forcing Court Line to compensate it {{for the loss of}} Horizon's business, Thomas Cook's money-back guarantee — a scheme widely copied by other rival tour operators — further reduced the number of Horizon holidaymakers travelling on Court Line's jets. As a result, Court Line carried far fewer Horizon customers than it had anticipated. Clarksons's financial position further deteriorated. In a desperate attempt to fill the group's planes and hotel rooms so that it could stay afloat, Clarksons continued selling holiday packages below cost, with a fortnight <b>all-inclusive</b> holiday to Majorca selling for as little as £50.|$|E

At {{the time of the}} Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with Sue Gardner in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an <b>all-inclusive</b> approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue.

25|$|In North Korea's first constitution, {{adopted in}} 1948, the {{executive}} powers were vested in the Cabinet, chaired by Kim Il-sung himself. The 1972 constitution saw {{the establishment of}} the post of President of North Korea which led the executive branch, and the cabinet was split into two organizations: The Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council. The Central People's Committee provided the highest visible institutional link {{between the government and the}} party and serves in effect as a de facto super-cabinet. The National Defence Commission was then sub-committee of this body. The CPC's formal powers were <b>all-inclusive</b> and it was chaired by the President. Among its responsibilities are formulating domestic and foreign policies, directing the work of the State Administration Council and its local organs, directing the judiciary, ensuring the enforcement of the constitution and other laws, appointing or removing the vice premiers and cabinet members, establishing or changing administrative subdivisions or their boundaries, and ratifying or abolishing treaties signed with foreign countries. The CPC also may issue decrees, decisions, and instructions. The State Administration Council was guided by the CPC and was led by a premier (chong-ri) and included vice premiers (bochong-ri), ministers (boojang), committee chairmen, and other cabinet-level members of central agencies. It was responsible for the formulation of state economic development plans and measures for implementing them, the preparation of the state budget, and the handling of other monetary and fiscal matters.|$|E

He claimed that al-Hajj Muhammad saw Palestinian unity as being <b>all-inclusive</b> and incompatible with political assassinations, particularly killings that would fuel divisions within the ranks of the rebellion's leadership. A possible exception to his anti-assassination policy was his alleged responsibility in the killings of Ahmad and Muhammad Irsheid, landowners who supported Nashashibi-led opposition to al-Husayni's leadership. Because of the widely disputed circumstances surrounding the Irsheids' deaths and its general attribution to al-Hajj Muhammad, the killings were rarely mentioned in Palestinian narratives of the revolt.|$|E
500|$|According {{to music}} critic and Bruce Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh, [...] "We Are the World" [...] was not widely {{accepted}} within the rock music community.

Marsh revealed that he felt some of the criticisms were right, while others were silly.

500|$|Slow lorises are a {{group of}} several species of nocturnal strepsirrhine {{primates}} {{that make up the}} genus Nycticebus. Found in Southeast Asia and bordering areas, they range from Bangladesh and Northeast India in the west to the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines in the east, and from Yunnan province in China in the north to the island of Java in the south. [...] Although many previous classifications recognized as few as a single <b>all-inclusive</b> species, there are now at least [...] eight that are considered valid: the Sunda slow loris (N.coucang), Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis), pygmy slow loris (N.pygmaeus), Javan slow loris (N.javanicus), Philippine slow loris (N.menagensis), Bangka slow loris (N.bancanus), Bornean slow loris (N.borneanus), and Kayan River slow loris (N.kayan). The group's closest relatives are the slender lorises of southern India and Sri Lanka. Their next closest relatives are the African lorisids, the pottos, false pottos, and angwantibos. They are less closely related to the remaining lorisoids (the various types of galago), and more distantly to the lemurs of Madagascar. Their evolutionary history is uncertain since their fossil record is patchy and molecular clock studies have given inconsistent results.|$|E
