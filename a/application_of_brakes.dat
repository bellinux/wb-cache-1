50|$|The {{braking effort}} {{achievable}} was limited, {{and an early}} development was {{the application of a}} steam brake to locomotives, where boiler pressure could be applied to brake blocks on the locomotive wheels.

50|$|A {{freewheel}} {{also produces}} slightly better fuel economy on carbureted engines (without fuel turn-off on engine brake) and less wear on the manual clutch, but {{leads to more}} wear on the brakes {{as there is no}} longer any ability to perform engine braking.

50|$|On 23 August 1858 the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway ran {{a special}} day {{excursion}} from Wolverhampton to Worcester and back. It {{was intended to}} be for school children and their teachers only, but this ruling was not adhered to and the train was packed with roughly equal numbers (about 750 of each) of children and adults. The train left Wolverhampton at 9.12 AM, comprising 42 four-wheeled coaches and four brake vans. Braking of the train was supplied entirely by manual <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes</b> on the engine (and tender) and the four brake vans (each van manned by a guard).|$|E
50|$|The broken rod was {{replaced}} with a new rod and loading conditions were applied. Four strain gauges were attached {{at a distance of}} 533 mm from the lower end, located 90 degrees apart around the circumference of the rod. Readings were taken during manual release and <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> and during emergency <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake.</b> The results showed that in addition to the expected direct tensile stresses at gauge positions there were substantial stresses due to bending when the brake was operated. The magnitude of stresses varied {{to such an extent that}} for the one farthest from the drum there was a change from tension to compression as the brake was released. The rod was not designed for such alternating bending loads. The rod was designed with a factor of safety 6.1 for tensile stress. But when alternative bending stress are induced, failure was inevitable.|$|R
50|$|The Cineston {{controller}} is {{a control}} lever used in mass transit vehicles that combines the accelerator, brake and emergency controls {{into a single}} hand-operated device. The Cineston controller allows smooth operation of the vehicle, avoids the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> and throttle at the same time, and provides a clear visual indication of the current power setting. However, it is only suitable for vehicles {{that do not require}} steering control, as it is hand operated and thus interferes with the presence of any sort of steering wheel.|$|R

The two of them try to choke each other, however Nate slams Marek's head into a nail on a wooden deck outside the cabin, finally killing him.

In the last scene, a revving car engine is heard as well as the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes.</b> A shot of Nate's wedding ring lies covered in blood on the road (Losada chopped Nate's hand when he found him {{on the side of the}} road) and a hand, presumably Nate's, picks it up before the screen goes black.|$|E
50|$|Rogers later {{went to work}} as a brakeman, a {{crew member}} of a {{locomotive}} train who helped regulate the speed through the manual <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes.</b> He worked across a number of midwestern railways, including the Kansas City, Springfield & Memphis, the Wabash & Western, the Santa Fe, and the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy. Rogers was fired from his position on the latter road during the Burlington railroad strike of 1888, when he supported the locomotive engineers striking the road. Following his dismissal Rogers toured the Burlington route engaging in public speeches on behalf of the strikers, traveling from Illinois all the way to Colorado on his mission.|$|E
5000|$|On August 5, 2013, Korean Air Flight 763, a Boeing 737 {{arriving}} from Seoul, overran {{the east end}} of Runway 10/28 upon landing, coming to a stop on the grass but almost falling into a nearby river. Although there were no injuries and the aircraft was not significantly damaged, the JTSB announced that the incident would be investigated as a [...] "major incident." [...] The JTSB investigation found that the aircraft temporarily lost all brake pressure for five to six seconds during its landing roll as spoilers and speedbrakes were retracted, followed by a sudden <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes</b> during the window 37 to 45 seconds after touchdown, which succeeded in stopping the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new model-based {{hierarchical}} control {{strategy for the}} <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> torque distribution to vehicle stability control. A three-layer control architecture is adopted, and {{the focus of the}} paper is on the intermediate layer which employs a form of model predictive control. To achieve this a non-linear vehicle model is linearised at successive time instants about non-equilibrium operating points. Simulations show that the new controller is more efficient (uses reduced brake authority) compared to a conventional rule-based control algorithm. It also has the advantage of being highly flexible for future application in fully integrated chassis systems. Copyright Â© 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd...|$|R
5000|$|Brake fade and rotor warping can {{be reduced}} through proper braking technique; when running down a long {{downgrade}} that would require braking simply select a lower gear (for automatic transmissions this may necessitate a brief <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the throttle after selecting the gear). Also, periodic, rather than continuous <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brakes</b> {{will allow them to}} cool between applications. Continuous light <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brakes</b> can be particularly destructive in both wear and adding heat to the brake system. Finally, new brakes are prone to a phenomenon termed [...] "green fade", where resin on the brake pad evaporates at the high temperatures involved in heavy braking and the resulting pressurised gas forces the brake lining away from the disk, reducing friction [...] - conflicting with [...] "Factors contributing to fade" [...] above.|$|R

50|$|Up to six trains daily were {{operated}} {{in each direction}} and a printed timetable was published on 16 September 1856 by Charles Easton Spooner who, following his father, served as Manager and Clerk for 30 years. It shows departures from the Quarry Terminus (later referred to as Dinas, sometimes as Rhiwbryfdir or Rhiw) at 7:30, 9:28, 11:16, 1:14, 3:12 and 5:10. Trains waited ten minutes at the intermediate stations called Tunnel Halt, Hafod y Llyn and Rhiw Goch. The fastest journey time from Quarry Terminus to Boston Lodge was 1 hour 32 minutes, including three stops. From Boston Lodge, the slate wagons were hauled to and from Porthmadog harbour by horses. Up trains took nearly six hours from Boston Lodge to the Quarry Terminus and each train ran in up to four sections, each hauled by a horse and comprising eight empty slate wagons plus a horse dandy. This timetable gave a maximum annual capacity of 70,000 tons of dressed slate. Two brakesmen travelled on each down train, controlling the speed by the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes</b> as needed. At passing loops, trains passed {{on the right and}} this continues to be a feature of Ffestiniog Railway operation.|$|E
5000|$|On 15 August 1967, two Channel Airways Hawker Siddeley HS 748-222 Srs. 2 (registration: G-ATEH and G-ATEK) were {{substantially}} {{damaged in}} separate landing accidents at Portsmouth Airport that occurred {{within two hours}} of each other. The first of these, involving HS 748-222 G-ATEK, occurred at 11.48 local time. The aircraft was operating that day's scheduled service from Southend to Paris via Portsmouth. Following a circling approach to Portsmouth Airport, it touched down normally ca. 330 ft left of grass strip 36's centre-line. The pilot flying the aircraft selected ground fine propeller pitch during landing followed by continuous application of the wheel brakes. Initially, the aircraft decelerated normally. However, at an advanced stage of the landing roll, the flightdeck crew realised that the remaining distance might not be sufficient for the plane to stop. To keep within the airfield's boundary, the flightdeck crew attempted to swing the aircraft to the left. Although this caused the aircraft to turn in the desired direction, it began sliding sideways, finally coming to a halt on an earth embankment. Despite extensive damage to the aircraft, there was no post-crash fire {{and none of the}} 23 occupants (four crew, 19 passengers) were injured. The subsequent accident investigation established inadequate braking as a result of inadequate friction provided by the aerodrome's very wet grass covering a hard, dry and almost impermeable sub-soil. Accident investigators also cited the flightdeck crew's failure {{to take into account the}} additional landing distance that was required to land an HS 748 safely on the wet grass strip as an important contributory factor. The second mishap, involving HS 748-222 G-ATEH, occurred at 13.34 local time. The aircraft was operating that day's scheduled service from Guernsey to Portsmouth. A visual approach to Portsmouth Airport's grass strip 07 resulted in an unsuccessful attempt to land. A second attempt was made, resulting in the aircraft landing on strip 07. Immediately after touchdown, selection of ground fine propeller pitch was followed by <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes.</b> Although this caused the aircraft to decelerate initially, subsequent braking proved ineffective due to the wet grass. As a consequence, the aircraft broke through the perimeter fence alongside the main road in the aerodrome's northeast corner, coming to a halt across the road. Despite extensive damage to the aircraft, there was no post-crash fire and none of the 66 occupants (four crew, 62 passengers) were injured. The subsequent accident investigation established inadequate braking as a result of inadequate friction provided by the aerodrome's very wet grass covering a hard, dry and almost impermeable sub-soil. Accident investigators also cited the flightdeck crew's failure to take into account the additional landing distance that was required to land an HS 748 safely on the wet grass strip as an important contributory factor. Both aircraft were subsequently repaired and returned to service.|$|E
50|$|Recent design {{innovations}} {{have led}} to the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> electromagnetic <b>brakes</b> to aircraft applications.

25|$|The main disadvantage, {{like the}} clutch braking system, is that {{steering}} dissipates heat through the brakes. Unlike the clutched system, however, {{in this case}} all turning requires braking.

Another disadvantage is that the differential will allow the tracks to turn at different speeds no matter what the cause may be. This may be the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>braking,</b> but also occurs as the tank travels over terrain; if one side of the tank enters softer terrain and slows down, the tank will naturally turn towards that side. Forward momentum tends to offset this effect, so it is mainly a problem at low speeds.|$|R
40|$|Three active front-steering (AFS) {{controllers}} {{were developed}} to enhance the lateral stability of a vehicle. They were designed using proportional-integral-derivative (PID), fuzzy-logic, and sliding-mode control methods. The controllers were compared under several driving and road conditions with and without the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> force. A 14 -degree-of-freedom vehicle model, a sliding-mode antilock brake system (ABS) controller, and a driver model were also employed to test the controllers. The {{results show that the}} three AFS controllers allowed the yaw rate to follow the reference yaw rate very well, and consequently the lateral stability improved. On a split-μ road, the controllers forced the vehicle to proceed straight ahead. The results also verify that the driver model can sufficiently control the vehicle to allow it to follow a desired path...|$|R

40|$|Based on data {{obtained}} from flight tests of the augmentor wing jet STOL research aircraft, a method is proposed for determining {{the length of the}} landing runway for powered-lift STOL aircraft. The suggested method determines runway landing length by summing three segments: the touchdown-dispersion distance, the transition distance from touchdown to <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes,</b> and the stopping distance after brakes are applied. It is shown how the landing field length can be reduced either through improved autoland system design or by providing the pilot with appropriate information to allow him to identify a "low probability" long or short landing and to execute a go-around. The proposed method appears to determine a safe runway landing length for the STOL application and offers the potential for reducing runway length if great emphasis is placed on a short-runway capability. FAR Parts 25 and 121 appear conservative and suitable for the situation where no great emphasis is placed on reducing the runway length requirement...|$|E
50|$|In {{off-road}} vehicles: Traction {{control is}} used instead of, or in addition to, the mechanical limited slip or locking differential. It is often implemented with an electronic limited slip differential, {{as well as other}} computerized controls of the engine and transmission. The spinning wheel is slowed down with short <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes,</b> diverting more torque to the non-spinning wheel; this is the system adopted by Range Rover in 1993, for example. ABS brake traction control has several advantages over limited-slip and locking differentials, such as steering control of a vehicle is easier, so the system can be continuously enabled. It also creates less stress on powertrain and driveline components, and increases durability as there are fewer moving parts to fail.|$|R
