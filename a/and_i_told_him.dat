500|$|Director Mark Romanek {{has said}} that, {{as in the}} novel, {{everyone}} has to uncover their relationship to our own mortality; we have two options: either go against it, or {{try to figure out}} a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been." ...|$|E

The album {{was described by}} CNN as a [...] "shrill confessional" [...] on which the performer [...] "flays his '80s persona, his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder, which he has." [...] Vanilla Ice explained that the album [...] "just comes out dark because that's the way I feel I've been treated" [...] and that the album [...] "wasn't intended to be so dark. I opened up to Ross <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{a lot of things}} that happened to me in the past.

500|$|O'Reilly took 3/164 on a batting paradise in the First Test at Trent Bridge as England scored 8/658 {{and forced}} Australia to follow on {{and hold on}} for a draw. In the Second Test at Lord's O'Reilly took 4/93 in the first innings and trapped Eddie Paynter for 99 to end a 222-run {{partnership}} with Hammond. In reply to England's 494, Australia {{were in danger of}} being forced to follow on; O'Reilly came in and made 42, featuring in a partnership of 85 in only 46 minutes with Bill Brown that enabled Australia to save the match: having been dropped by Paynter, he hit Hedley Verity for consecutive sixes to take Australia past the follow-on mark. [...] Brown recalled [...] "It was a nice day, and a nice wicket. O'Reilly came in, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I'd take the quicks—Wellard and Farnes—and Tiger [...] took Verity." [...] Australia reached 422 and O'Reilly took 2/53 in the second innings as the match petered into a draw.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Fellini {{drew his}} three leading players from people {{associated}} with the 1954 film Donne Proibite (Angels of Darkness), directed by Giuseppe Amato, in which Masina played the very different role of a madam. Anthony Quinn was also acting in the film, while Richard Basehart was often on the set visiting his wife, actress Valentina Cortese. When Masina introduced Quinn to her husband, the actor was disconcerted by Fellini's insistence that the director had found his Zampanò, later remembering: [...] "I {{thought he was a}} little bit crazy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I wasn't interested in the picture, but he kept hounding me for days." [...] Not long afterwards, Quinn spent the evening with Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, and after dinner they watched Fellini's 1953 Italian comedy-drama I Vitelloni. According to Quinn: [...] "I was thunderstruck by it. I told them the film was a masterpiece, and that the same director was the man who had been chasing me for weeks." ...|$|E
500|$|Valo {{has been}} a regular alcohol user much of his life. He got drunk {{for the first time}} at age 13, and on more than one occasion, Valo has also been {{reported}} to have performed intoxicated. In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a guy just talking a lot of bull about me and my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked the door, he opened the door <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E

The video was shot between those of [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] and [...] "Green Light", and took about one and half days of filming. Jay-Z performed his rap scenes first, [...] afterwards Knowles studied his scene, and then did her impersonation of him. Melina said: [...] "If anybody knows Jay-Z, it would be Beyoncé". Knowles commented on her impersonation of Jay-Z on MTV, [...] "I love what I did in [...] because it's completely out of my character, {{or at least the}} character that people think I am. I was pretending to be Jay, and he was there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he had to leave, because I couldn't do it with him in the room — it was way too embarrassing.

500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit.

500|$|Brown's {{most celebrated}} innings {{came in the}} Second Test at Lord's, {{carrying}} his bat to score 206 in the first televised Test match. England batted first and amassed 494, largely {{on the back of}} Wally Hammond's 240. Brown featured in an opening stand of 69 before Fingleton was dismissed. Hedley Verity then bowled Bradman for 18, leaving the score at 101, before Stan McCabe fell after a quickfire 38 with the score at 3/152. Brown registered his century in 193 minutes, during an innings highlighted by his driving {{on both sides of the}} wicket. After Lindsay Hassett was dismissed for 56 following a 134-run partnership, Australia reached stumps at 5/299, with Brown on 140. The following day, Brown set about ensuring that Australia would avoid the follow on, featuring in an aggressive eighth-wicket stand with tailender Bill O'Reilly. The pair added 85 runs in just 46 minutes, with Brown recalling [...] "It was a nice day, and a nice wicket. O'Reilly came in, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I'd take the quicks—Wellard and Farnes—and Tiger [...] took Verity." [...] Brown continued past his double century and remained unbeaten on 206 from just 375 minutes when his last partner fell, leaving Australia all out for 422. Brown's innings was the 100th century by an Australian against England, and the highest Test score for batsman carrying his bat; it stood until Glenn Turner made an unbeaten 223 in 1972. Ray Robinson quipped that Brown's performance [...] "did not cause smoke to rise from the back of those [...] sets but the charm of his style gave viewers a favourable impression of Australian batsmanship". They went on to draw the match, which was crucial in Australia's eventual retention of the Ashes. Brown's uninterrupted batting meant that he was on the field from the first morning until late on the fourth day.|$|E

Until 1987, when the Musée d'Orsay acquired this little-known work (exhibited only once since 1906) {{it had never been}} recognized as the masterpiece it is, let alone recognized for its relevance to the works leading up to the Demoiselles. Although just under 30 inches high , Oviri has an awesome presence, as befits a monument intended for Gauguin's grave. Picasso was very struck by Oviri. 50 years later he was delighted when [...] Cooper <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that we had come upon this sculpture in a collection that also included the original plaster of his Cubist head. Has it been a revelation, like Iberian sculpture? Picasso's shrug was grudgingly affirmative. He was always loath to admit Gauguin's role in setting him on the road to primitivism." ...|$|E
