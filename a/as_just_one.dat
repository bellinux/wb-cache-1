5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle <b>as</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E
5|$|Tin Machine's {{first world}} tour was a {{commercial}} success, {{but there was}} growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role <b>as</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.|$|E

5|$|Heathens {{commonly}} adopt a cosmology {{based on}} that found in Norse mythology. As part of this framework, humanity's world—known as Midgard—is regarded <b>as</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of nine realms, {{all of which are}} part of a cosmological world tree called Yggdrasil. Different types of being are believed to inhabit these different realms; for instance, humans live on Midgard, while dwarves live on another realm, elves on another, giants on another, and the divinities on two further realms. Most practitioners believe that this is a poetic or symbolic description of the cosmos, with the different levels representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence. The world tree is also interpreted by some in the community as an icon for ecological and social engagement. Some Heathens, such as the psychologist Brian Bates, have adopted an approach to this cosmology rooted in analytical psychology, thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps of the human mind.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s {{with the}} {{emergence}} of the United States's first political parties. Throughout the 1780s, few Americans knew or cared who wrote the Declaration. But in the next decade, Jeffersonian Republicans sought political advantage over their rival Federalists by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author. Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson's authorship or originality, and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole Congress, with Jefferson <b>as</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> member of the drafting committee. Federalists insisted that Congress's act of declaring independence, in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role, was more important than the document announcing it. But this view faded away, like the Federalist Party itself, and, before long, the act of declaring independence became synonymous with the document.|$|E

25|$|The Biblical prophets, {{including}} Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah, had {{a concept}} of the divine that differed significantly {{from that of the}} nature religions.

Instead of seeing the God of Israel <b>as</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> national god, these prophets saw him as the one God of the entire universe.|$|E

Stillman used Muybridge's photos as the basis for his 100 illustrations, and the photographer's research for the analysis, but he gave Muybridge no prominent credit. The historian Phillip Prodger later suggested that Stanford considered Muybridge <b>as</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of his employees, and not deserving of special recognition.|$|E
25|$|Reception to Wenjack {{was later}} {{overshadowed by the}} controversies around Boyden's {{genealogy}} and tribal affiliations. Debbie Reese, an Indigenous author and researcher of Native American portrayal in children’s literature, had an overall negative perception of Boyden’s novella. In a series of tweets {{a few months after}} the release of Wenjack, she criticizes Boyden’s act <b>as</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of many that “ Native ancestry … the centerpiece of who they are”, and the belief that “they can speak/write of things they ought not.” Pieta Woolley, in an article titled “Cultural thieves” for the United Church Observer, mentioned Wenjack as an introduction to labelling Boyden as “the latest alleged offender” in the midst of social questions regarding cultural thievery.|$|E

25|$|A {{publicist}} by profession, {{famed for}} inventing {{some of the}} most ingenious advertising slogans of his time, O’Neill was unusually adept at manipulating words and using them in an efficacious manner, but he refused to put that talent at the service of a lyrically lofty, feel-good sort of poetry (see ‘Simply Expressive’). Stridently anti-Romantic, concerned to keep humanity in its place <b>as</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of earth’s species, he did not believe that an especially harmonious world was possible, and he abhorred all attempts to escape the world, whether through mystical or poetical exaltations. His one hope, or consolation, explicitly stated in ‘St. Francis’s Empty Sandal’, was in the connection (never entirely peaceful) he felt {{with other members of the}} species.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1916 morale in {{the factory}} went slowly downhill, but nothing was done to {{alleviate}} the problem, although consultations were going on between Whitehall and Birtley {{on how best to}} deal with any unrest that night occur {{in the factory}}. Another problem was that in practice the Colony was policed by Belgian gendarmes but in theory they were working under British rule of law, very different from their own. <b>As</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> example, back home the gendarmes were allowed to carry pistols at all times: here they were not allowed to be armed except under special circumstances and only then with the approval of the British police. Finally, on 20 December 1916, it all came to a head. One of the workers went to see Captain Algrain, Military Head of Security, in order to obtain four days leave, to which he was entitled to. Suddenly the captain noticed that the man, though wearing his regulation uniform, was sporting a civilian cap. Enraged at this ‘breach of discipline’, he had the man sent directly to the cells for four days, to join two others who had attempted to leave the camp in civvies. The rest of the workforce quickly got to hear about this unjust act.|$|E

The possible existence of a fourth dimension inspired artists to question classical : non-Euclidean geometry became a valid alternative. The concept that painting could be expressed mathematically, in colour and form, contributed to Cubism, the art movement that led to abstract art. Metzinger, in 1910, wrote that: [...] " [...] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry".
