The Military Chamber is directed by a commander who must be an active lieutenant-general or a general within the Spanish military, and is under the direct orders of the king. The commander maintains an office with a military legal <b>advisor,</b> <b>an</b> auditor, and section heads for staffing, protocol, operations and logistics. The king is assigned personal aides-de-camp for his assistance, and by extension to his wife the queen and to Princess Sofía.

The Princess of Asturias is entitled to, in future, personal aides-de-camp, drawn from the army, the navy and the air force.|$|E
