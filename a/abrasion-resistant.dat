25|$|The {{strength}} of the SA-15 class ships was further proven when icebreaker Admiral Makarov, after having been immobilized for five days, pushed the freshly delivered Nizhneyansk at full power through the ice separating the vessels from Pevek, arriving at the city as the first ships of the year 1983. The freighter received only minor ice damage in the process. During the particularly difficult season, during which around fifty cargo ships were trapped in ice in the East Siberian Sea, the SA-15 class freighters {{were sent to the}} Northern Sea Route {{as soon as they were}} delivered from the Finnish shipyards. They were used to unload cargo from icebound ships and deliver the much-needed supplies to isolated communities along the coast. The ships also acted as escort icebreakers, using their stern notches to tow smaller ships through the ice fields even though it was not their original purpose. Among the ships that received assistance from the new SA-15 class ships was the nuclear icebreaker Sibir which had to be helped on several occasions by Okha. Unlike the freighters, the icebreaker had no <b>abrasion-resistant</b> coating and suffered from severe hull corrosion that considerably increased the ice resistance of the vessel.|$|E

2500|$|Aluminium oxide can {{be grown}} as a coating on {{aluminium}} by anodizing or by plasma electrolytic oxidation (see the [...] "Properties" [...] above). Both the hardness and <b>abrasion-resistant</b> characteristics of the coating originate from the high strength of aluminium oxide, yet the porous coating layer produced with conventional direct current anodizing procedures is within a 60-70 Rockwell hardness C range [...] which is comparable only to hardened carbon steel alloys, but considerably inferior to the hardness of natural and synthetic corundum. Instead, with plasma electrolytic oxidation, the coating is porous only on the surface oxide layer while the lower oxide layers are much more compact than with standard DC anodizing procedures and present a higher crystallinity due to the oxide layers being remelted and densified to obtain α-Al2O3 clusters with much higher coating hardness values circa 2000 Vickers hardness.|$|E
2500|$|For icebreaking operations, Robert LeMeur had an {{extensive}} outfit of various [...] "ice management systems" [...] {{designed to reduce}} friction between ice and the hull of the vessel. A powerful hull wash system {{could be used to}} wet the snow on ice ahead of the vessel by spraying water through eighteen openings on the hull, reducing the ice resistance by 20 to 30 percent based on ice trials in various ice conditions. A secondary system could be used to pump water below the waterline between hull and ice floes. Two air bubbler systems were fitted: one in the bow to lubricate the hull and another in the stern to prevent ice from entering the nozzles. The hull was coated with an <b>abrasion-resistant</b> low-friction epoxy paint. Finally, a heeling system capable of rocking the vessel back and forth could be used to prevent the vessel from getting stuck and assist in turning.|$|E

50|$|Tough rubber-sheathed {{cable is}} a type of cable which {{normally}} consists of a black outer sheath of rubber with several conductors inside. The rubber provides an <b>abrasion-resistant,</b> corrosion-resistant, waterproof, protective covering for an insulated electric cable.|$|E
5000|$|Inflatable: These {{contain no}} rigid frame members {{and can be}} deflated, folded and stored in a bag. The more durable types consist of an <b>abrasion-resistant</b> nylon or rubber outer shell, with {{separate}} PVC air chambers for the two side tubes and the floor.|$|E
5000|$|Water sprays {{help prevent}} solids buildup. The {{principal}} atomization {{of the liquid}} occurs at the rods, where the high-velocity gas moving through spacings creates the small droplets necessary for fine particle collection. These rods must be made of <b>abrasion-resistant</b> material due to the high velocities present.|$|E
5000|$|Cam {{switches}} {{are mainly}} used within the low voltage range. On a shaft, switching cams {{are made of}} <b>abrasion-resistant</b> conductive material. By rotating the shaft, the contacts are opened or closed by the cams. Often, a plurality of cams are seated on a shaft, which simultaneously switch or switch several pairs of contacts.|$|E
50|$|Titanium carbide {{is used in}} {{preparation}} of cermets, which are frequently used to machine steel materials at high cutting speed.

50|$|The parka and {{trousers}} (which have been {{adapted to the}} civilian outdoor clothing market) are themselves constructed in a three-layer fashion consisting of an outer layer of <b>abrasion-resistant</b> taslan nylon, an intermediate layer of durably waterproof, windproof, and Gore-Tex membrane (protected {{with a layer of}} nylon tricot and originally in a four-color camouflage print), and a hung inner layer of unlaminated nylon. The whole is seam-sealed.|$|E
50|$|Large subsurface, {{pressurized}} habitats {{would be}} the first step toward human settlement; the book suggests they can be built as Roman-style atria underground with easily produced Martian brick. During and after this initial phase of habitat construction, hard-plastic radiation- and <b>abrasion-resistant</b> geodesic domes could be deployed on the surface for eventual habitation and crop growth. Nascent industry would begin using indigenous resources: the manufacture of plastics, ceramics and glass.|$|E
50|$|Bottom tow: In this case, the {{pipeline}} is dragged onto the bottom - {{the line is}} not affected by waves and currents, and if the sea gets too rough for the tow vessel, the line can simply be abandoned and recovered later. Challenges {{with this type of}} system include: requirement for an <b>abrasion-resistant</b> coating, interaction with other submarine pipelines and potential obstructions (reef, boulders, etc.). Bottom tow is commonly used for river crossings and crossings between shores.|$|E
50|$|Permeation {{tests showed}} that several types of {{disposable}} latex or polyvinyl chloride gloves (typically, about 0.1 mm thick), commonly used in most laboratories and clinical settings, had high and maximal rates of permeation by dimethylmercury within 15 seconds. The American Occupational Safety and Health Administration advises handling dimethylmercury with highly resistant laminated gloves with an additional pair of <b>abrasion-resistant</b> gloves worn over the laminate pair, and also recommends using a face shield and working in a fume hood.|$|E
50|$|The Army Combat Boot (Temperate Weather) (ACB (TW)) is a tan-colored, {{temperate}} weather combat boot with a moisture-resistant, rough-side-out cattlehide {{leather and}} nylon duck cloth upper. It contains a waterproof breathable membrane and integrated safety features limited flame resistance, thermal insulation, and liquid fuel penetration protection.

50|$|A {{ball mill}} {{consists}} of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal. It is partially filled with balls. The grinding media is the balls, which may be made of steel (chrome steel), stainless steel, ceramic, or rubber. The inner surface of the cylindrical shell is usually lined with an <b>abrasion-resistant</b> material such as manganese steel or rubber. Less wear takes place in rubber lined mills. The length of the mill is approximately equal to its diameter.|$|E
50|$|Large subsurface, {{pressurized}} habitats {{would be}} the first step toward human settlement; as Dr. Robert Zubrin suggests in the first chapter of his book Mars Direct, these structures can be built as Roman-style atria in mountainsides or underground with easily produced Martian brick. During and after this initial phase of habitat construction, hard-plastic radiation and <b>abrasion-resistant</b> geodesic domes could be deployed on the surface for eventual habitation and crop growth. Nascent industry would begin using indigenous resources: the manufacture of plastics, ceramics and glass could be easily achieved.|$|E
50|$|The {{material}} used in {{the hull}} is largely grade E shipbuilding steel which is suitable for cold temperatures down to -50 C. A special high-strength steel, Rautaruukki Raex E32 Polar, is {{used in the}} main components of the ice zone where it was protected by <b>abrasion-resistant</b> low-friction paint, Inerta 160. The thickness of the plating in the ice belt is 36 mm. Longitudinal framing is used except in the side area between double bottom and tweendeck, which has transverse framing to improve the distribution of ice loads on the side shell.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional {{chairs are}} {{constructed}} {{of an open}} wooden frame, with their seat often supported by interwoven jute or cotton herringbone webbing. Stuffing is placed upon this, enclosed between hessian, then batting over this and finally the cover fabric. [...] To provide a taut and long-lasting seat, the webbing must be tightened into place. The webbing material must also resist yielding over time, hence {{the use of a}} dense herringbone weave, rather than the cheaper hessian webbings also used in upholstery. Where wire springs are to be placed over the webbing, the more <b>abrasion-resistant</b> cotton webbing is used rather than jute.|$|E
50|$|The ACS is {{constructed}} of three flame-resistant performance fabrics proprietary to TenCate Protective Fabrics or Massif Mountain Gear Company. The shirt’s torso {{is constructed}} of two highly breathable flame-resistant fabrics with advanced moisture management capabilities. Both fabrics wick moisture {{away from the}} skin and dry rapidly, preventing the fabrics from sticking to the user’s skin and greatly increasing comfort under body armor. The sleeves and side panels of the shirt are constructed of a lightweight, but durable and <b>abrasion-resistant</b> fabric designed to provide extra protection for areas not protected by body armor. All three fabrics feature 4-way stretch for enhanced performance and user comfort.|$|E
50|$|When Circulon was introduced, the nonstick {{system was}} so unique in {{extending}} {{the durability of}} nonstick cookware that it was granted a patent. The unique Circulon Hi-Low surface made the pans {{at least three times}} more <b>abrasion-resistant</b> than any other nonstick cookware on the market. Anolon followed in 1986 as the first hard-anodized nonstick with a smooth cooking surface (and heavier-gauge aluminum than Circulon). Unfortunately, Cheng did not patent the hard-anodized nonstick process, which allowed competitors to develop similar products. He still develops unique technologies and pans for Meyer, including Infinite Circulon's impact-bonded base and the Anolon Outdoor BBQ Pan, respectively. Cheng won the Humanitarian of the Year award from the Housewares Charity Foundation in 2002.|$|E
5000|$|Drum screens {{are usually}} {{made out of}} a 0.22-inch (5.6mm) thick clear acrylic sheet material. A more {{expensive}} scratch-resistant or AR (<b>abrasion-resistant)</b> acrylic is also sometimes used for rugged use and touring applications. While plastic drum screens perform fairly well as sound barriers, they reflect most sound that impacts them and so very little sound is actually absorbed. Therefore, it is usually recommended that some type of acoustic absorption product, such as acoustic foam, heavy curtains, acoustic panels, or absorption baffles be used on {{a significant percentage of}} the screen surface and opposite the screen in order to soak up and dissipate as much of the direct and reflected sound energy as possible.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{conventional}} pin chain and gas oven can operate {{at up to}} 1400 cans per minute, the UV curing and vacuum system {{have the potential to}} run at much higher speeds, and that will only increase as technology to increase printer and other equipment speed is developed and implemented. The UV varnish coats the beer cans with a strong, <b>abrasion-resistant</b> layer, protecting it in the manufacturing and transportation process. Since there are no longer any pins sticking inside the cans, there is no chance of the interior being scratched or damaged, which can have a negative effect while applying the interior coating. A standard test that measured the interior coating of the UV curing system has [...] "shown a tenfold improvement".|$|E
50|$|Rigging in the United States is {{typically}} done using a single anchor point, and pitches are rigged {{as a single}} long drop, often in excess of 100 meters. The rope is usually a thick <b>abrasion-resistant</b> type, which allows the rope {{to go over the}} lip of a shaft in contact with the rock. This is sometimes pejoratively called Indestructible Rope Technique. To descend such large drops on a bobbin-type descender would be difficult owing to the thickness and stiffness of the rope, and the resulting descent would be slow and jerky. The bobbin-descender could also overheat and melt the surface of the rope. Racks are preferred as they have a much larger heat sink capacity and offer a much smoother descent on such pitches. Using the frog system to ascend long pitches is time consuming, so rope-walking systems are preferred.|$|E

5000|$|Some icebreakers have a hull that is wider {{in the bow}} than in the stern. These {{so-called}} [...] "reamers" [...] {{increase the}} width of the ice channel and thus reduce frictional resistance in the aftship as well as improve the ship's maneuverability in ice. In addition to low friction paint, some icebreakers utilize an explosion-welded <b>abrasion-resistant</b> stainless steel ice belt that further reduces friction and protects the ship's hull from corrosion. Auxiliary systems such as powerful water deluges and air bubbling systems are used to reduce friction by forming a lubricating layer between the hull and the ice. Pumping water between tanks {{on both sides of the}} vessel results in continuous rolling that reduces friction and makes progress through the ice easier. Experimental bow designs such as the flat Thyssen-Waas bow and a cylindrical bow have been tried over the years to further reduce the ice resistance and create an ice-free channel.|$|E
50|$|The {{strength}} of the SA-15 class ships was further proven when icebreaker Admiral Makarov, after having been immobilized for five days, pushed the freshly delivered Nizhneyansk at full power through the ice separating the vessels from Pevek, arriving at the city as the first ships of the year 1983.

5000|$|Polyurethane {{varnishes}} {{are typically}} hard, <b>abrasion-resistant,</b> and durable coatings. They are popular for hardwood floors but are {{considered by some}} wood finishers to be difficult or unsuitable for finishing furniture or other detailed pieces. Polyurethanes are comparable in hardness to certain alkyds but generally form a tougher film. Compared to simple oil or shellac varnishes, polyurethane varnish forms a harder, decidedly tougher and more waterproof film. However, a thick film of ordinary polyurethane may de-laminate if subjected to heat or shock, fracturing the film and leaving white patches. This tendency increases with long exposure to sunlight or when it is applied over soft woods like pine. This is also {{in part due to}} polyurethane's lesser penetration into the wood. Various priming techniques are employed to overcome this problem, including the use of certain oil varnishes, specified [...] "dewaxed" [...] shellac, clear penetrating epoxy sealer, or [...] "oil-modified" [...] polyurethane designed for the purpose. Polyurethane varnish may also lack the [...] "hand-rubbed" [...] lustre of drying oils such as linseed or tung oil; in contrast, however, it is capable of a much faster and higher [...] "build" [...] of film, accomplishing in two coats what may require multiple applications of oil. Polyurethane may also be applied over a straight oil finish, but because of the relatively slow curing time of oils, the emission of certain chemical byproducts, and the need for exposure to oxygen from the air, care must be taken that the oils are sufficiently cured to accept the polyurethane.|$|E
