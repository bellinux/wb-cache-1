5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after <b>about</b> <b>age</b> three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Belief in {{prenatal}} fetal awareness, mental {{communication between}} mother and unborn child, and emotional attachment of child to mother as a prenatal phenomenon, are concepts that connect easily to the unfounded assumption that all adopted children suffer emotional disorders.

40|$|Beliefs <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> {{influence}} how we interpret {{and respond to}} changes within and around us. Essentialist beliefs <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> are defined as views that link chronological age with inherent and immutable properties underlying aging-related changes. These beliefs may influence the experience of aging-related changes and shape people's outlook of the future. We hypothesized that people who endorse essentialist beliefs <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> report a more limited future time perspective. Two studies provided correlational (Study 1, N = 250; 18 - 77 years) and experimental (Study 2, N = 103; 20 - 77 years) evidence that essentialist beliefs <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> affect people's future time perspective. In addition, Study 2 and Study 3 (N = 174; 34 - 67 years) tested the underlying mechanism and provided evidence that perception of aging-related threat explains the effect of essentialist beliefs on a reduced future time perspective. These findings highlight the fundamental role of essentialist beliefs <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> for the perception of time horizons {{in the context of}} agin...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to measure {{knowledge}} and attitude <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> and life satisfaction among older Korean adults and to examine the influence of attitude and knowledge <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> on these adults' life satisfaction. MethodsA cross-sectional and correlational design was used. A total of 405 older adults were surveyed using a written questionnaire at six elderly welfare centers in a metropolitan city in South Korea in mid April 2011. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation analysis, and multiple regression. ResultsThe score of knowledge on aging was below the medium level. Attitude <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> was neutral, and life satisfaction was at the medium level. Variables such as female sex, age, economic status, monthly allowance, living with a spouse, self-rated overall health, knowledge and attitude <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> accounted for 33. 8 % of the total variance in predicting life satisfaction of the older adults. Older age and lower economic status reduced life satisfaction. Being female, having a monthly income of 300, 000 Korea Republic Won or more, living with a spouse, and better knowledge and attitude <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> were associated with enhanced life satisfaction. ConclusionThe effect of knowledge and attitude <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> on life satisfaction is significant. Economic status, living with a spouse and self-rated overall health status are also predictive factors in life satisfaction. Consequently, nursing interventions for education and psychological support to increase knowledge <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> and induce a positive attitude towards it should be developed to improve older adults' life satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{critically}} analyse four Hindi short stories and to explain whether they can be considered examples of literature <b>about</b> <b>ageing.</b> The research questions that this thesis tries to answer are the following: Can the selected short stories be considered literature <b>about</b> <b>ageing?</b> If so, why and how this process of ageing is depicted in Hindi Literature? In order to answer these questions, the research of Mike Hepworth (2000) on literature <b>about</b> <b>ageing</b> in British Literature is used as theoretical framework. Indeed, the parameters given by Hepworth for recognising examples of literature <b>about</b> <b>ageing</b> {{can be used as}} general criteria for the analysis of literary texts worldwide. Differences and similarities between Hepworth’s analysis and the description of ageing in selected Hindi short stories are taken into account for this critical analysis. According {{to the study of the}} four selected short stories, it is observed that one of the main focus of Hindi literature <b>about</b> <b>ageing</b> is the pursuit of denouncing elderly abuse, in all the form they are perpetrated. This work also suggests that literature <b>about</b> <b>ageing</b> is also present in Hindi Literature and it can be recognised as a literary theme on its own...|$|R

5|$|Although {{there is}} some debate within Islam over {{whether it is a}} {{religious}} requirement, circumcision (called khitan) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and is very important in Islam. For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about the age at which circumcision should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to <b>about</b> <b>age</b> 15; most often it is performed at around six to seven years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his recitation of the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. Circumcision may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. Circumcision is recommended for, but is not required of, converts to Islam.|$|E

40|$|This three-sample {{study focused}} on changes in four key {{features}} of women's personalities (identity, generativity, confident power, and concern <b>about</b> <b>aging)</b> {{over the course of}} middle age.

We found that identity certainty, generativity, confident power, and concern <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> all were experienced as more prominent in middle age (the 40 s) than in early adulthood (the 30 s). We also found that these elements of personality were rated even higher in the 50 s than the 40 s. Scores seemed to be a function of age more than historical period or particular experiences in social roles. Scores on identity certainty, generativity, and confident power were positively related to well-being, while concern <b>about</b> <b>aging</b> was negatively related to well-being...|$|R
