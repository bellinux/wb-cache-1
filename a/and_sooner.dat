25|$|The current mascot for Oklahoma is the Sooner Schooner, a conestoga wagon {{similar to}} the primary method of {{transportation}} used by early settlers in Oklahoma. The Schooner is driven by two white ponies named Boomer <b>and</b> <b>Sooner.</b> In 2005, the university also introduced two costumed mascots also named Boomer <b>and</b> <b>Sooner</b> to serve as mascots for football games and events that do not permit a covered wagon.|$|E
25|$|Recently, in {{time for}} the 2005 {{football}} season, two new mascots, based on the ponies who pull the Schooner, were created, named appropriately, Boomer <b>and</b> <b>Sooner.</b> They are costumes of two identical (except for eye color) crème white ponies. Before, the Boomer <b>and</b> <b>Sooner</b> costume mascots, OU was also represented by Top Dawg. Top Dawg did some appearances at football games, but was primarily used at wrestling and basketball events.|$|E
25|$|Until 2011, {{when not}} in use, the Schooner was housed at the Bartlett Ranch outside Sapulpa, Oklahoma, along with Boomer <b>and</b> <b>Sooner.</b>|$|E
50|$|The rivalry {{had been}} less intense since the 1996 forming of the Big 12 Conference. This {{was due to the}} split-division nature of the Big 12 that {{scheduled}} the Cornhuskers <b>and</b> <b>Sooners</b> to meet only twice every four years. Before the beginning of Big 12 play in 1996, the Cornhuskers <b>and</b> <b>Sooners</b> had met for 71 straight years.|$|R
50|$|This game {{also turned}} out to be the {{unplanned}} final regular season conference meeting between these programs in their storied historical rivalry, <b>and</b> the <b>Sooners</b> <b>and</b> Cornhuskers parted ways with Oklahoma owning the series edge 44-38-3.|$|R
50|$|The 2012-13 Sooners missed graduating senior Jelena Serena, but {{retained}} {{the rest of}} the team.

Both Hartman and Cloman sat out the entire 2011-12 season with injuries.|$|R

25|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} reorganise its subsidy system, {{which is a}} heavy burden on government finances. In the short term these subsidies are helping to ease the burden but they cannot keep rising indefinitely, <b>and</b> <b>sooner</b> or later the load {{will have to be}} shared out. In the short term, national consumption per capita is expected to rise from the current level of 0.4 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) to as much as 0.90 toe in 2030, a good indication of development, but a massive challenge as well. The input of renewable energy is a matter of particular importance.|$|E
500|$|I've {{heard it}} said about The Velvet Underground that while {{not a lot}} of people bought their albums, {{everyone}} who did started a band. I think this is largely true about the Pixies as well. Charles' secret weapon turned out to be not so secret <b>and,</b> <b>sooner</b> or later, all sorts of bands were exploiting the same strategy of wide dynamics. It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for all the world like a Pixies song.|$|E

500|$|Under Bruce the Australian {{government}} also moved {{to its new}} permanent home in the planned federal city of Canberra. Plans for a new federal capital had been circulated {{since the time of}} Federation, and a site on the Molonglo River was selected in 1913. Design and construction had proceeded slowly due to World War I as well as funding and management problems. Bruce was a committed advocate of the new capital, however, stating: [...] "For the purposes of Federation it was essential that there should be some central point of nationhood, suitable to Australia as a nation... <b>and</b> <b>sooner</b> or later {{there would have to be}} a national capital, overriding State boundaries and State prejudices." [...] This came to pass on 9 May 1927 when the Federal Parliament moved to its new premises in Canberra; Bruce had moved himself and his wife to The Lodge a few days earlier. At the Federal Parliament's opening ceremony, Bruce decided that voices of the clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate were too heavily accented, and determined that he would personally welcome the Duke of York and co-open the new building a move that was criticised by several parliamentarians. The business of transferring government and cabinet operations to the new capital proceeded slowly over 1927 and 1928. This was an administrative task that occupied a significant proportion of the government's time in those years, with many departments only very gradually transferring from Melbourne, much to Bruce's consternation.|$|E
2500|$|The Mascot {{present at}} all {{football}} games is the Sooner Schooner, a Conestoga wagon, pulled by two crème white ponies, Boomer <b>and</b> <b>Sooner.</b> The caretakers {{of the wagon}} are the spirit group called the RUF/NEKS, who shoot off modified shotguns in celebration of scores by the home team.

2500|$|The Sooner Schooner is an {{official}} mascot {{of the sports}} teams of the University of Oklahoma Sooners. [...] Pulled by two white ponies named Boomer <b>and</b> <b>Sooner,</b> it is a scaled-down replica of the Conestoga wagon used by settlers of the Oklahoma Territory {{around the time of}} the Land Run of 1889. [...] Its name comes from the common term for such wagons ("prairie schooners") and the [...] name for settlers who sneaked into the Territory before it was officially opened for settlement ("Sooners").|$|E
2500|$|The undefeated, top-ranked Trojans met the also undefeated, second-ranked Sooners in the 2005 BCS National Championship Game {{held at the}} FedEx Orange Bowl at Pro Player Stadium in Miami, Florida. The {{game was}} the first time two Heisman Trophy winners had faced each other in a college {{football}} game with Sooners quarterback and 2003 winner Jason White facing 2004 winner Matt Leinart. [...] The game also featured four out of five of the 2004 Heisman finalists with Leinart, White, Reggie Bush <b>and</b> <b>Sooner</b> running back Adrian Peterson, the Heisman runner-up. [...] Both USC and Oklahoma started and ended the season ranked No. 1 and No. 2 (wire-to-wire), respectively, in the AP and Coaches polls.|$|E
2500|$|Underwood was a {{first-class}} bowler from his teens, {{and he took}} his 100th Test wicket and 1,000th first-class wicket in 1971, aged only 25. Only George Lohmann and Wilfred Rhodes had secured a thousand wickets {{at an earlier age}} than Underwood. He used to say that bowling was a 'low mentality profession: plug away, line and length, until there's a mistake', <b>and</b> <b>sooner</b> or later every batsman would make a mistake. He would finish his Test career with 297 wickets, and {{had it not been for}} his involvement in World Series Cricket and the rebel tour to South Africa, there is little doubt he would have had more than 300 Test wickets.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{his time}} as an NSA analyst, {{directing}} the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment {{when he and his}} colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly [...] "thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense—for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation. But they're extremely attractive. So what do they do? They turn around in their chair and they show a co-worker ... <b>and</b> <b>sooner</b> or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people." [...] As Snowden observed it, this behavior happened routinely every two months but was never reported, being considered one of the [...] "fringe benefits" [...] of the work.|$|E
2500|$|Perelman {{first entered}} {{what became known}} as the Savings & Loan crisis in 1988 when along with Gerald J. Ford he bought five {{insolvent}} thrifts with $12.2 billion in assets and $5.1 billion in federal aid for $315 million. [...] The five banks originally operated as a single entity named First Texas Bank, but the name changed to First Gibraltar after about a week. Perelman's turn-around manifested as trimming the payroll, selling branches, and dumping of $2.5 billion of underperforming assets. In 1990, Perelman added San Antonio Savings Association <b>and</b> <b>Sooner</b> Federal to First Gibraltar for $10.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The purchase of San Antonio added $1.1 billion of healthy assets, $1.2 billion unhealthy assets, and a $1.3 billion government cash advance to Perelman's larder while Sooner only provided $1.2 billion in assets along with the typical government guarantees. [...] Sooner Federal was not only the last S Perelman bought, but the first he sold; In August 1992, he sold the pieces of Sooner to Bank of Oklahoma and Fourth Financial Corporation for $31.4 million. [...] The following month he sold the rest of First Gibraltar to BankAmerica for $110 million, retaining four branches in Plano, Texas and $1.2 billion of assets in the mortgage and property management sectors. [...] He renamed the four branches First Madison. [...] It's unclear how much money Perelman made from his savings & loan deals, but it's estimated that he made anywhere from $600 million to $1.2 billion with most of the profits manifesting as tax breaks elsewhere in his empire. In essence, by owning First Gibraltar he was able to avoid paying hundreds of millions in federal taxes.|$|E
2500|$|Coaches Bennie Owen, Bud Wilkinson, and Barry Switzer {{have passed}} through the gameday tunnel for the Sooners, each {{on his way to}} the College Football Hall of Fame. Owen was the first highly {{successful}} coach at OU and was a major advocate of the forward pass, which at the turn of the century was not popular. The playing surface at Oklahoma's Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium is popularly known as Owen Field in honor of his long tenure and devotion to the university. Wilkinson left many imprints on the game, such as the 5-2 defense with five linemen and two linebackers; the perfection of the Split-T, an early option offense; three national championships; and his teams set the NCAA Division 1 record for consecutive wins at 47. The record of 47 straight wins is widely regarded as one of the great achievements in sports, and a streak that is unlikely to be broken (started October 10, 1953 vs. Texas and ended in 1957 with a loss to Notre Dame 7–0). Switzer won three national championships (The National Championship of 1975 is highly controversial, Arizona State went 12–0 that season while Oklahoma was 11–1) and forged arguably the fiercest rushing offense ever, the Oklahoma wishbone formation, throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Though the end of Switzer's tenure at Oklahoma was marked by controversy and poor player behavior, he is generally well regarded by both his past players <b>and</b> <b>Sooner</b> fans. During his 16 years as the Sooners' head coach, Switzer led his team to 12 conference championships and never lost more than two games in a row. His winning percentage of [...]837 stands as the fourth-highest in the history of 1-A football. Other Hall of Fame coaches whose tenure included stints at the University of Oklahoma are Lawrence [...] "Biff" [...] Jones and Jim Tatum.|$|E
