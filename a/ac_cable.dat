The brochure is particularly focused on the differences in the technical performance of an electric power system with long <b>AC</b> <b>cables</b> as compared to one with AC overhead lines. These differences in performance are due to the different electrical properties of <b>AC</b> <b>cables</b> as compared to OHLs. To interpret the results of studies and identify how they are affected by the distinctive characteristics of the cable, it is necessary to be familiar with the characteristics of various cable models in terms of their performance and resultant range of applicability, the effect of input data and their practical availability at various study phases, and the effect of physical properties of cables on their electrical performance. The reader is provided with some essential information about requirements for cable models for system technical performance studies over a range of frequencies. This ranges from data gathering to model accuracy, effect of data on model performance, evaluation of available cable models and their applicability for various studies, methods of validation, etc...|$|R

50|$|The {{usage of}} copper in {{photovoltaic}} systems is substantial, averaging around 4-5 tonnes per MW or higher if ribbons (conductive strips to connect individual PV cells) are considered. Copper is used in: 1) small wires that interconnect photovoltaic modules; 2) earthing grids in electrode earth pegs, horizontal plates, naked cables, and wires; 3) DC cables that connect photovoltaic modules to inverters; 4) low-voltage <b>AC</b> <b>cables</b> that connect inverters to metering systems and protection cabinets; 5) high-voltage AC cables; 6) communication cables; 7) inverters/power electronics; 8) ribbons; and 9) transformer windings.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{power can}} also be {{transmitted}} by underground power cables instead of overhead power lines. Underground cables take up less right-of-way than overhead lines, have lower visibility, and are less affected by bad weather. However, costs of insulated cable and excavation are much higher than overhead construction. Faults in buried transmission lines take longer to locate and repair. Underground lines are strictly limited by their thermal capacity, which permits less overload or re-rating than overhead lines. Long underground <b>AC</b> <b>cables</b> have significant capacitance, which may reduce their ability to provide useful power to loads beyond 50 mi. DC cables are not limited in length by their capacitance.|$|R

50|$|A {{video game}} {{accessory}} {{is a distinct}} piece of hardware that is required to use a video game console, or one that enriches the video game's play experience. Essentially, video game accessories are everything except the console itself, such as controllers, memory, power adapters (AC), and audio/visual cables. Most video game consoles come with the accessories required to play games {{out of the box}} (minus software): one A/V cable, one <b>AC</b> <b>cable,</b> and a controller. Memory is usually the most required accessory outside of these, as game data cannot be saved to compact discs. The companies that manufacture video game consoles also make these accessories for replacement purposes (AC cords and A/V cables) as well as improving the overall experience (extra controllers for more players, or unique devices like light guns and dance pads). There is an entire industry of companies that create accessories for consoles as well, called third-party companies. The prices are often lower than those made by the maker of the console (first-party). This is usually achieved by avoiding licensing or using cheaper materials. For the mobile systems like the PlayStation Portable and Game Boy iterations, there are many accessories to make them more usable in mobile environments, such as mobile chargers, lighting to improve visibility, and cases to both protect and help organize the collection of system peripherals to. Newer accessories include many home-made things like mod chips to bypass manufacturing protection or homemade software.|$|E

30|$|Compared with <b>AC</b> <b>cables,</b> the {{conductors}} of the DC cables do {{not have}} skin effect and proximity effect, so even though they transmit large current, the complex segmentation conductor structure is not required for them. The electric field intensity of DC cables is distributed {{in direct proportion to}} the resistance coefficients of insulation which will change along with the temperature. If the load increases, the electric field intensity on the insulation surface will gradually increase. Therefore, the maximum load allowed by the DC cables should not make the electric field intensity on the insulation surface exceed its permissible value, i.e. not only the maximum working temperature of the cables shall be considered but also the temperature distribution of the insulating layer.|$|R
50|$|A powered speaker usually weighs {{more than}} an {{equivalent}} passive speaker because the internal amplifier circuitry usually outweighs a speaker-level passive crossover. A loudspeaker associated with an integrated active system is even lighter because it has no internal crossover. A lightweight loudspeaker can be more easily carried and it {{is less of a}} load in rigging (flying). However, active speakers using lightweight Class-D amplifiers have narrowed the difference. Trucking for a sound system involves transporting all of the various components including amplifier racks, speaker cabling and loudspeaker enclosures. Overall shipping weight for an active loudspeaker system may be less than for a passive system because heavy passive speaker cable bundles are replaced by lighter <b>AC</b> <b>cables</b> and small diameter signal cables. Truck space and weight is reduced by eliminating amplifier racks.|$|R

40|$|This Technical Brochure {{describes}} system {{technical performance}} study issues {{important for a}} power system with (a large share of) long <b>AC</b> <b>cable</b> lines. The study areas are divided into planning studies, system impact studies and equipment design studies. The brochure contains examples and explanations of system technical performance phenomena occurring {{as a result of}} various system operations, guidelines for simulation methods, interpretation of the results and possible suggested countermeasures. As some of the presented examples produce overvoltages of significant duration and / or amplitude, consideration is given to the adequacy of cable tests recommended by IEC. The focus of this Technical Brochure is system technical performance issues and modelling of cables and other equipment is not its main topic. Nevertheless, in order to retain the ability to stand on its own, relevant recommendations concerning modelling of cables and other pieces of equipment as well as the required extent of network equivalents are given. Guidelines and recommendations for adequate modelling of <b>AC</b> <b>cable</b> lines for different types of power frequency studies and for studying phenomena that involve other frequencies are presented. Practical methods for gaining confidence in the accuracy of cable line models are described. Calculations of power frequency impedances based on published norms are shown. Available models for transient studies are identified and their selection for various studies is discussed including the required level of detail, accuracy and other implementation details. Sensitivity of study results due to variation of cable input parameters is analysed. Line constant solver results are benchmarked against manual calculations. Also a transient cable model validation procedure is shown. Derivation of basic computer cable line models, setups for measurement of cable impedances and results of real-life measurements performed on 100 km long <b>AC</b> <b>cable</b> of an offshore wind farm are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Calculating {{the current}} rating of HVDC cable systems is less {{straightforward}} than for <b>ac</b> <b>cables,</b> which are always thermally limited. While the permissible current in an HVDC cable circuit {{may be limited}} by the operating temperature of the dielectric, {{it may also be}} restricted by the electric stress within the dielectric. Conventional current rating calculations such as IEC 60287 are thus ill suited to HVDC applications. This paper demonstrates the importance of the electric stress constraint through the application of finite element modeling techniques which permit a coupling of the thermal and electrical properties within the cable. The results obtained demonstrate that changes within the installation environment cause the limiting factor to switch from thermal to electrical under steady state conditions, demonstrating the importance of developing calculation methods which can represent both cases...|$|R

40|$|Large dv/dt and di/dt outputs {{of power}} devices in the DC-fed motor power {{inverter}} can generate conducted and/or radiated emissions through parasitics {{that interfere with}} low voltage electric systems in electric vehicles (EVs) and nearby vehicles. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters, ferrite chokes, and shielding added in the product process based on the “black box” approach can reduce the emission levels in a specific frequency range. However, these countermeasures may also introduce an unexpected increase in EMI noises in other frequency ranges due to added capacitances and inductances in filters resonating with elements of the power inverter, and even increase the weight and dimension of the power inverter system in EVs with limited space. In order to predict {{the interaction between the}} mitigation techniques and power inverter geometry, an accurate model of the system is needed. A power inverter system was modeled based on series of two-port network measurements to study the impact of EMI generated by power devices on radiated emission of AC cables. Parallel resonances within the circuit can cause peaks in the S 21 (transmission coefficient between the phase-node-to-chassis voltage and the center-conductor-to-shield voltage of the <b>AC</b> <b>cable</b> connecting to the motor) and Z 11 (input impedance at Port 1 between the Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) phase node and chassis) at those resonance frequencies and result in enlarged noise voltage peaks at Port 1. The magnitude of S 21 between two ports was reduced to decrease the amount of energy coupled from the noise source between the phase node and chassis {{to the end of the}} <b>AC</b> <b>cable</b> by lowering the corresponding quality factor. The equivalent circuits were built by analyzing current-following paths at three critical resonance frequencies. Interference voltage peaks can be suppressed by mitigating the resonances. The capacitances and inductances generating the parallel resonances and responsible elements were determined by the calculation through the equivalent circuits. A combination of mitigation strategies including adding common-mode (CM) ferrite chokes through the Y-caps and the AC bus bar was designed to mitigate the resonances at 6 MHz, 11 MHz, and 26 MHz related to the CM conducted emission by IGBT switching and the radiated emission of the <b>AC</b> <b>cable.</b> The values of Z 11 decreased respectively by 15 dB at 6 MHz, 0. 4 dB at 11 MHz, and 11. 5 dB at 26 MHz and the values of S 21 decreased respectively by 8. 6 dB at 6 MHz, 7 dB at 11 MHz, and 6. 3 dB at 26 MHz.

40|$|In {{the case}} of an <b>ac</b> <b>cable,</b> power {{transmission}} is limited by the length of the cable due to the capacitive reactive current component. It is well known that high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cables do not have such limitations. However, insulation-related thermal problems pose a limitation on the power capability of HVDC cables. The author presents a viable theoretical development, a logical extension to Whitehead's theory on thermal limitations of the insulation. The computation of the maximum power-carrying capability of HVDC cables subject to limits on the maximum operable temperature of the insulation is presented. The limitation on the power-carrying capability is closely associated with the electrothermal insulation failure. The effect of environmental interaction by way of external thermal resistance, an important aspect, is also considered in the formulations. The Lagrange multiplier method has been used to handle the ensuing optimization problem. The theory is based on an accepted theory of thermal breakdown in insulation and is an important and a coherent extension of great significance...|$|E
