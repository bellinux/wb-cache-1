5|$|The Cucurbita digitata, C.foetidissima, C.galeotti, and C.pedatifolia species {{groups are}} xerophytes, <b>arid</b> <b>zone</b> {{perennials}} with storage roots; the remainder, including the five domesticated species, are all mesophytic annuals or short-life perennials with no storage roots. The five domesticated species are mostly isolated {{from each other}} by sterility barriers and have different physiological characteristics. Some cross pollinations can occur: C.pepo with C.argyrosperma and C.moschata; and C.maxima with C.moschata. Cross pollination does occur readily within the family Cucurbitaceae. The buffalo gourd (C.foetidissima), which does not taste good, {{has been used as}} an intermediary as it can be crossed with all the common Cucurbita.|$|E
5|$|The concept plan {{identified}} 145 {{species of}} birds as either known or expected {{to be found in}} the park. By 2006, 98 species had been recorded in the park's area, though not all specifically within the park's boundaries. Of the park's insects, seven species were found to be largely confined by its boundaries, with little presence in the rest of Adelaide. Their presence was unusual, as they were regarded as <b>arid</b> <b>zone</b> species. Approximately 35 reptile and amphibian species have been recorded within Anstey Hill park. Fauna in the park includes western grey kangaroo, common ringtail possum, common brushtail possum, short-beaked echidna, Gould's wattled bat, chocolate wattled bat, little forest bat, white-striped free-tailed bat and the lesser long-eared bat. Koalas are present, though they are not native to the area, having been deliberately introduced to the Adelaide hills.|$|E

25|$|Not much {{information}} is known on the ecology and biology of G. Kennedyana.

25|$|Below the steppes, and merging {{at times}} with them, was the arid zone: the semideserts and deserts of Soviet Central Asia and, particularly, of the Kazakh Republic.

25|$|Although most of {{the land}} around Mount Magnet has the heavy clay soil and Acacia aneura (Mulga) scrub common {{throughout}} semi-arid Western Australia, the area on which B.rosserae occurs is unusual in having deep yellow sand and laterite. It occurs there with mallee Eucalyptus species, over open heath of Grevillea, Hakea, Leptospermum, Melaleuca, Cryptandra and Triodia species. Thus the flora is more like that found on the Swan Coastal Plain than the <b>arid</b> <b>zone</b> in which it occurs.|$|E
25|$|The direct {{consequence}} {{of the war was}} the registration of the entire Tunisian plateau for land tax and its conversion to mainly wheat cultivation. The Musulamii and other nomadic tribes were likely permanently excluded from what had been their summer grazing grounds and forced to lead a more impoverished existence in the Aures mountains and the <b>arid</b> <b>zone.</b> The war also probably sealed the long-term fate of the client kingdom of Mauretania, which was annexed in AD 44 by the Emperor Claudius (ruled 41–54).|$|E
25|$|The {{scientists}} of Central <b>Arid</b> <b>Zone</b> Research Institute (CAZRI), have successfully developed and improved dozens of traditional and non-traditional crops/fruits, such as Ber trees (like plums) that produce much larger fruits than before (lemon-size) and can thrive with minimal rainfall. These trees {{have become a}} profitable option for farmers. One example from {{a case study of}} horticulture showed that in situation of budding in 35 plants of Ber and Guar (Gola, Seb & Mundia variety developed in CAZRI), using only one hectare of land, yielded 10,000kg. of Ber and 250kg. of Guar, which translates into double or even triple profit.|$|E
40|$|<b>Arid</b> <b>Zones</b> are {{typically}} {{defined in terms}} of lack of resources: water scarcity, a widespread risk of desertification and a fragile balance between water, food and energy. The paper proposes a different interpretation interpretation of the <b>Arid</b> <b>Zones</b> as a virtual creativity lab, which is stimulated by these primary issues. The research, implemented by the Design Department of Politecnico di Milano for the curation of the exhibition at the Cluster <b>Arid</b> <b>Zones</b> of EXPO Milan 2015, traced the following design approaches in these areas: building on existing customary practices and local empirical knowledge; reinterpreting people behaviors to empower the impact of innovative projects; adopting a multidisciplinary approach to link different fields of research. The results confirm the important role of the design discipline in such a fragile context, marked by difficult living conditions and fragile environment, as it allows envisaging the impact of the diffusion of certain innovations through various disciplinary fields of action. This systemic view helps us to broaden the thematic focus reminding that these emergencies are not just concerning the <b>Arid</b> <b>Zones,</b> often considered at the borders of our field of intervention, and it leads us to enhancing activities of forecasting, visualizing and communicating risks, moving from a local to a global level...|$|R
50|$|Nubian {{sandstone}} exposures in sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid conditions produce {{soil that}} is red-sandy but {{very different in}} other aspects. Only in sub-humid zones do these soils contain a moderately developed profile, including a textural B horizon lacking soluble salts and carbonates. In semi-arid and <b>arid</b> <b>zones,</b> profile differentiation is either weak or does not exist. In <b>arid</b> <b>zones</b> soils are shallow and contain carbonates, and soluble salts, including gypsum. The sole clay common to all Nubian sandstone parent materials is Kaolinite, which is the major clay mineral in sub-humid zone soil. In semi-arid soils smectite is a second major clay component. In <b>arid</b> <b>zones</b> small amounts of smectite and palygorskite accompany kaolinite. It is likely that smectite and palygorskite are products of pedogenic neoformation. Aeolian material was probably introduced into the silt and fine sand fractions from semi-arid and arid soils. It {{is also possible that}} some contamination of clay fractions occurred.|$|R

25|$|The {{importance}} of tool use by woodpecker finch species differs between vegetation zones. In the <b>arid</b> <b>zone,</b> where food is limited {{and hard to}} access, tool use is essential, especially during the dry season. Up to half of the finches' prey is acquired {{with the help of}} tools, making them even more routine tool users than chimpanzees. The tools allow them to extract large, nutritious insect larvae from tree holes, making tool use more profitable than other foraging techniques. In contrast, in the humid zone, woodpecker finches rarely use tools, since food availability is high and prey is more easily obtainable. Here, the time and energy costs of tool use would be too high.|$|E
25|$|The {{peace and}} {{stability}} the Mounties brought fostered dreams of mass settlement on the Canadian Prairies. The land was surveyed by the Canadian Pacific Railway for possible routes to the Pacific. The early favourite was a northerly line that went through Edmonton and the Yellowhead Pass. The success of the Mounties in the South, coupled with a government desire to establish Canadian sovereignty of that area, and the CPR’s desire to undercut land speculators, prompted the CPR to announce a last minute switch of the route to a more southerly path passing through Calgary and the Kicking Horse Pass. This was {{against the advice of}} some surveyors who said that the south was an <b>arid</b> <b>zone</b> not suitable for agricultural settlement.|$|E
