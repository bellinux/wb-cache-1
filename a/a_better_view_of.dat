5|$|The Singapura is {{described}} by the CFA as active, curious and playful. They are affectionate and desire human interaction. They {{have a tendency to}} perch on high places, to allow them <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> their surrounding.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the process.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the trophy}} {{was held by}} 1938 winners Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian {{vice-president}} of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent Adolf Hitler and the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden {{marked the beginning of}} a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographer requests for <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air. Every Cup-winning captain ever since has repeated the gesture.|$|E
50|$|On October 17, 2014 at the 1st Pangyo Techno Valley Festival, tragedy struck {{during a}} concert. Despite {{repeated}} safety warnings, {{a group of}} participants climbed {{on top of a}} ventilation grate to obtain <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>of</b> the stage. The grate, covering an underground parking lot 10 metres (33 feet) down, gave way under the sheer weight of roughly 20-30 additional bodies. According to BBC News, 16 people were killed with an additional 11 injured.|$|R

50|$|Unlike nearby Benham Falls, Dillon Falls are {{not widely}} {{documented}} {{because they are}} hard to see. Trails provide <b>a</b> somewhat <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the falls. The falls were named after Leander Dillon, a nearby homesteader. He died in 1907.|$|R
5|$|She and Tony meet up {{with her}} Israeli friend, Adam Eshel (Damon Dayoub), who gives them {{information}} on Bodnar's whereabouts and intentions. Bodnar contacts Ziva on the computer, urging her to walk away. They are able to track his location but are unable to apprehend him as he disappears into a crowd. Later, they learn that he is planning {{to pick up the}} diamonds from an ally (Willem Van Der Vegt) at a night club. While waiting to intercept him, Tony dances with Ziva both to help her get <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the area and to calm her agitated state of mind. Bodnar seems to appear, but when Ziva approaches him, she is stunned to see that it is Ilan's brother, Yaniv (Iddo Goldberg).|$|E
5|$|The site of CenturyLink Field is the {{smallest}} of those developed for new NFL stadiums. The upper levels were cantilevered over the lower sections to fit within the limited space. Along with the angle of seats and {{the placement of the}} lower sections closer to the field, this provided <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the field than typically seen throughout the country and allowed for a 67,000-seat capacity. Space is available to increase the total capacity to 72,000 for special events. Included in the capacity are 111 suites and over 7,000 club seats. The stadium has 1,400 seats for those with disabilities and their companions located in various sections. In 2009 CenturyLink Field ranked 21st out of the 31stadiums in the NFL for total seating capacity.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Joan of Arc, Etty's health continued to deteriorate. He continued to paint and exhibit, but his retirement plans grew firmer. In April 1846 he {{bought a house in}} Coney Street, central York, as a retirement home, and in December 1847 he formally resigned from the Council of the Royal Academy. Following structural alterations to give him <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the river, Etty moved into the house in June 1848, completing the move in September of that year, although he retained his London apartments. His move from London caused some consternation among that city's models, who were losing one of their most regular customers, as well as concerns from Etty who was worried that working with nude models might cause a scandal in York.|$|E
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{dictates}} that the 1. 642 -micron H(-) opacity minimum {{is the best}} window to {{the depths of the}} solar photosphere. However, the violet continuum near 0. 4 micron exhibits a larger intensity response to small thermal perturbations at depth, and thus might offer <b>an</b> even <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the subsurface roots of granulation cells and magnetic flux tubes...|$|R
30|$|This {{installation}} allows proper vaginal access, <b>a</b> <b>better</b> panoramic <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the pelvis, {{and safer}} ergonomy for the surgeon and the assistant. Should lumboaortic lymphadenectomy be done, a 10 -mm port {{is placed in}} the midline between the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus. The laparoscope is changed to this port, and an interxyphoumbilical port is used for bowel retractors.|$|R

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the All England Regulations for the Management of Prize Meetings, the draw for the 22 entrants was made on Saturday, 7 July 1877, at 3:30p.m. in the club's pavilion. H.T. Gillson had {{the distinction of being}} the first player in the history of modern tennis to be drawn for a tournament. The posts, nets and hand-stitched, flannel-covered India-rubber balls for the tournament were supplied by Jefferies & Co from Woolwich, while the rackets used were an adaptation of those used in real tennis, with a small and slightly lopsided head. The ball-boys kept the tennis balls, 180 of which were used during the tournament, in canvas wells. The umpires who were provided for the matches sat on chairs which in turn were placed on small tables of 18 inches height to give them <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the court.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS's two screens {{act as one}} tall screen; however, in practice, this {{essentially}} {{just gives}} the player <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the surroundings and, save for one boss battle, (Hector the Reflector, where the bottom screen acts as a mirror through which to see Hector during the battle) only provides the benefit {{of being able to}} see more (above) and, when the player is on the top screen, below. The game does not make use of the bottom screen's touch sensitivity for basic gameplay, though it is an option for selecting levels and in some mini-games. Each of DSs five worlds has two bosses, each with a weakness that must be identified and exploited. Most of the time, these are simply giant-sized versions of normal enemies, though some are more inventive.|$|E
5|$|The two vessels were {{pounding}} {{each other}} at such close range, they also managed to collide with one another at five different times. By 11:00am Monitors supply of shot in the turret had been used up. With one of the hatches to the gun ports damaged and jammed shut she hauled off to shallow waters to resupply the turret and effect repairs to the damaged hatch, {{which could not be}} repaired. During the lull in the battle Worden climbed through the gun port out onto the deck to get <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the overall situation. Virginia, seeing Monitor turn away turned her attention to the Minnesota and fired shots that set the wooden vessel ablaze, also destroying the nearby tugboat Dragon. When the turret was resupplied with ammunition Worden returned to battle with only one gun in operation.|$|E

50|$|Miniatures {{were sold}} in two kind of packages: a {{traditional}} blister carding and a less common shrink-wrap packing which offer <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> and protection <b>of</b> the miniatures during shipping.

50|$|XF Analyzers {{are capable}} of {{measuring}} the two major energy producing pathways of the cell simultaneously, mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, allowing scientists {{to get the most}} physiologically relevant bioenergetic assay available, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>better</b> overall <b>view</b> <b>of</b> metabolism. XF technology also measures fatty acid oxidation, and metabolism of glucose and amino acids for kinetic metabolic information. Research on obesity, diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases use this technology.|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} traditions {{associated}} with the Stanley Cup. One of the oldest, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory. The Cup is also traditionally presented on the ice to {{the captain of the}} winning team after the series-winning game; each member of the victorious club carries the trophy around the rink. However, this has not always been the case; prior to the 1930s, the Cup was not awarded immediately after the victory. The first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s. Ted Lindsay of the 1950Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first captain, upon receiving the Cup, to hoist it overhead and skate around the rink. According to Lindsay, he did so to allow the fans to have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Cup. Since then, it has been a tradition for each member of the winning team, beginning with the captain, to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted above his head.|$|E
25|$|He {{was well}} known for his batting technique, {{temperament}} and skill. He even experimented with a side-on batting stance, where one foot was placed {{at an angle to}} the crease, giving the body had a more open stance with <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the bowler.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{background}} illumination or using a pinhole to effectively decrease pupil diameter may allow {{a person to}} obtain <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> {{his or her own}} floaters. The head may be tilted {{in such a way that}} one of the floaters drifts towards the central axis of the eye. In the sharpened image the fibrous elements are more conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|The {{air traffic}} control at Værnes was {{established}} in 1946, after the air force had sent personnel to the United Kingdom for training. The Telecommunications Administration took over {{the responsibility for the}} radio installations, and the responsibility for the meteorological services became the responsibility of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center was also established to monitor all air space over Central Norway. In 1955, a glass dome was built on top of the control tower, giving <b>a</b> much <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the air field.|$|R
50|$|Zinn {{was one of}} {{the first}} aviators to attempt to {{photograph}} enemy troop positions from the air to assist commanders on the ground. This had previously been done from manned balloons, but they were vulnerable to enemy fire and had to be kept behind the lines. By flying directly over enemy positions and taking photographs, Zinn provided French commanders with <b>a</b> far <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the battlefield, and the techniques he and others developed soon became standard practice for both sides in the trench warfare style conflict.|$|R
50|$|Returning {{home from}} a dinner party, Jack has a {{coughing}} fit. His wife Anne is shocked when he coughs up blood all over her and the car. In an examination, Jack has a sample of a growth removed from his throat. The biopsy comes back positive for cancer. His time spent with another, cold impersonal surgeon in this examination {{is the beginning of}} his transformation. Further tests and disappointments are blended with scenes of other patients' grace and empathy towards each other and <b>a</b> much <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the delays and missteps of their doctors and medical support personnel.|$|R
25|$|The Invalidenfriedhof lay {{near the}} {{dividing}} line between East Berlin and West Berlin. Tombstones were removed from many graves in 1960, including Berthold's, so that communist border guards preventing escapes from East Berlin had <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the boundary. Berthold's stone disappeared. However, after Germany's reunification, private donors raised the funds for a simple marker {{to be placed on}} his grave in 2003.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that while serum or blood plasma levels follow the circadian rhythm or short term dietary changes, those within tissues themselves are more stable and give <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the availability of ascorbate within the organism. However, very few hospital laboratories are adequately equipped and trained to carry out such detailed analyses, and require samples to be analyzed in specialized laboratories.|$|E
25|$|Church restorations {{were also}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Oxford Movement, which advocated moving the centre of importance in the church from preaching to the sacrament of the Eucharist: from the pulpit to the altar. Consequences of this included moving the pulpit from a more central position {{to the side of}} the church, replacing box pews with open pews, creating a central aisle to give <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the altar, and the removal of galleries. Another consequence was that a larger chancel was required for the associated ritual.|$|E
5000|$|A dog sits {{beneath the}} same curly-haired man from before, and another fellow uses the canine's tail as a crank that curves the dog's {{midsection}} upwards, allowing {{the young man}} <b>a</b> far <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the field (or simply a chance to leap over the fence.) An apparently Scotch couple inflates a set of bagpipes, then ties them, as an hot air balloon, to a drum, {{which serves as a}} platform, that the couple might float in the air and leap over the fence as well. The fans sway about in the stands, and an unusually blond Cookie greets Buddy and vice versa.|$|R
30|$|Two papers used head-attached {{displays}}. Although these displays provide <b>a</b> <b>better</b> field <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> fashion constraints are {{a common}} issue. For instance, Martín-Gutiérrez et al. [52] reported that the HMD use was not comfortable. The cables linking the glass and camera with the PC interfered with user’s movement.|$|R
6000|$|There is a wall some {{hundred yards}} from the summit, on the [...] south-westerly flank of High Crag; near this--at a point close by, two [...] large holly trees--the boy might have {{sheltered}} himself against the [...] north-eastern wind, and have got <b>a</b> closer and <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the road [...] between Barngates and Outgate, and Randy Pike and Outgate.|$|R
25|$|In the laboratory, stratigraphers analyze {{samples of}} stratigraphic {{sections}} {{that can be}} returned from the field, such as those from drill cores. Stratigraphers also analyze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface. Geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the subsurface, and stratigraphers often use computer programs {{to do this in}} three dimensions. Stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occurring {{on the surface of the}} Earth, interpret past environments, and locate areas for water, coal, and hydrocarbon extraction.|$|E
25|$|The {{summit is}} broad and too flat to allow good all round views. These are further {{restricted}} by the higher fells to the west, {{but there is}} a fine prospect to the Pennines and Howgill Fells. Walls and fences follow the ridges from Gatesgarth, Tarn Crag and Selside Pike, meeting near the summit. A small cairn is situated a little to the north. <b>A</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Mardale, and certainly a better foreground, can be seen from Artlecrag Pike. This subsidiary top a little to the north has two fine columnar cairns built from the nearby outcrop of flaky rocks.|$|E
25|$|The pair were {{partners}} in 'Hudson Amusements' {{and had been}} operating their amusements in Omeath {{for the duration of}} the Omeath Gala. When the first explosion was heard across the Lough, the pair went down to the shore to see what was happening. The pair made their way to Narrow Water on the southern side to get <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> what was happening on the northern side of the Lough. Barry Hudson was shot in the arm and as he fell to the ground he saw his cousin, who was the son of a coachman at Buckingham Palace, fall to the ground. He died almost immediately.|$|E
50|$|The area {{within and}} around the fort is now {{completely}} wooded, although in Iron Age times {{it would have been}} cleared of trees to enable <b>a</b> <b>better</b> field <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and for agriculture. This has been suggested by evidence of Wild Service trees, which are an indicator of regrown forest.|$|R
50|$|Standing {{on large}} rocks in {{shallower}} {{parts of a}} river is another technique. This provides <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> higher out <b>of</b> the water. Going from rock to rock in a river with two hunters gets the fish moving if they are inactive. It is similar to herding the fish to the other hunter; while one hunter is wading the other is stationary on a rock.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Rose design was that the turret was not fully enclosed. Previous designs had perspex around the gun position, but in the Rose turret there was no {{protective}} shielding immediately {{in front of the}} gunner. This feature reflected operational experience: many Lancaster gunners had cut away parts of their turret in order to obtain <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view.</b> Testing <b>of</b> the Rose turret found that the open design reduced the temperature in the turret - which was typically very low - by only four degrees Celsius compared with a closed design. As well as improving the gunner's view, this feature also made it easier for him to bail out of the aircraft in an emergency.|$|R
