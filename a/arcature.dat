50|$|Nikortsminda has {{a massive}} dome and has {{unbroken}} <b>arcatures</b> as its twelve windows, which {{are decorated with}} ornamented architraves.|$|R
25|$|The main temple is a domed hall. The {{diameter}} of the high dome is quite large, and the under-dome space predominates in the structures interior. The vertical orientation of the interior is emphasized by the pillars supporting the dome. Attached to the pillars are several faceted pilasters and half-columns which form, at the top, semi-circular and pointed arches bearing the supporting girth of the domes. High niches, semi-circular in the plan, framed with graceful <b>arcatures</b> on twin half-columns, which decorate {{the bottom of the}} altar apses, harmoniously fit in with the pillars.|$|R
50|$|From {{the outside}} the Cathedral shapes like a short-armed {{rectangular}} cross {{and has a}} short segment to the west. The facades of the Cathedral are covered with smoothly hewn stone. Decorations include unbroken <b>arcatures</b> and various rich ornaments including multiple-figured story-telling reliefs and episodes (The Transfiguration, The Judgment Day, The Ascension of the Cross, figures of saint, real or imaginary animals, forming one premeditated program). Nikortsminda {{has one of the}} most beautiful decorations from all Georgian churches and cathedrals because several different styles can be seen among them, telling the richness of the selection of motifs and the manner of execution.|$|R
25|$|The {{shaft of}} the {{south-western}} column {{of the interior}} is girdled with an eight-arch <b>arcature,</b> the capital is accentuated, on the transversal axis, by a large rosette above which, {{on the face of}} the arch, there is a relief representation of a dove with a lifted wing. The abutment on the western side, corresponding to the column, has smaller vertical divisions than the other wall-attached abutments. Rosettes of various designs, painted white, yellow and red, were cut on the flat ceilings of the corner sections. The decoration of the central section was richer. Floral ornaments covering the shield-shaped pendentives show birds in various attitudes. The girth of transition to the 20-hedral base of the ceiling which probably consisted of six intersecting arches is composed of groove-divided triangular slabs, vertical and inclined.|$|E

5000|$|... "Seeing it is {{a joyful}} surprise" [...] wrote the great {{historian}} Nicolae Iorga. [...] "It's tall and narrows like a fine casket with holy relics; an architectural jewel which adorns the ancient woods of Bucovina." [...] The church is built mostly of raw, unpolished stone, {{except for the}} pillars, which end with buttresses made of polished stone. At the windows, Gothic-style frets have intersected bars. Under the cornice, there are two bands of friezed <b>arcatures.</b> The church is encircled with a stone belt of three alternately woven bands. This belt, {{a symbol of the}} Holy Trinity, also contains an allegorical message from the bishop, who lived to see the union of the Romanian-speaking peoples accomplished by Michael the Brave: he urged the coming generations to guide national and faith unity through the Holy Church.|$|R

50|$|From the outside, the Assumption church resembles an {{ordinary}} shrine {{rather than a}} monastic cathedral. Its architecture is based on 16th century traditional styles. The {{main part of the}} building has a cubical form, crowned with one illuminated and four decorative drums decorated with <b>arcature</b> and bearing large onion cupolas. The decor of the facades is simple: plain cornices and mouldings and window-jambs on rollers.|$|E

40|$|Na temelju arheoloških istraživanja benediktinske crkve sv. Nikole u Trogiru autorica donosi nalaz kasnoantičkih obrambenih zidina i južnih gradskih vrata. Uz izgradnju pomoćnog vanjskog zida, kojim se ostvaruje nova urbanistička regulacija Vrata Gospodnjih, razmatra i ranosrednjovjekovnu adaptaciju crkve sv. Dujma koju su 1064. godine građani poklonili novoutemeljenom ženskom benediktinskom samostanu. The convent of St Nicholas in Trogir is {{the oldest}} of the {{benedictine}} order among Dalmatian towns. According to a copy of a document of 1064, the citizens of Trogir gifted to the sisters the chapel, house of the blessed Domnius, at The Lord 2 ̆ 7 s Door (Porta Dominica), along with the adjacent seafront. Archaeological excavations show that the earliest chapel mentioned in the foundation document stood beneath the high embankment on which the present-day church• was erected. The position of the Lord 2 ̆ 7 s Door has also been established. Inside the Church, along the northern wall, the defensive wall dating from late antiquity, built with smaller irregular stones, has been excavated, while the sides of the door are made of monumental stone carvings with built-in ancient spolia from the same period. In the early Middle Ages, the town widened concentric ally in the area towards the south in a narrow belt of four to five metres 2 ̆ 7 width, and a new defensive wall was built. The town gate was positioned with its axis to the late antiquity gate as an extension to the cardo and form with them a complex providing a double entrance into the town with a space between. Concurrently with the building of the new defensive wall {{to the west of the}} late antiquity gate, a smaller church was erected which was later gifted to the Benedictine sisters. With external ground plan in the form of a parallelogram, the church 2 ̆ 7 s northern wall abuts the town wall of late antiquity, while its unusually broad south wall is an integral part of the new defensive wall. The longitudinal walls of the nave were divided by central and corner pilasters which formed shallow niches and carried barrel-shaped arches, most probably without the transverse rib. The apse is separated by its lengthened right-angled form and size from the proportions of the nave. From the method of its construction and its foundations, it indicates the narrowing and adaptation of a larger chamber for sacral purposes. Judging by the position of the south door which led directly on to the sea-fro nt, the chamber originally was used for the purposes of access to the harbour or as a guard, and only with additional changes became a modest chapel next to the town gate. The ground-plan irregularities of the building were primarily determined by the given area and the maximal use of existing walls. A tendency to establish symmetry at the front and back of the church produced asymmetry inside the building. Beneath today 2 ̆ 7 s apse in between the two town walls, there was an unusual and layered re-structuring. The eastern wall of today 2 ̆ 7 s apse lies on the walls of a square chamber which extended almost to the Lord 2 ̆ 7 s Door and which opened up into a broad arch towards the east. The eastern wall of the church of St. Domnius, therefore, and the western wall of the chamber formed a specific enclosed corridor or propugnaculum between double town walls. The untidy structure of the defensive wall and the parts of ancient tombstones and sculptures forming part of the town gate show the manner of building characteristic to late antiquity fortifications. It can surmised that the direction of the wall towards the east went underneath the bell-tower and served as foundation for part of the <b>arcature</b> of the monastery courtyard. The size of the door certainly does not correspond in its dimensions to the main ancient entrance into the town from the direction of the sea and arose because of the volatile times, when as a rule the numbers and sizes of openings would be minimised. Quick building interventions with the use of materials from ruined ancient buildings have been noted in Zadar and Salona another littoral towns and are attributed to the period after the expulsion of eastern Goths from Dalmatia. With the early Medieval broadening of the south front of Trogir the regular ancient perimeter was reconstructed into a polygonal scheme. Looting by the Saracens and the Arabs, who ventured into the Adriatic and attacked the littoral towns during the ninth century, was the incentive for the strengthening of the harbour part of town. At the end of the 9 th and beginning of the 1 Oth centuries a smaller chamber next to the harbour gate in Trogir was adapted as a church and was consecrated to St Domnius. The strengthening of the cult of the local martyr in the early Middle Ages, who also preached Christianity in Trogir, according to tradition, is a confirmation of the metropolitan rights of the Split church as successor to that of Salona...|$|E
