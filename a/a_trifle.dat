5|$|Light House: <b>A</b> <b>Trifle,</b> a 2000 satirical {{novel by}} American screenwriter William Monahan. Originally {{serialized}} in the Amherst literary magazine Old Crow Review from 1993 to 1995, Monahan sold Light House to Riverhead Books, a Penguin Group imprint, in 1998. Warner Bros. optioned the film rights while the novel was in manuscript and hired Monahan {{to write the}} screenplay adaptation. The novel was delayed for two years, with plans to release it alongside the upcoming film; however, the film was never produced.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head <b>a</b> <b>trifle</b> darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens. Females average slightly larger than males.|$|E

5|$|The two incisors on {{each side}} of the lower jaw are small and have three cusps. The lower canine (c1) has one high and narrow cusp. The second lower premolar (p2) is a large tooth with a high central cusp and high crests {{connecting}} this cusp to the front and back edges. A second, smaller cusp is present in the back crest. The fourth premolar (p4) also has a high central cusp; in addition, there are smaller roots before and behind it on the lingual side. This tooth has two roots. In the first lower molar (m1), a large tooth, the cusp complex at the front (the trigonid) is high and the one at the back (the talonid) is lower. Among the cusps of the trigonid, the protoconid is highest and the metaconid and paraconid are lower and about equally high. The cingula (shelves) at the front and the back are low. The second molar (m2) is similar and only <b>a</b> <b>trifle</b> smaller, but m3 is much smaller and has a reduced talonid. Length of m3 averages 2.37mm (SD 0.098mm) and width 1.76mm (SD 0.076mm).|$|E
5|$|Babe {{returns to}} the Vic, but is {{rejected}} by Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) and leaves. When Stan loses {{the use of his}} legs due to his prostate cancer, Tina asks Babe to visit so she can persuade him to seek medical help. Stan is pleased to see Babe and reconciles with Tina. Although Babe is upset when Stan proposes to Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), she encourages Cora to accept the proposal as Stan will never love her. After Stan's death, Babe excludes Cora from his funeral and encourages the rift between Mick and Shirley. After the funeral, Babe tells Sylvie, who is residing in a care home, that Stan has died, which frustrates Sylvie as she could not attend the funeral. Babe and Sylvie argue and exchange insults, leading to Babe slapping Sylvie. Sylvie then bites Babe's shoulder and threatens to report a criminal act that Babe and Queenie Trott (Judy Cornwell) committed several years earlier. Babe continues to create a rift between the Carter family and pays a teenager to throw a brick through the window of Shirley's son Dean Wicks's (Matt Di Angelo) salon. However, Dean's father, Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), learns the truth behind the attack and confronts Babe in front of the Carters, tipping <b>a</b> <b>trifle</b> over her head. After realising Babe's deceit, Mick and Shirley force Babe to leave Walford, but Babe warns that she will return.|$|E

25|$|The {{unit has}} been {{responsible}} for all search and rescue work from Bhamo, in Burma, north as far as allied planes regularly fly. Roughly, its jurisdiction extended from Tezpur, India to Yunnanyi, China. Before organized search and rescue, crews had been lost for weeks, sometimes months. Stretches up to 90 days were not unknown in a country where jungle thickets and dizzy mountain trails made each hour a nightmare to the lost crews fighting their way out. But today, ICD's unique outfit probably would have made the story <b>a</b> <b>trifle</b> less stark. Aerial supply drops of maps and pertinent homing information would have made the walk-out perhaps less circuitous, while certainly the hardships would have been alleviated by air-dropped medical supplies, food and clothing. S & R members have parachuted to lost aircrews to furnish medical aid and walkout assistance. As {{a direct result of the}} unit's work, the percentage of saved personnel steadily mounted and with it the confidence and assurance of ICD flight crews.|$|E
25|$|Nigamananda {{pointed out}} that the path shown by Gouranga, who practiced and preached {{unconditional}} devotion and love for God, was rather narrow, inasmuch as it was directed to Sri Krishna as the only God. In order to broaden that path, Nigamananda suggested taking the master as an embodiment of Sri Krishna (or any other deity whom the aspirant loved), in which case the guide himself becomes the goal. In this way Nigamananda convincingly reconciled the two apparently contradictory creeds of Shankaracharya and Gauranga who advocated the principle and practice of apparent duality between the devotee and God. After all, Nigamananda {{pointed out that}} in the path of devotion and love the aspirant has to subdue or tame his ego adequately and hence he attains to the same stage as that of the monastic aspirant whose ego loses its identity on attaining to his goal. In the former case, the devotee's individuality is reduced to <b>a</b> <b>trifle,</b> overpowered by personal god-consciousness, whereas in the latter the aspirant loses his self-consciousness in the ocean of impersonal universal consciousness.|$|E

25|$|Distinctive {{features}} include eyes {{that are very}} clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or <b>a</b> <b>trifle</b> higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and {{is often associated with}} a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be straight with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Light House: <b>A</b> <b>Trifle</b> {{was finally}} {{published}} and garnered critical acclaim: The New York Times proclaimed [...] "Monahan's cocksure prose gallops along", and BookPage Fiction called Monahan [...] "a worthy successor to Kingsley Amis". The story follows an artist named Tim Picasso who runs afoul {{of a drug}} lord and seeks refuge at a New England inn {{in the middle of}} a nor'easter. It is a work intentionally referential to the satirical novels of the early 19th-century British author Thomas Love Peacock, such as Headlong Hall and Nightmare Abbey.|$|E

500|$|The English edition by Britten Austin is a {{selection}} of the Epistles, and is in rhyming verse in the original metre. Britten Austin describes the challenge of translation as difficult or impossible, and admits that in one way his translations are inevitably [...] "a little faint." [...] He explains this is because [...] "Bellman's colloquialisms which offended his contemporaries still strike Swedish ears as the language of everyday speech. My renderings, therefore, may seem <b>a</b> <b>trifle</b> too antique in flavour; but to have jumbled up, as Bellman brilliantly does, modern-sounding slang with the graces of Rococo diction, would have produced a horrid effect.|$|E
500|$|Upon publication, {{reviews of}} Marching Men were {{moderate}} {{with a small}} number of reviewers taking strong negative stances. In one such [...] review, an anonymous critic from the New York Times Book Review noted that the beginning of the novel was [...] "sufficiently well done to lead the reader to expect a novel of possibly <b>a</b> <b>trifle</b> more than average interest and average merit" [...] but ultimately concludes that neither McGregor, [...] "nor the book ever seems to get anywhere in particular". Other reviewers too did not hesitate to mention the novel's stunted character development and anti-climactic ending. Aside from these faults, several critics also commented on Marching Mens [...] "deliberate vagueness", calling the book a [...] "generous if misty vision of the future".|$|E

500|$|Byron {{requested}} {{that her name}} be changed from Alba, which also related to [...] "Albé," [...] Clairmont's nickname for Byron, to Allegra, an Italian name meaning [...] "cheerful, brisk" [...] and relating to the musical term [...] "allegro." [...] During the journey to turn the child over to Byron, Clairmont wrote in her journal that she had bathed her daughter in Dover, but then crossed the passage out, as if afraid to mention the baby's name. The child was baptised with the name Clara Allegra before her mother relinquished her to Byron. Byron discussed spelling Allegra's surname as [...] "Biron" [...] instead of as [...] "Byron" [...] to further distinguish her from his legitimate daughter, Augusta Ada Byron. Byron offered to pay Shelley for the expense of Allegra's upkeep during her first months of life, but Shelley indignantly refused and said the cost was <b>a</b> <b>trifle.</b>|$|E
500|$|After the poem's {{original}} creation, it {{was expanded}} {{from its original}} use of an Aeolian harp as its theme over the months that followed. However, Coleridge did not stop working on it {{when it was first}} published. Instead, the poem was expanded and rewritten throughout Coleridge's life until 1817. Of the final version, lines 21–25 were previously removed between the 1797 and 1815 editions of Coleridge's poems. Likewise, lines 26–33 were altered through the multiple editions. Regardless of the amount of editing, Coleridge believed that the poem served as a model for other poems, especially those in the series called Conversation poems. Of The Eolian Harp as a model for poetry, Coleridge wrote, [...] "Let me be excused, if it should seem to others too mere <b>a</b> <b>trifle</b> to justify my noticing it—but I have some claim to the thanks of no small number of the readers of poetry in having first introduced this species of short blank verse poems—of which Southey, Lamb, Wordsworth, and others have since produced so many exquisite specimens." ...|$|E

In June 1956 Jacques appeared in an episode of The Tony Hancock Show on ITV; this {{led to the}} role of Hancock's secretary, Griselda Pugh, in the BBC radio series Hancock's Half Hour. She appeared in 16 episodes from November 1956 to February 1957, alongside Hancock and regulars Sidney James, Bill Kerr and Kenneth Williams. Jacques's arrival on Hancock [...] "provided an additional boost to the series", according to television historian Richard Webber. She appeared again in five further episodes of Hancock's Half Hour between April and June 1957, and again for a further 20 episodes between January and June 1958, before a special edition on Christmas Day 1958. She spent much of 1958 at the London Palladium, undertaking 380 performances of the revue Large as Life, alongside Terry-Thomas, Eric Sykes and Harry Secombe. She appeared in the sketches [...] "Concerto for Three Buffoons" [...] with Secombe and Sykes, [...] "The Good Old Days", and the two full company numbers that closed each of the two halves of the show.|$|E
