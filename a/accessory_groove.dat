50|$|Kelmayisaurus {{has been}} {{thought to be}} a nomen dubium due to its scanty remains, and its phylogenetic {{position}} was uncertain. It has usually been regarded as a basal tetanuran of uncertain affinities. However, Kelmayisaurus is diagnosable by the form and presence of a deeply inset <b>accessory</b> <b>groove</b> on the lateral side of the dentary, the main toothbearing bone of the lower jaw. Some of its features are like those of carcharodontosaurians, but they are also seen in large megalosauroids like Megalosaurus and Torvosaurus.|$|E
40|$|The Early Cretaceous {{fossil record}} of large−bodied theropods from Asia is poor, {{hindering}} comparison of Asian predatory dinosaur faunas {{with those from}} other continents. One of the few large Asian theropod specimens from this interval is a partial skull (maxilla and dentary) from the Lianmugin Formation (?Valanginian–Albian), the holotype of Kelmayi− saurus petrolicus. Most authors have either considered this specimen as an indeterminate basal tetanuran or a nomen dubium. We redescribe K. petrolicus and note that it possesses a single autapomorphy (a deep <b>accessory</b> <b>groove</b> on the lat− eral surface of the anterior dentary), {{as well as a}} unique combination of characters that differentiates it from other theropods, affirming its validity. A phylogenetic analysis recovers K. petrolicus as a basal carcharodontosaurid, which is supported by various features: very deep interdental plates (a carcharodontosaurid synapomorphy), fused interdental plates (present in carchardontosaurids and a limited number of other theropods), and the absence of diagnostic features of other clades of large−bodied theropods such as abelisaurids, megalosauroids, and coelurosaurs. As such, Kelmayisaurus is the second known carcharodontosaurid from Asia, and further evidence that this clade represented a global radiation o...|$|E
40|$|Rhoetosaurus brownei is {{the only}} known named pre-Cretaceous sauropod from Australia. It is {{therefore}} a potentially important taxon for understanding global paleobiogeographic and phylogenetic patterns among early sauropods. Despite its obvious significance, Rhoetosaurus has been too poorly understood {{to be included in}} most recent analyses of early sauropod evolution. With this in mind, we evaluated the osteology and phylogeny of undescribed materials of Rhoetosaurus, in order to attempt to close the gap in this understanding. The lower hind limb of Rhoetosaurus highlights a plethora of differences from other sauropods, supporting the distinctiveness of Rhoetosaurus {{even in the absence of}} other materials. Some unique traits include prominent crests and sulci on the tibia medially, a narrow metatarsal articular bridge, and pedal claws with an <b>accessory</b> <b>groove</b> or fossa. The pes plesiomorphically retains four claws where most sauropods have three, and bears superficial similarity to that of Shunosaurus. Preliminary cladistic analysis confirms that Rhoetosaurus is a non-neosauropod gravisaurian, although weak support for the most parsimonious topology suggests further findings are required to improve upon incompleteness in the character data. Examination of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses rules out a close relationship between Rhoetosaurus and East Asian Jurassic sauropods, and indicates a closer examination of the potential relationships between Rhoetosaurus and other contemporaneous Middle Jurassic Gondwanan sauropods is necessary...|$|E

50|$|It shows a one-host lifecycle, {{where all}} larva, nymphs and adults lives in one host. After eggs hatched, larva crawl in {{vegetation}} and blown away with wind. After stick on to a host, larva found in softer {{parts of the}} body and then becomes nymph and then to adult after two molts. After sexually matured and mating, female detaches from the host and lay eggs on vegetation. Female dies after ovipositing. Adult has a hexagonal shaped scutum. Male has adanal shields and <b>accessory</b> shields. Anal <b>groove</b> is absent in female, but minute in male.|$|R
