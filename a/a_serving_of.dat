5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. <b>A</b> <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E

40|$|Background: Calcium is an {{essential}} mineral often taken as a daily, long-term nutritional supplement. Data suggests that once-daily dosing is important with regard to long-term compliance of both drugs and nutritional supplements. Objective: This study was undertaken to compare the bioavailability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> two calcium supplements in healthy, premenopausal women. Design: A two-period, crossover bioavailability study <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> calcium citrate tablets (two tablets= 500 mg calcium) versus <b>a</b> single <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> calcium carbonate powder (one packet of powder= 1, 000 mg calcium) was performed in healthy women aged between 25 and 45. All subjects were on a calcium-restricted diet 7 days prior to testing and fasted for 12 h before being evaluated at 0, 1, 2, and 4 h after oral administration of the test agents. Blood measurements for total and ionized calcium and parathyroid hormone were performed and adverse events were monitored. Results: Twenty-three women were evaluable {{with a mean age}} of 33. 2 ± 8. 71. Results showed that administration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> calcium carbonate powder resulted in greater absorption in total and ionized calcium versus <b>a</b> single <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> calcium citrate tablets at 4 h (4. 25 ± 0. 21 vs. 4. 16 ± 0. 16, p= 0. 001). There were minimal side effects and no reported serious adverse events. Conclusions: This study shows that <b>a</b> single <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> calcium carbonate powder is more bioavailable than <b>a</b> single <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> calcium citrate tablets. This may be beneficial for long-term compliance...|$|R

Because of Arab and Zionist unrest in Palestine, Britain was determined to apply the terms of the White Paper of 1939 to minimise Jewish immigration to Palestine. British diplomats urged the Turkish government of Refik Saydam to prevent Struma from continuing her voyage. Turkey refused to allow the passengers to disembark. While detained in Istanbul, Struma ran short of food. Soup was cooked twice a week and supper was typically an orange and some peanuts for each person.

25|$|In 1997, the FDA {{approved}} of {{a claim that}} intake of at least 3.0 g of β-glucan from oats per day decreased absorption of dietary cholesterol and reduced the risk of coronary heart disease. The approved health claim was later amended to include these sources of β-glucan: rolled oats (oatmeal), oat bran, whole oat flour, oatrim, whole grain barley and barley beta-fiber. An example of an allowed label claim: Soluble fiber from foods such as oatmeal, {{as part of a}} diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. <b>A</b> <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> oatmeal supplies 0.75 grams of the 3.0 g of β-glucan soluble fiber necessary per day to have this effect.

25|$|Dishes {{that were}} {{intended}} to be eaten as well as entertain {{can be traced back}} at least to the early Roman Empire. In his Satyricon, the Roman writer Petronius describes a dish consisting of a rabbit dressed to look like the mythical horse Pegasus. The function of the entremet was to mark the end of a course, met (<b>a</b> <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> several dishes), of which there could be several at a banquet. It punctuated each stage of a banquet, prepared the diners for the next serving and functioned as a conversation piece. The earliest recipe for an entremet can be found in an edition of Le Viandier, a medieval recipe collection from the early 14th century. It described a comparatively simple dish: boiled and fried chicken liver with chopped giblet, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, wine, verjuice, beef bouillon and egg yolks, served with cinnamon on top, and was supposed to be of a bright yellow color. An even simpler dish, like millet boiled in milk and seasoned with saffron, was also considered to be an entremet.|$|E

2500|$|An entremet or entremets ( [...] ; from Old French, {{literally}} meaning [...] "between servings") is {{in modern}} French cuisine a small dish served between courses {{or simply a}} dessert. Originally it was an elaborate form of entertainment dish common among the nobility and upper middle class in Europe during the later part of the Middle Ages and the early modern period. An entremet {{marked the end of}} <b>a</b> <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> courses and could be anything from a simple frumenty (a type of wheat porridge) that was brightly colored and flavored with exotic and expensive spices to elaborate models of castles complete with wine fountains, musicians, and food modeled into allegorical scenes. By the end of the Middle Ages, it had evolved almost entirely into dinner entertainment in the form of inedible ornaments or acted performances, often packed with symbolism of power and regality. In English it was more commonly known as a subtlety (also sotelty or soteltie) and did not include acted entertainment.|$|E

The main course usually includes <b>a</b> <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> meat, such as roast or kotlet schabowy (breaded pork cutlet), or chicken. Vegetables, currently replaced by leafy green salads, were not very long ago most commonly served as surówka [...] – shredded root vegetables with lemon and sugar (carrot, celeriac, seared beetroot) or sauerkraut (...) [...] The side dishes are usually boiled potatoes, rice or more traditionally kasza (cereals). Meals often conclude with a dessert such as makowiec, a poppy seed pastry, or drożdżówka , a type of yeast cake. Other Polish specialities include chłodnik [...] (a chilled beet or fruit soup for hot days), golonka (pork knuckles cooked with vegetables), kołduny (meat dumplings), zrazy (stuffed slices of beef), salceson and flaki (tripe).|$|E
