25|$|Chorea {{is another}} {{condition}} which results from {{damage to the}} basal ganglia. Similar to athetosis, it results from mutations affecting the pallidum inhibition of the thalamus as well as increased dopaminergic activity {{at the level of}} the striatum.

According to Einstein, gravity is not a force – it is a property of space-time itself.

It came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> Ellsworth favored the Three-Fifths Compromise on the enumeration of slaves and opposed the abolition of the foreign slave trade. Stressing that he had no slaves, Ellsworth spoke twice before the Convention, on August 21 and 22, in favor of slavery being abolished.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of Irish immigrants in America {{has not always}} been harmonious. The US did not have a good relationship with most of the incoming Irish because of their Roman Catholic faith, as {{the majority of the population}} was Protestant and had been originally formed by offshoots of the Protestant faith, many of whom were from Northern Ireland (Ulster). So it came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> the federal government issued new immigration acts, adding to previous ones which limited Eastern European immigration, ones which limited the immigration of the Irish.|$|E

As both King Gustavus I and his son, John III, were involved in lengthy wars with Russia, it should come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> this was a central element {{in the arms of}} both the Grand Duchy of Finland, and in that of the coat of arms of the Finnish province of Karelia (Figure 6), which symbolizes the struggle between East and West.|$|E
25|$|Several reasons can {{be cited}} {{as to why}} the {{professional}} middle class is so influential. One is that journalists, commentators, writers, professors, economists, and political scientists, who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle-class persons in post secondary education, another essential instrument in regards to shaping public opinion, it should come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the American mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle-class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker.|$|E

Taft did not have a majority, but was likely to have one once southern delegations committed to him. Roosevelt challenged the election of these delegates, but the RNC overruled most objections. Roosevelt's sole remaining chance was with a friendly convention chairman, who might make rulings on the seating of delegates that favored his side. Taft followed custom and remained in Washington, but Roosevelt went to Chicago to run his campaign and told his supporters in a speech, [...] "we stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord".|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga the Grammy {{performance}} {{was inspired by}} many things, including Gregorian music, Alvin Ailey dance moves and Martha Graham's dance energy. On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno she explained that Smith inspired her to [...] "whip my hair {{back and forth on}} stage," [...] referring to Smith's similar named song. Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice. The idea occurred to her when she was in Amsterdam on her tour bus, and was thinking about birth and embryos. She had thought to herself, [...] "Gosh, the thing I hate most about doing award shows is, it can be [...] distracting... I want to exist only for my fans and for the stage. I don't want to exist in this machine or this circus that is the industry. I wish I could be encapsulated for three days and just think only about my performance, think only about the album, think only about the future of my fans. So that's what I did." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the {{performance was}} [...] "surprisingly" [...] sparse compared to Gaga's previous [...] "over-the-top" [...] endeavors. Soraya Roberts from New York Daily News was disappointed with the [...] "highly expected" [...] performance, feeling that it had copied Madonna and her Blond Ambition World Tour choreography. Jason Lipscultz from Billboard described the performance as [...] "spirited", and felt that Gaga's appearance inside the egg was one of the memorable moments of the Grammy Awards. Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly praised the performance saying that although there were definite influences of Madonna in it, the performance was {{one of the highlights of}} the show. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone concurred that [...] "It should come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> Lady Gaga's performance of her new single 'Born This Way' was the evening's most visually stunning and bizarre spectacle." ...|$|E

Only {{a small crowd}} turned up on 20 December 1965 to watch the last train pull out of Oldmeldrum.

Following the official closure of the branch line on 3 January 1966, it was temporarily used to store wagons before the demolition team arrived to lift the track.|$|R

2500|$|But {{the reason}} for Maroto's leaving Catalonia was not the {{opposition}} of the leading Catalans, but his belief {{that he had been}} betrayed in not having received the resources he had counted on when he left Navarre. So, after submitting to the Intendant Díaz de Labandero a series of petitions for armaments and uniforms that were totally impossible to fulfill, Maroto abandoned Catalonia 5 October on the pretext of going to see Don Carlos to notify him of the true situation of the war in that territory, thereby fulfilling [...] "my intent of resigning the command of the Catalan forces… it not being my character to carry on a disastrous life with no higher dignity than that of a captain of brigands". It should come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> the Catalans despised the man who had abandoned them, and that the court of Don Carlos did not look favorably on a man who appeared not to have exerted all possible force to achieve his assigned task.|$|E

Thereafter, the parishioners had to use {{the church in}} Gladsaxe though there was {{increasing}} interest in building a new church in Bagsværd. It therefore came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> the congregational council took special interest in the church Utzon had included in a competition exhibit for the town centre in Farum when it was displayed in Gladsaxe at an architectural exhibition in 1967. When he was asked whether he would like to submit a proposal for a church at Bagsværd, Utzon was elated: [...] "There I stood, and was offered the finest task an architect can have — a magnificent time when it was the light from above that showed us the way." [...] The proposal he submitted the following year included four sketches: the first one showed a group of people under the clouds on a beach, the last one depicted the same people as a congregation in a church where the clouds had become the sculptural roof. They were intended to illustrate Utzon's understanding of the overall concept.|$|E

AllMusic writer Andy Kellman described it as [...] "a career low point for all involved" [...] however he states [...] "There's a sense that he'll regain focus once his legal matters settle". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club states [...] "As is the case with 2Pac, it's difficult to separate the ongoing crime drama/soap opera of T.I.'s life from the music he creates. So it should come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> No Mercy, the superstar's latest post-and-pre-prison-stint album, reflects the life lessons and soul-searching that come with extended jail time at the height of a superstar's fame". Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe noted that [...] "throughout this disc there's an unsettling celebration of the untamed life without any reflection on the consequences T.I. often laments". Entertainment Weeklys Brad Wete noted that [...] "The self-proclaimed King of the South addresses his troubles on several tracks while on others he remains unrepentant, though: On Get Back Up, he arrogantly apologizes for being human rather than for his crimes" [...] Wete ended the review by stating [...] "That crown must be getting heavy".|$|E
