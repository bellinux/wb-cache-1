40|$|Abstract: Passive-type drug <b>infusion</b> <b>pumps</b> {{have several}} {{advantages}} over active-type pumps including a simple drug chamber structure and relatively high operational stability. However, conventional passive-type <b>infusion</b> <b>pumps</b> also have several limitations compared to active ejection pumps, {{such as a}} fixed flowrate and monotonic flow pattern. To enhance the clinical feasibility of using passive-type drug <b>infusion</b> <b>pumps,</b> flow readjustment and flow regulation abilities are needed. This paper proposes a new portable elastic drug <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> that inte-grates the advantages of active and passive <b>infusion</b> <b>pumps</b> to improve clinical feasibility. The proposed <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> incorporates a passively driven drug chamber and an actively adjusted flow controller, which can adjust and regulate various target flowrates and adjust the flow pattern {{in accordance with the}} patient’s time-varying physiological status. The proposed <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> uses the contraction force of an expanded elastic membrane to extract the drug from the drug chamber for delivery into the patient’s body through an outlet catheter. It also utilizes a flow sensor, a flow resistor, and a motor-driven flow restrictor that can monitor the real-time flowrate through the outlet catheter and automatically regulate the actual flow-rate around the target value. Experiments on the proposed system resulted in actual injectio...|$|R

40|$|Objective – To {{study the}} {{requirement}} of nursing care of the equine patient during eye treatment with a lavage system together with a constant rate <b>infusion</b> <b>pump.</b> Procedures – Three veterinary nurses at ATG: s Hästsjukhus in Skara were asked nine questions at individual interviews. Inclusion criteria {{for participation in the}} interview were that the nurse should have treated equines with and without the <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> to the lavage system, but also traditionally with eye drops. Results – The equine had a higher well-being since it experienced less stress during eye treatment with the <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> compared to treatment given by hand through the lavage system. The treatment would be more effective with constant rate infusion and save costs for the owner. The disadvantage with the <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> is that it can stop working and air pockets can accumulate in the SPL system and the pump. For optimal function the <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> should be attached to the halter instead of the mane and the air hole on the backside should not be taped over. When filling up the <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> with medicine it is important that no air is administrated. The veterinary nurse has to assess the function of the SPL system and the <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> frequently over the day to establish an adequate treatment. When a halter with a protective eye cup is used the horse does not need specific stable conditions with reduced light intensity. Conclusions – Eye treatment with the constant rate <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> ought to be a benefit for the horse both physically and psychologically. However further research is required to better establish the nursing care of the horse during the treatment...|$|R

40|$|Background: Adjuvants such as ketamine, {{promethazine}} and paracetamol {{could bring}} up patients satisfaction and control {{harmful effects of}} opioids besides lessening their needed doses, as seen by fentanyl/paracetamol and fentanyl/ketamine combination before. The current study headed to compare paracetamol and ketamine in addition to fentanyl applied by <b>infusion</b> <b>pumps</b> in order to pain relief following major surgery. Methods: Through a double blinded randomized clinical trial, patients between 18 and 65 with elective surgery for tight or leg fractures with ASA Class 1 and 2 referring to a university hospital in Arak, a town in central region of Iran, were recruited and used <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> for their postoperative pain control. The participants were divided into cases and controls regarding using ketamine/fentanyl (KF) or paracetamol/fentanyl (PF) <b>infusion</b> <b>pumps.</b> Results: The mean pain score was totally 3. 87 with higher value in KF (5. 06) and lower in PF (4. 5) immediately after finishing surgery and getting conscious when started using <b>infusion</b> <b>pump.</b> There was no statistical difference between the groups in this regard. Concerning {{the side effects of}} the applied medications, blood pressure and heart rate had no differences comparing the groups. Conclusion: This study showed that paracetamol used in <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> can be brilliant in pain control after major surgeries like what done in lower extremities and joint replacement while lessens opioid use. Although paracetamol was more effective than ketamine in the current trial, more qualified studies at bigger size and in other fields of surgery beside orthopedic ones would be useful to support the effects if applicable.
