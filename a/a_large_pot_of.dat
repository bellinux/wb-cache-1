Based on his flawed idea Dr. Dinwiddie began a daily practice of placing his surgical bedding and instruments into <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> boiling pine tea. When the steam (in his mind the ‘dark humors’ or 'bad air') came to the surface, he would ring a cow bell to frighten them away. Dr. Dinwiddies’ infection rates plummeted.|$|E

Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of Sunset and Sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar.

60|$|Having ascertained, {{by leaving}} crossed and self-fertilised seed on damp sand, that they germinated simultaneously, both kinds were thickly sown on {{opposite}} sides of a broad and rather shallow pan; so that the two sets of seedlings, which came up at the same time, were subjected to the same unfavourable conditions. This was a bad method of treatment, but this species {{was one of the first}} on which I experimented. When the crossed seedlings were on an average half an inch high, the self-fertilised ones were only a quarter of an inch high. When grown to their full height under the above unfavourable conditions, the four tallest crossed plants averaged 7.62, and the four tallest self-fertilised 5.87 inches in height; or as 100 to 77. Ten flowers on the crossed plants were fully expanded before one on the self-fertilised plants. A few of these plants of both lots were transplanted into <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> with plenty <b>of</b> good earth, and the self-fertilised plants, not now being subjected to severe competition, grew during the following year as tall as the crossed plants; but from a case which follows it is doubtful whether they would have long continued equal. Some flowers on the crossed plants were crossed with pollen from another plant, and the capsules thus produced contained a rather greater weight of seed than those on the self-fertilised plants again self-fertilised.|$|R
40|$|The fission yeast <b>Pot</b> 1 (protection <b>of</b> telomeres) protein binds to the {{single-stranded}} extensions at {{the ends}} of telomeres, where its presence is critical for the maintenance of linear chromosomes. Homologs <b>of</b> <b>Pot</b> 1 have been identified {{in a wide variety of}} eukaryotes, including plants, animals, and humans. We now show that Pot 1 plays dual roles in telomere length regulation and chromosome end protection. Using a series <b>of</b> <b>Pot</b> 1 truncation mutants, we have defined distinct areas of the protein required for chromosome stability and for limiting access to telomere ends by telomerase. We provide evidence that <b>a</b> <b>large</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>Pot</b> 1, including the N-terminal DNA binding domain and amino acids close to the C terminus, is essential for its protective function. C-terminal Pot 1 fragments were found to exert a dominant-negative effect by displacing endogenous Pot 1 from telomeres. Reducing telomere-bound Pot 1 in this manner resulted in dramatic lengthening of the telomere tract. Upon further reduction <b>of</b> <b>Pot</b> 1 at telomeres, the opposite phenotype was observed: loss of telomeric DNA and chromosome end fusions. Our results demonstrate that cells must carefully regulate the amount <b>of</b> telomere-bound <b>Pot</b> 1 to differentiate between allowing access to telomerase and catastrophic loss of telomeres...|$|R

In another variation, known as tsutsugayu shinji, multiple hollow cylinders made of split bamboo or reeds are placed in the gruel, each cylinder corresponding to a specific month. Shinto prayers are chanted and the rice porridge is then left overnight. The following morning, the cylinders are cut open and the contents examined - the more rice that has stuck {{to the inside of}} the tube, the more propitious the harvest. If multiple tubes are used, these usually correspond to specific months of the year, and the results are recorded on a month-by-month basis.

60|$|Under {{the power}} of this impression, I hastened back to my castle, {{prepared}} every thing for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left,) and a basket of raisins: and thus, loading myself with every thing necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out of her, put her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head for <b>a</b> shade, another <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk and a cheese: all which, with great labour and sweat, I carried to my boat; and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out; and rowing, or paddling, the canoe along the shore, came at last to the utmost point of the island on the north-east side.

I looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly {{on both sides of the}} island at a distance, and which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those currents, I should be carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of the island again; and that then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost.|$|R
6000|$|The Somal hold {{mainly to}} the Shafei school of El Islam: their {{principal}} peculiarity is that of not reciting prayers over the dead even in the towns. The marriage ceremony is simple: {{the price of the}} bride and the feast being duly arranged, the formula is recited by some priest or pilgrim. I have often been requested to officiate on these occasions, and the End of Time has done it by irreverently reciting the Fatihah over the happy pair. [18] The Somal, as usual amongst the heterogeneous mass amalgamated by El Islam, have a diversity of superstitions attesting their Pagan origin. Such for instance are their oaths by stones, their reverence of cairns and holy trees, and their ordeals of fire and water, the Bolungo of Western Africa. A man accused of murder or theft walks down a trench full of live charcoal and about a spear's length, or he draws out of the flames a smith's anvil heated to redness: some prefer picking four or five cowries from <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> full <b>of</b> boiling water. The member used is at once rolled up in the intestines of a sheep and not inspected for a whole day. They have traditionary seers called Tawuli, like the Greegree-men of Western Africa, who, by inspecting the fat and bones of slaughtered cattle, [...] "do medicine," [...] predict rains, battles, and diseases of animals. This class is of both sexes: they never pray or bathe, and are therefore considered always impure; thus, being feared, they are greatly respected by the vulgar. Their predictions are delivered in a rude rhyme, often put for importance into the mouth of some deceased seer. During the three months called Rajalo [19] the Koran is not read over graves, and no marriage ever takes place. The reason of this peculiarity is stated to be imitation of their ancestor Ishak, who happened not to contract a matrimonial alliance at such epoch: it is, however, a manifest remnant of the Pagan's auspicious and inauspicious months. Thus they sacrifice she- camels in the month Sabuh, and keep holy with feasts and bonfires the Dubshid or New Year's Day. [20] At certain unlucky periods when the moon is in ill-omened Asterisms those who die are placed in bundles of matting upon a tree, the idea being that if buried a loss would result to the tribe.

40|$|In {{this study}} we interviewed the local {{knowledgeable}} people {{in terms of the}} traditional dyeing plants and methods for the costumes used in "hachigatsu odori" (a local festival for harvest celebration held annually in August of the lunar calendar), which was designated as an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Properties of Japan, and conducted dyeing experiments based on the information obtained from the interviews. At present, the fabric of the costumes used in "hachigatsu odori" are dyed with man-made synthetic dyes, however, dyes from herbs and trees were used to dye costume fabrics in the past on Tarama Island. Various plants have been used to extract colors, e. g.,fukugi (Garcinia subelliptica), terihaboku (Calophyllum inophyllum), towel gourd (Luffa cylindrica), sharinhai (Rhaphiofepis indica ssp. umbellata), and yaeyama aoki (Morinda citrifolia). In particular,fitkugi trees were widely used to extract yellow color to dye the costumes in the parts of hakama (a traditional Japanese clothing resembling skirt-like trousers), haori (coat), furoshiki (wrapping cloth), and flags. The process of dyeing from fukugi varies significantly depending on the material to be dyed, the time and method of soaking the material in boiled water, and methodology involved in the transfer of color to the textiles. Fukugi tree stem was hit with a hammer to help separate the bark the stem, and then barked as natural dyeing material. Then, the barks were soaked and boiled in water in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot.</b> The period <b>of</b> heating was not fixed. There existed three essentiul ways of fixing colors to the textiles or fibers; 1) Soak and heat the material in water, and then dye the textiles in the liquid made from the boiled down bark. 2) Soak the textile in the liquid made from boiled down barks and wood-ash liquid separately. 3) Soak the textile in the mixed liquid that made from boiled down barks and wood-ash liquid. We found {{that the best way to}} "fix" color or the fastest way to transfer the color is as follows. The bark should be soaked and heated in water for 2 hours. The boiled down bark liquid has a pH value of 4. 85 and Baume of 3. 0. After mixing wood-ash and water in 1 : 2 volume ratio, we obtained the wood-ash liquid with a pH value at 10. 5 and Baume at 4. 0. Finally, the above mentioned color fixing method 2) was used. Soak the textile in the liquid made from boiled down barks and wood-ash liquid separately. It can be concluded that in the past, the costumes used for "hachigatsu odori must have been dyed in a manner similar to the above conditions...|$|R
