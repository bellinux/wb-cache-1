5|$|In the campaign, Hunter {{emphasized}} {{his conservative}} credentials, {{focusing on the}} issues of border security, the War on Terrorism, and trade. Throughout 2007, he was in the second tier of Republican candidates, consistently receiving three percent or less support <b>among</b> <b>Republicans</b> in national polls. However, the campaign reached a high point after Hunter won the Texas Straw Poll.|$|E
5|$|In foreign policy, Grant {{sought to}} {{increase}} trade and influence while remaining at peace with the world. With Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, he successfully resolved the Alabama claims through the Treaty of Washington with Great Britain. Grant and Fish negotiated a peaceful resolution with Spain over the Virginius Affair. Congress rejected Grant's initiative to annex the Dominican Republic, creating a rift <b>among</b> <b>Republicans.</b> His administration implemented a gold standard and sought to strengthen the dollar. Grant's immediate response to the Panic of 1873 failed to halt a severe industrial depression that produced high unemployment, deflation, and bankruptcies. When Grant left office in 1877, he embarked on a two-year world tour that captured favorable global attention for him and the United States.|$|E

5|$|When Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, he held an {{approval}} rating of sixty-eight percent, matching those of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and later Bill Clinton, {{as the highest}} ratings for departing presidents in the modern era. He was the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve two full terms, after a succession of five prior presidents did not, some under unusual circumstances. Although he had planned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in 1994 {{that he had been}} diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier that year. He appeared publicly for the last time at the funeral of Richard Nixon. He died ten years later in 2004 at the age of 93. Reagan had the third-longest life out of all the presidents, after Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. An icon <b>among</b> <b>Republicans,</b> he is viewed favorably in historian rankings of U.S. presidents, and his tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Post {{election}} {{polls showed}} that Humphrey lost the white vote with 38%, nine points behind Nixon, but won the nonwhite vote solidly, 85% to 12%, including 97% of African-Americans. African-Americans favored Humphrey {{because of his}} record on civil rights, and their desire to quickly end the war in Vietnam, where blacks were overrepresented. The racial divide in the election had widened since 1964, and was attributed to civil rights protests and race riots. Humphrey won 45% of the female vote, two points ahead of Nixon, but lost to the Republican among males, 41% to 43%. Voters with only a grade school education supported Humphrey 52% to 33% over Nixon, while Nixon won among both those with no higher education than high school (43% to 42%) and those who graduated from college (54% to 37%). Occupation demographics mirrored these numbers with manual-labor workers supporting Humphrey 50% to 37%, and with white-collar (47% to 41%) and professionals (56% to 34%) favoring Nixon. Humphrey won among young voters (under 30 years old) by 47% to 38%, and also edged Nixon among those between 30 and 49 years, with 44% to 41%. Nixon won among voters over 50 years, 47% to 41%. Catholics backed Humphrey with 59%, twelve points ahead of Nixon, but Protestants favored Nixon, 49% to 35%. Humphrey lost the Independent vote 31% to 44%, with 25% going to Wallace, and won a lower percentage among Democrats (74%) than Nixon won <b>among</b> <b>Republicans</b> (86%). This discrepancy {{was connected to the}} tough Democratic primary election that caused some former McCarthy, Kennedy or McGovern supporters to vote for Nixon or Wallace as a protest.|$|E

25|$|Lieberman's {{embrace of}} certain {{conservative}} policies {{and in particular}} his endorsement of John McCain have been cited as factors for his high approval rating <b>among</b> <b>Republicans</b> in Connecticut with 66% of Republicans approving of him along with 52% of independents also approving of his job performance, this however is also cited for his mediocre approval rating among Democrats: 44% approving and 46% disapproving.|$|E

His approval <b>among</b> <b>Republicans</b> polled was 62%, but his rating among Democrats was only 12%. This {{was one of the greatest}} partisan divides of any governor.|$|E
25|$|At the convention, a {{republic}} gained majority support (89 votes to 52 with 11 abstentions), {{but the question}} of what model for {{a republic}} should be put to the people at a referendum produced deep divisions <b>among</b> <b>republicans.</b> Four republican models were debated: two involving direct election of the head of state; one involving appointment on the advice of the prime minister (the McGarvie Model); and one involving appointment by a two-thirds majority of parliament (the bi-partisan appointment model).|$|E
25|$|During 2007, Hunter {{did well}} in some county- and state-level straw polls, {{including}} a victory at the first GOP Texas Straw Poll on September 1, but those results did not transfer to regular polls at national or state levels. Some major polls did not even list Hunter as an option along with Mitt Romney, John McCain, Mike Huckabee, Ron Paul, Fred Thompson, or Rudy Giuliani. When national polls did list Hunter, he consistently got three percent or less support <b>among</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E

25|$|Trump {{support was}} high among working and middle-class white male voters with annual incomes {{of less than}} $50,000 and no college degree. This group, {{particularly}} those {{with less than a}} high-school education, suffered a decline in their income in recent years. According to The Washington Post, support for Trump is higher in areas with a higher mortality rate for middle-age white people. A sample of interviews with more than 11,000 Republican-leaning respondents from August to December 2015 found that Trump at that time found his strongest support <b>among</b> <b>Republicans</b> in West Virginia, followed by New York, and then followed by six Southern states.|$|E
25|$|When {{it became}} clear that Mexico would not stand for this kind of an agreement, some critics from the labor {{movement}} would not settle for any viable alternatives. In response, part of the labor movement wanted to declare their open opposition to the agreement, and to push for NAFTA's rejection in Congress. Ultimately, the ambivalence of labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to believe that strengthening NAFTA's labor side agreement too much would cost more votes <b>among</b> <b>Republicans</b> than it would garner among Democrats, and would make it harder for the United States to elicit support from Mexico.|$|E
25|$|On September 1, 2007, Senator Larry Craig {{announced}} his intent {{to resign from}} the Senate effective September 30, 2007. The announcement followed by just six days the disclosure that he had pleaded guilty on August 1, 2007 to a reduced misdemeanor charge arising out of his arrest on June 11 at the Minneapolis airport for soliciting sex with {{a man in the}} restroom. Craig found almost no support <b>among</b> <b>Republicans</b> in his home state or Washington.

50|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the vote, which was {{originally}} scheduled for March 23, 2017, there was increased division <b>among</b> House <b>Republicans</b> over the replacement, causing concerns <b>among</b> <b>Republican</b> Party leadership over having the votes needed to pass the bill. <b>Among</b> <b>Republican</b> defectors from the bill, the largest opposition came from members of the House Freedom Caucus, which consists of some of the most conservative members in the House. The Freedom Caucus members, among their primary objections to the bill, were not convinced that the healthcare replacement effectively abolished some elements of the Affordable Care Act, most prominently the essential health benefits. To achieve success in the House, Republicans could not afford more than twenty-one members of their own party voting against the bill, and several days before the vote, dissent within the party, largely from the Freedom Caucus, was a significant threat to its passage. Beyond the conservative members of the Freedom Caucus, there was continued opposition to the bill from more moderate Republicans in the House, such as from members of the center-right Tuesday Group, where there were concerns about loss of coverage and the potential of rising insurance costs.|$|R
