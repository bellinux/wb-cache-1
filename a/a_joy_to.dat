25|$|The great England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans was on {{his fourth}} tour of Australia, having visited before in 1946-47, 1950–51 and 1954-55. He was chosen in part for his batting, having made centuries against the West Indies and India, but his loud and {{enthusiastic}} wicketkeeping was <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> watch and considered {{by far the best}} in the world. When he returned to England in 1959 he missed three stumpings in fifteen minutes against India and retired from Test cricket as he no longer met his own exacting standards, but his record number of dismissals in Test cricket remained unbeaten for eighteen years. The Marylebone Cricket Club preferred to rotate their reserve wicket-keepers and in 1958-59 it was the turn of the reserve Surrey keeper Roy Swetman. He was by far the shortest man in the team and looked only 17, but was in fact 25. Although a good man behind the stumps and a decent lower order batsman he was not Evans and lost his England place in 1960. In 1956 England had out-fielded and out-caught Australia and they were still a strong fielding team. Colin Cowdrey would be the first slip fielder to take 100 Test catches, Peter May and Tom Graveney were good slips and Ted Dexter an athletic cover. Fred Trueman was a good close field and Tony Lock was considered the greatest backward short leg in the world and one of the safest pair of hands in cricket. Peter Richardson, Willie Watson and Trevor Bailey were good all round fielders, though the latter two were slowing {{down at the end of}} their careers.|$|E

[...] His caps of feathers, his bonnets of freedom, and his starry diadems are <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> behold." [...] Nevertheless, Vermeule disliked the figure on the obverse, [...] "the princess of the gold coins is a banknote engraver's elegant version of folk art of the 1850s. [...] The plumes or feathers are more like the crest of the Prince of Wales than anything that saw the Western frontier, save perhaps on a music hall beauty." ...|$|E

Starring as the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror film , based on Anne Rice's 1976 novel of the same name, {{he was part of}} an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas. Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony, his performance was poorly received. According to the Dallas Observer, [...] "Brad Pitt... is {{a large part of the}} problem [...] When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side... he's <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> watch. But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis." ...|$|E

Jackson said of Viramontes, [...] "He was very creative, and I believe one day his work will be iconic. He was such <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> work with. I miss him." [...] Author Dean Rhys Morgan in Bold, Beautiful and Damned: The World of Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes discusses how Jackson was [...] "transformed from a former child star into an assured fashion forward figure with her trendsetting big hair and severe all black ensemble. Until this point Jackson had been more a reflection than pioneer, more interpreter than innovator. This album was all about Janet and who she wanted to be."

500|$|The {{series was}} {{received}} negatively by Katherine Dacey of Mangacritic.com {{where it was}} listed as fifth on Manga Critic's [...] "The 2009 Manga Hall of Shame Inductees". Dacey criticized the series' lack of comedy, art style, and the personality of girls stating the author must hate girls. Kurt Hassler of Yen Press rebutted Mangacritics review and disagreed and praised the characters and the art style. Hassler's response to the review led to Dacey modifying her review to specify it was not hatred of women, but of the characters. Hassler also highlighted a quote from a review by Julie Opipari of Manga Maniac Cafe, a personal website, which stated, [...] "The art alone makes this title worthy of a read, with its fine lines, elegant details, and overall attractiveness…the vision revealed inside this book is gorgeous. Dramatic and comedic scenes are played out with equal effectiveness, making the visuals <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> behold." ...|$|E
500|$|Just {{before the}} dedication, the slogan [...] "Quebec Libre" [...] (a {{reference}} to the Quebec sovereignty movement) was painted on the fountain at night, and the graffiti was erased. During the dedication, attended by Thomas Hoving, director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, a rock band played, and Armand Vaillancourt himself painted [...] "Quebec Libre" [...] on the fountain in as many places as he could reach. A redevelopment agency employee started to paint over the slogans during the ceremony, but Herman stopped him, saying {{it could be done}} later. When asked about why he defaced his own fountain with graffiti he responded, “No, no. It's <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> make a free statement. This fountain is dedicated to all freedom. Free Quebec! Free East Pakistan! Free Viet Nam! Free the whole world!” Vaillancourt said his actions were [...] "a powerful performance" [...] intended to illustrate the notion of power to the people. [...] "Quebec Libre" [...] has been an alternate name for the fountain since.|$|E
500|$|A {{biography}} of Sylvester was authored by Gamson {{and published in}} 2005. Writing for the London-based LGBT magazine Beige: The Provocative Cultural Quarterly, Stephen Brogan expressed his opinion that while Gamson's biography was well researched, it had a fragmented structure and as such was [...] "not <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> read". Entertainment Weekly called the book [...] "playful and furious" [...] and awarded it a B+ rating, The Boston Globe suggested that it was [...] "as engaging as the times it so energetically resurrects", and The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the author [...] "carefully paints the shifting social tapestry into his subject's life story without ever taking Sylvester out of the foreground". The Fabulous Sylvester won the 2006 Stonewall Book Award for nonfiction. In 2015, Sylvester's publicist Sharon Davis published memoirs {{of the time that}} she spent with Sylvester, noting that she planned for it to appear in 2013 to mark the 25th anniversary of Sylvester's death.|$|E

The [...] "Ping Pong" [...] diamond had cost only $14 and had been bought for her by Burton after he promised her a diamond if she beat him by ten points at a game of ping pong. When people praised her {{diamonds}} at the ball, Taylor would make a show of pretending that they were praising the Ping Pong diamond and not its much larger counterparts. Burton wrote in his diary that [...] "Elizabeth's delight in it is <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> behold and a very quaint thing to witness is the obvious pleasure that other people take in her wearing it. Even Hjordis Niven and Princess Grace, who are coldish fish, seemed to enjoy her moment. And of course nobody can wear it better.

He also acknowledged the need for horse racing to have [...] "stars" [...] and for them to race as long as they could. Though American Pharoah's stud rights had been sold with plans to retire the horse at the end of 2015, Zayat expressed hope that the horse would continue racing as long as he was healthy and [...] "has it in him". His winning time of 2:26.65 was the sixth-fastest in Belmont history, the second-fastest for a Triple Crown winner, and his closing quarter-mile was run in 24.32 seconds, which was over a half-second faster than Secretariat's final quarter-mile time of 25.00 when the 1973 winner set a world record and won by 31 lengths.|$|E

Everyone's been really nice to me and it's going well." [...] Prior to the airing of the Connor family's arrival on the famous cobblestone street in August 2006, Thompson commented, [...] "I can't say too much about Ryan and the story lines, but he's very mischievous. The character is not a bad lad, but he's not a good lad either."

500|$|Over {{the course}} of her {{appearances}} in Angel, Cordelia would develop enormously as a character. Describing this evolution, Carpenter comments, [...] "When I first started playing Cordelia, she wasn't nice. She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility. She's a team player, which was not the case in the beginning." [...] Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing The road Cordelia has travelled, the journey she has taken up to now has been such <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> play as an actress, because {{there have been so many}} chances to do so many different emotions.

Josh Duboff of Vanity Fair felt [...] "Clumsy" [...] portrays [...] "the most straight-forward 'club' track" [...] and further explained that [...] "the song is innocuous and propulsive." [...] Digital Spy's Lewis Corner named the recording a [...] "four-to-the-floor banger" [...] with an infectious clap-beat." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Spin stated that [...] "the rubbery track is among Britney’s most fun songs of recent years." [...] Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle, declared, [...] "It's both a relief and <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> hear Spears return to her former glory with the empowering, x-rated 'Clumsy' lyrics."

500|$|Resonance of Fate {{received}} [...] "mildly positive" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. The game launched in Japan with 145,000 copies {{sold in the}} first week across both platforms but dropped off Media Create's top 30 list within a month. Critics were most vocal in their praise of the gameplay and battle system. Eurogamer called its innovative design [...] "one of the most inspired approaches to the role-playing video game seen in a decade." [...] IGN stated that [...] "the battle system in Resonance of Fate is strong enough to hold everything together" [...] and added [...] "the unique combat system steps up to be the star of the show." [...] GameSpot noted that [...] "the cinematography used during hero actions is so over-the-top and exciting to watch that it makes battles <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> take part in." [...] USgamer also lauded the faster pace of the combat system and its emphasis on teamwork to win battles. But some reviewers noted that [...] "the flow of combat in Resonance of Fate is initially confusing, especially if you don't take the optional tutorial." [...] The game was the runner-up for RPGamer's Best Battle System award.|$|E

500|$|Stafford was {{admired by}} critics and the {{listening}} {{public for the}} purity of her voice, and {{was considered one of}} the most versatile vocalists of her era. Peter Levinson said that she was a coloratura soprano, whose operatic training allowed her to sing a natural falsetto. Her style encompassed a number of genres, including big band, ballads, jazz, folk and comedy. The music critic Terry Teachout described her as [...] "rhythmically fluid without ever sounding self-consciously 'jazzy' [...] ", while Rosemary Clooney said of her, [...] "The voice says it all: beautiful, pure, straightforward, no artifice, matchless intonation, instantly recognizable. Those things describe the woman too." [...] Writing for the New York Sun, Will Friedwald described her 1947 interpretation of [...] "Haunted Heart" [...] as [...] "effective because it's so subtle, because Stafford holds something back and doesn't shove her emotion in the listener's face." [...] Nancy Franklin described Stafford's version of the folk song [...] "He's Gone Away" [...] as [...] "wistful and tender, as if she had picked up a piece of clothing once worn by a loved one and begun singing." [...] Frank Sinatra said, [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> sit on the bandstand and listen to her". The singer Judy Collins has cited Stafford's folk recordings as an influence on her own musical career. The country singer Patsy Cline was also inspired by Stafford's work.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, Thomas Lee wrote: [...] "Why [...] Lopez {{decided to}} do this inept, cliche-infested film is anyone's guess". Peter Keough of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] " [...] may end up {{as one of the}} worst movies of 2015, but {{it is also one of}} the most entertaining". The Guardian writer Jordan Hoffman gave the film two stars, writing that [...] "it is bad, but it isn't THAT bad", and said: [...] "for a would-be cult [...] classic, this could have been much more". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times was {{critical}} of [...] The Boy Next Door, calling it [...] "breathless, uninspired (...) junk that feels like the iffiest bits of a Lifetime movie and late-night cable schlock slapped together", calling Guzman's character boring. Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt similarly wrote that the film was a [...] "few deliciously bonkers bons mots dot the Lifetime-grade dialogue", while calling its script [...] "too timid to fully dive into the high camp it hints at". Despite negative reviews, Lopez has received praise. Richard Lawson from Vanity Fair wrote: [...] "Given the material, Lopez is actually pretty darn good in [...] the movie, taking it seriously enough that it's not irksomely arch camp, but also plenty aware that she's not doing Shakespeare. She's <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> watch throughout." [...] Claudia Puig from USA Today stated that the movie was an improvement on her previous romantic comedies, calling Lopez [...] "believably powerful in moments of physical conflict".|$|E

Chicago Tribune journalist Maureen Ryan said that it was an [...] "intelligently made character drama". In his four star review, Adam Buckman of New York Post described it as [...] "stunning" [...] and suggested that Mad Men [...] "just happens to be the finest new TV series of the summer and possibly the entire year". Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle and Brian Lowry of Variety lauded the episode for its historical accuracy; [...] "Just because they're on the cusp of a new decade does not mean they can see what viewers already know is around the corner," [...] stated Goodman. [...] "That impending change gives an extra dimension of perspective to the series." [...] Lowry addressed that despite the subtle approach of Mad Men, it managed to provoke a profound meaning. [...] "In that context, the show illustrates that period's own form of excess without wagging fingers, while reminding us that before sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, there was sexual harassment, free-flowing cocktails and bluesy ballads, invariably sung by white guys." [...] USA Today writer Robert Bianco echoed synonymous sentiment: [...] "Mad Men is <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> watch—the clothes, the clocks, the furniture, it's like a mid-century night's dream. But this is no mere period piece. It's a smart, complex drama that attempts to get through the facades that have always hidden the truth." ...|$|E
