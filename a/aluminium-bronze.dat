25|$|The new markka coinage {{consisted}} initially of six denominations: 1 (bronze, later aluminium), 5 (bronze, later aluminium), 10 (<b>aluminium-bronze,</b> later aluminium), 20 and 50 penniä (<b>aluminium-bronze)</b> and 1 markka (silver, later cupro-nickel). From 1972, <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 5 markka {{were also}} issued.|$|E
25|$|A nickel 10-franc {{piece was}} issued in 1986, but was quickly {{withdrawn}} and demonetized due to confusion with the half-franc and an unpopular design. This {{led to the}} conception of the later bimetallic model. The <b>aluminium-bronze</b> pieces continued to circulate until the bimetallic pieces were developed and additional <b>aluminium-bronze</b> coins were minted to replace those initially withdrawn. Once the bimetallic coins were circulating and produced in necessary quantities, the <b>aluminium-bronze</b> pieces were gradually withdrawn and demonetized.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, zinc 50 para, 1, 2 and 5 dinara were introduced, {{followed}} in 1953 by aluminium coins {{for the same}} denominations. In 1955, <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 10, 20 and 50 dinara were added.|$|E
25|$|Between 1947 and 1952, {{coins in}} {{denominations}} of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 Groschen; and 1, 2, and 5 Schilling were introduced. The 2 and 50 Groschen; 1, 2, and 5 Schilling were struck in aluminium, {{as was the}} second type of 10 groschen coin. The 1 and 5 groschen and the first type of 10 groschen were in zinc, with the 20 groschen struck in <b>aluminium-bronze.</b> The 1 groschen was only struck in 1947, while the 20 groschen and 2 Schilling coins were suspended from production in 1954 and 1952, respectively. In 1957, silver 10 Schilling coins were introduced, followed in 1959 by <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 50 groschen and 1 Schilling, and in 1960 by silver 5 Schilling coins. Thus, the 5 Schilling coins went from an aluminium composition to a silver one, a highly unusual event made possible by the substantial improvement of the Austrian economy in the 1950s. Cupro-nickel replaced silver in the 5 and 10 Schilling coins in 1969 and 1974, respectively. An <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 20 Schilling coin was introduced in 1980.|$|E
25|$|On 11 February 1991, <b>aluminium-bronze</b> $1 and $2 coins were {{introduced}} to replace existing $1 and $2 notes. In 1999, Ian Rank-Broadley's portrait of the Queen was introduced and the legend rearranged to read NEW ZEALAND ELIZABETH II.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 200-lira coins were introduced, {{followed}} in 1982 by the bimetallic 500 lire. This {{was the first}} bi-metallic coin to be produced for circulation, minted using a system patented by IPZS. It {{was also the first}} to feature the value in braille.|$|E
25|$|With high {{inflation}} in the sixties, small denomination coins which {{were made of}} bronze, nickel-brass, cupro-nickel, and <b>aluminium-bronze</b> were gradually minted in Aluminium. This change commenced {{with the introduction of}} the new hexagonal 3 paise coin. A twenty paise coin was introduced in 1968 but did not gain much popularity.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, cupronickel 5 baht coins were introduced, {{switching}} to cupronickel-clad copper in 1977. Between 1986 and 1988, a new coinage was introduced, consisting of aluminium 1, 5, and 10 satang, <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 25 and 50 satang, cupronickel 1 baht, cupronickel-clad-copper 5 baht and bimetallic 10 baht. Cupronickel-clad-steel 2 baht {{were introduced in}} 2005.|$|E
25|$|All coins below 1 markka {{had ceased}} to be {{produced}} by 1948. In 1952, a new coinage was introduced, with smaller iron (later nickel-plated) 1- and 5=markka coins alongside <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 10-, 20- and 50-markka coins and (from 1956) silver 100- and 200-markka denominations. This coinage continued to be issued until {{the introduction of the}} new markka in 1963.|$|E
25|$|The Nationalists issued {{their first}} {{official}} coins in 1937. These were holed 25 céntimos featuring a rising sun and {{a clutch of}} arrows. These coins were minted in Vienna. A smaller copper 25 céntimos followed in 1938. Following {{the end of the}} Civil War in 1939, the victorious Nationalist government introduced aluminium 5 and 10 céntimos in 1940 featuring a conquistador, followed by reduced size <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 1-peseta coins in 1944 featuring the state crest and national symbols.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, {{the first}} coins were minted {{in the name}} of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. They were zinc 5 and 10 para and nickel-bronze 25 para. These were followed, in 1925, by nickel-bronze 50 para, 1 and 2 dinara. From 1931, coins were minted {{in the name of}} Yugoslavia, {{starting}} with silver 10 and 20 dinara, followed by silver 50 dinara in 1932. In 1938, <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 50 para, 1 and 2 dinara, nickel 10 dinara and reduced size, silver 20 and 50 dinara were introduced. These were the last coins issued before the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|When the markka was introduced, coins were minted in copper (1, 5 and 10 penniä), silver (25 and 50 penniä, 1 and 2 markkaa) {{and gold}} (10 and 20 markkaa). After the First World War, {{silver and gold}} issues were ceased and {{cupro-nickel}} 25 and 50 penniä and 1 markka coins were introduced in 1921, followed by <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 5, 10 and 20 markkaa between 1928 and 1931. During the Second World War, copper replaced cupro-nickel in the 25 and 50 penniä and 1 markka, followed by an issue of iron 10, 25 and 50 penniä and 1 markka. This period also saw the issue of holed 5 and 10 penniä coins.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{bronze and}} <b>aluminium-bronze</b> coins were {{replaced}} by zinc and aluminium, with the 2 Reichspfennig discontinued for potential of being too easily mistaken for the 10 Reichspfennig when being struck in the same metal. The 1, 2, and 5 Reichsmark coins were no longer issued, replaced instead by banknotes. Aluminium 50 Reichspfennig coins were reintroduced to replace the nickel versions. This time around they had a longer run, being produced from 1939 to 1944. Lower denominations were produced in zinc from 1940 onwards. Due to their composition, these coins had poor durability and {{are hard to find}} in very good condition. The last production of coins bearing the swastika was in 1944 (1, 5, 10, and 50 Reichspfennig) and 1945 (1 and 10 Reichspfennig only).|$|E
25|$|In 1941, {{a series}} of silver coins was {{introduced}} in denominations of 5, 10, and 20 satang, due to a shortage of nickel caused by World War II. The next year, tin coins were introduced for 1, 5, and 10 satang, followed by 20 satang in 1945 and 25 and 50 satang in 1946. In 1950, <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 5, 10, 25, and 50 satang were introduced whilst, in 1957, bronze 5 and 10 satang were issued, along with 1 baht coins struck in an unusual alloy of copper, nickel, silver, and zinc. Several Thai coins were issued for many years without changing the date. These include the tin 1942 1 satang and the 1950 5 and 10 satang, struck until 1973, the tin 1946 25 satang struck until 1964, the tin 50 satang struck until 1957, and the aluminium bronze 1957 5, 10, 25, and 50 satang struck until the 1970s. Cupronickel 1 baht coins were introduced in 1962 and struck without date change until 1982.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 {{the biggest}} changes came; {{the size of}} the 1-peseta coin was {{significantly}} reduced, however not discontinued (making it the smallest, lightest circulating coin in Western Europe and perhaps the world at that time). The 2-peseta coin was discontinued. Smaller aluminum-bronze 5 pesetas were introduced, and reduced <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 25 pesetas were also introduced which had a hole in the center. Smaller 50 peseta coins were also issued the same year in cupro-nickel with the distinct Spanish flower shape that would eventually be used by many countries, most notably the 20-cent coin of the euro. At the same time, the 200-peseta coin was made larger and included an identifiable edge with incuse lettering. In 1999, a laser-etched hologram was added to the 500-peseta coin as a security feature to help discourage counterfeiting. During this period, all coins except the 1 and 500 pesetas went through a commemorative redesign each year, in a similar vein to the U.S. State commemorative quarters program until their discontinuation in 2001 preceding the introduction of the euro common currency.|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, the new franc (...) was {{introduced}}, worth 100 old francs.

A number of commemorative coins were also issued by the Islamic State of Afghanistan between 1995 and 2001.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{accession}} of King Juan Carlos, {{there were}} a few changes. The replacement of Franco's portrait with that of Juan Carlos on the 50 céntimos and 1 peseta in 1975 and the addition of a cupro-nickel 100 pesetas in 1976. 10 céntimos were discontinued. However, more significant changes occurred to each coin in 1982. Following this redesign the 50 céntimos was discontinued, with aluminium replacing aluminum-bronze in the 1 peseta. A 2 pesetas coin was also introduced featuring a map of Spain, though this denomination never became popular. More importantly, nickel brass 100 pesetas were introduced. The redesign centered around the 1982 World Cup and depicted football (soccer) related themes on the 1, 5, 25, 50, and 100 pesetas. Shortly afterwords, the large cupro-nickel 100 pesetas by a smaller aluminim-bronze coin, which also replaced the 100 pesetas banknote. cupro-nickel 10 pesetas was introduced in 1983, a denomination that had previously not been issued for many decades.

2500|$|In 1946 coin {{production}} was resumed, although only in 1948, with the {{purchasing power of}} the lira reduced to 2% of that of 1939, did numbers minted exceed 1 million. To begin with, four denominations were issued in aluminium, 1, 2, 5 and 10 lire: these coins were in circulation together with the AM-lire {{and some of the}} old, devalued coins of the Italian Kingdom. In 1951, the government decided to replace all the circulating coins and bills with new smaller-sized aluminium 1, 2, 5 and 10 lire (although the 2-lira coin was not minted in 1951 or 1952) and in 1954–1955, Acmonital (stainless-steel) 50- and 100-lira coins were introduced, followed by <b>aluminium-bronze</b> 20-lira in 1957 and silver 500-lira in 1958. Increases in the silver bullion price led to the 500-lira coins being produced only in small numbers for collectors after 1967. The 500-lira (and later the 1,000-lira) also appeared in a number of commemorative coin issues, such as the centennial of Italian unification in 1961. Between 1967 and 1982, two types of [...] "paper money" [...] were issued with a value of 500 lire. These were not issued by [...] "Banca d'Italia", but directly by the government bearing the title [...] "Repubblica Italiana".|$|E
