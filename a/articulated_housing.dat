40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to discuss the ongoing trend of decline of social mobilizations on the housing issue in Milan, Italy. Our {{exploration}} starts from the observation {{of one of the}} paradoxical traits of the current situation: today, in Milan as in other large Italian urban areas, there is a growing and <b>articulated</b> <b>housing</b> need, increasingly diffused among different social classes (and especially among the most vulnerable groups - migrants, young people, unemployed - whose conditions has significantly worsened since the inception of the economic crisis in 2008). Against this background, however, it has become increasingly apparent that mobilization on housing issues has significantly weakened over the same period...|$|E

The holotype {{consists of a}} skull with fully occluded lower jaws, a complete vertebral column lacking the outer half of the tail, several neck and back ribs, some haemal arches, some gastralia, the pectoral girdle, both partially preserved humeri, a partial pelvic girdle, and both nearly complete hind-limbs including both femora, tibiae, fibulae, tarsals and feet. PVSJ 567 was found at Valle Pintado, Hoyada de Ischigualasto of the Ischigualasto Provincial Park, San Juan Province. It was collected from the Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation, of Ischigualasto-Villa Union Basin, dating to the late Carnian to earliest Norian stages of the middle Late Triassic.|$|R

Of course, other people, including viewers {{with access to the}} show, actually live their daily lives in those vacation paradises. The actors are presented as seeking an “authentic” experience away from the local population that is often tokenized and seen as static or invisible. In many instances, women and people of color who {{are a part of the}} visual landscape represent these places. This paper considers the ways the show frames mobility as entertainment, which ignores the politics of gender, race, and class that enables such mobility in the first place.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to provide a socio-historical and political framework for analysing two small government programs, the Victorian Rental Housing Co-operative Program and the Local Government and Community Housing Program, through which community housing principles were introduced into Australian public housing policy. The context for this research is the failure by the housing rights movement to continue with aims which were politically independent of the ALP, the descent of the movement into "tenure politics", the move to the Right by the ALP after the collapse of Keynesianism as an economic tool, and the possible privatisation of public housing by the Liberal Government through the use of housing vouchers. Links between these themes are postulated. A picture of these events and processes, and the ideologies and motivations of the individuals involved in the public housing policy communities both in Victoria and federally, has been built up through the examination and analysis of contemporary documentation, interviews with key informants and through secondary sources. The major conclusions postulate a relationship between the adoption of small community housing programs in the late 1970 s and 1980 s and the strategic co-option of the housing rights movement by the ALP, and the current inability of the movement to <b>articulate</b> a <b>housing</b> politics which transcends "tenure politics" {{at a time when the}} movement is most severely threatened...|$|R

The rounded forms were possibly influences of the German expressionist architect, Erich Mendelsohn. Rex Martienssen had visited his Schocken Store (1927), Stuttgart, in 1930 and was inspired by it. Eaton's mentor, Gordon Leith, was also attracted {{to the work of}} Mendelsohn – see Leith's Queen Victoria Maternity Hospital (1943) in Johannesburg.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to <b>articulate</b> the <b>housing</b> affordability problem faced by millions of middle income earners in Malaysia. Although the media has highlighted this issue in recent times, no empirical {{research was}} conducted to prove such claim. Hence, one {{of the purposes of}} this study is to investigate this matter by looking at households’ income and expenditure, as well as the recent house price index. Besides that, this study will also review the recent government proposal –“My First Home Scheme”, which was designed to curb the housing affordability issue. The findings of this study suggest that middle income earners are faced with housing affordability problem, especially those living in urban areas as property prices increase more rapidly than households’ income. Apart from that, the scheme proposed by the government does not provide any relief to the present situation due to its stringent requirements. Nevertheless, the subsequent scheme by the ministry – “ 1 Malaysia Housing Project” (PR 1 MA) is perceived to be more relevant and effective by some of the nation’s property developers. This paper will open up a new area of study as previous studies about housing affordability in Malaysia only emphasized on providing low cost housing to the poor. As Malaysia continues to develop robustly, the population in the middle income segments will increase significantly. Hence, future studies pertaining to housing affordability should focus more on this section of the population...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} success of mixed-income housing {{in the context of}} a for-profit {{development}} in New Haven, Connecticut. It takes as its sample the development and the tenants of The Residences at Ninth Square, a mixed-use, mixed-income apartment complex located in the center of the historic city. The early parts of the paper (Parts II-III) tell the story of the neighborhood and contextualize the study in the geography and the history of New Haven, Connecticut. Part IV describes the development in detail. Part V looks to the expectations and commitments undertaken by the developers of The Residences. Part VI recounts the threats of failure voiced by contemporary critics. Part VII evaluates {{the success of}} the project in meeting those expectations and avoiding those threatened pitfalls by considering the success of the development, both financially, and as a form of urban revitalization. Part VIII evaluates the success of the project as a mixed-income development. It looks to the purposes of mixed-income <b>housing,</b> <b>articulates</b> the need for social interaction among tenants to achieve those purposes, and empirically examines the content and relation of those social interactions...|$|R
40|$|Bon Aire is a Federal-style {{dwelling}} dramatically sited {{on a hill}} {{overlooking the}} James River. Built ca. 1812 the original three-part scheme remains strongly <b>articulated,</b> although the <b>house</b> has sustained significant alterations. In plan and detail Bon Aire is linked {{to a number of}} tripartite houses, such as Point of Honor in Lynchburg, built for a cousin of Bon Aire's builder. Palladian in plan, Bon Aire is composed of a two-story, three-bay center section flanked by 1 - 1 / 2 -story, two-bay wings. The brick walls of the original house and the small western addition are laid in Flemish bond. Glazing is still visible on many headers. Treated as a classical temple motif, the pedimented center block of this three-part ensemble is capped by a pedimented gable roof covered with slate. The tympanum contains a lunette, and the pediment cornices are ornamented with thin, round-butt modillions. Tall windows, 9 / 9 on the first story, 6 / 9 on the second story, light the first- and second-story hallways. Crudely pointed jack arches over the first-floor windows indicate that they were stuccoed and resembled the corresponding windows of the rear (north) elevation, which have stuccoed arches. The recessed double-door openings at each level are flanked by pilasters. Severa...|$|R
40|$|In {{partnership}} with Metris UK we present the modelling {{and development of}} a revolutionary Robot Coordinate-measuring Arm (RCA). The RCA combines the automation capability of traditional Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM) methods with the mobility and part accessibility of an articulated arm, resulting in a versatile and powerful tool for coordinate measuring applications with a target accuracy of sub- 100 µm. The RCA exploits novel, patented technology to accelerate repetitive 3 D inspection jobs. A highly accurate 7 -axis <b>articulated</b> arm is <b>housed</b> within a robotized exoskeleton driven by electromotors. We utilise Denavit-Hartenberg parameters to model the robot links and investigate the accessible configurations of the exoskeleton under the effects of arbitrary offsets and twists. We further examine the configuration space of a 2 -axis version of the system, its singular points and the singularities of the mapping to the space of controls. We demonstrate the compliance of the RCA to accepted engineering standards and discuss improvements in the calibration and error-correction of the unit, which have reduced residuals {{by a factor of}} two. We identify singular poses as a large cause of uncertainty and propose solutions to circumvent them. This work is supported by the UK Technology Strategy Board under the EPSRC-managed scheme “Gathering Data in Complex Environments”. ...|$|R
40|$|The recent House of Lords {{decision}} in Quintavalle v Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has raised difficult and complex issues regarding {{the extent to}} which embryo selection and reproductive technology {{can be used as a}} means of rectifying genetic disorders and treating critically ill children. This comment outlines the facts of Quintavalle and explores how the House of Lords approached the legal, ethical and policy issues that arose out of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority 2 ̆ 7 s (UK) decision to allow reproductive and embryo technology to be used to produce a 2 ̆ 7 saviour sibling 2 ̆ 7 whose tissue could be used to save the life of a critically ill child. Particular attention will be given to the implications of the {{decision in}} Quintavalle for Australian family and medical law and policy. As part of this focus, the comment explores the current Australian legislative and policy framework regarding the use of genetic and reproductive technology as a mechanism through which to assist critically ill siblings. It is argued that the present Australian framework would appear to impose significant limits on the medical uses of genetic technology and, in this context, would seem to reflect many of the principles that were <b>articulated</b> by the <b>House</b> of Lords in Quintavalle...|$|R
40|$|A federal False Claims Act {{action against}} Westchester County, New York {{launched}} a unique effort to explore whether zoning, subsidies, and advocacy could significantly Increase {{the percentage of}} minorities living in largely white communities. A Voluntary Cooperation Agreement entered into by Marin County, California raises a similar question. This article describes the legal background of the lawsuit brought against Westchester County, the Settlement Agreement that arose from it, and the attempt by Westchester County {{to carry out its}} obligations to affirmatively further fair housing. It traces the evolution of exclusionary zoning law in New York State courts, contrasts it to statutory approaches in New Jersey and Connecticut, and reviews the tepid efforts of the New York State legislature to tackle the problem of <b>articulating</b> the affordable <b>housing</b> obligations of local governments. The authors detail the progress made in Westchester County and explain their own initiative to use training, education, and technical assistance to further the efforts by communities to provide fair and affordable housing. The article also explains the significance of the implementation of the Settlement Agreement and that while Westchester County will probably meet most of the literal terms of the Settlement, the goal of achieving significant racial integration in largely white census tracts, and all the benefits of diversity that integration achieves, remains elusive. Finally, it considers what can be done at the state level to achieve integration goals, while still pursuing other state policies regarding smart growth, climate change mitigation, energy conservation, and housing equity in densely settled urban areas...|$|R
5000|$|The Munich Agreement, a {{diplomatic}} act of appeasement to the territorial demands of Hitler’s Germany, led Winston Churchill to <b>articulate</b> to the <b>House</b> of Commons how Britain’s display of weakness had upset {{the balance of}} continental power. In an effort to avoid war with Germany, the allies gave the Sudetenland, a large German part of Czechoslovakia, to Hitler’s growing Nazi empire. Churchill described the disastrous {{chain of events that}} would soon arise from the Prime Minister’s choice to acquiesce to Hitler’s demands and gave his recommendation of how to deal with a growingly belligerent German state. Churchill announced that The Munich Agreement had restructured the political landscape and history of Europe, forever altering the continent without a single drop of blood being shed. He went further, saying the fate of Czechoslovakia was the worst possible outcome and that Czech ties to the West and the League of Nations were the main cause of Czechoslovakia’s downfall. Churchill suggested, “Between submission and immediate war there was this third alternative, which gave a hope not only of peace but of justice.” The orator made the observation that the system of alliance that had allowed France to maintain a balance of power was gone. The consequences of The Munich Agreement meant that the smaller nations of Europe had to answer to Germany, which now had access and influence deep into the east. Already, Churchill saw the lands of Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia as future victims of German conquests. Churchill’s speech was a wake-up call to British parliament, a passive group led by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Churchill argued that the Prime Minister’s approval of the Munich Agreement came out of a powerful desire to avoid another worldwide conflagration. Using Wilsonian language, Churchill argues “liberal and democratic” nations must defend the principle of self-determination from being perverted by totalitarian governments. Churchill saw The Munich Agreement as a culmination of five years of retreat from global responsibility and believed that Great Britain and France would pay the price. Churchill believed Germany would soon demand more democratic land and the Allies would need to reverse their strategy of appeasement against Germany. With German rapidly rearming and Russia out of European balance of power, Churchill predicted that Hitler would next turn towards Western Europe in search of land and resources. While Prime Minister Chamberlain believed Czechoslovakia would face the consequences of The Munich Agreement, Churchill argued that Britain and France would be the countries to feel the aftermath. Early in his speech, Churchill declared, “I have always held the view that the maintenance of peace depends upon the accumulation of deterrents against the aggressor…”. [...] Churchill said it was time to claim air superiority and create a system of alliances against Germany while building up the entire British military, suggestions that had been made in vain until after the Munich Crisis. Churchill’s militant-desires are systemic from his disapproval of The Munich Agreement, claiming Britain’s act of appeasement would start an unending desire for more land from Germany.|$|R
