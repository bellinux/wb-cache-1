2500|$|The War Finance Committee {{was placed}} in charge of supervising the sale of all bonds, and the War Advertising Council {{promoted}} voluntary compliance with bond buying. Popular contemporary art was used to help promote the bonds such as the Warner Brothers theatrical cartoon, Any Bonds Today?. More {{than a quarter of}} a billion dollars' worth of advertising was donated during the first three years of the National Defense Savings Program. The government appealed to the public through popular culture. Norman Rockwell's painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort that raised $. Bond rallies were held throughout the country with famous celebrities, usually Hollywood film stars, to enhance the bond <b>advertising</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> Many motion pictures during the time, especially war dramas (a form of propaganda itself), included a graphic shown during the closing credits advising patrons to 'Buy War Bonds and Stamps', which were sometimes sold in the lobby of the theater.

Over the course of the war 85 million Americans purchased bonds totalling approximately $.|$|E
2500|$|Personal {{income was}} {{at an all-time high}}, and more dollars were chasing fewer goods to purchase. This was a recipe for {{economic}} disaster that was largely avoided because Americans—cajoled daily by their government to do so—were also saving money at an all-time high rate, mostly in War Bonds but also in private savings accounts and insurance policies. Consumer saving was strongly encouraged through investment in war bonds that would mature after the war. Most workers had an automatic payroll deduction; children collected savings stamps until they had enough to buy a bond. Bond rallies were held throughout the U.S. with famous celebrities, usually Hollywood film stars, to enhance the bond <b>advertising</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> Several stars were responsible for personal appearance tours that netted multiple millions of dollars in bond pledges—an astonishing amount in 1943. The public paid ¾ of the face value of a war bond, and received the full face value back after a set number of years. This shifted their consumption from the war to postwar, and allowed over 40% of GDP to go to military spending, with moderate inflation. Americans were challenged to put [...] "at least 10% of every paycheck into Bonds". Compliance was very high, with entire factories of workers earning a special [...] "Minuteman" [...] flag to fly over their plant if all workers belonged to the [...] "Ten Percent Club". There were seven major War Loan drives, all of which exceeded their goals.|$|E

40|$|Although {{raw milk}} is {{essentially}} a homoge-neous input {{in the production of}} fluid milk and manufactured dairy products, in many countries the price received for fluid milk usage is higher than the price received for manufactured prod-uct usage. Such differences indicate that prices are not competitively determined. This cer-tainly is the case in the United States, where federal and state milk marketing order pro-grams establish minimum Class I price differentials (premiums) for most milk mar-keted. There are also over-order fluid premium payments resulting from negotiations between cooperatives and fluid processors. Changes in milk advertising expenditures should produce changes in milk prices as well as in milk demand. Thus, an <b>advertising</b> program's <b>effectiveness</b> should account for changes in both price and quantity; each should be treated as endogenous. Most studies of U.

The findings of the studies, employing different language slogans for different products, lend support to these expectations. Thus, FLs in <b>advertising</b> derive their <b>effectiveness</b> from the COO effect, and practitioners can use them to benefit from this effect...|$|R
