40|$|There is an {{important}} <b>pioneer</b> vegetation <b>formation</b> along the Xingu River {{in the area where}} the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam is being constructed that is highly adapted to a seasonally fluctuating water levels. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the habitat and flora of the <b>pioneer</b> <b>formations</b> in the Belo Monte area. The area was divided in three sections for study purposes (Reservoir, Low Flow, and Control) that were expected to experience different degrees of impact from the dam project. The calculations of habitat losses were based on satellite imagery classifications, and a total of 111 plots were established in the three areas for vegetation sampling. Habitat losses of the <b>pioneer</b> <b>formations</b> will total 89. 7 % when the project is fully functional. Forty-five of the 72 recorded species are restricted to single areas. Species richness and diversity were significantly lower in the control area. The completion of the Belo Monte reservoir will result in habitat reductions and will consequently reduce the richness and diversity of <b>pioneer</b> <b>formations.</b> Studies suggest monitoring the populations located in the reduced flow area to determine possible impacts resulting from changes in the regional hydrological cycle caused by the Xingu River dam...|$|R
25|$|The 4th Ersatz Division {{was formed}} on {{mobilization}} from 13 brigade replacement battalions (Brigade-Ersatz-Bataillone).

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relative}} proportion of sexual vs. clonal reproduction in 20 {{populations of the}} <b>alpine</b> <b>pioneer</b> plant Geum reptans in response to altitude (low and high) and succession (early and late). Additionally, the proportion of life-cycle stages, the proportion of reproducing adults, seed size, and seed number per flower head were determined. With increasing plant size, the probability of producing both flower heads and stolons increased (P > 0. 001). Individuals of all size classes tended to produce more flower heads than stolons. Stolon production was more frequent only if plants reproduced by one reproductive mode (P > 0. 05). The significant difference among populations in sexual reproduction and of seed number per flower head was not explained by habitat type. However, clonal reproduction was higher in populations at low and high altitude compared to populations at intermediate altitude (P > 0. 05). High altitude populations were characterised by a tendency of small plants to decline {{and an increase in}} the proportion of large plants (P > 0. 05) whereas the proportion of reproducing adults did not change with altitude. This indicates not only lower recruitment but also, that after successful establishment, growth and reproduction in G. reptans are not generally restricted, even above 2850 m. Our results suggest that variation in the proportion of sexual and clonal reproduction in G. reptans is probably more shaped by individual, i. e. plastic responses to local environmental conditions than by environmental gradients...|$|R
