5|$|Born François-Marie Arouet, Voltaire (1694–1778), by {{the time}} of the Lisbon earthquake, was already a {{well-established}} author, known for his satirical wit. He had been made a member of the Académie Française in 1746. He was a deist, a strong proponent of religious freedom, and a critic of tyrannical governments. Candide became part of his large, diverse body of philosophical, political and artistic works expressing these views. More specifically, it was <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century novels called the contes philosophiques. This genre, of which Voltaire was one of the founders, included previous works of his such as Zadig and Micromegas.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, {{construction}} resumed on roadways throughout Ontario. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa {{was completed}} in December 1947, while other sections languished. The Toronto–Barrie Highway was {{the primary focus of}} the Department of Highways at the time, and the onset of the Korean War in 1950 stalled construction again. Despite the delays, highway minister George Doucett officially announced the plans for construction of the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving as <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> design. Work on the most important link, the Toronto Bypass, began in 1951, but it would not open with that name.|$|E
5|$|Here {{we can see}} how {{important}} the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry as <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked {{a model for a}} logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.|$|E
5|$|Important for the {{adoption}} of the style {{in the early nineteenth century}} was Abbotsford House, the residence the novelist and poet, Sir Walter Scott. Re-built for him from 1816, it became <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> modern revival of the baronial style. Common features borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations. The style was popular across Scotland and was applied to many relatively modest dwellings by architects such as William Burn (1789–1870), David Bryce (1803–76), Edward Blore (1787–1879), Edward Calvert (c. 1847–1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864–1929) and in urban contexts, including the building of Cockburn Street in Edinburgh (from the 1850s) as well as the National Wallace Monument at Stirling (1859–69). The rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace and its adoption as a royal retreat from 1855–8 confirmed the popularity of the style.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} two {{decades of the twentieth}} century the Indiana Anti-Saloon League (IASL), formed in 1898 as a state {{auxiliary}} of the national Anti-Saloon League, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union successfully organized pressure on Indiana politicians, especially members of the Republican party, to support the dry cause. The IASL, although not the first organization to take up the dry crusade in Indiana, became a key force behind efforts at attaining passage of statewide prohibition in early 1917, and rallied state support for ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1919. The IASL's success, under the leadership of Edward S. Shumaker, an ordained Methodist minister, made it <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> League's other state organizations. Shumaker made clear to politicians he did not care whether they drank, but insisted they vote for dry laws or face defeated in the next election by dry voters.|$|E
5|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{is one of}} {{only two}} films {{directed}} by Asif; one of his unfinished projects was released posthumously as a tribute. Over time the title has become part of Bollywood vernacular, used to describe a project that is taking too long to complete. Art director Omung Kumar, who has designed sets for major Indian films such as Black (2005) and Saawariya (2007), said that he and others in his field look to Mughal-e-Azam as a source of inspiration for art direction. It has also been used as <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> perfect love story, requiring directors to ensure lovers overcome obstacles. Following her success in the film, Madhubala could have gone on to land further major roles, but she was advised not to overwork owing to her heart condition, and had to withdraw from some productions that were already underway.|$|E
5|$|The first XFR-1 {{made its}} first flight on 25 June 1944 without its jet engine, but that was {{installed}} shortly afterward. The second prototype first flew on 20 September 1944. Test flights confirmed wind tunnel tests that revealed a lack of longitudinal stability because {{the center of gravity}} had been miscalculated. In addition, the circular rear fuselage of the FR-1 gave less stability than the slab-style fuselage of the Grumman F4F Wildcat that was used as <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stability calculations. A new tail with enlarged vertical and horizontal stabilizers was designed and retrofitted to the prototypes. The original Douglas double-slotted flaps proved to be unsatisfactory during flight testing, but all three prototypes and the first 14 production aircraft were built with them before they were replaced with a single-slotted flap.|$|E

5|$|The {{reign of}} PedroII thus {{came to an}} unusual end—he was overthrown while highly {{regarded}} by the people and {{at the pinnacle of}} his popularity, and some of his accomplishments were soon brought to naught as Brazil slipped into a long period of weak governments, dictatorships, and constitutional and economic crises. The men who had exiled him soon began to see in him <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian republic. A few decades after his death, his reputation was restored and his remains were returned to Brazil with celebrations nationwide. Historians have regarded the Emperor in an extremely positive light and several have ranked him as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{from the}} Japanese sleeper ray is strong but not {{life-threatening}} to humans.

5|$|As a builder, Hugh {{built the}} New Bridge, now Elvet Bridge, in Durham, the second stone {{bridge in the}} town. Hugh also oversaw work on Durham Cathedral, decorating the inside with marble, {{installing}} stained glass windows, putting in a shrine for the bones of Bede, and building the Galilee Chapel on {{the west end of}} the cathedral. Originally, Puiset had planned to put in a Lady Chapel {{on the east side of}} the cathedral, but the ground was unsuitable, and instead work began on the Galilee Chapel on the west side of the cathedral. The Galilee Chapel is unusual in that it has five aisles, and quatrefoil, or four lobed, piers. <b>A</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chapel may have been the work being done on York Minster in rebuilding the choir. The current Norman doorway and the gallery that is above the doorway in Durham Castle were also the work of Hugh, which was part of a hall built in the bailey of the castle. Along with the king of Scots, he built the first bridge over the River Tweed at Berwick. He also rebuilt Norham Castle, replacing the previous buildings built by Ranulf Flambard, an earlier bishop, with a stone castle.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, Rommel {{received}} a promotion from Hitler {{to the rank}} of Generalmajor ahead of more senior officers. Showalter notes that even at this early stage, Hitler already regarded Rommel as <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fusion of Germany's new and old orders. With an intervention by Hitler, Rommel was subsequently able to obtain command of an armoured (Panzer) division despite having been turned down by the army's personnel office, which had offered him command of a mountain division. Rommel's unprofessional conduct was noted by his fellow officers and added to his growing reputation as one of Hitler's favoured commanders. After the Fall of France, Rommel sent to him a specially prepared diary on the 7th Division, Rommel {{received a}} letter of thanks. Unknown to Rommel though, Hitler had barely looked at his diary and the letter was written by an adjutant. Remy remarks that by this time, Hitler still did not treat Rommel as a significantly important person.|$|E
5|$|In August 1940, a British mission, led by Tizard {{and with}} members that {{included}} Cockcroft, {{was sent to}} America to create relations and help advance the research towards war technology with the Americans. Several military technologies were shared, including advances in radar, antisubmarine warfare, aeronautical engineering and explosives. The American radar programme in particular was reinvigorated with an added impetus {{to the development of}} microwave radar and proximity fuses. This prompted the Americans to create the MIT Radiation Laboratory, which would later serve <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Los Alamos Laboratory. The mission did not spend much time on nuclear fission, with only two meetings of the subject, mainly about uranium enrichment. In particular, Cockcroft did not report Peierls' and Frisch's findings. Nonetheless, there were important repercussions. A barrier had been broken and a pathway to exchange technical information between the two countries was developed. Moreover, the notion of civilian scientists playing an important role of the development of military technologies was strengthened {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|In the {{entertainment}} sector various ploys {{were used to}} attract tourists. In 1920 an annual beauty contest, named the Pageant of Pulchritude (also known as the Miss Universe contest) in 1926, was started in Galveston by C.E. Barfield, manager of a local amusement park owned by the Maceos. The contest was part of Splash Day, the kick-off of the summer tourist season each year, {{and became the first}} international beauty contest, attracting participants from England, Russia, Turkey, and many other nations until its demise in 1932. This contest is said to have served as <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> modern Miss America pageant and others. At its height the pageant tripled the island's population the weekend it ran. Even after the international contest's closing, Splash Day was revived in various forms and continued to attract tourists. Other annual events included an extravagant Mardi Gras celebration in spring. The grand Buccaneer Hotel was constructed in 1929 creating an additional hotel landmark to compete with the Galvez (in addition to many other smaller hotel venues).|$|E
