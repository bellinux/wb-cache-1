Although everyone is trying to push in a particular direction, there are no real organised teams. The Sway makes very slow progress, as it snakes around, stopping quite often when it collapses, in order to pull bodies out, that became crushed into the mud.

25|$|On 1 April 1978, {{he started}} an ambitious tour of SFR Yugoslavia with Lokice dance group {{in support of}} the album that had already sold 150,000 copies. Čolić also started to play the guitar {{occasionally}} on stage. Putujući zemljotres (Traveling Earthquake Tour) produced and organized by Maksa Ćatović moved all over the country, soon becoming a phenomenon the likes of which the country had not seen before. The scenes of screaming girls rushing the stage were repeated in city after city. The tour's climax took place in Belgrade at Red Star FC stadium on 5 September 1978 with 70,000 people in attendance despite the fact that Čolić already played two sold out shows in Belgrade a few months earlier on 4 and 8 April at Hala Pionir. Supporting Čolić on stage that night were Chris Nicholls on keyboards and Dado Topić on bass guitar with old favourites Kornelije Kovač, Arsen Dedić, Kemal Monteno, Josip Boček, Trio Strune and RTV Belgrade singing quintet appearing as guests. Čolić and the massive tour essentially became a cultural phenomenon transcending musical boundaries such that in the lead up to the big Belgrade concert journalist Dušan Savković and film director Jovan Ristić decided to make a movie about Čolić. Savković wrote a rudimentary screenplay, but the movie ended up being a 90-minute feature documentary titled Pjevam danju, pjevam noću that follows Čolić from Belgrade concert onwards and looks back on his career up to that point. Two days after the Belgrade concert, Čolić was in his hometown Sarajevo at Koševo Stadium for the tour's grand finale, however the rain interrupted much of the concert <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> {{turned out to be a}} little anticlimactic. By the end of its promotion cycle, the album sold more than 700,000 copies and with later re-releases during the 1990s went over the million mark.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of release, both Record Mirror and NME gave the album four stars out of five. Record Mirror commented that [...] "he {{psychedelic}} image of the group really comes to life, record wise, on this LP which is a fine showcase for both their talent and the recording technique. Plenty of mind blowing sound, both blatant and subtle here, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> is extremely well performed." [...] Cash Box called it [...] "a particularly striking collection of driving, up-to-date rock ventures". Paul McCartney and Pink Floyd's past producer Joe Boyd both rated the album highly. Some voiced {{the opinion of the}} underground fans, by suggesting that the album did not reflect the band's live performances.|$|E
500|$|M-10 {{was built}} in {{segments}} through the late 1950s and early 1960s. It carried several different names before the entire route was finally officially named the John C.

The southern segment was part of US Highway12 (US12) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> was later renumbered Business Spur Interstate 696 (BS I-696). From 1970 until 1986, {{it was part of}} US10, and the freeway has been M-10 since. The non-freeway segment that runs between I-696 in Southfield and Orchard Lake Road was previously numbered M-4.

Fraser wrote to Rossi on May 18, deprecating the designs, [...] "the bear is entirely too short, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> inexperienced and amateurish." [...] He recommended that Chester Beach (credited with {{the design of the}} 1923 Monroe Doctrine coin) or Robert I. Aitken (who had created the 1915 Panama-Pacific $50 pieces) be hired, as both were from California and might create [...] "something which would be far more interesting and with a bigger sense of what California really is".|$|E
500|$|By 1994, Ice {{received}} less publicity and became {{removed from the}} public spotlight. After becoming more interested with the Rastafari movement, Ice became a vegetarian, grew dreadlocks and talked more openly about smoking cannabis. On March 22, 1994, Ice released his second studio album, Mind Blowin'. Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album [...] "more clunky than funky".|accessdate=March 7, 2009|last=Bernard|first=James|date=March 25, 1994|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}} Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song [...] "Get Loose" [...] as [...] "snappy", writing that although the lyrics are [...] "inane", [...] "the song is a thumping party, {{one of the few}} places where Ice loosens up. He sounds solid at the beginning of 'The Wrath' as well ... In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics." [...] Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] "There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> is rather embarrassing." [...] Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Ice's cannabis-oriented lyrics: [...] "That's all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people." [...] When asked about the drug oriented sound years later, Vanilla Ice said [...] "A lot of the record is drug oriented because I was doing a lot of drugs at the time". Shortly afterward, SBK went bankrupt.|$|E
500|$|... "It's You" [...] {{was highly}} {{received}} by several music critics. Tim Sendra of AllMusic picked the track {{as one of}} the album's highlights, noting that [...] "his soaring falsetto on 'iT's YoU' is breathtaking." [...] Zach Frydenlund of Complex called it an emotional ballad that [...] "showcas his tremendous vocal abilities, which weren't on display like this previously." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent was also complimentary of his vocals and selected it {{as one of the}} tracks to download, writing that [...] "the drawn-out, melismatic title hook of 'It’s You' soars over the organ drone and piano." [...] Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine praised the [...] "Malik's surprisingly mournful vocals on the haunting" [...] song. Amy Davidson, writing for Digital Spy, named it [...] "a slice of slick R," [...] observing that [...] "the stripped back production lets his airy falsetto come through nicely, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> sits as perfectly stylised as his glorious quiff." [...] Lewis Corner of the same publication opined that, [...] "It's the most vulnerable Zayn sounds on the entire record, while his spire-scaling 'oooohs' are poignantly doleful." [...] Kate Solomon of Drowned in Sound was also positive to what she called [...] "his dreamy falsetto underpinned by a melancholy organ line and coupled madly with Top Gun guitars and Disney film strings." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described it as [...] "an elegant whisper of a love song, part mellow soul burner and part post-Coldplay melancholia." ...|$|E

500|$|Eckhart's {{next project}} was Thank You for Smoking, {{in which he}} played Nick Naylor, a tobacco {{lobbyist}} whose firm researched the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer. Eckhart said that he felt challenged playing the role: [...] "You have to say these words that are crazy, and yet {{do it with a}} smile on your face and have the audience like you. At one point, I'm doing a talk show with a kid who's dying of cancer, and he's going through chemotherapy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing,</b> and I spin it so the anti-smoking people are the bad guys and I'm the good guy, and I'm this guy's best friend. I mean, it's whacked out." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 30th annual Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. It had a limited release in March 2006 and was released worldwide the following month. For his performance, Eckhart received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. A contributor of USA Today wrote that he gave a [...] "standout, whip-smart performance" [...] citing that as Nick Naylor he kept him [...] "likable even in his cynicism." [...] In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer review of the film, it was reported that [...] "Under his chummy but compassionless smile" [...] Eckhart radiated charm and [...] "Naylor's true joys: manipulating arguments, steering debate, cooking words." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club said {{that most of}} [...] "Aubrey" [...] was [...] "fun", {{although}} Tillman was not [...] "particularly interesting". He stated that things got [...] "dicey" [...] for him around the revelation about Thibedeaux's child {{and that he did}} not buy Mulder's genetic impulse theories. He criticised the ending, writing that it [...] " [...] whatever mood and character development the previous thirty had spent establishing for cheesy theatrics, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> lands with a resounding thud. There are too many problems with the concept; the nature/nurture debate {{has been going on for}} decades, and this ep throws the whole thing out the window in about two minutes. No other cause for BJ's actions is ever given... That's some lazy writing right there." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com gave the episode a mixed review and wrote that it was [...] "sort of good [...] sort of a terrible idea". She cited the theme of [...] "breaking the cycle of abuse" [...] as a plus for the entry, noting that it was a [...] "revenge story [...] a woman righting the wrongs of her male ancestors and breaking the cycle of violence outside the family". However, Deans was critical of various elements of the episode, most notably, the genetic theory conceit and the idea of a [...] "activator baby" [...] that caused Morrow's past ancestors to work through her.|$|E
500|$|Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD (now part of Mania.com) gave {{positive}} reviews {{to the two}} New Cutey Honey Collections {{released in}} 2000 by ADV; he [...] "was really impressed with the production values of this show" [...] and called it [...] "quite a bit of fun, especially for those looking for fan-service with a bit more intelligence and style {{than some of the}} other offerings out there". [...] Two reviews of Honey on the website Anime Jump greatly diverged: site maintainer Mike Toole rated the series 3.5 out of 5 stars and called it [...] "tons of fun, a light, tasty action-comedy that's... spirited and silly and tongue-in-cheek", and praised its character designs as [...] "letter-perfect to Go Nagai's original (quite appealing!) character designs"; Jason Carter praised Calvello's voice work in his review of the 2004 ADV release, but rated it 1.5 out of 5 stars, said that much of Cosplay City [...] "goes back and forth between looking like an ordinary modern metropolis and resembling some sort of Smurf town built of polluted marshmallows", and concluded [...] "The characters are largely annoying, the plot is , the nudity is absurd, the fighting is rarely more than average, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> is ultimately pointless - as the series' later attempts at developing Honey as a person make all too clear." [...] Sandra Dozier of DVD Verdict was also unimpressed with Honey: [...] "I can see why it is popular—the glossy animation, the well-endowed chicks, the scant clothing. If that isn't your thing, however, there is very little to draw you to this series." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Robert Hales and choreographed by Gil Duldulao. It premiered on 20/20 on November 20, 2009. Nick Levine from Digital Spy commented: [...] "There's lots of dancing, Janet looks fantastic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> as slick as a classic Jam & Lewis groove. In short? A thoroughly enjoyable way {{to spend the next}} three-and-a-half-minutes. Right, back to 'Escapade' for us". Jefferson Reid and Lindsay Miller of E!

500|$|Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter {{praised the}} film, saying, [...] "It sounds kooky on paper {{but on the}} screen cowboys and aliens make beautiful, fun music together." [...] Honeycutt felt {{that the success of}} the film's blend of aliens and western themes was due to [...] "the {{determination}} by everyone involved to play the damn thing straight. Even the slightest goofiness, the tiniest touch of camp, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> would blow sky high. But it doesn't." [...] He criticized the aliens, which he said [...] "don't rate as characters", existing as [...] "moving blobs you shoot at in a video game." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge echoed Honeycutt's sentiments that the [...] "potential hamminess" [...] of the premise is offset by the cast, particularly Craig through a [...] "mix of ruthlessness and sensitivity." [...] He considered however, that Wilde had the opposite effect, stating she [...] "appears out of place among her grizzled co-stars". Debruge appreciated the attention paid to the roots of the two genres, saying [...] "beneath all the state-of-the-art special effects beats an old-fashioned heart, one that prizes both of the genres in play" [...] and concluded that [...] "a canny blend of CG and practical effects serve the sci-fi elements well, while location shooting and Mary Zophres' form-fitting period duds make the West look its best." [...] Nick Pinkerton of The Village Voice said the Western elements of the film were [...] "lovingly" [...] handled but called felt the science aspects a [...] "gimmick" [...] and [...] "much more standard fare" [...] in comparison. He added that [...] "Ford, enlivened by dude garb, seems to enjoy himself {{in front of a camera}} for the first time in decades".|$|E
500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide praised [...] "David Schwimmer for {{throwing}} himself into this role" [...] as Jared, [...] "this rather unlikable lout." [...] Webb Mitovich also wrote that [...] " [...] party {{in and of}} itself has to be one of 30 Rocks finest and most manic moments." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that [...] " [...] Schwimmer was good as Greenzo" [...] and that [...] "the subplots were some of the most bizarre this season." [...] Robert Canning of IGN thought that the [...] "cameo from Al Gore {{at the end of the}} show added little to the episode. It was a fine bit, but it wasn't helped by the fact that nearly the entire scene had already aired in the promos leading up to the episode" [...] and that [...] "seeing [...] desperately take on the role of Greenzo and then get carried away with the whole concept could have been hysterically self-referential [...] Instead we got Jerrod as Greenzo <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> just felt flat and forced." [...] Canning rated the episode [...] "8 out of 10" [...] Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Rob Owen also felt that Al Gore's appearance had been [...] "already given away in [...] promos". He praised the episode's dialogue, saying that Baldwin's line, [...] "you could put on a silly hat and tell the kids how outsourcing means cheaper toys for Christmas" [...] was the sort of dialogue that [...] "makes 30 Rock rock. Hard." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that this episode [...] "was one of the best of season 2" [...] and that [...] "Schwimmer's performance reminded [...] of his most bizarre episodes as Friends Ross Geller, like 'The One With Ross's Sandwich'." [...] The episode of Friends referred to includes Schwimmer's character, Ross, shouting at his boss for eating his special Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.|$|E
500|$|Television critics reacted mostly {{positive}} {{toward the}} episode, calling the storyline [...] "heartfelt." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded and followed the show, respectively, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I spent the entire time expecting the rug to be pulled out <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> revealed to be Seth MacFarlane just trying to manipulate my emotions." [...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think {{it may have been}} a little bit too far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we will do for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change." [...] Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sarah Chatfield, who {{wanted to do a}} Tom and Jerry-like video, where the human character is cut off at the waist. Hence Allen {{was not going to be}} part of it originally. However, she did appear on the video. The singer declared on her official blog that, I did a video shoot for the next single, which is Alfie, and that was quite a lot of fun, Alfie was played by a puppet <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> looks like an episode of a mixture Tom and Jerry and Roger Rabbit, you'll understand when you see it. The whole day was a pleasurable experience [...] The video starts off with an opening title parodying Looney Tunes and shows Allen in the kitchen preparing a cup of tea, while Alfie, impersonated by a puppet, smokes in his miniature bedroom, watching television. The singer enters the room and takes away his bong, as he unsuccessfully tries to get it back. Next, Allen irons his tuxedo and marks a job announcement called [...] "The Puppet Show" [...] in the newspaper, as the lyric [...] "You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid" [...] is sung. Meanwhile, Alfie is in his bed, staring at a magazine in which there are undressed dolls, titled [...] "Roxy & Babs get it on!" [...] and proceeds to masturbate. Allen walks in on him with the newspaper and suit as he does so, but immediately exits out of embarrassment. With the start of the bridge, puppet birds sing outside the home, while Alfie sneaks out of his room and tries to get beer out of the refrigerator, but is ultimately caught by Allen. She then takes off his [...] "stupid fitted cap", as he scrawls a picture of her, which is also the cover of [...] "Littlest Things". The final scene happens at night, in the kitchen, where Allen is lying on the floor, watching her brother dance.
