Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn onto the FC and CB with the Aida Image Analyzer analysis program (Aida 4.22, Raytest Isotopenmessgeräte GmbH, Straubenhardt, Germany). ROIs were drawn onto at least ten sections per animal, and mean intensity ratios were calculated between the FC and the CB. In addition, intensity profiles were drawn across the cortex that contained Aβ deposits, and Aβ plaque-to-background ratios were calculated for TG mice.|$|E

A 2 -m long EDF with an absorption coefficient of 24 dB m- 1 {{at the pump}} wavelength is used as gain medium. The ultra-narrow tunable filter is used for selection of a single longitudinal mode from the available spectrum of multiple modes, which originally exist in the FBG's reflection spectrum. Our approach provides a relatively simple and direct method for realization of SLM operation.

40|$|Nowadays one of {{the most}} {{complicated}} challenges for Nuclear Industry is to ensure a safe and efficient decommissioning of nuclear facilities. With the term decommissioning we usually describe the process, {{at the end of life}} of facility, starting after the defueling and coolant removal. One of the most relevant activities related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities is the radiological characterisation. With the term “radiological characterisation” we define all operation to determinate the type, location and concentration of radionuclides. Radiological characterisation, together with clearance levels, allows minimizing the radiological hazards the waste volume and costs of decommissioning. In these last years many efforts have been carried out to improve the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in particular in the decommissioning field. Sometimes we have to face the characterization of unknown and hazardous environments because of the lack of recorded data, in case of experimental facilities where took place different experiments at the beginning of nuclear industry or simply we have to decommissioning facility that was not designed with the aim of future decommissioning (presence of activated material,place difficult to reach or waste disposed without characterization or engineering barriers). The aim of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility to develop an airborne system for radiation survey. The starting point of the research was the characterization of the detector of choice. During the testing we calculated the energy calibration of the MultiChannel <b>Analyser,</b> energy <b>resolution,</b> the detection efficiency of the detector and the minimum detectable quantity in the laboratory. We can confirm that SIGMA 50 detector is suitable for this system and we were able to measure a 137 Cs source in the distance range of interest...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{simulation}} package VITESS {{offers an}} ad-vanced Monte Carlo technique for the numerical calcula-tion of flux, count rates and resolution functions for single-crystal neutron spectrometers and diffractometers. The com-parison of various moderator (decoupled-poisoned, decou-pled and coupled) and target (short and long pulse) options for backscattering spectrometers and single-crystal diffrac-tometers {{at the future}} European Spallation Source (ESS) {{is one of the}} main applications of VITESS. Single crys-tal instrument components highly determine both the wave-length selection and the intensities measured at the detec-tors. Both intensity and beam divergence are highly influ-enced by the focussing geometry of the monochromators or <b>analysers.</b> Detailed <b>resolution</b> calculations are presented. Crystal-sample modules were implemented to analyse the op-tions mentioned above for single-crystal diffraction at the ESS. We made a detailed line-shape analysis of the detector signals. PACS: 29. 30. Hs; 29. 85. +c; 29. 25. Dz Monte Carlo simulations are used for detailed resolution calculations of time-of-flight backscattering (TOF-BS) spec-trometers in a wide dynamic range where experimental methods are not possible and also implemented in neutron scattering instrument design and development [1]. The reso-lution performance of the Backscattering Spectrometer at SNS has been analysed by MC using VITESS as reported in [2]. We report here on simulation results for a similar TOF-BS instrument at the European Spallation Source (ESS) (For BS at ESS see also [3]). The very high flux of short wave-length neutrons of the short pulse target of ESS will give the opportunity for very high resolution single crystal applica-tions [4]. First results of MC simulations are here presented. More about the MC code can be found on the VITESS-website at HMI [5]. ∗Corresponding author. (Fax: + 49 - 30 / 8062 - 2523...|$|R
40|$|Clonality {{analysis}} {{is a critical}} tool for the diagnosis of suspect lymphoproliferative disorders. Amplification of the immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes on genomic DNA from the suspect samples is followed by analysis of the PCR products to distinguish between polyclonal and clonal rearrangements. These analyses are based on electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels after heteroduplex formation, or more frequently, GeneScan {{analysis is}} performed by capillary electrophoresis in automated DNA <b>analysers,</b> providing higher <b>resolution</b> and sensitivity. An alternative method for clonality analysis {{is the use of}} single-strand conformation analysis; however, this usually required labour intensive work with polyacrylamide gels and radioactive labelling. Within the EuroClonality group, we have developed a non-radioactive automated analysis based on capillary electrophoresis of single-strand PCR products that combines some of the benefits of heteroduplex and GeneScan analysis. This new method could be particularly suitable for challenging cases and could be implemented {{as an alternative to the}} more laborious heteroduplex analysis in standard gels in some instances.

Developed method was used to measure standard calibration curves and matrix calibration curves in four <b>analyser</b> modes (sensitive, <b>resolution,</b> high resolution and enhanced mode). Spiked lyophilized serum treated by the protein precipitation was used for matrix calibration curve. Finally, the individual analyser modes were compared due to the linearity and sensitivity The effect of individual analyser modes on the correlation coefficient was not observed. On the other hand, analyser modes influenced the method sensitivity. In positive mode, lower LOQ values were obtained for the standard calibration curves [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Proteomics is {{a growing}} field that has the {{potential}} to be applied to many biology-related disciplines. However, the study of the proteome has proven to be very challenging due to its high level of complexity when compared to genome and transcriptome data. In order to analyse this level of complexity, high resolution separation of peptides/proteins are needed together with high <b>resolution</b> <b>analysers.</b> Currently, liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis (CE) are the two most widely used separation techniques that can be coupled on-line with a mass spectrometer (MS). In CE, proteins/peptides are separated according to their size, charge and shape leading to high resolving power. Although further progress in the area of sensitivity, throughput and proteome coverage are expected, MS-based proteomics have developed to a level at which they are habitually applied to study a wide range of biological questions. The aim of this review is to present CE-MS as a proteomic analytical platform for biomarker research that could be used in farm animal and veterinary studies. This is a MS-analytical platform that has been widely used for biomarker research in the biomedical field but its application in animal proteomic studies is relatively novel. The review will focus on introducing the CE-MS platform and the primary considerations for its application to biomarker research. Furthermore, current applications but more importantly potential application in the field of farm animals and veterinary science will be presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor {{decades of}} space exploration, mass {{spectrometry}} {{has proven to}} be a reliable instrumentation for the characterisation of the nature and energy of ionic and neutral, atomic and molecular species in the interplanetary medium and upper planetary atmospheres. It has been used as well to analyse the chemical composition of planetary and small bodies environments. The chemical complexity of these environments calls for the need to develop a new generation of mass spectrometers with significantly increased mass resolving power The recently developed Orbitrap ™ mass <b>analyser</b> at ultra-high <b>resolution</b> shows promising adaptability to space instrumentation, offering improved performances for in situ measurements. In this article, we report on our project named “Cosmorbitrap” aiming at demonstrating the adaptability of the Orbitrap technology for in situ space exploration. We present the prototype that was developed in the laboratory for demonstration of both technical feasibility and analytical capabilities. A set of samples containing elements with masses ranging from 9 to 208 u has been used to evaluate the performance of the analyser, in terms of mass resolving power (reaching 474 000 at m/z 9) and ability to discriminate between isobaric interferences, accuracy of mass measurement (below 15 ppm) and determination of relative isotopic abundances (below 5 %) of various samples. We observe a good agreement between the results obtained with the prototype and those of a commercial instrument. As the background pressure is a key parameter for in situ exploration of atmosphere planetary bodies, we study the effect of background gas on the performances of the Cosmorbitrap prototype, showing an upper limit for N 2 in our set-up at 10 − 8 mbar. The results demonstrate the strong potential to adapt this technology to space exploration...|$|R

The final design includes a 1 MV dedicated AMS system (14 C, 26 Al, 10 Be, 129 I, Pu, U), a 6 MV shared IBA and AMS system (10 Be, 26 Al, 36 Cl, 129 I), a gas-filled-magnet beam line, and a dedicated AMS sample preparation building. The NEC accelerators are housed in a new 1500 m 2 building interconnected with the existing ANTARES AMS Facility. The 1200 m 2 chemistry building was designed as a multipurpose laboratory which provides dedicated and separated lab space for sample preparation for cosmogenic 10 Be, 26 Al and 36 Cl, meteoric 10 Be, low-level actinides (Pu,U) and an ice-core freezer storage facility for 14 CH 4 and 10 Be work. An independent Uranium series laboratory (for carbonates, water, quartz) is available with allocated labs for an ICP-MC and IRMS units. The 1 MV AMS accelerator was delivered in October 2013. Large beam-optical acceptance and high-mass <b>resolution</b> <b>analysers,</b> coupled to a novel fast coupled HE and LE isotope switching system, enables high quality radiocarbon and actinide analyses.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is a well-established technique for the measurement of isotope ratios. Double focussing mass <b>analysers</b> enable increased <b>resolution</b> {{to be applied to}} separate spectroscopic interferences, or the use of multi-collector detection techniques for high precision isotope ratio determinations. For the Central Science Laboratory (CSL), trace elements team, methods were developed for Zn and Fe isotope ratio measurements in acid digested faecal samples from a human nutritional study. For Zn, a novel high resolutionlmulticollector combination was employed; for Fe a single collector, high resolution method was used. In both cases, samples from the nutritional study known to contain the analytes in natural isotopic abundance were used to correct for the mass bias. Two independent methods for determining Zn and Fe isotope ratios were used to validate the measurement strategies. The team at CSL are also involved in the authentication of food products. Isotope ratio and elemental concentration data were used to determine the geographical origin of rice samples, and to distinguish between traditional and modem Basmati rice grown in India and Pakistan. NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory are primarily concerned with the achievable accuracy and precision of an isotope ratio measurement. Use of a mass bias correction expression appropriate to the ICP-MS instrument is essential for high quality isotope ratio measurements. Cd and Sn were used to study the variation of the mass bias in a double focussing ICP-MS system with time, absolute mass and mass difference. It was proposed that mass bias should be considered {{as a result of the}} change in the instrument response with mass, and not a fundamental parameter in its own right. A method for determination of the best mass bias correction model for an individual instrument, through examination of the instrument response function was developed...|$|R
