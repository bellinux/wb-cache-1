5|$|In captivity studies, it {{has been}} {{discovered}} {{that most of the}} hybrids do not follow Haldane's Rule, but sometimes hybrid females die before they reach sexual maturity, thereby supporting the case for the <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> being a distinct species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> is {{considered}} to be aspecies of least concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN). It has long been valued as a game bird. Habitat loss due to drainage, global warming, filling of wetlands due to urbanization and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population of the <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck.</b> The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has been purchasing and managing the habitat of this species in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations. The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture also protects habitat through restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> is {{a habitat}} generalist {{as it is}} {{associated}} with tidal marshes and present throughout the year in salt marshes from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia. It usually prefers freshwater and coastal wetlands throughout northeastern America, including brackish marshes, estuaries and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by speckled alder. It also inhabits beaver ponds, shallow lakes with sedges and reeds, bogs in open boreal and mixed hardwood forests, as well as forested swamps. Populations in Vermont have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats. During winter, the <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> mostly inhabits brackish marshes bordering bays, agricultural marshes, flooded timber, agricultural fields, estuaries and riverine areas. Ducks usually take shelter from hunting and other disturbances by moving to brackish and fresh impoundments on conservation land.|$|E
50|$|The Floridan population, {{which occurs}} {{approximately}} south of Tampa, is separated as the nominate subspecies Anas fulvigula fulvigula and is occasionally called the Florida duck or Florida mallard. by being somewhat lighter {{in color and}} less heavily marked; while both subspecies are intermediate between female mallards and <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks,</b> the Florida mottled duck {{is closer to the}} former and the mottled duck closer to the latter in appearance; this is mainly recognizable in the lighter head being quite clearly separated from the darker breast in mottled, but much less so in Florida mottled ducks. As the subspecies' ranges do not overlap, these birds can only be confused with female mallards and <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> however; particularly female <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> are often only reliably separable by their dark purple speculum from mottled ducks in the field.|$|R
5000|$|... mtDNA {{control region}} {{sequence}} data indicates that these birds {{are derived from}} ancestral <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks,</b> being far more distantly related to the mallard, and that the subspecies, {{as a consequence of}} their rather limited range and sedentary habits, are genetically well distinct already.|$|R

5|$|The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has {{continued}} to purchase and manage habitat in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations of the <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck.</b> In addition, the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge has purchased and restored over 1,000 acres of wetlands to provide stopover habitat for over 10,000 American black ducks during fall migration. Also, the Atlantic Coast Joint Venture has been protecting the habitat of the <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> through habitat restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas. In 2003, a Boreal Forest Conservation Framework was adopted by conservation organizations, industries and First Nations to protect the Canadian boreal forests, including the American black duck's eastern Canadian breeding range.|$|E
5|$|Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are {{especially}} important to the IBA. They serve as a stopover for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Waterfowl observed at the park include pied-billed and Slavonian grebes, common loon, <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck,</b> ruddy duck, blue-winged and green-winged teal, tundra swan, long-tailed duck, hooded and red-breasted merganser, greater and lesser scaup, northern pintail, bufflehead, American wigeon, and northern shoveler.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to 5000 acres of natural marsh, the refuge includes 1200 acres of managed wetlands formed by three impoundments. Water levels {{in these areas}} are manipulated to encourage the growth of waterfowl food and cover plants such as wild rice and buttonbush, while also exposing hummocks of soil and vegetation that support nesting by mallards, <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> and other wetland birds.|$|R
50|$|The {{barrier beach}} habitat of Quicksand Pond is a {{potential}} suitable nesting site for the American oystercatcher. saltmarsh sharp-tailed sparrows have also been seen. Waterfowl residents and migrants include Canada geese, canvasbacks, <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> and scaups. Quicksand Pond has been {{called one of the}} most significant migratory waterfowl concentration sites of New England. There are also historical records of sea-beach pigweed and sandplain gerardia.|$|R
50|$|The ten {{units of}} Stewart B. McKinney NWR include {{a variety of}} {{habitats}} from grassy upland, to tidal salt marsh. Native wildlife populations have diverse habitat requirements. Each species, from roseate terns to <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks,</b> has very different needs for food, water, shelter and space. The refuge units along Connecticut's coast fill these needs by providing habitats that are forested, marshy, sandy and secluded island habitats.|$|R
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the diet of the <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> consists of approximately 80% plant food and 20% animal food. The animal food diet increases to 85% during winter. During nesting, {{the proportion of}} invertebrates increases. Ducklings mostly eat water invertebrates for the first 12 days after hatching, including aquatic snowbugs, snails, mayflies, dragonflies, beetles, flies, caddisflies and larvae. After this, they shift to seeds and other plant food.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> interbreeds {{regularly}} and extensively with the mallard, {{to which it}} is closely related. Some authorities even consider the black duck to be a subspecies of the mallard instead of a separate species. Mank et al. argue that this is in error as the extent of hybridization alone is not a valid means to delimitate Anas species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> is an {{omnivorous}} {{species with}} a diverse diet. It feeds by dabbling {{in shallow water}} and grazing on land. Its plant diet primarily includes {{a wide variety of}} wetland grasses and sedges, and the seeds, stems, leaves and root stalks of aquatic plants, such as eelgrass, pondweed and smartweed. Its animal diet includes mollusks, snails, amphipods, insects, mussels and small fishes.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife on {{the refuge}} is {{as diverse as}} its habitats. Waterfowl are {{primarily}} <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> and bufflehead. The grasslands are being managed and enlarged specifically to attract grassland dependent birds such as grasshopper sparrow, eastern meadowlark, Savannah sparrow and bobolink. Due to its coastal location, the refuge is heavily used by migratory songbirds, shorebirds and raptors. The refuge also supports endangered and threatened species.|$|R
50|$|The river also {{provides}} a habitat for a broad assortment of nesting and migratory birds. Species of note include the common tern, black skimmer, laughing gull, piping plover, least tern, great black-backed gull, osprey, great egret, black-crowned night heron, clapper rail, Virginia rail, merlin, and marsh wren, among others. Canada geese, <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks,</b> mallards, tundra swans, northern pintails, and other migratory birds are often observed in the river estuary.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to mallards and Canada geese the park attracts {{large numbers of}} northern shovelers, gadwall, as well as American and Eurasian wigeon, redhead, lesser and greater scaup, bufflehead, ruddy ducks, northern pintail, green-winged teal, hooded mergansers, ring-necked <b>ducks,</b> <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks,</b> and other rarer duck species. And there are also pied-billed grebe, double-crested cormorants, American coots {{and other kinds of}} non-duck waterfowl. Many other birds may also be seen from warblers to raptors.|$|R
5|$|The apex nest predators of the <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> include American crows, gulls and raccoons, {{especially}} in tree nests. Great horned owls {{are also a}} major predator of adults. Bullfrogs and snapping turtles eat many ducklings. Ducklings often catch diseases caused by protozoan blood parasites transmitted by bites of insects such as blackflies. They are also vulnerable to lead shot poisoning, known as plumbism, due to their bottom-foraging food habits.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck,</b> and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. This is quite unusual among such different species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet {{reached the point where}} they are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} duck have brown-plumaged females {{that can be}} {{confused}} with the female mallard. The female gadwall (A.strepera) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white speculum that is seen as a white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to the female mallard in North America are the <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> (A.rubripes), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (A.fulvigula), which is somewhat darker than the female mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white edge on the speculum.|$|E
50|$|The Delaware Bay and estuary are {{wetlands}} {{of international}} importance {{and an international}} shorebird reserve. The refuge currently owns approximately 3000 acre within the 4600 acre approved boundary. The brackish water tidal marshes and coastal forests that make up nearly 80 percent of the refuge provide waterfowl with a feeding and resting area, particularly during the fall and spring migrations. <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks,</b> mallards and northern pintails are common winter visitors. Sandpipers and other shorebirds use the refuge marshes as a feeding area during the summer as well as during {{the spring and fall}} migrations.|$|R
50|$|Writers on the {{derivation}} of the Cayuga Duck have, over time, {{made more}} or less the same assertions regarding its origin; these are: it is descended from either pure <b>American</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Ducks</b> (Anas rubripes; syn. A. obscura), or is the result of hybrids between that species and the Mallard or some domesticated variety, and it was first held in a captive state by a miller in Dutchess County around 1809. There is evidence to support one portion of this theory, but, mostly, it is an inaccurate assumption; as will be explained.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of a dike across James Bay could negatively impact many mammal species, including ringed and bearded seals, walruses, and bowhead whales, as well as vulnerable populations of polar bears and beluga whales. The impacts would also affect many species of migratory bird, including lesser snow geese, Canada geese, <b>black</b> scoters, brants, <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks,</b> northern pintails, mallards, American wigeons, green-winged teals, greater scaups, common eiders, red knots, dunlins, black-bellied, American goldens, and semipalmated plovers, greater and lesser yellowlegs, sanderlings, many species of sandpipers, whimbrels, and marbled godwits, {{as well as the}} critically endangered Eskimo curlew.|$|R
5|$|Since 1988, the <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> {{has been}} rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This {{is because the}} range of this species is {{extremely}} large, which is not near the threshold of vulnerable species. In addition, the total population is large, and, although it is declining, it is not declining fast {{enough to make the}} species vulnerable. It has long been valued as a game bird, being extremely wary and fast flying. Habitat loss due to drainage, filling of wetlands due to urbanization, global warming and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population. Some conservationists consider hybridization and competition with the mallard as an additional source of concern should this decline continue. Hybridization itself is not a major problem; natural selection makes sure that the best-adapted individuals have the most offspring. However, the reduced viability of female hybrids causes some broods to fail in the long run due to the death of the offspring before reproducing themselves. While this is not a problem in the plentiful mallard, it might place an additional strain on the American black duck's population. Recent research conducted for the Delta Waterfowl Foundation suggests that hybrids are a result of forced copulations and not a normal pairing choice by black hens.|$|E

The head is brown, but is slightly lighter in tone than the darker brown body. The cheeks and throat are streaked brown, with a dark streak going through the crown and dark eye. The speculum feathers are iridescent violet-blue with predominantly black margins. The fleshy orange feet of the duck have dark webbing.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> and the mallard were formerly separated by habitat preference, with the American black duck's dark plumage giving it a selective advantage in shaded forest pools in eastern North America, and the mallard's lighter plumage giving it an advantage in the brighter, more open prairie and plains lakes. According to this view, recent deforestation {{in the east and}} tree planting on the plains has broken down this habitat separation, leading to the high levels of hybridization now observed. However, rates of past hybridization are unknown in this and most other avian hybrid zones, and it is merely presumed {{in the case of the}} <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> that past hybridization rates were lower than those seen today. Also, many avian hybrid zones are known to be stable and longstanding despite the occurrence of extensive interbreeding. The <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> and the local mallard are now very hard to distinguish by means of microsatellite comparisons, even if many specimens are sampled. Contrary to this study's claims, the question of whether the American haplotype is an original mallard lineage is far from resolved. Their statement, [...] "Northern black ducks are now no more distinct from mallards than their southern conspecifics" [...] only holds true in regard to the molecular markers tested. As birds indistinguishable according to the set of microsatellite markers still can look different, there are other genetic differences that were simply not tested in the study.|$|E
50|$|The Miramichi River {{watershed}} {{supports a}} large population of land mammals and waterfowl, particularly white-tailed deer, moose, <b>American</b> <b>black</b> bear, <b>ducks</b> and the Canada goose.

5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{attract a}} wide variety of waterfowl. Lake Phelps is just one of several large, shallow {{freshwater}} lakes on the Pamlico-Albemarle Peninsula. These lakes are all winter grounds for ducks, geese and swans. The waterfowl at Lake Phelps use the area primarily for roosting purpose before flying off to nearby feeding sites. Tundra swans and Canada geese feed in nearby farm fields and the ducks feed in the wetlands. The waterfowl usually arrive in the area in October and overwinter until February or March. Commonly seen waterfowl are Canada geese, tundra swans, mallards, <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> and northern pintail.|$|R
40|$|Understanding migratory {{connectivity}} {{for species}} of concern {{is of great}} importance {{if we are to}} implement management aimed at conserving them. New methods are improving our understanding of migration; however, banding (ringing) data {{is by far the most}} widely available and accessible movement data for researchers. Here, we use band recovery data for <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> (Anas rubripes) from 1951 – 2011 and analyze their movement among seven management regions using a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We showed that <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> generally exhibit flyway fidelity, and that many <b>black</b> <b>ducks,</b> regardless of breeding region, stopover or overwinter on the Atlantic coast of the United States. We also show that a non-trivial portion of the continental <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> population either does not move at all or moves to the north during the fall migration (they typically move to the south). The results of this analysis will be used in a projection modeling context to evaluate how habitat or harvest management actions in one region would propagate throughout the continental population of <b>black</b> <b>ducks.</b> This analysis may provide a guide for future research and help inform management efforts for <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> as well as other migratory species...|$|R

50|$|Over 200 {{species of}} both migratory and {{non-migratory}} birds {{have been identified}} in the marsh. It serves as a wintering ground and stop-over point for migrating waterfowl, which gather in numbers as high as 4,000 in the fall. These waterfowl include <b>American</b> <b>black</b> <b>ducks,</b> wood ducks, and mallards. Constitution Marsh is also used by migrating pied-billed grebes, ospreys, northern harriers, and peregrine falcons; at least 2 and as many as 30 bald eagles can be found there in the winter. Autumn concentrations of swallows once peaked at 100,000, but have dwindled since the mid-1990s. Over 50 different bird species are known to breed within the wildlife sanctuary, including the least bittern, worm-eating warbler, Virginia rail, Louisiana waterthrush, northern cardinal, spotted sandpiper, gray catbird, common yellowthroat, marsh wren, eastern phoebe, swamp sparrow, and willow flycatcher, as well as the wood thrush, which breeds in the forest near the swamp.
