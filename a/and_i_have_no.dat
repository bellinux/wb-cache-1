Pascu also purchased his own drinking establishment and live music venue, a Bucharest tavern he named Gyuri's Pub, which hosted performances by the Moldovan folk singer Radu Captari. A collaborator of Pascu on solo music projects during spring 2010, Captari sang and played the guitar while riding a horse.|$|E
500|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that Smith was hoping to release her second album later in the year. In an interview, she expressed surprise and pleasure that the label wanted her to do another album so soon after the first. In September, further details about the album were released, including its name, Wonderland, and planned release date, 30 November. Smith claimed that Faryl [...] "was an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording", while Cohen, producer of both Faryl and Wonderland, said Smith had [...] "matured as an artist since the first album <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt that once again, people will be astonished and moved by her performances". The album, which was recorded at Sarm Studios in Notting Hill, London, was completed in early October, and is loosely based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Wonderland was released on 30 November. To publicise the album, Smith appeared on numerous radio shows, as well as television appearances including Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and Sky News Sunrise.|$|E

Australian LGBT website SameSame said the story had attracted attention from some media commentators, who called it [...] "an obvious ratings grab and an attempt to out-gay rival soap, Home and Away".

500|$|While {{the music}} of Henry Cow was highly orchestrated and structured, Frith also began to {{experiment}} with unstructured music, using prepared instruments and chance composition. In June 1974, {{after the release of}} Henry Cow's second album, Virgin Records (Henry Cow's record label) commissioned a solo record from Frith. They were impressed with his musical ability and gave him free rein to record whatever he wanted. In a 2001 radio interview, Frith said he used the opportunity as a challenge: [...] "I said to myself ... in two weeks time I'm going to go into the studio <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> idea what I'm going to do and I'm going to kind of reinvent the instrument for myself." [...] Frith spent four days in July 1974 recording at the Kaleidophon Studios in London, and the resulting experimentation and the process of galvanisation and pressure led to the [...] "radical approach to the guitar" [...] on the album. In October 1974, Virgin released the album as Guitar Solos on their budget label, Caroline Records.|$|E

[...] Shot on November 16, 2007 in a suburban area of Los Angeles, California, the video included fifty background dancers, such as a middle school teacher. Cyrus said the concept was, [...] "I'm singing and dancing and like rocking out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> idea where these people come from." [...] The portion of the music video in which she enters the [...] "carnival-like" [...] scene drew influences from the 1950s and Hairspray. Another concept she further explained was the appearance of a man in a [...] "prom-setting." [...] Cyrus said, [...] "Here it's gonna be the guy that I'm supposed to 'start all over' and we're at prom, so I'm just [...] not like in a dress or anything. So, it's random.

500|$|Following {{the first}} three verses of {{advertising}} slogans, the song continues with the lyrics [...] "I have no compass, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> map" [...] and [...] "No reason to get back", referring to {{the uncertainty of the}} new direction of U2's music at the time. [...] The following verse begins with, [...] "And I have no religion", which was included in the lyrics because Bono stated that he believes [...] "religion is the enemy of God." [...] A review of the album in Melody Maker compared the lyric [...] "Uncertainty can be a guiding light" [...] {{towards the end of the}} song to the line [...] "If you walk away, [...] I will follow" [...] from U2's 1980 single [...] "I Will Follow". The reviewer stated [...] "The man (Bono) that once had so many answers now sounds simply confused." [...] The theme of moral confusion was first used in U2's song [...] "Acrobat" [...] from Achtung Baby. The coda in [...] "Zooropa" [...] features the lyric [...] "dream out loud", which Bono included as a reference to [...] "Acrobat". The phrase [...] "dream out loud" [...] was first used by Bono during the Lovetown Tour in 1989, and has appeared several times in U2's work since then. The phrase was also used in the song [...] "Always"– a B-side to the [...] "Beautiful Day" [...] single released in 2000 — and was spoken by Bono in the [...] video.|$|E
500|$|During the Zoo TV Tour, {{clips of}} [...] "Zooropa" [...] were played during the {{beginning}} of the show. The clips included the lyric [...] "What do you want?" [...] repeated twice, which was displayed on video screens in various languages, and interspersed with a voice saying [...] "It's very simple". This part of the opening segment was intended to create confusion among the audience regarding the show's message, and eventually lead to information overload. [...] U2 performed [...] "Zooropa" [...] live at three consecutive concerts during the fourth leg of the Zoo TV Tour in 1993. Bono originally discussed how the song would be played live during the album's recording sessions, saying that The Edge's guitar riffs may be extended in concert. The song debuted live at a concert in Glasgow in August 1993, and was performed {{in the middle of the}} set list following [...] "Numb". The live version was much shorter than the album version, skipping the piano intro, as well as the first three verses, starting with the line [...] "I have no compass, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> map". U2 had difficulty performing the song live, which Bono acknowledged to the audience following its debut. According to the book U2 Live: A Concert Documentary, the song's first performance sounded [...] "shaky" [...] and needed more rehearsal, although its subsequent Zoo TV performances [...] "sound better". Adam Clayton suggested performing the song as the show opener during the rehearsals for the tour's fifth and final Zoomerang leg, but it was not performed again on the tour.|$|E
500|$|... "Zooropa" [...] is set amongst neon {{signs of}} a brightly lit futuristic city. In the song's introduction, {{background}} voices ask, [...] "What do you want?" [...] In response to the question, the lyrics {{in the first three}} verses consist of various advertising slogans, including, [...] "Better by design", [...] "Be all that you can be", and [...] "Vorsprung durch technik". Critic Parry Gettelman interpreted these lines as meaning to [...] "signify the emptiness of modern, godless life". In the song's second half, the theme of moral confusion and uncertainty is introduced, particularly in the lines [...] "I have no compass / <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> map". [...] "Babyface" [...] is about a man practicing his obsessive love for a celebrity by manipulating her image on a TV recording. [...] "Lemon", inspired by an old video of Bono's late mother in a lemon-coloured dress, describes man's attempts to preserve time through technology. This is reflected in lines such as, [...] "A man makes a picture / A moving picture / Through the light projected he can see himself up close". The lyrics to [...] "Numb" [...] are a series of [...] "don't" [...] commands, amidst a noisy backdrop of sounds. The Edge notes that the song was inspired by one of the themes of Zoo TV, [...] "that sense that you were getting bombarded with so much that you actually were finding yourself shutting down and unable to respond because there was so much imagery and information being thrown at you".|$|E

500|$|Madness {{frequently}} discovers itself {{merely by}} unnecessary {{deviation from the}} usual mode of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, {{or in any other}} unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [...] Burney:– Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was carried back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit [...] Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> passion for it.'– Johnson continued. 'Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.' ...|$|E
500|$|The Fourteenth Amendment {{provides}} that children {{born in the}} United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents. At {{the time of the}} amendment's passage, three Senators, including Trumbull,Mr. Cowan: [...] "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"Mr. Trumbull: [...] "Undoubtedly."...Mr. Trumbull: [...] "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."Mr. Cowan: [...] "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."Mr. Trumbull: [...] "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European." [...] the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as President Andrew Johnson, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth; however, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively contrary opinion.Mr. Cowan: [...] "...Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."Mr. Johnson: [...] "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..." [...] These congressional remarks applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants, although {{the law of the land}} continues to be based on the standard interpretation. Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of [...] "birth tourism", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.|$|E
