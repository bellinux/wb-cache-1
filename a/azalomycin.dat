50|$|Nigericin is an {{antibiotic}} derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Its isolation {{was described in}} the 1950s, and in 1968 the structure could be elucidated by X-ray crystallography. The structure and properties of nigericin {{are similar to the}} antibiotic monensin. Commercially it is obtained as a byproduct, or contaminant, at the fermentation of Geldanamycin. It is also called Polyetherin A, <b>Azalomycin</b> M, Helixin C, Antibiotic K178, Antibiotic X-464.|$|E
40|$|Copiamycin, an {{antibiotic}} agent, has shown in vitro activity against Candida albicans, Torulopsis glabrata, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Local administration of copiamycin to mice inoculated intraperitoneally with protozoa reduced the per cent of infection {{as measured by}} decreased abscess formation. This antibiotic has {{had little effect on}} the glucose oxidation by protozoa. Its action on anaerobic glucose metabolism in these organisms was equal to that of aminitrozole and <b>azalomycin</b> F. From these results we conclude that copiamycin is an effective antifungal and antitrichomonal agent equivalent in activity to <b>azalomycin</b> F...|$|E
40|$|The assembly-line synthases {{that produce}} {{bacterial}} polyketide natural products follow a modular paradigm {{in which each}} round of chain extension is catalysed by a different set or module of enzymes. Examples of deviation from this paradigm, in which a module catalyses either multiple extensions or none are of interest from both a mechanistic and an evolutionary viewpoint. We present evidence that in the biosynthesis of the 36 -membered macrocyclic aminopolyol lactones (marginolactones) <b>azalomycin</b> and kanchanamycin, isolated respectively from Streptomyces malaysiensis DSM 4137 and Streptomyces olivaceus Tü 4018, the first extension module catalyses both {{the first and second}} cycles of polyketide chain extension. To confirm the integrity of the azl gene cluster, it was cloned intact on a bacterial artificial chromosome and transplanted into the heterologous host strain Streptomyces lividans, which does not possess the genes for marginolactone production. When furnished with 4 -guanidinobutyramide, a specific precursor of the <b>azalomycin</b> starter unit, the recombinant S. lividans produced <b>azalomycin,</b> showing that the polyketide synthase genes in the sequenced cluster are sufficient to accomplish formation of the full-length polyketide chain. This provides strong support for module iteration in the <b>azalomycin</b> and kanchanamycin biosynthetic pathways. In contrast, re-sequencing of the gene cluster for biosynthesis of the polyketide β-lactone ebelactone in Streptomyces aburaviensis has shown that, contrary to a recently-published proposal, the ebelactone polyketide synthase faithfully follows the colinear modular paradigm...|$|E
40|$|Copiamycin, an {{antifungal}} antibiotic, exhibits antimicrobial activity {{against a}} few bacteria {{in addition to}} a wide variety of fungi. The methanol extract of Sarcina lutea, one of the most susceptible bacteria, was found to reverse the antimicrobial activity of copiamycin. The reversing activity was associated with the phospholipid fraction of the bacteria. The S. lutea phospholipids also reversed the activities of <b>azalomycin</b> F and miconazole, but not that of clotrimazole. The effects of authentic phospholipids and fatty acids were also investigated. As the antimicrobial activities of copiamycin and <b>azalomycin</b> F were most strongly reversed in the same manner by phospholipids with unsaturated fatty acids and basic hydrophilic groups, the sites on the cell membrane sensitive to both antibiotics are assumed to be identical. On the other hand, the activity of miconazole was affected by different phospholipids from those which affected these two antifungal antibiotics, and the activity of clotrimazole was not affected by any of the phospholipids and fatty acids. It was postulated that the sites on the cell membrane sensitive to miconazole and clotrimazole are different from those sensitive to copiamycin and <b>azalomycin</b> F...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Seven new <b>azalomycin</b> F analogs (1 – 7) were {{isolated}} from the broth of mangrove Streptomyces sp. 211726, and respectively identified as 25 -malonyl demalonylazalomycin F 5 a monoester (1), 23 -valine demalonylazalomycin F 5 a ester (2), 23 -(6 -methyl) heptanoic acid demalonylazalomycins F 3 a ester (3), F 4 a ester (4) and F 5 a ester (5), 23 -(9 -methyl) decanoic acid demalonylazalomycin F 4 a ester (6) and 23 -(10 -methyl) undecanoic acid demalony lazalomycin F 4 a ester (7). Their structures were established by their spectroscopic data and by comparing with those of azalomycins F 3 a, F 4 a and F 5 a. Biological assays exhibited that 1 – 7 showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial and anti HCT- 116 activities...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-two {{clinical}} isolates of anthropophilic dermatophytes {{were examined}} for {{their capacity to}} produce antibiotics in liquid culture and on human stratum corneum in vitro. Antibiotics were detected and classified using agar diffusion bioassays and chromatographic analysis. Twenty-four isolates produced antibiotic substances in liquid culture filtrates; some strains produced more than one antibiotic. Only four isolates produced detectable levels of antibiotics when grown on stratum corneum unless an artificial sweat mixture {{was used as a}} nutrient supplement, when the number rose to 11. Representatives of all species studied produced benzyl penicillin-like substances. Some Trichophyton isolates also pro-duced streptomycin-like antibiotics, a characteristic previously unrecorded for eukaryotic organisms. Other antibiotics, which apart from <b>azalomycin</b> F could not be properly classi-fied, were produced by Epidermophyton floccosum. Antibiotic production occurred over the normal skin temperature range but sometimes the type of antibiotic produced and the frequency of detection appeared to be influenced by the incubation temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} 8 {{kinds of}} antitrichomonal drugs {{were examined in}} vitro for growth inhibiting effect upon 2 strains (S and H strains) of Trichomonas Vaginalis: 3 antibiotics (trichomycin, pimaricin, and <b>azalomycin</b> F) and 5 synthetic chemicals (carbarsone, chlordantoin, piperanitrozole, metronidazole and rimovazole). The parasites were inoculated in each tube containing the V-bouillon medium and different concentrations of drugs. After the incubation for 48 hours at 37 ℃, the numbers of active parasites were counted using Burker-Turk's haemacytometer, and the percentages of growthinhibition by the drugs were calculated by comparison with data in the control where no drug was added into the culture medium. The percentage data were transformed into Probit value to calculate a regression line for each strain and each drug. Then, 99. 9 % inhibiting dose (ID_) and 50 % inhibiting dose (ID_) of the drugs {{were obtained from the}} regression lines. Among the drugs tested carbarsone and pimaricin had rather higher ID_ and ID_, whereas trichomycin, piperanitrozole, metronidazole and nimovazole showed lower ID_ and ID_. There were statistically {{no significant difference between the}} two strains tested in ID_ as well as ID_ for each drug. In vivo experiments were also carried out to examine the therapeutic effect of drugs against the experimental abscess-formation caused by the subcutaneous inoculation of Trichomonas vaginalis to the back of mice. After the parasite inoculation the following drugs were orally treated: trichomycin, piperanitrozole, metronidazole and nimovazole. Trichomycin showed unexpectedly low therapeutic effect against the abscessformation whereas it was highly toxic to mice. On the other hand, piperanitrozole, metronidazole and nimovazole showed noticeable therapeutic effect without toxicity at a dosage of 50 mg/kg/day for 5 days...|$|E
