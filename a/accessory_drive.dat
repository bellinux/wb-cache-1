25|$|The {{packaging}} of {{an engine}} within its nacelle {{is a complicated}} task. The <b>accessory</b> <b>drive</b> is usually arranged as a curved casing, so that the various accessories are mounted close to the engine. The casing {{is a pair of}} light alloy castings. Separate machined mounting pads are provided for each accessory.|$|E
25|$|For two-shaft designs, an <b>accessory</b> <b>drive</b> will {{be taken}} from the {{high-pressure}} shaft, i.e. the outer and shorter of the two concentric shafts. This shaft comes up to speed more quickly when the engine is started. The drive and accessory gearboxes may also be split in two, one driven from each engine shaft, so as to distribute their loads. The engine-critical systems, including the starter drive, are arranged on the high-pressure shaft, with aircraft systems on the low-pressure shaft. The high-pressure shaft also rotates faster than the low-pressure shaft, which may influence the distribution of accessories.|$|E
2500|$|The first prototypes of the ASh-73 {{were built}} in 1945 {{and by the end}} of 1946 testing had {{completed}} successfully. The first models to enter production in 1947 lacked turbo-superchargers. They weighed [...] and had [...] during take-off. The ASh-73TK had two TK-19 turbochargers and an intercooler fitted which were direct copies of the units used on the R-3350. The engine was upgraded over the course of its production. On the fourth series of engines the crankshaft nose was changed, the articulated connecting rods were strengthened and the <b>accessory</b> <b>drive</b> was changed. The middle part of the crankcase and the pistons were strengthened and the ignition was improved in the fifth series. In the sixth series the master connecting rod and the crankshaft cheeks were strengthened, the pistons were lightened and shortened. For the seventh series exhaust valves with floating seats were introduced and the reduction gearing was improved.|$|E

2500|$|The 567 is {{laid out}} with engine {{accessories}} (oil and water pumps and governors) at the [...] "forward" [...] end and the power take off at the [...] "rear" [...] end. The blowers and camshafts are at the [...] "rear" [...] end of the engine, with the blowers mounted above the power take off."The full line of engines was designed with the same general arrangement, revising basically only the length of crankshaft and crankcase to [...] the required number of cylinders. It appeared that the most satisfactory method of having the engine accessories such as pumps, governor, etc. easily maintained would be to drive them through a gear train at the forward end of the engine, that is, opposite the power take-off end. Having {{the location of the}} pumps all {{at one end of the}} engine, called the <b>accessory</b> <b>drive</b> end, fitted very well into locomotive installation. A leaf spring flexible drive gear mounted on the crankshaft was used to eliminate all crankshaft torsional vibration from the gear train."By using either one or two blowers for an 8 or 12 cylinder engine respectively and mounting them above the main generator, it was possible to shorten the overall length of the engine and generator installation. This was one of the main original objectives. The blowers as well as the camshafts were driven at the power take-off end of the engine by another gear train." ...|$|E

50|$|An {{underdrive}} pulley {{refers to}} a crankshaft or accessory pulley (a/c, alternator, power steering, water pump, etc.) designed to turn at a slower speed than stock. To Underdrive means to slow the rate of rotation in a system. Underdrive is achieved by either making the crank/main (drive) pulley smaller or the <b>accessory</b> (<b>driven)</b> pulley larger than the original diameter pulleys.|$|R
50|$|For the E170 Corolla model, the {{transmission}} is an {{electric power steering}} system offering improved directness and weight; an electric rack and pinion system eliminates an <b>accessory</b> <b>driven</b> hydraulic steering system, reducing parasitic loss. The components of the tilt, telescopic steering structure help improve steering rigidity, and reduce vibration. A more structurally rigid intermediate shaft increases the direct feel of steering. Steering measures 3.19 turns total.|$|R

50|$|A {{constant}} speed drive (CSD) is a mechanical gearbox that takes {{an input shaft}} rotating at {{a wide range of}} speeds, delivering this power to an output shaft that rotates at a {{constant speed}}, despite the varying input. They are used to drive mechanisms, typically electrical generators, that require a constant input speed. Constant speed drives are usually found as part of the <b>accessory</b> <b>drives</b> of gas turbine engines, such as aircraft jet engines. Constant-speed drives are usually found supplying accessory equipment and are rarely needed for an engine's main power output.|$|R

5000|$|The factory-quoted {{horsepower}} {{rating of}} [...] {{was measured using}} the SAE (gross) system current in the USA {{at the time the}} 420/Sovereign was sold there. The SAE (gross) system excluded many <b>accessory</b> <b>drives</b> and often used non-standard induction and exhaust systems and so was replaced by the more accurate SAE (net) system in 1972, long after the 420/Sovereign had gone out of production. Reference states that the DIN horsepower rating of the 1977 USA specification 4.2-litre Series II XJ6 was equivalent to 180 bhp. The DIN system yields horsepower ratings which, for most technical purposes, are the same as those that would be obtained using the SAE (net) system. However, the 1977 test would have included power-sapping emissions equipment not present on the 420/Sovereign. Therefore, the SAE (net) power rating of the 420/Sovereign must have lain somewhere between 180 bhp and 245 bhp.|$|R
