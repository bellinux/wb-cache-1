5|$|While small interfering RNAs (siRNA; 20-25nt) {{are often}} {{produced}} by breakdown of viral RNA, {{there are also}} endogenous sources of siRNAs. siRNAs act through RNA interference in a fashion similar to miRNAs. Some miRNAs and siRNAs can cause genes they target to be methylated, thereby decreasing or increasing transcription of those genes.

5|$|Alvin Plantinga's {{free will}} defense {{is a logical}} {{argument}} developed by American analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and published in its final version in his 1977 book God, Freedom, and Evil. Plantinga's argument is <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>against</b> the logical problem of evil as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in The Miracle of Theism, {{though he did not}} claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.|$|E
5|$|Building a {{complete}} deployment {{would have been}} extremely expensive, {{on the order of}} the total yearly budget of the Department of Defense. Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense, felt the cost could not be justified and worried it would lead to a further nuclear arms race. He directed the teams to consider deployments where a limited number of interceptors might still be militarily useful. Among these, the I-67 concept suggested building a lightweight defense against very limited attacks. When the People's Republic of China exploded their first H-bomb in 1967, I-67 was promoted as <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>against</b> a Chinese attack, and this system became Sentinel in October. Nike-X development, in its original form, ended.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine is not {{essential}} for humans or other mammals; small amounts may be beneficial for bone strength, but {{this has not been}} definitively established. As there are many environmental sources of trace fluorine, the possibility of a fluorine deficiency could apply only to artificial diets. Natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals. The most common is fluoroacetate, which is used as <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>against</b> herbivores by at least 40 plants in Africa, Australia and Brazil. Other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate. An enzyme that binds fluorine to carbon – adenosyl-fluoride synthase – was discovered in bacteria in 2002.|$|E

5|$|One of the higher-level predators {{within its}} ecosystem, the Australian swellshark feeds on {{crustaceans}} (particularly crabs and rock lobsters), cephalopods (including squid and octopus), and small fishes. Even large-sized prey {{tends to be}} swallowed whole; the long periods of rest exhibited by some sharks may relate to digestion. Like {{the other members of}} its genus, this shark is capable of rapidly inflating its body by taking water or air into its stomach, as <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>against</b> predators. These include larger fishes, such as the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and marine mammals. By inflating, the shark may be able to wedge itself inside crevices, make itself harder to swallow, or simply intimidate a would-be predator. Marine snails are known to prey upon this shark's eggs. The Australian swellshark serves as a host to a number of parasite species, but these are poorly documented.|$|E
5|$|Richard H. Fallon {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} Harvard Magazine, and characterized Freedom for the Thought That We Hate as a clear and captivating background education to U.S. freedom of speech legislation. Fallon praised the author's ability to weave descriptions of historical events into an entertaining account. Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that Lewis aptly summarized {{the development of the}} U.S. Constitution's protections of freedom of speech and of the press. She observed that the book forcefully presented the author's admiration of brave judges who had helped to develop interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's protections of the rights of freedom of expression as <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>against</b> censorship.|$|E

This rivalry started at TNA's Sacrifice PPV event held on August14, 2005, where Joe {{defeated}} Styles {{in the final}} round of the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament. By winning the tournament, Joe was entitled to a TNA X Division Championship match against then-champion Christopher Daniels. Daniels had interfered in the match, leading to Joe's victory. As a result, Styles was added to Joe's title match with Daniels, making it a Three Way match at TNA's Unbreakable PPV event held on September11, 2005. Styles won the bout at Unbreakable becoming the new champion, thus leading to <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>against</b> Daniels at Bound for Glory in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match which Styles also won.|$|E

5|$|The {{skin of a}} giraffe {{is mostly}} gray. Its {{thickness}} allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur {{may serve as a}} chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>against</b> insects.|$|E

The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E
5|$|Vistulan gords, {{built from}} the mid-8th century on, were {{typically}} very large, often over 10 hectares in size. About 30 big ones are known. The 9th-century gords in Lesser Poland and in Silesia were likely built as <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>against</b> Great Moravian military expansion. The largest one, in Stradów, Kazimierza Wielka County, had {{an area of}} 25 hectares and walls or embankments 18 meters high, but parts of this giant structure were probably built later. The gords were often located along the northern slope of the western Carpathian Mountains, on hills or hillsides.

5|$|Voracious and {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, the blotchy swellshark {{is known}} to consume numerous types of fishes and invertebrates, including an unusually high diversity of cartilaginous fishes. Like other Cephaloscyllium species, {{it is capable of}} rapidly inflating its body as <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>against</b> predators. This species is oviparous, with females laying encapsulated eggs two at a time. There is no well-defined breeding season and reproduction occurs year-round. The eggs hatch after approximately one year. The blotchy swellshark is harmless and fares well in captivity. It is caught as bycatch in commercial bottom trawls, though its population {{does not seem to have}} suffered from fishing activity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|While {{the root}} of the parsnip is edible, {{handling}} the shoots and leaves of the plant requires caution as the sap is toxic. Like many other members of the family Apiaceae, the parsnip contains furanocoumarins as <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>against</b> herbivory, photosensitive chemicals that causes a condition known as phytophotodermatitis. The condition is a type of chemical burn rather than an allergic reaction, and is similar to the rash caused by poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Symptoms include redness, burning, and blisters; afflicted areas can remain discolored for up to two years. Reports of gardeners experiencing toxic symptoms after coming into contact with foliage have been made but these have been small in number compared to {{the number of people who}} grow the crop. The problem is most likely to occur on a sunny day when gathering foliage or pulling up old plants that have gone to seed. The symptoms have mostly been mild to moderate.|$|E
