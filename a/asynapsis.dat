50|$|George Wells Beadle {{was born}} in Wahoo, Nebraska. He {{was the son of}} Chauncey Elmer Beadle and Hattie Albro, who owned and {{operated}} a 40 acre farm nearby. George was educated at the Wahoo High School and might himself have become a farmer if one of his teachers at school had not directed his mind towards science and persuaded him to go to the College of Agriculture in Lincoln, Nebraska. In 1926 he took his Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Nebraska and subsequently worked for a year with Professor F.D. Keim, who was studying hybrid wheat. In 1927 he took his Master of Science degree, and Professor Keim secured for him a post as Teaching Assistant at Cornell University, where he worked, until 1931, with Professors R.A. Emerson and L.W. Sharp on Mendelian <b>asynapsis</b> in Zea mays. For this work he obtained, in 1931, his Doctor of Philosophy degree.|$|E
50|$|The DSB-independent pathway was {{proposed}} when people studied spo11 mutant cells in some species {{and found that}} these Spo11 cells could not process to metaphase I {{even in the absence}} of DSB. The direct purpose of these DSBs is to help with the condensation of chromosomes. Even though the initial homolog paring in early leptotene is just random interactions, the further progression into presynaptic alignment depends on the formation of double strand breaks and single strand transfer complexes. Therefore the unsynapsed chromosomes in Spo11 cells can be a target of checkpoint. An AAA-adenosine triphosphatase (AAA-ATPase) was found to be essential in this pathway. but the mechanism is not yet clear. Some other studies also drew sex body formation into attention, and the signaling could be either structure based or transcription regulation such as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Under this cascade, failure to synapse will maintain the gene expression from sex chromosomes and some products may inhibit cell cycle progression. Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation only happens in male, which may partially be the reason why only Spo11 mutant spermatocytes but not oocytes fail to transition from prophase I to metaphase I. However the <b>asynapsis</b> does not happen only within sex chromosomes, and such transcription regulation was suspended until it was further expanded to all the chromosomes as meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin, but the effector gene is not found yet.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} family in which {{azoospermia}} and infertility affected two sibs whose parents were first cousins once removed. Meiotic cells of the proband, who had the chromosomal complement of a normal male (46,XY), exhibited <b>asynapsis,</b> defective synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, chiasma failure, and degeneration of prophase spermatocytes with <b>asynapsis.</b> Based on these observations, we suggest that the meiotic abnormalities and infertility in this family comprise a trait with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Review of published cases of infertile men with normal chromosomal complements and disturbed meiosis suggests that genetically determined <b>asynapsis</b> and desynapsis similar to that established in plant and insect species also occur in humans. In humans, <b>asynapsis</b> appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive. The mode of inheritance of desynapsis is not clear; X-linked recessive or autosomal dominant has been suggested in one family. Studies by us and by others {{reported in the literature}} suggest that the mode of action of genes that affect synapsis and cause a reduction in the numbers of visible chiasmata at diakinesis is dissimilar to that of the action of genes that cause defective meiotic recombination, defective repair of induced damage to DNA in somatic cells, and chromosome instability...|$|E
40|$|Failure of {{homologous}} synapsis during meiotic prophase triggers transcriptional repression. <b>Asynapsis</b> of the X and Y chromosomes {{and their}} consequent silencing {{is essential for}} spermatogenesis. However, <b>asynapsis</b> of portions of autosomes in heterozygous translocation carriers may be detrimental for meiotic progression. In fact, {{a wide range of}} phenotypic outcomes from meiotic arrest to normal spermatogenesis have been described and the causes of such a variation remain elusive. To better understand the consequences of <b>asynapsis</b> in male carriers of Robertsonian translocations, we focused on the dynamics of recruitment of markers of <b>asynapsis</b> and meiotic silencing at unsynapsed autosomal trivalents in the spermatocytes of Robertsonian translocation carrier mice. Here we report that the enrichment of breast cancer 1 (BRCA 1) and histone γH 2 AX at unsynapsed trivalents declines during the pachytene stage of meiosis and differs from that observed in the sex body. Furthermore, histone variant H 3. 3 S 31, which associates with the sex chromosomes in metaphase I/anaphase I spermatocytes, localizes to autosomes in 12 % and 31 % of nuclei from carriers of one and three translocations, respectively. These data suggest that the proportion of spermatocytes with markers of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC) at trivalents depends on both, the stage of meiosis and the number of translocations. This may explain some of the variability in phenotypic outcomes associated with Robertsonian translocations. In addition our data suggest that the dynamics o...|$|E
40|$|Chromosome {{synapsis}} during zygotene is {{a prerequisite}} for the timely homologous recombinational repair of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Unrepaired DSBs are thought to trigger apoptosis during midpachytene of male meiosis if synapsis fails. An early pachytene response to <b>asynapsis</b> is meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC), which, in normal males, silences the X and Y chromosomes (meiotic sex chromosome inactivation [MSCI]). In this study, we show that MSUC occurs in Spo 11 -null mouse spermatocytes with extensive <b>asynapsis</b> but lacking meiotic DSBs. In contrast, three mutants (Dnmt 3 l, Msh 5, and Dmc 1) with high levels of <b>asynapsis</b> and numerous persistent unrepaired DSBs have a severely impaired MSUC response. We suggest that MSUC-related proteins, including the MSUC initiator BRCA 1, are sequestered at unrepaired DSBs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We studied meiosis {{in three}} {{infertile}} patients presenting complete AZFc microdeletion and three controls. METHODS: Primary spermatocytes were immunolabeled with SCP 3, BRCA 1 and gH 2 AX. We quantified the leptotene, zygotene and pachytene stages, and pachytene abnormalities: <b>asynapsis</b> and fragmented and dotted synaptonemal complexes (SCs). RESULTS: SCP 3 level {{was significantly higher}} in leptotene and zygotene (bouquet) stages in patients, suggesting AZFc may have a direct effect on early prophase. SCs were abnormal in 77. 3 % of pachy-tene nuclei of patients versus 30. 8 % of controls. The two groups differed significantly (P < 0. 001) in asynapsed nuclei, fragmented SC and dotted SCs. In patients, <b>asynapsis</b> were short and limited to a few bivalents. Staging of pachytene nuclei based on the morphology of the XY pair with BRCA 1 revealed a prevalence of early pachytene substages (70. 7 %) in patients. H 2 AX was normally phosphorylated. CONCLUSIONS: In {{the absence of the}} AZFc region, the transient zygotene stage is extended, and chromosome condensation is reduced. The low level of limited <b>asynapsis,</b> the normal H 2 AX staining and the incomplete loss of germ cells at the pachytene checkpoint indicate that the AZFc region is not critical for meiotic recombination.

40|$|Hybrid {{sterility}} (HS) {{belongs to}} reproductive isolation barriers that safeguard {{the integrity of}} species in statu nascendi. Although hybrid sterility occurs almost universally among animal and plant species, most of our current knowledge comes from the classical genetic studies on Drosophila interspecific crosses or introgressions. With the house mouse subspecies Mus m. musculus and Mus m. domesticus as a model, new research tools have become available for studies of the molecular mechanisms and genetic networks underlying HS. Here we used QTL analysis and intersubspecific chromosome substitution strains to identify a 4. 7 Mb critical region on Chromosome X (Chr X) harboring the Hstx 2 HS locus, which causes asymmetrical spermatogenic arrest in reciprocal intersubspecific F 1 hybrids. Subsequently, we mapped autosomal loci on Chrs 3, 9 and 13 that can abolish this asymmetry. Combination of immunofluorescent visualization of the proteins of synaptonemal complexes with whole-chromosome DNA FISH on pachytene spreads revealed that heterosubspecific, unlike consubspecific, homologous chromosomes are predisposed to <b>asynapsis</b> in F 1 hybrid male and female meiosis. The <b>asynapsis</b> is under the trans- control of Hstx 2 and Hst 1 /Prdm 9 hybrid sterility genes in pachynemas of male but not female hybrids.

40|$|Meiotic sex {{chromosome}} inactivation (MSCI) {{is an essential}} epigenetic process, which transcriptionally silences X and Y chromosomes during spermatogenesis. It is accompanied by substantial chromatin remodeling resulting in a formation of so called sex or XY body, which is a characteristic of male pachytene spermatocytes. In spite of MSCI indispensability for male fertility, its biological role and molecular nature still remain rather unclear. However, the described link between chromosomal <b>asynapsis</b> and transcriptional silencing demonstrated that MSCI is tightly associated with the <b>asynapsis</b> of largely non-homologous {{sex chromosome}}s and is a specific form of more general mechanism called meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC). The essential role of MSCI was demonstrated using mouse models, such as carriers of X- autosome translocations, where anomalous synapsis of sex chromosomes leads to impairment of MSCI and male sterility. Intriguingly, the exclusive spermatogenic arrest is a hallmark of not only X-autosome translocations but even various autosomal rearrangements, including autosomal translocations, inversions, or other structural mutations.

Here we investigate the contribu-tion of these lesions to oocyte elimination in mice with chromosome abnormalities, e. g. Turner syndrome (XO) and translocations. We show that asynapsed chromosomes trigger oocyte elimination at diplonema, which {{is linked to the}} presence of phosphorylated H 2 AFX (γH 2 AFX). We find that DNA double-strand break (DSB) foci disappear on asynapsed chro-mosomes during pachynema, excluding persistent DNA damage as a likely cause, and demonstrating the existence in mammalian oocytes of a repair pathway for asynapsis-asso-ciated DNA DSBs. Importantly, deletion or point mutation of H 2 afx restores oocyte numbers in XO females to wild type (XX) levels. Unexpectedly, we find that asynapsed supernumer-ary chromosomes do not elicit prophase I loss, despite being enriched for γH 2 AFX and other checkpoint proteins.

Certain mutations of these complexes have been shown to behave in a synapsis-dependent fashion. That is, certain bithorax and white genotypes exhibit one level of expression when the two copies of these loci are able to synapse in somatic tissues and another level when heterozygosity for chromosomal rearrangements interferes with their ability to pair. Such phenomena are termed transvection effects by Lewis (1954). In the case of the white locus, <b>asynapsis</b> leads to a more normal state, whereas at bithorax, <b>asynapsis</b> leads to a more mutant phenotype. Recently, a third case of transvection was described at the decapentaplegic (2 - 4. 0; 22 F 1 - 3) gene complex (Gelbart 1982); phenomenologically, it is very similar to transvection at bithorax. In this report, we demonstrate that zeste mutations can also interact with those decapentaplegic mutations that exhibit transvection effects. In addition, we present more information on the zeste interactions with white and bithorax. Interactions with zeste may be diagnostic of loci that can exhibit transvection effects. However, different groups of zeste alleles interact with each complex. z 1 interacts with white, za alleles interact with bithorax and all tested zeste mutants interact with decapentaplegic. These differential effects of zeste mutations may be a reflection of the neomorphic nature of the z 1 allele...|$|E

However this probably does not express the entire evolutionary complexity of its populations. Isofemale lines A 95 F 3 (from Brazil) and B 20 D 2 (from Argentina), at present representing, respectively, the first and second species, were analyzed for fertility and fecundity in pair-mating intracrosses and intercrosses, as well as for development time, banding patterns and <b>asynapsis</b> of polytene chromosomes in the isofemale lines and their hybrids. Although variations in experimental conditions resulted in some variability in the results, in general A 95 F 3 fertility and fecundity were lower than in B 20 D 2. Intercrosses of A 95 F 3 females and B 20 D 2 males showed lower fertility and fecundity than the reciprocal crosses, following more closely characteristics of the mother strains. This is in contrast to the results obtained by Fontdevilla et al. (An. Entomol. Soc. Amer. 81 : 380 - 385, 1988) and may be due to the different geographic origin of D. serido strains they used in crosses to B 20 D 2. This difference and others cited in the literature relative to aedeagus morphology, karyotype characteristics, inversion polymorphisms and reproductive isolation strongly indicate that A 95 F 3 and D. serido from the State of Bahia, Brazil are not a single evolutionary entity, reinforcing the idea of greater complexity of the superspecies D. serido than is known today. The reproductive isolation mechanisms found operating between A 95 F 3 and B 20 D 2 were prezygotic and postzygotic, the latter included mortality at the larvae stage in both directions of crosses and sterility of male hybrids in intercrosses involving B 20 D 2 females and A 95 F 3 males.

40|$|For {{studying}} meiosis in males, large {{samples of}} Cacopsylla myrtilli (Wagner, 1947) (Hemiptera, Psyllidae) {{were collected in}} Norway, Sweden, Finland and northwest Russia. In addition to all-female populations, males were present in 10 out of 47 populations; still, all populations were highly female-biased, the proportion of males varying from 0. 1 % to 9. 1 %. These males are thus rare or so-called spanandric males. Males in northern Norway, Finland and northwest Russia showed normal chiasmate meiosis, while complete absence of chiasmata due to <b>asynapsis</b> was found in males collected in Norway and northern Sweden. In asynaptic meiosis, all univalent chromosomes divided during the first meiotic division resulting in incomplete second meiotic division and formation of diploid sperms. Hence, males in these populations are nonfunctional and do {{not contribute to the}} genetic constitution of the population, but appear in every generation as reversals from apomictic parthenogenesis and the mode of parthenogenesis is of obligatory type...|$|E
40|$|Lantana camara L. is a {{polyploid}} {{species with}} a basic chromosome number of 11 (x = l l). Chromosome association in 39 cultivars indicated the occurrence of univalents to heptavalents with bivalents predominating. Multivalent association analysis revealed the presence in South Africa of at least four different groups of L. camara at the diploid level. The potential for sexual reproduction must exist, {{at least at the}} diploid level, to account for differences in chromosomal behaviour that can only be attributed to hybridization. The possibility exists that the basic chromosome number may be lower than 11, or else postspeciation genomic evolution must have occurred. No cytogenetical correlation exists between the South African and Indian cultivars. The number of chiasmata per genome increases with an increase in the polyploid level. Most multivalents are of the chain type. Univalents during diakinesis are the result of <b>asynapsis.</b> Triploid and pentaploid plants display a markedly abnormal meiosis.   L. camara is a segmental allopolyploid species. </p...|$|E
40|$|Transcriptional {{silencing}} {{of the sex}} chromosomes during male meiosis (MSCI) is conserved among organisms {{with limited}} sex chromosome synapsis, including mammals. Since the 1990 s the prevailing view has been that MSCI in mammals is transient, with sex chromosome reactivation occurring as cells exit meiosis. Recently, we found that any chromosome region unsynapsed during pachytene {{of male and female}} mouse meiosis is subject to transcriptional silencing (MSUC), and we hypothesized that MSCI is an inevitable consequence of this more general meiotic silencing mechanism. Here, we provide direct evidence that <b>asynapsis</b> does indeed drive MSCI. We also show that a substantial degree of transcriptional repression of the sex chromosomes is retained postmeiotically, and we provide evidence that this postmeiotic repression is a downstream consequence of MSCI/MSUC. While this postmeiotic repression occurs after the loss of MSUC-related proteins at the end of prophase, other histone modifications associated with transcriptional repression have by then become established...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe four {{mammalian}} Argonaute {{family members}} are thought to share redundant functions in the microRNA pathway, yet only AGO 2 possesses the catalytic “slicer” function required for RNAi. Whether AGO 1, AGO 3, or AGO 4 possesses specialized functions remains unclear. Here we show that AGO 4 localizes to spermatocyte nuclei during meiotic prophase I, specifically at sites of <b>asynapsis</b> and the transcriptionally silenced XY subdomain, the sex body. We generated Ago 4 knockout mice and show that Ago 4 −/− spermatogonia initiate meiosis early, resulting from premature induction of retinoic acid-response genes. During prophase I, the sex body assembles incorrectly in Ago 4 −/− mice, leading to disrupted meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). This {{is associated with a}} dramatic loss of microRNAs, > 20 % of which arises from the X chromosome. Thus, AGO 4 regulates meiotic entry and MSCI in mammalian germ cells, implicating small RNA pathways in these processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{chromosomes}} of {{specimens of}} Oryctes nasicornis from three locations in France and two locations in Greece were studied. All karyotypes have an X-Y-autosome translocation: 18, neoXY. Two male specimens from France (subspecies nasicornis) displayed an unusual behaviour of their meiotic chromosomes in 30 – 50 % of spermatocytes, with <b>asynapsis</b> at pachynema, premature bivalent and chromosome split at metaphases I and II. The karyotypes remained balanced at metaphase I, {{but not at}} metaphase II. These particularities mimic the meiotic behaviour of B chromosomes and question about their existence, reported earlier in Spanish specimens. Due to the variable character of B chromosomes, complementary analyses are needed. To our knowledge, such meiotic particularities have not been described, beside cases of infertility. In specimens from Corsica (subspecies laevigatus) and Greece (subspecies kuntzeni), all spermatocytes I and II had a normal appearance. The meiotic particularity may thus be limited to male specimens from subspecies nasicornis...|$|E
40|$|The European cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis cerasi, {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest {{for which}} biological, genetic, and cytogenetic information is limited. We report here a cytogenetic analysis of 4 natural Greek populations of R. cerasi, all of them infected with the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. The mitotic karyotype and detailed photographic maps of the salivary gland polytene chromosomes of this pest species are presented here. The mitotic metaphase complement consists of 6 pairs of chromosomes, including one pair of heteromorphic sex chromosomes, with the male being the heterogametic sex. The analysis of the salivary gland polytene complement has shown a total of 5 long chromosomes (10 polytene arms) that correspond to the 5 autosomes of the mitotic nuclei and a heterochromatic mass corresponding to the sex chromosomes. The most prominent landmarks of each polytene chromosome, the "weak points", and the unusual <b>asynapsis</b> of homologous pairs of polytene chromosomes at certain regions of the polytene elements are also presented and discussed...|$|E
