5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} {{right hand to}} the head that caused Mayweather to retreat to the ropes and cover up. The {{momentum}} changed in the fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face. Then Mayweather landed a right hand {{on the bridge of}} Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> <b>and</b> Judah's foot movement was considerably slower than it had been earlier in the fight.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} scene, the nurse confesses {{to the mother}} that the child has been lost. Rover, also sitting in the room, listens before jumping {{through the window and}} racing down the street, going around <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> across a river. The dog makes its way to a slum and barges through each and every door; he finds the right one and enters. In an attic, the beggar woman is {{removing}} the clothing from the child; the dog enters and is driven off by the beggar.|$|E

A couple are shown arguing {{in one of the}} apartments while the group appear invisible beside them. The couple throw clothes and pillows at each other, among other things. Their aggressive behaviour is frozen each time while the group serenade them.

5|$|Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, {{becoming}} moody and listless. A spinal injury sustained {{during the}} war, {{for which he}} had to wear a corset, remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat in <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E
5|$|The early {{breakaway}} included four riders. These were Thomas Voeckler (Direct Énergie), Matthew Brammeier (Dimension Data), Florian Vachon (Fortuneo–Vital Concept) and Evaldas Siskevicius (Delko–Marseille Provence KTM). They {{were not}} allowed to build a large advantage, with the peloton keeping them just a few minutes ahead. The main action of the day came on the second-category final climb. In the breakaway, now just a minute ahead, Voeckler attacked and dropped the other breakaway riders. Nathan Haas (Dimension Data) attacked the peloton {{at the top of the}} climb, but made a mistake on <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> ended up in a field. On the climb, Marcel Kittel and Arnaud Démare were dropped, with Démare then pulling out of the race. Geraint Thomas was one of several riders to crash on the climb, but he was able to return to the peloton.|$|E
5|$|On 26 June 2008, Giovinco officially {{returned}} to Juventus. Giovinco played his first Serie A match for Juventus on 24 September, against Catania, before assisting both goals for Vincenzo Iaquinta in the 2–2 draw with BATE Borisov in the Champions League on 30 September, {{his first start}} for the club. On 7 December, he scored his first goal for Juventus, a free kick against Lecce in a 2–1 win. In October 2008, he signed a contract extension, tying him to Juventus until the summer of 2013. Despite a promising start, Giovinco did not play regularly and made sporadic appearances throughout the season, both in the starting eleven and off the bench, {{as he struggled to}} fit into Claudio Ranieri's preferred 4–4–2 formation, and was often used out of position on the left wing. However, he did earn praise in the media for the Man of the match performance that he produced when he was started in Juventus's home fixture in Serie A against Bologna on 14 March 2009, in which he first set-up a goal from <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> later scored another from a half-volley to help Juventus come from behind to win the match 4–1. He eventually finished the season with 3 goals in 27 appearances in all competitions, 2 of which came from 19 Serie A appearances.|$|E

However, Evans believed he had been lucky to gain some exposure before this profound change in the music world, and never had problems finding employers and recording opportunities.|$|E
25|$|The janus is {{the only}} piece in this game which is able to checkmate the opponent's king without the {{assistance}} of any other piece, if the king is in <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> the janus is two squares away on a diagonal, but this checkmate cannot be forced. This chess variant has been popular {{in places such as}} Europe. Several chess grandmasters have played this game including Viktor Korchnoi, Péter Lékó and Artur Yusupov.|$|E

25|$|Holyfield {{started the}} fight aggressively, {{pressing}} the 46-year-old Nielsen into {{the ropes and}} landing several hard jabs and hooks, knocking him down in the 3rd round. Despite getting a swollen eye in the 4th round, Nielsen kept on clowning to provoke Holyfield throughout the bout, prompting his trainer, Paul Duvill, to beg him to stop fooling around and focus on Holyfield. In round 10, Nielsen pushed a tired-looking Holyfield into the ropes {{with a series of}} combinations, before Holyfield turned it around. Holyfield pushed Nielsen into <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> battered him with combinations until the referee stopped the contest.|$|E
25|$|On 10 January 2010, Ronaldinho {{scored two}} goals against Juventus in an away match, sealing a 3–0 {{victory for the}} Rossoneri. In the {{following}} match, against Siena on 17 January 2010, Ronaldinho scored his first hat-trick for Milan when he converted a penalty kick, scored with a header from <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> finished with a wonder goal from 20 yards out. On 16 February, Ronaldinho played his first match against Manchester United in a Champions League game at the San Siro. He scored {{early in the game}} to give Milan the lead. Milan ended up losing the game 3–2, with a goal from Paul Scholes and two goals from Wayne Rooney.|$|E
25|$|If X plays corner opening move (best {{move for}} them), O should take center, {{and then an}} edge, forcing X to block in the next move. This will stop any forks from happening. When both X and O are perfect players and X chooses to start by marking a corner, O takes the center, and X takes the corner {{opposite}} the original. In that case, O is free to choose any edge as its second move. However, if X is not a perfect player and has played <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> then an edge, O should not play the opposite edge as its second move, because then X is not forced to block in the next move and can fork.|$|E

Pjölk's {{sinister}} {{plan was to}} murder all the early adopters of tele-o-vision with a single broadcast of Echsenfriedl's deadly eyes. The nerds can hear the audio of this broadcast, and react with repulsion and anger, attacking Pjölk's office.

25|$|For Uruguay's final group {{match against}} Italy on 24 June, Uruguay needed a win {{to advance to}} the {{knockout}} stage while Italy only needed a draw. Around the 79th minute and with the score at 0–0, Suárez clashed with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini while waiting for a cross. Replays showed that Suárez lunged at Chiellini and bit his shoulder (Chiellini showed bite marks), followed by Suárez falling and clutching his face. The controversial incident made headline news around the world. As the Italian players protested to Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodríguez for not penalising Suárez for the bite, Uruguay won <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> scored. The match would finish 1–0 to Uruguay as they qualified for the knockout stage and eliminated Italy.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} finally improved but {{the result}} stayed the same when Middlesbrough went to Old Trafford, where Matthew Bates started a Middlesbrough game {{for the first time}} since the end of the 2005–06 season. Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson had spoken before the game, hoping to banish the rift that existed between the two clubs. Things probably weren't helped when Pogatetz, defending a corner, put his hands around the back of Cristiano Ronaldo's neck <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> the United player went down, claiming a penalty. The spat continued when the players walked off the pitch for half time. Dimitar Berbatov's goal was the decisive moment in the game when he fired home to give his side a 1–0 victory, and left Middlesbrough hovering above the relegation zone on goal difference and without a win in eight games.|$|E

25|$|On Holy Saturday, Parma {{travelled}} to Udinese to face ex-employee Francesco Guidolin's charges. Udinese {{started the}} game well, {{but the first}} half was an even affair. Udinese {{might have had a}} man sent off when Giovinco was fouled when through on goal, but Roberto Pereyra was only booked. Udinese took the lead on the stroke of half-time with a calm finish from Kwadwo Asamoah. Antonio Di Natale doubled the lead just before the hour mark, but it was Parma who continued to press. The away side's reward eventually came from <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> captain Alessandro Lucarelli's calm finish from close range. As Parma looked for an equaliser, Udinese broke and Asamoah sealed victory with his second goal of the afternoon. Unlikely victories for Lecce against Roma and Fiorentina against Milan meant Parma were dragged back into the relegation fight.|$|E
25|$|Klitschko {{defeated}} WBO Heavyweight Champion Sultan Ibragimov at Madison Square Garden in New York City on 23 February 2008 {{to unify}} the IBF, IBO and WBO Heavyweight titles. The Klitschko-Ibragimov fight was the first heavyweight unification since Holyfield-Lewis in 1999. The unification clash with Ibragimov {{proved to be a}} huge disappointment for fans. Klitschko was very dominant from the first bell. He backed Ibragimov into <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> proceeded to push down Ibragimov's glove with his left hand so he could not throw a punch. Though Klitschko won every single round, the crowd in New York City began booing after the second round. The boos and jeers increased as the fight progressed in the same fashion. Ibragimov's corner was almost silent from the sixth round onwards, unable to give their man any meaningful advice. Klitschko did not fight again in the United States until 2015 where he defeated Bryant Jennings.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} World Heavyweight Championship between {{champion}} Batista and Triple H. In the opening seconds Flair grabbed Batista's leg, providing the distraction necessary for Triple H to attack Batista and gain an early advantage. Both men attempted to hit their finishers early on, but both attempts failed. Triple H went for another Pedigree attempt, but was backdropped over the top rope to the floor. Batista returned to the ring and walked into a spinebuster for a two count. Batista then went for a Batista Bomb, but Triple H hit Batista {{in the head with}} the championship belt. Batista performed a spinebuster on Triple H, but there was no referee to make the pin. Jack Doan then ran put and made the pin, but only got a two count. A second Batista Bomb attempt was stopped with a low blow by Triple H. Triple H then backed Batista into <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> punched him ten times. Batista then performed another Batista Bomb to win the match and retain the championship. After the match, Triple H pedigreed referee Mike Chioda, while Batista celebrated on the entrance ramp.|$|E
