However, some <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> 'local brands like Baojun could eventually become threats to their parent brands if they compete more against established models over time'. Shanghai-GM-Wuling sold 1.23 million vehicles in 2010, mainly commercial vans and trucks, of which about 700,000 units were a van called Sunshine.|$|E

25|$|The man {{disguised}} as a woman, {{now known as the}} rank of Naishi no Kami (head of the ceremonies committee), becomes the sheltered princess's confidante, whereas the woman {{disguised as}} a man becomes a Chūnagon (mid-ranking courtier). The siblings <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> they will be exposed, and so Naishi no Kami is even shyer than most ladies of the court, and the Chūnagon more aloof than is seemly. Despite this, the Chūnagon has platonic affairs with the elder Yoshino princess and the Lady of the Reikeiden. Naishi no Kami is pursued by men — the Crown Prince falls in love with Naishi no Kami based on her reputation, and pursuing her relentlessly. The Chūnagon's best friend, Saishō Chūjō, attempts to seduce Naishi no Kami for a period of two nights and a day.|$|E

Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and Squirrelflight <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> {{he is going to}} {{publicly}} announce their secret. Between then and the day of the Gathering, the three warn Ashfur that he will regret it if he reveals the secret. Although he is frightened, he refuses to listen to them. Right before the Gathering, the patrol of warriors going notices that both Ashfur and Squirrelflight are missing. On the way to the Gathering, they see Ashfur's body lying in the WindClan stream as if he had drowned. They take him back to camp and set him for vigil. Leafpool notices a slit in his neck, suggesting he was murdered. After the Gathering, Firestar announces that Ashfur's death was unknown and suspects a cat from ThunderClan may have killed him, and the three see Squirrelflight looking scared and holding her breath. The three vow to keep the recent events involving them, Squirrelflight, and Ashfur a secret.|$|E
500|$|Helen Martin (Nicole Callender), a nanny, is {{run over}} by a {{speeding}} truck whilst trying to stop the kidnapping of the six-year-old child she was caring for, Noah Parker (Anthony Pierini). Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) is assisted by Special Agent Derek Ames (Cliff Curtis) of the FBI, who takes a call from Noah, but the kidnapper hangs up before the phone can be traced. Bud questions Jason Peterson (Stink Fisher), when his truck matches that of the kidnapping vehicle. Bud turns off the cameras whilst interrogating, and later on, Jason is found dead, which causes Bud's reputation to be questioned, but is later cleared. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) finds several clues which reveal that Jason knew where Noah is, but the detectives <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> Noah may die as he is asthmatic and is without his inhaler. Megan's mother Joan (Joanna Cassidy) offers to help with the case, but only to help her re-election as a judge. Joan is using pamphlets, for her campaign, with a picture of Megan at the funeral of her father. Megan dislikes the photo, but Joan likes the picture as it shows [...] "strength and survival". A ransom is made, with the kidnappers wanting one million dollars for the return of Noah. A picture of Noah is sent, with Megan stating that he looks extremely sick. Bud and Derek, with the help of Joan, search many places associated with Jason, despite Bud knowing that Internal Affairs is considering voluntary manslaughter charges against him due to Jason's death.|$|E

500|$|Since the episode's initial airing, Blinky {{has been}} {{mentioned}} several times in news articles regarding nuclear waste and mutation. A reporter for the Lincoln Journal Star compared Blinky to a rainbow trout with two mouths caught in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 2005. The fish was mentioned in a National Review article discussing a legislation {{which would make it}} illegal to import, possess or release alive into California any live transgenic fish: [...] "Sounds like someone watched one too many episodes of The Simpsons with Blinky, the three-eyed fish that swims by the nuclear-power plant." [...] Matt Smith of SF Weekly compared Blinky to a type of fish found in San Francisco Bay, which, {{according to a study by}} the University of California, Davis, had a shrunken brain and misshapen body that had been caused by the dumping of toxic chemicals into the bay. In an article about the now closed nuclear weapons production facility Rocky Flats Plant, Brian Park of The Rocky Mountain Collegian joked that after its closure, [...] "years of clean up ensued and now the area is a wildlife refuge; no word yet if Blinky has been spotted." [...] Barbara Taormina of the North Shore Sunday wrote in her article about the new liquefied natural gas (LNG) pipeline in Massachusetts Bay: [...] "Will Blinky, the mutant three-eyed fish from The Simpsons be showing up in Massachusetts Bay? Probably not, but local environmentalists <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> digging for the new LNG pipeline may stir up radioactive waste dumped decades ago." [...] In his article about the nuclear power plant operator Exelon, Thomas M. Anderson of Kiplinger wrote: [...] "The thought of more nuclear power may conjure up images of the Three Mile Island accident or Blinky , but a growing number of policymakers and even environmentalists are coming to appreciate the advantages of atomic energy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite its pervasiveness, private tuition {{remains a}} {{controversial}} subject in Singapore. Students generally attend tuition classes {{to improve their}} weak academic performance.

Teachers and schools allegedly encouraged weaker students to receive private tuition as well, though the Ministry of Education's official stance is that [...] "Teachers should not recommend tuition to students or parents as a form of learning support". Some students who are doing well academically have had requested to have private tuition to further improve on their grades.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2009, the United States, France, and Russia {{proposed}} a U.N.-drafted deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program, {{in an effort}} to find a compromise between Iran's stated need for a nuclear reactor and the concerns of those who <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> Iran harbors a secret intent of developing a nuclear weapon. After some delay in responding, on 29 October, Ahmadinejad seemed to change his tone towards the deal. [...] "We welcome fuel exchange, nuclear co-operation, building of power plants and reactors and we are ready to co-operate," [...] he said in a live broadcast on state television.

2500|$|Turnout reached nearly 80% by {{the time}} the polls closed, and the Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party {{reportedly}} won 44 seats, with the People's Democratic Party winning only three seats (Phuentsholing in Chhukha, Goenkhatoe-Laya in Gasa and Sombeykha in Haa). The PDP's leader, Sangay Ngedup, who was also the ruling king's uncle, lost his own constituency by 380 votes. Reportedly, there were few differences between the platforms of the two parties, which might explain the unexpectedly uneven results; analysts <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> the small representation of the opposition may obstruct the functioning of the newly founded democratic system. Both parties had pledged to follow the king's guidelines of [...] "pursuing Gross National Happiness", and both party leaders had previously served in governments.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of Peña Nieto's {{security}} strategy, however, {{say that}} he has offered [...] "little sense" [...] in exactly how he will reduce the violence. During the three-month campaign, Peña Nieto was not explicit on his anti-crime strategy, and many analysts wonder whether Peña Nieto is holding back politically sensitive details in his security strategy or simply does not know yet how he will squelch the violence and carry out the next stage in Mexico's drug war. Moreover, U.S. officials <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> the return of Peña Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) after ruling Mexico for 71 years [...] may mean returning to the old PRI tactics of [...] "corruption [...] backroom deals" [...] with the cartels in exchange for bribes and relative peace.

2500|$|While {{the project}} covers the major {{intercity}} routes to Bristol and Wales, many long-distance services run beyond the planned electrification zone to stations such as , Worcester, , , , [...] and [...] These services {{would have to}} either retain diesel traction, or employ [...] "bi-mode" [...] trains capable of taking power either from overhead lines or from onboard diesel generators. Some transport groups in the Bristol area <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> this would {{mean the end of}} direct services from London to Weston-super-Mare, forcing commuters onto already crowded local services, currently worked by diesel multiple units approaching the end of their useful lives. These groups and local politicians are campaigning for the extension of electrification to Weston-super-Mare, as well as the complete electrification of the Severn Beach Line. A similar situation developed in Wales, as the electrification was not due to extend to Swansea, but it was announced in July 2012 that the line to Swansea from Cardiff would in fact be electrified.|$|E

2500|$|Islamic {{communities}} in Asia, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, have also experienced feminist movements which work to restrict polygynous practices. [...] Indonesian feminists have challenged these practices through {{the study and}} reinterpretation of religious texts. [...] Fatayat NU, a voluntary Muslim women's organization, was created in 1950 for middle-aged women who {{were a part of}} Nahdlatul Ulama, a Sunni Islam group, and wanted to have a voice. Initially experiencing membership issues due to large percentage of women who were married or uneducated, Fatayat NU began to gain power as institutions outside of Indonesia took notice of it and supported the organizations work. The women in Fatayat NU use Islam and the religious texts to justify their actions and guide their decisions, so women who have extensively studied the religion are crucial. [...] Out of the many controversial issues that Fatayat NU takes a stand on, polygyny is one that has recently come into contention. [...] Although polygyny in Indonesia was never very popular, some Muslim women <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> it is starting to gain more support. [...] Nahdlatul Ulama is one of the organizations that approves of polygyny as an Islamic practice, but Fatayat NU is taking a contradicting stance; the members believe that polygyny can only be possible if men and women are unequal, which goes against their interpretation of the Qur'an's message on gender status. Fatayat NU cites several hadiths in which Muhammad opposed the polygynous practices of his followers as evidence for why it is not a truly Islamic practice. [...] One hadith states: ...|$|E
