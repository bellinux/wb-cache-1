5|$|Glenwood Canyon {{has served}} as the primary {{transportation}} artery through the Rocky Mountains, even before the creation of U.S. highways. Railroads have used the canyon since 1887 and <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> was built through the canyon in the early 20th century. The first paved road was built from 1936 to 1938 at a cost of $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million today).|$|E
5|$|The first road to use {{the general}} {{alignment}} of modern Route 14 was called the El Camino Sierra, or Sierra Highway, which extended from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe. <b>A</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> was completed in the 1910s from {{what had been a}} pack trail. The Los Angeles Times declared El Camino Sierra complete in 1931, when the portion from Mojave to the Owens Valley, along modern US 395, was paved.|$|E

5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to notification from Air Traffic Control, three ambulances from Perth were despatched {{in the direction}} of the crash site, known to be somewhere between Chidlow and York. The crash site was several miles from the road so the ambulance crews travelled eastwards all the way to York without sighting a fire. The crews were eventually guided back along the main road and then along <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> that enabled them to drive to within three or four miles of the crash site. The crews then took their first-aid boxes and set out on foot.|$|E
5|$|The Barlow Road {{begins at}} The Dalles and heads south to Tygh Valley (some {{consider}} Tygh Valley {{to be the}} beginning), then turns west and roughly parallels the White River on the north and then west, crosses the south shoulder of Mount Hood at Barlow Pass, follows Camp Creek and the Sandy River for some way, and finally leads to Oregon City. The road was rendered largely irrelevant in the early 1900s by {{the construction of the}} Mount Hood Highway. It still exists as <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> in some places, while many other parts have been paved over by newer streets and highways.|$|E

5|$|The first {{numbered}} highway {{along the}} SR85 corridor {{was established in}} 1927 between Gila Bend and Phoenix as US80. At the time, it was only paved from Phoenix to Hassayampa. Although not paved between Hassayampa and Gila Bend, it was an improved road. This original routing of US80 still exists as Old US80 west of the SR85 alignment. <b>A</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> between Gila Bend and Ajo did exist at this time, {{but it was not}} a part of the state highway system. By 1935, the entire route of US80 between Gila Bend and Phoenix had been paved. The road south of Gila Bend had also been improved to a gravel road.|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 93 northwest of Congress and southeast of Nothing. Beginning at US 93 southbound, SR 97 crosses US 93 northbound after several feet. It crosses through a desert region in a northeasterly direction, meeting <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> that connects back to US 93. SR 97 curves northward before heading eastward at an intersection with Burro Creek Road. Again turning northeastward, the roadway meets various local roads, {{most of them}} dirt. The highway meets its northern terminus at SR 96, which continues northwestward toward Bagdad.|$|E
5|$|The Beckwourth Trail was the {{earliest}} predecessor of SR 70, {{which was a}} spur of the California Trail. This {{was followed by the}} railroad, mostly built on the route of the trail; <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> was needed for construction that was later converted into part of the present state highway. Construction on the highway began in 1928, which involved the boring of three tunnels. Previously, the road was signed as U.S. Route 40 Alternate, crossing the Sierra Nevada at a lower elevation than Donner Pass on US 40, now Interstate 80 (I-80). The road was renumbered SR 70 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Today, portions of SR 70 have been upgraded to a four-lane expressway, and even a freeway in a few locations.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} NY292 between West Patterson and Whaley Lake {{originated}} as <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> named the Patterson–Dutchess County Line Road. This road was reconstructed in 1919 and {{became part of}} NY39, a highway extending from Poughkeepsie to Patterson by way of West Pawling, in the 1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the segment of NY39 from East Fishkill to West Patterson was incorporated into the new NY52. By {{the end of the}} 1930s, the portion of NY52 from Stormville to West Patterson was renumbered to NY216. In 1970, NY216 was truncated to its current length and NY216's former alignment from West Pawling to Patterson was renumbered to NY292.|$|E
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar. On the retirement in 1956 of a Mr and Mrs Dendy, who operated North Bar from 1948 to 1956 and lived in the station apartment, North station was abandoned, and demolished in the 1960s owing to dry rot. South Bar continued to operate as a refreshment kiosk.|$|E
5|$|By 1932, US-36 {{headed west}} from Norton toward Oberlin instead of {{southwest}} toward Selden, {{and all of}} what is K-383 became part of US-83. The entire route from Selden to Nebraska had been straightened, mostly paralleling the railroad instead of following section lines, except for through Oronoque and Jennings. US-83 was a gravel road from Selden to the NortonPhillips county line, east of which the highway remained <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> until it was graveled in 1937. The highway was relocated straight through Jennings and to a path with fewer turns through Oronoque in 1938; that same year, the highway was paved with a bituminous surface along the US-36 concurrency. US-83 was paved from the US-36 split to the Nebraska state line in 1940. The highway was paved from Selden to Dresden by 1945 and from Dresden to US-36 west of Norton in 1948. US-383 {{was assigned to the}} entire length of the K-383 corridor and beyond in both directions by 1945.|$|E

50|$|SR 285 {{was first}} {{designated}} in 1931 as an gravel spur route from SR 265 near Lore City to Senecaville. Within one year, the route was extended north via <b>an</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> to US 40 in Old Washington. By 1935, the route {{was extended to}} its current northern terminus at US 22. SR 285 was extended to its current southern terminus in Caldwell (at the time, US 21) by 1937. No major changes have occurred to the route since that time.|$|R
5|$|SR76 {{then goes}} through Pala and the Pala Indian Reservation, {{providing}} access to the Pala Casino and intersecting CR S16, the turnoff to the Pala Mission and Temecula. Continuing to parallel the San Luis Rey River, SR76 passes by the Wilderness Gardens County Park before entering the community of Pauma Valley and meeting the southern terminus of CR S7 (Nate Harrison Grade), <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> leading into Palomar Mountain State Park. SR76 intersects the southern leg of CR S6 (Valley Center Road), leading to Valley Center and Escondido. East of the small Yuima Indian Reservation, it then encounters the northern leg of CRS6, the southern approach to the Palomar Observatory and Palomar Mountain State Park, {{as well as the}} community of La Jolla Amago. It then briefly passes through the Cleveland National Forest and meets the eastern terminus of CR S7, the eastern approach to Palomar Mountain. SR76 then passes along the shores of Lake Henshaw before terminating at the intersection with SR 79 at Morettis Junction, southeast of Lake Henshaw.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Seminole Wars, Americans began {{settling}} at isolated {{points along}} the coast in what is now the park, from the Ten Thousand Islands to Cape Sable. Communities developed on the two largest pieces of dry ground in the area, on Chokoloskee Island and at Flamingo on Cape Sable, both of which established post offices in the early 1890s. Chokoloskee Island is a shell mound, a midden built roughly 20feet (6m) high over thousands of years of occupation by the Calusa. The settlements in Chokoloskee and Flamingo served as trading centers for small populations of farmers, fishermen and charcoal burners settled in the Ten Thousand Islands. Both settlements and the more isolated homesteads could only be reached by boat until well into the 20th century. Everglades City, on the mainland near Chokoloskee, enjoyed a brief period of prosperity when, beginning in 1920, it served as the headquarters for construction of the Tamiami Trail. <b>A</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> from Florida City reached Flamingo in 1922, while a causeway finally connected Chokoloskee to the mainland's Everglades City in 1956. After the park was established, residents of Flamingo were bought out, and the site was incorporated into the park as a visitor center.|$|E
5|$|The Western Pacific Railroad {{completed}} its main line into California in 1909. This followed the old Beckwourth Trail east of Quincy, {{but to the}} west it reached Oroville and Marysville via the Feather River Canyon. While building the railroad, the Utah Construction Company had created <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> through the canyon to assist with construction; citizens created the Plumas County Road Association in 1911 to push for improvements to this roadway and creation of a year-round route between Oroville and Quincy (the existing route over the ridges was closed {{for at least four}} months each winter). The first state highway bond issue, passed by the state's voters in 1910, included a Route 30 connecting Oroville with Quincy. Plumas County surveyor Arthur W. Keddie surveyed the Feather River Canyon route for the California Highway Commission in 1913, but the state announced in 1916 that the existing ridge route would be improved. After much debate, the state legislative road committee included the statement that this route would follow the Feather River in the 1919 amendment authorizing a third bond issue; instead of keeping it as Route 30, the Highway Commission changed the designation to an extension of the short Richvale-Oroville (now SR 162) Route 21, which was also part of the first bond issue.|$|E
