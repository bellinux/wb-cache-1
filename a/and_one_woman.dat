5|$|Edward Christian, {{brother of}} Fletcher Christian, had been {{appointed}} Chief Justice of the Isle of Ely in 1800 by the Bishop of Ely.

The rioters were tried in the assizes at Ely during the week commencing June 1816. 23 men <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>woman</b> were condemned, of which five were subsequently hanged.

5|$|Prior to the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Obergefell v.

The Obergefell {{decision in}} June 2015 invalidated these state constitutional amendments insofar as they prevented same-sex couples from marrying, even though the actual text of these amendments remain written into the state constitutions.|$|E
