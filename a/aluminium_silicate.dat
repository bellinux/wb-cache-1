25|$|In {{order to}} obtain alum from alunite, it is {{calcined}} and then exposed to the action of air for a considerable time. During this exposure it is kept continually moistened with water, so that it ultimately falls to a very fine powder. This powder is then lixiviated with hot water, the liquor decanted, and the alum allowed to crystallize. The alum schists employed {{in the manufacture of}} alum are mixtures of iron pyrite, <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> and various bituminous substances, and are found in upper Bavaria, Bohemia, Belgium, and Scotland. These are either roasted or exposed to the weathering action of the air. In the roasting process, sulfuric acid is formed and acts on the clay to form aluminium sulfate, a similar condition of affairs being produced during weathering. The mass is now systematically extracted with water, and a solution of aluminium sulfate of specific gravity 1.16 is prepared. This solution is allowed to stand for some time (in order that any calcium sulfate and basic ferric sulfate may separate), and is then evaporated until ferrous sulfate crystallizes on cooling; it is then drawn off and evaporated until it attains a specific gravity of 1.40. It is now allowed to stand for some time, decanted from any sediment, and finally mixed with the calculated quantity of potassium sulfate, well agitated, and the alum is thrown down as a finely divided precipitate of alum meal. If much iron should be present in the shale then it is preferable to use potassium chloride in place of potassium sulfate.|$|E
500|$|Wide-scale {{production}} is credited to Edward Goodrich Acheson in 1890. Acheson was [...] attempting to prepare artificial diamonds when he heated {{a mixture of}} clay (<b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate)</b> and powdered coke (carbon) in an iron bowl. [...] He called the blue crystals that formed carborundum, believing {{it to be a}} new compound of carbon and aluminium, similar to corundum. [...] In 1893, Ferdinand Henri Moissan discovered the very rare naturally occurring SiC mineral while examining rock samples found in the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona. [...] The mineral was named moissanite in his honor. [...] Moissan also synthesized SiC by several routes, including dissolution of carbon in molten silicon, melting a mixture of calcium carbide and silica, and by reducing silica with carbon in an electric furnace.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} are {{reported on the}} use of both synthetic and natural zeolites in the diets of two strains of laying hens (56 weeks old). The synthetic zeolite, sodium zeolite A (SZA) was added to layer diets at four levels of inclusion (O. O%, O- 75 %, 1. 125 %; 1. 5 %). SZA did not improve or adversely effect layer performance as measured by several parameters. The incidence of egg shell defects as measured by four major categories were not influenced by the inclusion of SZA in the diet. Shell quality measured by conventional methods was not influenced by dietary treatment. The use of three <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicates</b> (natural zeolite 23, sodium bentonite, kaolin) included at two levels (2. 5 % and 5. 0 %) did not improve or adversely affect layer performance.

Shell defects and shell quality were not influenced by these <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicates.</b> In both experiments there was a significant strain effect on the usual production paremeters. Dietary treatment gave the same production and shell quality parameters for the two strains.

40|$|ArticleThis is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Taylor & Francis via the DOI in this record. Dredging activities to extend, deepen and maintain access to harbours generate significant volumes of waste dredged material. Some ways are investigated to add value to these sediments. One solution described here is their use in road construction following treatment with hydraulic binders. This paper presents the characterisation of four sediments, in their raw state and after 90 days of curing following stabilisation treatment with lime and cement, {{using a combination of}} novel and established analytical techniques to investigate subsequent changes in mineralogy. These sediments are classified as fine, moderately to highly organic and highly plastic and their behaviour is linked to the presence of smectite clays. The main minerals found in the sediments using X-rays diffraction (XRD) and automated mineralogy are quartz, calcite, feldspars, <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicates,</b> pyrite and halite. Stabilisation was found to improve the mechanical performances of all the sediments. The formation of cementitious hydrates was not specifically detected using automated mineralogy or XRD. However, a decrease in the percentage volume of <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicates</b> and aluminium-iron silicates and an increase of the percentage volume of feldspars and carbonates was observed.

5000|$|Apply {{investment}} materials: The ceramic mould, {{known as}} the investment, is produced by repeating a series of steps—coating, stuccoing, and hardening—until a desired thickness is achieved. Coating involves dipping a pattern cluster into a slurry of fine refractory material and then draining to create a uniform surface coating. Fine materials are used in this first step, also called a prime coat, to preserve fine details from the mould. Stuccoing applies coarse ceramic particles by dipping patterns into a fluidised bed, placing it in a rainfall-sander, or by applying materials by hand. Hardening allows coatings to cure. These steps are repeated until the investment reaches its required thickness—usually 5 to 15 mm. Investment moulds are left to dry completely, which can take 16 to 48 hours. Drying can be accelerated by applying a vacuum or minimizing environmental humidity. Investment moulds can also be created by placing the pattern clusters into a flask and then pouring liquid investment material from above. The flask is then vibrated to allow entrapped air to escape and help the investment material fill any small voids. [...] Common refractory materials used to create the investments are: silica, zircon, various <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicates,</b> and alumina. Silica is usually used in the fused silica form, but sometimes quartz is used because it is less expensive. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>silicates</b> are a mixture of alumina and silica, where commonly used mixtures have an alumina content from 42 to 72%; at 72% alumina the compound is known as mullite. During the primary coat(s), zircon-based refractories are commonly used, because zirconium {{is less likely to}} react with the molten metal. Prior to silica, a mixture of plaster and ground up old molds (chamotte) was used. The binders used to hold the refractory material in place include: ethyl silicate (alcohol-based and chemically set), colloidal silica (water-based, also known as silica sol, set by drying), sodium silicate, and a hybrid of these controlled for pH and viscosity.|$|R
