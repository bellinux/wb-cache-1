5|$|Initial {{examination}} for {{the construction}} of what would become Penticton Regional Airport began in 1937, at two locations.

The land for the airport was expropriated from the band in 1949 under the War Measures <b>Act,</b> <b>with</b> the preliminary development of the airfield completed in 1941. Because of wartime military air transportation concerns, the airport acted as an emergency landing strip until its tarmac was completed. Rights for a temporary public use airport were secured in 1945for an operation of 24hours a day. In 1946, more land was acquired from the Penticton Indian Band for the airport's use.|$|E
