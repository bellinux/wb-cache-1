40|$|INTRODUCTION: Rotavirus is {{the main}} {{etiologic}} agent of <b>acute</b> infectious <b>diarrhea</b> in children worldwide. Considering that a rotavirus vaccine (G 1 P 8, strain RIX 4414) {{was added to the}} Brazilian vaccination schedule in 2006, we aimed to study its effectiveness and safety regarding intestinal intussusception. METHODS: A quasi-experimental trial was performed in which the primary outcome was the number of hospitalizations that were presumably due to <b>acute</b> infectious <b>diarrhea</b> per 100, 000 children at risk (0 - 4 years old). The secondary outcomes included mortality due to <b>acute</b> infectious <b>diarrhea</b> and the intestinal intussusception rates in children in the same age range. We analyzed three scenarios: Health Division XIII of the State of S&# 227;o Paulo (DRS XIII) from 2002 to 2008, the State of S&# 227;o Paulo, and Brazil from 2002 to 2012. RESULTS: The averages of the hospitalization rates for 100, 000 children in the pre- and post-vaccination periods were 1, 413 and 959, respectively, for DRS XIII (RR= 0. 67), 312 and 249, respectively, for the State of S&# 227;o Paulo (RR= 0. 79), and 718 and 576, respectively, for Brazil (RR= 0. 8). The mortality rate per 100, 000 children in the pre- and post-vaccination periods was 2. 0 and 1. 3, respectively, for DRS XIII (RR= 0. 66), 5. 5 and 2. 5, respectively, for the State of S&# 227;o Paulo (RR= 0. 47), and 15. 0 and 8. 0, respectively, for Brazil (RR= 0. 53). The average annual rates of intussusception for 100, 000 children in DRS XIII were 28. 0 and 22. 0 (RR= 0. 77) in the pre- and post-vaccination periods, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A monovalent rotavirus vaccine was demonstrated to be effective in preventing the hospitalizations and deaths of children that were presumably due to <b>acute</b> infectious <b>diarrhea,</b> without increasing the risk of intestinal intussusception...|$|R
40|$|Background Diarrhea is {{the major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in children. Probiotics can decrease the frequency and duration of diarrhea. There are two types of probiotics, live and tyndallized. Tyndallized probiotics have been stetilized, so they are unable to produce active metabolites, but may have an effect on human immunity. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of supplementing WHO standard therapy with tyndallized probiotics in children with <b>acute,</b> watery <b>diarrhea.</b> Methods We performed a randomized, single-blind, controlled trial in children aged 3 - 60 months who were diagnosed with <b>acute,</b> watery <b>diarrhea</b> at Gunungsitoh General Hospital, Nias, North Sumatera. Subjects were collected by consecutive sampling by way of parent interviews. Results One hundred subjects with <b>acute,</b> watery <b>diarrhea</b> were divided into 2 groups of 50. One group was treated with only WHO standard therapy for <b>acute,</b> watery <b>diarrhea.</b> The other group was treated by WHO standard therapy with the addition of tyndallized probiotics. There {{were no significant differences in}} basic characteristics between the two groups. Diarrheal duration for the group receiving WHO standard therapy only was 3. 95 ± 1. 3 days, while that of the group receiving both WHO standard therapy and tyndallized probiotics was 4. 6 ± 2. 3 days (P > 0. 05). Diarrheal frequency on the fifth day in the WHO standard therapy group was 1. 90 ± 0. 99 times per day, while that of the tyndalhzed probiotic group was 1. 56 ± 0. 67 times per day (P > 0. 05). Conclusion There were no significant differences between WHO standard therapy alone and WHO standard therapy with the addition of tyndallized probiotics for decreasing the duration and frequency of diarrhea in children.
