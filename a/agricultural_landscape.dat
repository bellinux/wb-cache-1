A generic approach comprising three types of monitoring is developed for measuring success of reconciliation strategies: monitoring of the intensity of the conflict between stakeholders, of the social and economic effects on farmers, and of the status and trends in biodiversity.

40|$|Diverse <b>agricultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> {{have been}} shown to support many {{ecosystem}} services including clean water, species conservation, and carbon sequestration. However, far less is known about the role of diverse <b>agricultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> in <b>agricultural</b> pest control. This research investigated how diverse <b>agricultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> affect insect pest dynamics and evolution. A comprehensive literature review of this subject revealed that direct effects of landscape diversity on insect pest control have been largely ignored. Nevertheless, increases in pest mortality and decreases in fecundity are likely with increasing landscape diversification. Field surveys of insect populations in <b>agricultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> of varying complexity across New York further illuminated landscape-insect relationships. Surveys showed that populations of insect pests in field corn were generally lower and that natural enemy populations were generally higher as <b>agricultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> increased in their diversity. Spatially-explicit modeling further explored landscape-insect relationships and considered pests with varied life histories and the influence of crop rotation and economic thresholds. Model results suggested that insect diet breadth and regional crop management play pivotal roles in landscape-insect relationships. Furthermore, pest management may be more intense in highly agricultural than in diverse landscapes, which may reduce apparent pest control benefits of landscape diversification. Finally, the role of diverse landscapes in slowing the evolution of insect resistance to Bt crops was explored. A detailed study of the European corn borer’s host utilization, fecundity, and U. S. distribution indicated that diverse <b>agricultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> are not likely to substantively slow the evolution of resistance to Bt corn for this pest. Together, this research supports pest control as an important ecosystem service of diverse <b>agricultural</b> <b>landscapes.</b> Additionally, it highlights the roles that insect life history and regional pest management play in shaping landscapeinsect relationships...|$|R

Overall, its stocks seem to be declining in the European part of its range since the 1970s. In North America, the populations {{seem to have been}} stable by contrast, except in the east. The increase and decline seem to be reactions to changing land use, with an increase as the number of agricultural workers declined after World War II and land fell fallow, declining again when land consolidation (see e.g. Flurbereinigung) had seriously depleted the number of hedgerows and similar elevated growth formerly common amidst the <b>agricultural</b> <b>landscape.</b> For such a predatory bird, the indiscriminate use of pesticides (which will accumulate in adult carnivores and inhibit breeding success) around the 1960s probably had a detrimental influence on stocks too.|$|E

He shows in his poetry that originally otium was a military concept, the disuse of one's weapons. Tibullus prefers the rustic <b>agricultural</b> <b>landscape</b> and a simple life. He indicates that while he would do agricultural work, he would only be interested in doing it sometimes (interdum) and therefore inserts otium (peace and leisure time) into agricultural life. He expresses in his attitude of his poetry that the qualities of the Epicurean resolve to quietism (occultism—religious mysticism) and pacifism (abstention from violence) as the pursuits of ignobile otium (mean leisure) - peace of mind (peace with one's self) and detachment from worldy ambitions.|$|E

This has been cause for concern mainly due to the often-irreversible damage done to the otherwise productive <b>agricultural</b> <b>landscapes.</b> Agro-ecology is proclaimed to be deteriorating due to eroding integrity of connected ecological mosaics and vulnerability to climate change. This has contributed to declining species diversity, loss of buffer vegetation, fragmentation of habitats, and loss of natural pollinators or predators, which eventually leads to decline in ecosystem services. Currently, a hierarchy of conservation initiatives is being considered to restore ecological integrity of <b>agricultural</b> <b>landscapes.</b> However, the challenge of identifying a suitable conservation strategy is a daunting task in view of socio-ecological factors that may constrain the choice of available strategies.
