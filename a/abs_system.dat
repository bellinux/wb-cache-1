The Xtrac 672 6-speed transversal and sequential gearbox changes gears in 20ms. The traction control developed by Bosch with 12 stage traction control and the renewed <b>ABS</b> <b>system,</b> allows the vehicle to further adapt to the driver's driving style. The aerodynamics feature new and updated canards on the front, as well as a vertical stabilizer supporting the main rear wing. Beside using R Evolución's body, the Zonda Revolución also features a DRS (Drag Reduction System) on the rear wing. The system has two different operating modes, both can be activated by the driver at any time. The manual system is controlled with the DRS button on the steering wheel. The rear wing changes between maximum and minimum down-force settings, at the occurrence of a lateral acceleration of 0.8 g and a minimum speed of [...] Holding down the DRS for more than two seconds engages the DRS to work automatically according to the algorithms developed by the Pagani engineers during the development phase. The main rear wing also utilises mounts on the side of the vehicle alongside a smaller wing at the end of the vertical stabiliser. The Brembo braking system adopts new CCMR discs derived from F1 technology. With a weight saving of 15% compared to the previous CCM discs, the CCMR offer higher stiffness and lower operating temperatures on extreme track use. This contributes to the life of the disc which is increased by four times, with no sign of fading and a significant overall increase in braking power.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{detailed study of}} the effect of spin‐quantization and spin–orbit coupling on the transition energies of triplet state dimers or small excitons. We consider both translationally equivalent (AA) and inequivalent (AB) dimers. For the AA and <b>AB</b> <b>systems,</b> we calculate transition frequency shifts induced by the spin–orbital coupling and by the spin–spin interactions between the plus (+) and minus (−) states of the dimer. As a result of these combined effects the selective coupling between the ± states of the singlet and the ± states of the triplet AA dimer system is not operative in the <b>AB</b> <b>system.</b> Furthermore, the role of the gas‐to‐crystal shifts and the intermolecular spin–spin interactions is to change the observed transition frequencies and hence cause a dispersion in the frequencies of the ± states. The relationship between such a dispersion in the AA and the same <b>AB</b> <b>system</b> is directly related to molecular parameters such as the strength of spin–orbital coupling. These results are applied to three experimental findings obtained for different dimer systems—phenazine, naphthalene, and tetrachlorobenzene dimers isolated in isotopically mixed crystals at T< 2 [*]°K.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of XMM-Newton X-ray {{observations}} of the Mira <b>AB</b> binary <b>system,</b> which consists of a pulsating, asymptotic giant branch primary and nearby (~ 0. 6 '' separation) secondary of uncertain nature. The EPIC CCD (MOS and pn) X-ray spectra of Mira AB are relatively soft, peaking at ~ 1 keV, with only very weak emission at energies > 3 keV; lines of Ne IX, Ne X, and O VIII are apparent. Spectral modeling indicates a characteristic temperature T_X ~ 10 ^ 7 K and intrinsic luminosity L_X ~ 5 x 10 ^ 29 erg s^{- 1 }, and suggests enhanced abundances of O and, possibly, Ne and Si in the X-ray-emitting plasma. Overall, the X-ray spectrum and luminosity of the Mira <b>AB</b> <b>system</b> more closely resemble those of late-type, pre-main sequence stars or late-type, magnetically active main sequence stars than those of accreting white dwarfs.

We present a total of 598 high-resolution echelle spectra from our robotic facility STELLA from 2006 - 2012 which we used to compute orbital elements of unprecedented accuracy.
