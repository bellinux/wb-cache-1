5|$|At {{a meeting}} with church and cathedral officials, held on 11 June, reporters noted that three people had been shot within {{the city in the}} {{previous}} 72 hours. The attendees produced a letter by the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, on behalf of the Dean and Canons of Manchester Cathedral to Sony. It stated that they were currently seeking the advice of lawyers in the matter, and reserved their legal position in relation to the same. It demanded a substantial donation for the cathedral's work with youth in resisting the culture of gun crime and other forms of violence in our society. It further demanded the immediate withdrawal of the game, and that Sony not re-issue it without removing the section of the game containing the Cathedral interior. Govender described the use of images of the cathedral as virtual desecration. The letter stressed that they were in consultation with their lawyers and urged Sony to contact them so there can be a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the matter. Govender told reporters that the church officials had only been told of the content on 8 June 2007, and, after watching footage of gameplay posted on YouTube, said they were dismayed beyond belief and were shocked to see a place of worship being presented to youths as a place where guns may be fired, and that every year, they invite hundreds of teenagers to see the Cathedral and appreciate it as an alternative to violence. They added that it was <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> have a game like this undermining such important work. They also sought that Sony apologise unreservedly.|$|E
25|$|Habib Bourguiba {{was officially}} born on August 3, 1903, in Monastir to Ali Bourguiba (1850–1925) and Fattouma Khefacha (1861–1913). Being their eighth and last child, his birth was <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> {{his mother and}} a worry to his father, who {{conceived}} him in an advanced age. Born into a modest family, the young Habib {{was raised in a}} female environment and was marked by gender inequality. Despite his financial conditions, Ali Bourguiba decided to invest his money in the education of his son and therefore, avoid him his fate of being enrolled in the army. Likewise, he sent his son to Tunis, circa 1907, to live with his brother M'hamed, in order to study in elementary school of Sadiki. Separated from his mother at 5, he lived in modest conditions in the capital city, and the Jellaz Affair made a deep impression on him. In 1913, he obtained his Certificat d'études primaires to the relief of his father, exempting him from military service and permitted him to pursue his secondary education in Sadiki. However, in the same year, he lost his mother at the age of 10, which marked his entire life.|$|E

500|$|... "Heartbreaker" [...] is a {{moderately}} slow, mid-tempo dance-pop track, with hip-hop and R influences. According {{to the music}} sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is written in the key of D♭ major, while the beat is set in common time which moves at a moderate pace of 100 beats per minute. It has a sequence of D–Bm–D as its chord progression. Carey's vocals in the song span from the note of D3 to the high note of C7. The song has a [...] "percolating beat" [...] over which Carey sings with nasal, silken and declarative vocals. The verses are melismatic, meaning, there are multiple notes sung per word or syllable with rapid yet seamless transitions. For example, Carey starts the second verse already in mid-belt [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> be" [...] while then going off into a whispering coo for [...] "so euphoric and weak." ...|$|E
500|$|Although a level {{sharing the}} same name {{appeared}} in Sonic & Knuckles, the original version of Hidden Palace was left unfinished until the remastered iOS port was released in December 2013, which features a redesigned version of the level as an optional stage. Sega also provided some magazines with mockup images that showed another scrapped level, the desert-themed Dust Hill Zone, and the stolen 1992 prototype features an unused level slot titled [...] "Genocide City". Naka has also alluded to another scrapped level in the Sonic Jam Official Strategy Guide, explaining why the Metropolis Zone had three parts to it, while every other level only had two: [...] "Due to problems with the story, Act 3 {{was going to be}} a different Zone that would only appear once, but since it was cut, we still wanted to have something after Act 2. So that's why there are three acts in this one. We had already finished the map, and it would have been <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> waste it, so this is what we went with." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Improbable" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B+". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called the script [...] "very witty". The two wrote that [...] "the brilliance of Chris Carter's direction" [...] allowed the viewer of the episode to see it [...] "from God's point of view". Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode [...] "is not as smart as it thinks it is. But it's still pretty smart." [...] John Keegan, writing for Critical Myth, on the other hand, gave the episode a more mixed review {{and gave it a}} 6 out of 10 rating. He wrote that [...] "overall, this episode was amusing enough, but there was nothing about it that would prompt me to rank it as highly as the more inspired [...] "lite" [...] episodes of previous seasons. And considering that the sixth and seventh seasons suffered tremendously from too many episodes like this, it's <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> see them do it again." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode [...] "bizarre yet amusing" [...] and said that the central numerology story [...] "doesn't feel like it's enough to sustain an entire episode".|$|E

500|$|Numerous {{publications}} {{declared the}} gameplay was {{an improvement over}} the original. John Davison of GamePro wrote [...] "BioWare has done a spectacular job moving the role playing genre forward, and blending disparate gameplay styles into genuinely exciting sci-fi epic." [...] VanOrd praised Mass Effect 2 for possessing an identity, which was something that its predecessor lacked. He noted that the shooting is [...] "more immediate and satisfying, which keeps the pace moving and intensifies the violence of each encounter". Similarly, GameSpys Gerald Villoria observed that, while the original Mass Effect [...] "walked the line between RPG and shooter [...] Mass Effect 2 has become a much more focused shooter experience". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com credited the combat for being more balanced, stating that the game encourages players to use different weapon classes and squad abilities when the situation requires it. Despite the praise, some publications like GameCritics and RPGamer expressed concerns about the game's simplified RPG elements, calling it [...] "stripped-down" [...] and with a [...] "dumbed-down feeling". Some reviewers also criticized the slow planet scanning. Game Revolution {{felt it was a}} [...] "chore, mandatory if you want upgrades and boring because there is no tension or challenge", but ultimately concluded that the game as a whole [...] "does more than enough {{to live up to its}} predecessor". Italian journalist Jaime d'Alessandro of la Repubblica defined Mass Effect 2 as [...] "dazzling" [...] and [...] "a great sci-fi fresco that would be <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> miss." ...|$|E

Of his exit, Lapinskas said [...] "I'm having a fantastic time working on EastEnders and {{playing the role of}} Anthony Moon. Working with David Essex, Tony Discipline and the EastEnders cast has been an absolute pleasure. Although I will really miss EastEnders and everyone involved, I am very excited about future projects and what is next for me as an actor." [...] Lapinskas revealed that Anthony's exit plot sees him make a [...] "big mistake". Anthony realises how much he loves Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) but is unsure how to deal with her brother and father Joey (David Witts) and Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) respectively. Speaking to Soaplife, Lapinskas said [...] "Joey manipulates Anthony into challenging Derek, which is a big mistake. I can't give too much away, but I can tell you that after going up against Derek, Anthony {{has no choice but to}} leave the Square." [...] Magazine reports claim that Anthony packs his bags after losing everything to Joey and Derek, revising his gambling problem. Lapinskas hopes that Anthony will return someday. In an interview with Inside Soap, Lapinskas said that EastEnders was his first job outside of drama school and added that he has learnt a lot from the people he worked with. He also added [...] "I was quite disappointed when I found out Anthony {{would be leaving}}, I'd have liked to do a lot more stuff with him.
