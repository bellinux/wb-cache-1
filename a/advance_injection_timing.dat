40|$|Engine {{performance}} {{improvement and}} exhaust emissions reduction {{are the two}} most important issues to develop a more efficient engine with less environmental impact. For a diesel engine, injection timing {{is one of the major}} parameters that affect the engine performance and emissions. Now-a-days, alternative fuels for internal combustion engines have created interest among the researchers around the world due to the limited reserve and rapid depletion of petroleum based fuels. In this paper, studies focused on characterizing influence of injection timing on engine performance and exhaust emissions have been critically reviewed where diesel, biodiesel, alcohol and other alternative fuels are used. In case of diesel fuel, advancement in injection timing results in lower carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emission; though it increases nitrogen oxides (NO x) emission. <b>Advance</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> increases brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and decreases brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). Biodiesel-diesel blends produce more HC and CO emission, but reduce NO x emission when injection timing is retarded. Advancement in injection timing results in higher exhaust gas temperature with increase of biodiesel percentage in the blends...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) combustion can extend {{the operation of}} diesel engine to achieve better performance. HCCI can reduce NOx emissions by the low combustion temperatures resulted from {{the introduction of a}} fraction of EGR. Also, it can reduce PM by utilizing the premixed charge combustion. Direct injection multi-cylinder water cooled diesel engine used in this study. The tests procedure consisted of the addition of EGR starting from 0 % till burning misfire occurred.

40|$|Abstract. Concern {{over the}} {{environment}} and=or {{the increasing demand}} for conventional fossil fuel has promoted interest {{in the development of}} alternative sources of fuel energy for internal combustion (IC) engines. The effect of <b>advanced</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> on the performance of natural gas used as primary fuel in dual-fuel combustion has been examined. Satisfactory diesel engine combustion demands self-ignition of the fuel as it is injected near the top dead centre (TDC) into the hot swirling compressed cylinder gas. Longer delays between injection and ignition lead to unacceptable rates of pressure rise (diesel knock) because too much fuel is ready to burn when combustion eventually occurs. Natural gas has been noted to exhibit longer ignition delays and slower burning rates especially at low load levels hence resulting in late combustion in the expansion stroke. <b>Advanced</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> is expected to compensate for these effects. The engine has standard <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> of 30 before TDC (BTDC). The <b>injection</b> was first <b>advanced</b> by 5 : 5 given <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> of 35 : 5 BTDC. The engine ran for about 5 minutes at this timing and stopped. The engine failed to start upon subsequent attempts. The <b>injection</b> was then <b>advanced</b> by 3 : 5 (i. e. 33 : 5 BTDC).

40|$|Copyright © 2005 SAE International Simultaneous {{reduction}} of nitric oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions {{is possible in}} a diesel engine by employing a Partially Premixed Compression Ignition (PPCI) strategy.

In the present investigation influence of <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> on the performance and emissions of a single cylinder, four stroke stationary, variable compression ratio, diesel engine was studied using waste cooking oil (WCO) as the biodiesel blended with diesel. The tests were performed at three different <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> (24 Â°, 27 Â°, 30 Â° CA BTDC) by changing the thickness of the advance shim. The experimental results showed that brake thermal efficiency for the advanced as well as the retarded <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> was lesser than that for the normal <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> (27 Â° BTDC) for all sets of compression ratios. Smoke, un-burnt hydrocarbon (UBHC) emissions were reduced for <b>advanced</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> where as NOx emissions increased. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) was used to predict the engine performance and emission characteristics of the engine.

To train the network, compression ratio, <b>injection</b> <b>timing,</b> blend percentage, percentage load, were used as the input parameters where as engine performance parameters like brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific energy consumption (BSEC), exhaust gas temperature (Texh) were used as the output parameters for the performance model and engine exhaust emissions such as NOx, smoke and (UBHC) values were used as the output parameters for the emission model. ANN results showed that there is a good correlation between the ANN predicted values and the experimental values for various engine performance parameters and exhaust emission characteristics and the relative mean error values (MRE) were within 8 %, which is acceptable. <b>Injection</b> <b>timing</b> Waste cooking oil Transesterification Artificial Neural Network...|$|R
40|$|Societal {{concerns}} on combustion-based {{fuel consumption}} are ever-increasing. With respect to internal combustion engines, this translates to {{a need to}} increase brake fuel conversion efficiency (BFCE). Diesel engines are a relatively efficient internal combustion engine to consider for numerous applications, but associated actions to mitigate certain exhaust emissions have generally deteriorated engine efficiency. Conventionally, diesel engine emission control has centered on in-cylinder techniques. Although these continue to hold promise, the industry trend is presently favoring the use of after-treatment devices which create new opportunities to improve the diesel engine's brake fuel conversion efficiency. This study focuses on <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> effects on the combustion processes, engine efficiency, and the engine system's responses. The engine in the study is a medium duty diesel engine (capable of meeting US EPA Tier III off road emission standards) equipped with common rail direct fuel injection, variable geometry turbo charging, and interfaced with a custom built engine controller. The study found that <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> greatly affected BFCE by changing the combustion phasing. BFCE would increase up to a maximum then begin to decrease as phasing became less favorable. Combustion phasing would change from being mostly mixing controlled combustion to premixed combustion as <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> would <b>advance</b> allowing more time for fuel to mix during the ignition delay. Combustion phasing, in turn, would influence many other engine parameters. As <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> is <b>advanced,</b> in-cylinder temperatures and pressures amplify, and intake and exhaust manifold pressures deteriorate. Rate of heat release and rate of heat transfer increase when <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> is <b>advanced.</b> Turbocharger speed falls with the <b>advancing</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing.</b> Torque, however, rose to a maximum then fell off again even though engine speed and fueling rate were held constant between different <b>injection</b> <b>timings.</b> Interestingly, the coefficient of heat transfer changes from a two peak curve to a smooth one peak curve as the <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> is <b>advanced</b> further. The major conclusion {{of the study is}} that <b>injection</b> <b>advance</b> both positively and negatively influences the diesel engine's response which contributes to the brake fuel conversion efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In this work, an {{experimental}} work {{was carried out}} to compare the performance of biodiesels made from non edible mahua oil and edible gingili oil in dual fuel engine. A single cylinder diesel engine was modified to work in dual fuel mode and liquefied petroleum gas was used as primary fuel. Biodiesel was prepared by transesterification process and mahua oil methyl ester (MOME) and gingili oil methyl ester (GOME) were used as pilot fuels. The viscosity of MOME is slightly higher than GOME. The dual fuel engine runs smoothly with MOME and GOME. The test {{results show that the}} performance of the MOME is close to GOME, at the pilot fuel quantity of 0. 45 kg/h and at the <b>advanced</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> of 30 deg bTDC. Also it is observed that the smoke, carbon monoxide and unburnt hydro carbon emissions of GOME lower than the MOME. But the GOME results in slightly higher NOx emissions.

40|$|Introduction Nowadays, due {{to higher}} {{environmental}} pollution and decreasing fossil fuels many countries make decisions to use renewable fuels and restrict using of fossil fuels. Renewable fuels generally produce from biological sources. Biodiesel {{is an alternative}} diesel fuel derived from the transesteriﬁcation of vegetable oils, animal fats, or waste frying oils. Considering the differences between diesel and biodiesel fuels, engine condition should be modified based on the fuel or fuel blends to achieve optimum performance. One of the simplest and yet {{the most widely used}} models is the thermodynamic model. After verification of the data obtained by model with experimental data it is possible to generalize the extracted data to an unlimited number of functional conditions or unlimited number of fuel types which saves time and reduces costs for experimental engine tests. Using the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible to calculate and analyze the exergy of the engine. 4 Materials and Methods In this work, the zero-dimensional model was used to account for internal energy variations, pressure work, heat transfer losses to the solid walls and heat release. The applied assumptions include: The cylinder mixture temperature, pressure and composition were assumed uniform throughout the cylinder. Furthermore, the one-zone thermodynamic model assumes instantaneous mixing between the burned and unburned gases. The cylinder gases were assumed to behave as an ideal gas mixture, Gas properties, include enthalpy, internal energy modeled using polynomial equations associated with temperature. In this research, the equations 1 to 20 were used in Fortran programming language. The results of incylinder pressure obtained by the model were validated by the results of experimental test of OM 314 engine. Then the effects of <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> on Energy and Exergy of the engine were analyzed for B 20 fuel. Results and Discussion Comparing the results of the model with the experimental data shows that there was a good agreement between the model and experimental results. The results showed that <b>advancing</b> fuel <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> increases the peak cylinder pressure. When fuel injecting occurs before the standard <b>injection</b> <b>timing,</b> the pressure and temperature of the charged air in the cylinder is less than that of the fuel when it is injected at standard <b>injection</b> <b>timing.</b> Thus, ignition delay of the injected fuel extends further. As a consequence, the reaction between fuel and air improves, which prepares a good mixture for burning. When the combustion starts, the rate of heat release increases in the premixed or rapid combustion phase of the combustion process due to the suitability of the mixture of air and fuel and hence the peak pressure of cylinder increases. When the <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> is retarded, the fuel is injected into charged air that has a high temperature and pressure. Thus, in the <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> of 10 degrees before top dead center, the maximum of incylinder pressure and temperature are reduced compared to the standard <b>injection</b> <b>timing.</b> By retarding the fuel injection into the cylinder, the indicator availability, the heat loss availability by heat transfer from cylinder walls and irreversibility are increased and by <b>advancing</b> the fuel <b>injection</b> into the cylinder, the indicator availability, the heat loss availability by heat transfer from the cylinder walls and irreversibility are reduced. High temperature will increase the produced entropy, so by <b>advancing</b> the <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> the produced entropy will increase while the retarding <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> reduces the produced entropy. Exergy and energy efficiencies increased by <b>advancing</b> the <b>injection</b> <b>timing.</b> At 2000 rpm the total availability and heat loss availability by heat transfer was increased compared to 1200 and 1600 rpm. Conclusions The proposed model was able to predict the pressure and temperature of the cylinder at different <b>injection</b> <b>timings.</b> By <b>advancing</b> the fuel <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> energy and exergy efficiency and heat loss availability by heat transfer was increased. At 2000 rpm the total availability and heat loss availability by heat transfer was increased...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: HCCI engines {{improvements}} are challenged with high CO emissions. In this study, effects of EGR and equivalence ratio on CO and soot emissions of a dual fuel HCCI engine are investigated. The experiments {{were conducted on}} a variable compression ratio(VCR) single-cylinder research engine with compression ratio of 17. 5 : 1. Premixed gasoline is provided by a carburetor connected to intake manifold and equipped with a screw to adjust premixed air-fuel ratio, and diesel fuel is injected directly into the cylinder through an injector at pressure of 250 bars. Intake charge temperature was increased up to 110 - 115 ºC by using an electrical heater. The higher <b>advanced</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> (35 BTDC) was used to initiate the gasoline auto-ignition in the HCCI dual fuel engine. The results show that increasing EGR rate increases CO emissions due to dilution effect which reduces combustion temperature, also addition of EGR increases soot emission {{as a result of}} decreases the inlet air and its oxygen, which create rich points in the cylinder mixture. Results also show that the CO emission decreases by increasing the equivalence ratio due to formation of more OH radicals in the cylinder and increasing the overall reactivity...|$|R

40|$|The spray, {{combustion}} {{and emissions}} characteristics of diesel and gasoline blends (dieseline) were studied. Experimental {{results showed that}} the dieseline fuel spray had tip penetration length similar as diesel. With an increase of the gasoline/diesel blending ratio, the fuel droplets size decreased. When operating with dieseline, the engine's PM emissions were much lower than diesel. With <b>advanced</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> and large amounts of EGR, both the NOx and PM emissions of dieseline combustion were reduced significantly at part loads. Using split injection strategies gave even more flexibility for the control of mixing strength and combustion phasing. However, the power density of dieseline fuelled PPCI operation was limited. A novel concept, Stoichiometric Dual-fuel Compression Ignition (SDCI) was investigated. The diesel and gasoline were blended internally through direct injection and port fuel injection respectively. Stoichiometric condition was maintained through adjusting the EGR ratio, which thus allows for a three-way-catalyst to handle gaseous emissions. Experimental {{results showed that the}} SDCI combustion can achieve better thermal efficiency and lower PM emissions than conventional diesel combustion. Overall, the SDCI concept was proved to be a promising technique for optimising a CI engine's efficiency, emissions and noise without compromise of cost and power density...|$|R

Performance parameters were determined at various values of brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) of the engine. The effect of void ratio, temperature of catalyst, space velocity on the reduction of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in the exhaust of the engines was studied. Exhaust emissions of smoke and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) were determined at various values of BMEP. The emission levels of NOx in LHR engine were controlled by means of the selective catalytic reduction technique using lanthanum ion exchanged zeolite (catalyst-A) and urea infused lanthanum ion exchanged zeolite (catalyst-B) with different versions of the engine at peak load operation of the engine. Conventional engine (CE) showed deteriorated performance, while LHR engine showed improved performance with bio-diesel at recommended <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> of 27 obTDC (before top dead centre) and pressure of 190 bar. The performance of both version of the engine improved with <b>advanced</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> and higher <b>injection</b> pressure when compared with CE with pure diesel operation.
