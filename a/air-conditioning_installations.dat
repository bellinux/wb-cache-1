40|$|Based on a finite-difference {{solution}} of the transient, periodic wall heat conduction differential equation and on the superposition principle, a correlation is developed, which expresses the maximum periodic indoor heat flow in terms of two wall-dependent coefficients m and r, and two corresponding climatic parameters DELTAT(max) and DELTAT(r). Tables with {{the values of the}} wall coefficients and the climatic parameters are available for 15 typical wall constructions and various cities around the world. Based on the present method, it is easy to develop more extensive tables. The above correlation is directly applicable when the maximum outdoor air temperature and the daily range for the location considered are known. When the temperature information is available {{in the form of the}} mean temperature and the amplitudes of a cosine and a sine variation, another correlation is suggested.

40|$|The green wall, {{built for}} an office {{building}} in Genoa, {{has been designed to}} check, through an extended monitoring, its performance in the Mediterranean-environment.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{correlations}} {{of the solar}} radiation for the Athens area are provided, based on hourly measurements over the period 1955 - 1980. These correlations are of two kinds: The first, which provide the average total radiation incident on a horizontal surface in terms of hour, day, and month of the typical year, is suitable for solar energy collection applications. The correlations of the second kind provide the maximum radiation and are suitable {{for use in the}} design of <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>installations</b> or other applications requiring knowledge of maximum values.

40|$|AbstractBecause {{of their}} low cost, small air {{conditioning}} systems (AC) like split {{air conditioning systems}} are often installed without a proper study of building envelope performance. Furthermore, these systems are sometimes installed by tradesmen who neglect {{to comply with the}} appropriate rules and regulations. Finally, when routine maintenance is not rigorously carried out (as so often happens), the energetic performance of the system is compromised over time. This article presents a practical, global approach to diagnose the performance of existing small <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>installations</b> in buildings applied in Reunion Island. This tropical Island aspires to become electricity self-sufficient. This approach relies on a numerical tool and dynamic simulations of buildings equipped with AC. The simulations, which take account of the building envelope, a description of the system as well as the practices of the users, are based on the kernel calculation EnergyPlus. They also take into account the climatic conditions and provide an estimate of the annual electricity consumption related to the cooling of the zone. This global analysis helps to qualify the entire system by assigning an energy label. In addition to the tool, a diagnostic procedure is proposed, helping an auditor defining guidance to improve the building envelope and to install and maintain the system...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Faults that develop in the heat exchanger subsystems in <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>installations</b> can lead to increased energy costs and jeopardise thermal comfort. The sensor and control signals associated with these systems contain potentially valuable information {{about the condition of}} the system, and energy management and control systems are able to monitor and store these signals. In practice, the only checks made are to verify set-points are being maintained and that certain critical variables remain within predetermined limits. This approach may allow the detection of certain abrupt or catastrophic faults, but degradation faults often remain undetected until their effects become quite severe. This thesis investigates the appropriateness of using mathematical models to track the development of degradation faults. An approach is developed, which is based on the use of analytical models in conjunction with a recursive parameter estimation algorithm. A subset of the parameters of the models, which are closely related to faults, is estimated recursively. Significant deviations in the values of the estimated parameters from nominal values, which represent `correct operation', are used as an indication that the system has developed a fault. The extent of the deviation from the nominal values is used as an estimate of the degree of fault. This thesis develops the theory and examines the robustness of the parameter estimator using simulation-based testing. Results are also presented from testing the fault detection and diagnosis scheme with data obtained from a simulated air-conditioning system and from a full size test installation...|$|E
40|$|A {{flexible}} {{model in}} the form of an artificial neural network (NN) with evolving structure (eNN) is represented in the paper {{in the form of}} the evolving fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno model. It falls into the same category of models as the recently introduced evolving rule-based (eR) models. The learning algorithm is incremental, unsupervised and is based on the on-line identification of Takagi-Sugeno type quasilinear models. Both eR and eNN differ from the other model schemes by their gradually evolving structure as opposed to the fixed structure models, in which only parameters are subject to optimization or adaptation. Essentially, it represents a Takagi-Sugeno model with gradually evolving set of rules, determined on-line. This approach has potential in both modeling and control using indirect learning mechanisms. Its computational efficiency is based on the non-iterative and recursive procedure, which combines a Kalman filter with proper initializations, and online unsupervised clustering. eNN has been tested with data from a real <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>installation.</b> Applications to real-time adaptive non-linear control, fault detection and diagnostics, performance analysis, time-series forecasting, knowledge extraction and accumulation, etc. are possible directions of their use in the future research...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} to the online learning of Takagi-Sugeno (TS) type models is proposed in the paper. It {{is based on a}} novel learning algorithm that recursively updates TS model structure and parameters by combining supervised and unsupervised learning. The rule-base and parameters of the TS model continually evolve by adding new rules with more summarization power and by modifying existing rules and parameters. In this way, the rule-base structure is inherited and up-dated when new data become available. By applying this learning concept to the TS model we arrive at a new type adaptive model called the Evolving Takagi-Sugeno model (ETS). The adaptive nature of these evolving TS models in combination with the highly transparent and compact form of fuzzy rules makes them a promising candidate for online modeling and control of complex processes, competitive to neural networks. The approach has been tested on data from an <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>installation</b> serving a real building. The results illustrate the viability and efficiency of the approach.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a procedure for calculating the COP and heat transfer rates, based on on-site experimental temperature measurements, of a lithium-bromide/water direct-fired double-effect absorption chiller in reverse parallel flow configuration, running on natural gas. The chiller {{was equipped with}} a set of thermocouples which allowed measuring its working temperature levels through all its operating stages. The chiller analysed in this work is the central cooling system of the <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>installation</b> of the Principe Felipe Science Museum, located at the Valencia's City of Arts and Sciences (Spain). This installation is capable of providing a cooling capacity of 4. 5 millions of kcal/h (5. 2 Â MW), by means of three direct-fired double-effect absorption chillers. From the experimental measurements a calculation procedure, based on energy and mass balances, has been developed, which allows estimating the specific powers by unit of mass flow rate through the evaporator. From these power values the instantaneous COP of the chiller could be obtained.

In order to identify the parameter to take into consideration for this study, methodologies for this study are divided into four phases. In the first phase, more study and literature survey of related journal and articles were conducted to understand key energy efficiency parameters. In the second phase, a visit and close observation were conducted in the FKM Administration block. Next, the energy efficiency problem and the comfort level parameters in the FKM Administration block was analyzed.

40|$|Building {{sector is}} {{regarded}} as one of the key factors in determining people's quality of life (Wadu & Wan, 2013). To pursue better living conditions, the role of building management is no longer just focused on providing a hygienic and safety living or working place, but is also required to create a sustainable environment. Thus, building management has to adopt various green measures to improve the sustainability of their buildings. In Hong Kong, industrial buildings being part of the building sector with high energy consumption and waste generation, which increased its potential to implement green measures. Therefore, nowadays management of industrial buildings are more willing to implement various kinds of green measures in their buildings. In order to affirm the effectiveness of those measures, this study will focus on evaluating the cost-effectiveness of green measures in Hong Kong's industrial buildings and will try to identify the cost-effective green measures that could be applied in industrial buildings. In this research, it would study on energy efficiency measures related to lighting, <b>air-conditioning</b> and lifts <b>installations,</b> as well as waste recycling measures. A case study of a sample building would illustrate the effectiveness of green measures in real situation. The concept of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness will be used to analyze the performance of green measures. Furthermore, the concept of payback period will be adopted in determining the cost-effectiveness of a green measures. Also, an interview will be carried out to understand the difficulties of implementing green measures in industrial buildings. The results of this study showed that waste recycle is the most cost-effective scheme in industrial buildings. Also, when comparing the cost-effectiveness of various energy efficiency measures, replacement of lighting is more cost-effective than the others, even though the type of lighting being replaced involved a higher cost. Apart from that, the energy saving system for lift installations has a highest energy saving performance when compared to those measures of lighting and air conditioning. Also, the findings showed that the factors of disturbance on operations, insufficient quantifiable benefits, high investment cost, long payback period and lack of support from senior management and government are the key barriers impeded the implementation of green measures in industrial buildings. Besides, incorporation of organization objectives with green measure performance and increase linkage of monetary benefits with the performance of green measure could help to improve the accomplishment of green measures. The findings of this study would serve the purpose to remind the building management of industrial buildings the environmental impacts that generated from their buildings and suggested means for them to contribute their efforts in environmental protection. By showing the performance and evaluating different kinds of green measures with a real case, this research had sorted out the cost-effective scheme and provided some actual statistics and information to building management of industrial buildings for their decision making. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
