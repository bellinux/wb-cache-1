[...] She and Waugh later developed a lasting friendship. Although she was now of age, her father [...] maintained an aggressive hostility towards most of her male friends, particularly since, as Hastings remarks, these tended towards the frivolous, the aesthetic and the effeminate. Among them was Hamish St Clair Erskine, the second son of the 5th Earl of Rosslyn, an Oxford undergraduate four years Nancy's junior. He was, according to Hastings, the least suitable partner of all, [...] "the most shimmering and narcissistic of all the beautiful butterflies"—and the one most likely to offend Lord Redesdale. The pair met in 1928 and became unofficially engaged, despite his homosexuality (of which Nancy {{may not have been}} aware). Against a backdrop of negativity from family and friends—Waugh [...] advised her to [...] "dress better <b>and</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> better man"— the affair endured sporadically for several years.|$|E
500|$|... "Weeping Willow" [...] {{analyzes}} {{the concept of}} 15 minutes of fame during the Information Age {{from the perspective of}} the Internet celebrity, one who gains fame through the creation of or participation in a popular website. Leight said of the episode, [...] "Forget about 15 minutes of fame: there are hundreds of people who get their 15 inches of bandwidth, people making names for themselves on YouTube and others. ... This blogging phenomenon has created a certain kind of 'cyberfame,' people who don't have to do anything more than put themselves on the Web <b>and</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> cyberwave. We now have a spate of very strange celebrities." [...] Leight said the episode also focuses on the extent to which one will go to achieve such fame. While the Law & Order shows routinely draw on inspiration from real-life events in an approach the creators call [...] "ripped from the headlines", Criminal Intent producers referred to this episode as [...] "'pre-ripping' from the headlines", because the script usually took a real-life event (as the lonelygirl15 phenomenon) and added to it a fictional dramatic conflict (the kidnapping).|$|E

2500|$|Games {{played in}} Mesoamerica with rubber balls by {{indigenous}} peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links {{have been found}} between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw <b>and</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed {{as a form of}} [...] "football." ...|$|E

2500|$|Martin was {{not out of}} {{work for}} very long, as the Yankees had also fired their manager, Bill Virdon. The former Yankee second baseman was hired to take his place, marking Martin's first time in a Yankee uniform since the 1957 trade. With Martin at the helm, the Yankees went 30-26 in their final 56 games of the 1975 season; he then managed them to the World Series in [...] (their first pennant since [...] ) and , winning in 1977. He feuded {{publicly}} with both Yankee owner George Steinbrenner and star outfielder Reggie Jackson. In one especially infamous incident, on June 18, 1977, in the middle game of what would prove to be a three-game series sweep by the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Martin pulled Jackson off the field (replacing him with Paul Blair) in mid-inning for failing to hustle <b>and</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> shallow outfield fly ball by Jim Rice, allowing Rice to reach second base. The extremely angry and highly animated Martin had to be restrained by coaches Elston Howard and Yogi Berra from getting into a fight with Jackson in the dugout during the nationally-televised Saturday afternoon game.|$|E

He was scheduled to appear on the first episode of NBC Saturday Night (later renamed Saturday Night Live on October 11, 1975), but his sketch was cut. He did perform on episode 17 of that first season, doing a monologue of an old jazz man capped by the line [...] "Can you dig it? [...] I knew that you could."
