5|$|Cristina is re-hired and Owen {{asks for}} a divorce once Cristina wants to reconcile. Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later finds out that the {{potential}} conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him. Owen tells her that he 'feels responsible' and was worried as {{he thought she was}} dead. They have a sexual relationship after divorcing. The hospital is sued and found guilty of negligence. The surviving doctors, including Yang, must receive $15 million of compensation each, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurers refuse to pay. Yang, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and the other surviving doctors buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for the O.R. and breaks things off with Owen because he still wants kids <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>still</b> doesn't.|$|E

However, Zohra maintained a low profile about her former beauty queen status until 11 September 2001 when Daoud grew weary of the media's treatment of Afghan women as illiterate, burqa-clad victims, and felt the need to speak out.|$|E

25|$|Elective {{caesarean}} sections may {{be performed}} {{on the basis of}} an obstetrical or medical indication, or because of a medically non-indicated maternal request. Among women in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia, about 7% preferred caesarean section as a method of delivery. In cases without medical indications the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend a planned vaginal delivery. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that if after a women has been provided information on the risk of a planned caesarean section <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>still</b> insists on the procedure it should be provided. If provided this should be done at 39 weeks of gestation or later.|$|E
25|$|At the Columbia University, Stublić started {{training}} in earnest {{for the first}} time, and improved her 5000-meter results by two minutes {{in the first two}} years. In the third and fourth year of college, she switched from 5000 meters to 10,000 meters and steeplechase. She {{was a member of the}} women's cross country team that won conference championship titles in each of the four years she competed. Stublić's team qualified for the NCAA Nationals in cross country every year she ran for them, and she earned the All-American honors once, in her senior year, placing 33rd. Despite her athletic achievements, at that time Stublić's primary interest was art – music, poetry and drawing – <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>still</b> saw running as little more than a hobby.|$|E
25|$|Without any obvious cause Genie's {{incontinence}} immediately resurfaced, and {{was especially}} severe {{for the first}} few weeks after she moved in but persisted at a lower level for several months. In contrast to Butler's writings, the Riglers observed Genie still acted out her anger on herself and noted that certain situations in particular, such as spilling containers of liquid, sent her into tantrum behavior, which doctors attributed to her having been beaten for these actions as a child. The research team recorded her speech being much more halting and hesitant than Butler described, writing that Genie very rarely spoke and that, for {{the first three months of}} her stay, almost always used one-word utterances. Unless she saw something which frightened her both her speech and behavior exhibited a great deal of latency, often several minutes delayed, for no clear reason, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>still</b> had no reaction to temperature. She continued to have a very difficult time controlling her impulses, frequently engaging in highly anti-social and destructive behavior.|$|E

25|$|Jason and Sam {{first met}} {{when they were}} both arrested for aiding and abetting Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard). The two have often been caught in {{situations}} where they were in trouble with the law. The two started to interact more after Sam got involved with a married Sonny, and Jason tried to pay her off so that Sonny would go back to his wife, Carly (then Tamara Braun). Sam refused, and the two were constantly fighting, even after Jason was assigned as Sam's bodyguard to protect her from Sonny's enemies. When Sam found out that she was pregnant with Sonny’s child, Jason asks Sam to say he's the baby's father, and let Sonny and Carly stay together for the sake of their sons, Michael (then Dylan Cash) and Morgan. Sam agrees to Jason's request and they almost marry, but Sam backs out because they are not in love <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>still</b> has feelings for Sonny.|$|E
500|$|When the {{character}} was ultimately {{found not guilty}} and was released, Lister stated {{in an interview with}} E4: [...] "I think this is a great storyline, I've really enjoyed doing it. When Zoe's obviously released, it's like a whole new scenario for her because there are people who haven't really trusted her or believed in her. People that have really let her down, and plus the fact she hasn't got over Sarah [...] being killed yet either. She hasn't had the chance to deal with that, so that's really interesting, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>still</b> wants Lydia to go down!" [...] The character of Zoe then set out to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. She befriended her, and even seduced her in order to gain a confession. During an interview about Zoe's new scheme, Lister said: ...|$|E
500|$|Burke is {{replaced}} by Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who immediately dislikes Yang for her trend of having affairs with famous surgeons, such as Burke, {{going so far as}} refusing to let her scrub in on cardiac surgeries. Eventually, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) moves in with Yang, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>still</b> tries to earn Hahn's approval. Hahn reveals that she dislikes Yang because she reminds her of an early version of herself and continues to cut Yang out of cardio surgeries and neglects to teach her, before eventually quitting the hospital and leaving Seattle Grace without a head of cardio. [...] Without a teacher, Yang begins to seriously doubt the purpose of remaining in her place at Seattle Grace when the program falls to twelfth on a list of the best teaching hospitals, and Burke wins the Harper-Avery award without mentioning her at all, despite her saving his career. Yang tells the Chief that her current existence in the hospital is [...] "unbearable" [...] and that she has turned into a ghost.|$|E

500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{revelation of}} Danielle's identity {{was set at}} Archie's wedding to Peggy (Barbara Windsor), matriarch of the Mitchell family. Crace deemed the wedding [...] "the perfect opportunity" [...] for the storyline to conclude, and Santer explained: [...] "Weddings are great because they bring the community together. A wedding gives you a stage, it gives you an event, the context to play things out, so it felt right that these big Mitchell stories would collide at Peggy's wedding." [...] Writer James Payne concurred that setting the reveal at the wedding helped to make the moment [...] "as dramatic and sensational" [...] as it could possibly be. The episode saw Danielle announce that she was Ronnie's daughter {{in front of the}} entire wedding reception party, in what Crace has named her favourite scene on the show. She opined that the disbelief Danielle was faced with was [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and served to highlight the fact that [...] "she came as the outsider <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>still</b> is the outsider because no one steps in to help her".|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the 6000th episode of Neighbours would see Paul pushed from the mezzanine of Lassiter's Hotel. This then kicks off a whodunit storyline with Diana being one of six suspects. Susan Bower said that as the Neighbours team was developing the storyline, they decided to add to the story that Paul's financial situation leads to him embezzling, which in turn leads to Diana arriving. Badler said it was [...] "great" [...] {{to be involved in the}} storyline and said she was largely featured in the 6000th episode. [...] Diana becomes a suspect in the attempt on Paul's life because he jilts her [...] "in the boardroom and the bedroom". Paul then humiliates Diana and sends her packing from Lassiter's. On Diana's reason to kill Paul, Badler said [...] "Seeing her name splashed across the Erinsborough News prompts Diana to pull out all the stops in order to bring Paul down. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>still</b> has friends in high places!" [...] Diana is seen placing a call asking for something to be taken care of and she hands money over to a stranger just before Paul is pushed. Following the attempt on Paul's life, Diana's earring is found at the scene and the police manage to catch her at the airport before she returns to America. Diana diverts the police attention to Rebecca by telling them that she revealed Paul's affair to her.|$|E

Stacey Anderson of Spin commented that its first disc [...] "meanders over [...] down-tempo cuts" [...] and called ...Sasha [...] "an intriguing but diluted direction". The Village Voices Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond felt that the I Am... disc lacks cohesion, but complimented [...] "Sasha Fierce as [...] "brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty," [...] and stated, [...] "each incendiary track challenges you to leave your inhibitions at coat-check." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted that its slow songs are [...] "full of bland self-affirmation and saggy lines", but wrote that [...] "the [...] "Sasha" [...] disc boasts Beyoncé's most adventurous music yet". Colin McGuire of PopMatters called the album [...] "a little rough around the edges at times" [...] and viewed its Sasha Fierce disc as [...] "a far more compelling trip down dance-lane". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the album offers [...] "two compelling sides" [...] of Beyoncé and stated: [...] "The collection {{might have been better}} served had she edited it down to one disc, rather than belabor what ultimately seems like a marketing gimmick. And while fans will surely speculate, there's little in the lyrics that feels more revealing than previous emotional fire-starters." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones from The New Yorker found the album to be [...] "something of a mess", mostly because the alter ego [...] "trips on the idea of redefinition".|$|E

500|$|Arnold Wayne Jones {{from the}} Dallas Voice gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, writing that the show [...] "has all of the Material Girl's majesty and fetishistic eroticism, merged with lots of disturbing, violent imagery and a huge catalog of songs". Jones {{concluded}} that Madonna was more provocative than before with the release. Chuck Campbell from The Republic gave the album three and a half stars out of five, writing that [...] "an ambitious woman like Madonna will not let herself become a nostalgia act". He added that Madonna makes that clear every time she goes on tour: [...] "she's living in the moment, and she's all about her newest material." [...] The Advocates review for the release was positive, saying that the DVD affirms the fact that Madonna's [...] "musical reign continues". Entertainment Focus Pip Ellwood felt that the highlights of the record were the live performances of [...] "Human Nature" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". He concluded the review by saying that [...] " [...] Making perfect use of her dancers, the video screens and the sets, the MDNA World Tour is one of [...] most spectacular to date <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>still</b> performs with the passion and the energy she always has done. If you went to the show then get your copy of this and treat it like a souvenir. If you didn't you need to check it out as it's one of the best shows she's ever done." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic awarded the release three out of five stars, saying that [...] "there are unexpected musical moments that do make MDNA World Tour worth hearing", including the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". However, he felt that the CD release was unnecessary since the album would be a better experience with its video.|$|E
500|$|During the 1920s, a {{commitment}} to refurbish Yavuz {{as the centerpiece of}} the new country's fleet was the only constant element of the various naval policies which were put forward. [...] The battlecruiser remained in İzmit until 1926, in a neglected state: only two of her boilers worked, she could not steer or steam, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>still</b> had two unrepaired scars from the mine damage in 1918. Enough money was raised to allow the purchase of a new [...] floating dock from Germany, as Yavuz could not be towed anywhere without risk of her sinking in rough seas. The French company Atelier et Chantiers de St. Nazaire-Penhöet was contracted in December 1926 to oversee the subsequent refit, which was carried out by the Gölcük Naval Shipyard. Work proceeded over three years (1927–1930); it was delayed when several compartments of the dock collapsed while being pumped out. Yavuz was slightly damaged before she could be refloated and the dock had to be repaired before the repair work could begin. The Minister of Marine, Ihsan Bey (İhsan Eryavuz), was convicted of embezzlement in the resulting investigation. Other delays were caused by fraud charges which resulted in the abolition of the Ministry of Marine. The Turkish Military's Chief of Staff, Marshal Fevzi, opposed naval construction and slowed down all naval building programs following the fraud charges. Intensive work on the battlecruiser only began after the Greek Navy conducted a large-scale naval exercise off Turkey in September 1928 and the Turkish Government perceived a need to counter Greece's naval superiority. The Turks also ordered four destroyers and two submarines from Italian shipyards. The Greek Government proposed a 10-year [...] "holiday" [...] from naval building modeled on the Washington Treaty when it learned that Yavuz was to be brought back into service, though it reserved the right to build two new cruisers. The Turkish Government rejected this proposal, and claimed that the ship was intended to counter the growing strength of the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea.|$|E

On one occasion, Lloyd said that Shetty should [...] "fuck off home", something that Big Brother questioned her about at a later date. Danielle eventually finished fifth on the final night.
