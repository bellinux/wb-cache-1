This {{was one of the}} aims at this work. Chapters I., II., III., IV. describe logistics and logistics support, crisis management, <b>citizen</b> protection <b>and</b> integrated rescue system. Chapter V. describes basic legislation connected with crisis management <b>and</b> <b>citizen</b> protection. Chapter VI. deals with logistics and logistics support in crisis management <b>and</b> <b>citizen</b> protection <b>and</b> presents information on the Institute of Citizen Protection, the Logistics base in Olomouc, the Administration of Government Material Reserves and the Fire Brigade of the Czech Republic. An analysed anonymous questionnaire {{is a part of the}} graduation thesis as well. Its aim was to find out the level of logistics and logistics support in the Police of the Czech Republic. The assessment of the research showed deficiencies in the logistics and logistics support of the Czech Police. The following hypothesis was determined in connection with the graduation thesis: 1. Logistics and logistics support in crisis management <b>and</b> <b>citizen</b> protection are on a good level. This hypothesis was confirmed...|$|R
5|$|The chapter {{asserts that}} the king should be truthful, avoid anger, be virtuous and lead by example. The king, ministers <b>and</b> <b>citizens</b> should, states the Manasollasa's first sub-book, refrain from injury to others, {{practice}} self-restraint and generosity, have faith in gods, feed and support the poor and helpless, and be friendly. The king, according to the text, should honour his ancestors and all guests.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville {{proposal}} the proposal in Bremerton {{was to be}} partially funded with public money, the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme {{similar to the one}} used to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers <b>and</b> <b>citizens,</b> but the company has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007.|$|E
5|$|Although by {{the close}} of the 1860s, Denver {{residents}} could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center, the decision to route the nation's first transcontinental railroad through Cheyenne, rather than Denver, threatened the prosperity of the young town. A daunting 100 miles away, citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to the transcontinental railroad. Spearheaded by visionary leaders including Territorial Governor John Evans, David Moffat, and Walter Cheesman, fundraising began. Within three days, $300,000 had been raised, <b>and</b> <b>citizens</b> were optimistic. Fundraising stalled before enough was raised, forcing these visionary leaders {{to take control of the}} debt-ridden railroad. Despite challenges, on June 24, 1870, citizens cheered as the Denver Pacific completed the link to the transcontinental railroad, ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver.|$|E

5|$|Amiral Charner was {{an armored}} cruiser {{built for the}} French Navy in the 1890s, the name ship of her class. She {{spent most of her}} career in the Mediterranean, {{although}} she was sent to China during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900–01. The ship was assigned to the International Squadron off the island of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 to protect French interests <b>and</b> <b>citizens.</b> Amiral Charner spent most of {{the first decade of the}} 20th century as a training ship or in reserve. The ship was recommissioned when World War I began in 1914 and escorted convoys for several months before she was assigned to the Eastern Mediterranean to blockade the Ottoman-controlled coast. During this time, she helped to rescue several thousand Armenians from Syria during the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Amiral Charner was sunk in early 1916 by a German submarine, with only a single survivor rescued.|$|E
5|$|As the {{national}} commander of Los Zetas, Treviño Morales earned a notorious reputation for intimidating officials <b>and</b> <b>citizens</b> throughout Mexico. The Mexican authorities {{believe that he}} is responsible for {{a significant part of the}} violence in Mexico, including the murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people in 2011. A common torture method of his was known as guiso (stew), in which victims would be dumped into oil barrels, doused with gasoline and burned alive. Following the death of his boss Lazcano Lazcano in October 2012, Treviño Morales became his successor and the top leader of Los Zetas drug cartel amid an internal power struggle within the organization.|$|E
5|$|Assemblies and councils {{operated}} {{according to}} established procedures {{overseen by the}} augurs.

Over the years, laws were passed which mandated a written ballot, attempted to reduce voter intimidation, and established procedures to watch over voting and prevent voter fraud. For elections, {{it was not a}} matter of who received the most votes, but rather who could first be approved by a majority of the voting blocs. All votes had to be completed within a single day and had to be done again if interrupted or abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Bo's {{approach}} to social policy was demonstrated during the November 2008 taxi strikes, which saw over 8,000 taxi drivers {{take to the}} streets for two days in protests over high fees, unregulated competition and rising fuel costs. Similar protests in China were frequently suppressed—sometimes forcefully—with official media sometimes blaming labor unrest on criminal instigation. Bo's government instead held a televised roundtable dialogues with the protesters <b>and</b> <b>citizens,</b> and agreed to allow the formation of a trade union. His handling of the situation earned him praise as a comparatively restrained and progressive leader.|$|E

5|$|Houphouët entered electoral {{politics}} in August 1945, when {{elections for the}} Abidjan city council were held for the first time. The French electoral rules established a common roll: half of the elected {{would have to be}} French citizens (who were mostly Europeans) and the other half non-citizens. Houphouët reacted by creating a multi-ethnic all-African roll with both non-citizens <b>and</b> <b>citizens</b> (mostly Senegalese with French citizenship). As a result, most of the African contenders withdrew and a large number of the French protested by abstaining, thus assuring a decisive victory for his African Bloc.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln, {{as well as}} {{many other}} leaders <b>and</b> <b>citizens</b> of the {{northern}} states, became increasingly impatient with McClellan's slowness to attack the Confederate forces still massed near Washington. The Union defeat at the minor Battle of Ball's Bluff near Leesburg in October added to the frustration and indirectly damaged McClellan. In December, the Congress formed a Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, which became a thorn in the side of many generals throughout the war, accusing them of incompetence and, in some cases, treason. McClellan was called as the first witness on December 23, but he contracted typhoid fever and could not attend. Instead, his subordinate officers testified, and their candid admissions that they had no knowledge of specific strategies for advancing against the Confederates raised many calls for McClellan's dismissal.|$|E
5|$|More {{and more}} state institutions, private firms, organizations, and clubs joined the {{procession}} each year, and the event {{began to take}} on the character of a public holiday. During the 1930s, the laying of badnjak on the fire became a court ritual. It was performed, {{in the presence of the}} royal family, by representatives of the army in the Royal Palace's room with a fireplace. At the end of the 1930s in some parts of Yugoslavia, especially Vojvodina and Montenegro, the military badnjak ceremony was performed not in the barracks yard but in a square in the garrison town. An open fire was built, on which the badnjak was placed by an Orthodox priest in the presence of soldiers <b>and</b> <b>citizens.</b> This tradition, symbolizing the unity of state, church, and people, was ended by the outbreak of WorldWarII.|$|E

5|$|Morgan's Raid, the Confederate army's major {{incursion}} into Indiana, occurred a {{month after}} Hines' raid. On July 8, 1863, General Morgan crossed the Ohio River, landing at Mauckport, Indiana, with 2,400 troopers. Their arrival was initially contested by a small party from the Indiana Legion, who withdrew after Morgan's men began firing artillery from the river's southern shore. The state militia quickly retreated towards Corydon, Indiana, where a larger body was gathering to block Morgan's advance. The Confederates advanced rapidly on the town and engaged in the Battle of Corydon. After a brief but fierce fight, Morgan took command of high ground south of town, and Corydon's local militia <b>and</b> <b>citizens</b> promptly surrendered after Morgan's artillery fired two warning shots. Corydon was sacked, but little damage was done to its buildings. Morgan continued his raid north and burned most {{of the town of}} Salem.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the rivalry}} is {{attributed}} to the bitter rivalry between the sports fans from New York City and Philadelphia, which are approximately two hours apart by car, also seen between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles in the National Football League, and the New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers in the National Hockey League. Games between the two teams at Citi Field <b>and</b> <b>Citizens</b> Bank Park are often very intense, hard-hitting affairs, as each home crowd does its best to create an unfriendly, sometimes volatile atmosphere for any visiting-team fans.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, as the {{precursor}} extratropical storm was forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale {{and later a}} storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60mph (60 to 95km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents believed they were insufficiently warned, though it is acknowledged that emergency managers <b>and</b> <b>citizens</b> pay less attention to gale warnings then they do for tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the storm was passing {{to the south of}} the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. Many private businesses closed as well.|$|E
