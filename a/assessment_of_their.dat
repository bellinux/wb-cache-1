5|$|In {{spite of}} his autocracy and iron rule, Cẩn earned praise from Huế-based US {{officials}} for his relatively high levels of success against the Việt Cộng insurgency. Cẩn's central region was much more peaceful than the restive areas near Saigon and the Mekong Delta. Cẩn created the Popular Force organisation to operate in central Vietnam. The Popular Force was {{an alternative to the}} Strategic Hamlet Program which was used on a much larger scale in the south by Nhu, who moved peasants into fortified camps in an attempt to isolate Vietcong cadres from accessing the rural populace and intimidating or otherwise gaining their support. Cẩn assumed a third or so of the rural peasantry were Việt Cộng sympathisers, significant enough to render the hamlets ineffective by intimidating other villagers from within. Cẩn's Popular Force were a group of volunteers who underwent rigorous training similar to United States Marine Corps Recruit Training. Those who passed the training were put into units of 150 men and assigned to live and work in the villages by day. At night, they did defense patrols, using hit-and-run tactics against the Việt Cộng. According to the report by US officials in central Vietnam, the program aroused popular support because of the integration of the Popular Force's personnel into the daily life of the village and the sense of security that the force provided. The units were generally regarded as being successful in their six-month deployments, allowing them to be deployed to the next trouble spot. Officials in Washington disagreed with the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> subordinates in central Vietnam, alleging that Cẩn was mainly using the Popular Force for repressing dissidents.|$|E

25|$|Considering phylogenetic methods, several {{approaches}} to validating individual HGT inferences and benchmarking {{methods have been}} adopted, typically relying on various forms of simulation. Because the truth is known in simulation, the number of false positives {{and the number of}} false negatives are straightforward to compute. However, simulating data do not trivially resolve the problem because the true extent of HGT in nature remains largely unknown, and specifying rates of HGT in the simulated model is always hasardous. Nonetheless, studies involving the comparison of several phylogenetic methods in a simulation framework could provide quantitative <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> respective performances, and thus help the biologist in choosing objectively proper tools.|$|E

This resulted in the current incorrect classification {{of all of the}} species as Lower Risk/Near Threatened. Until now, the true conservation status, the actual effects of wildlife trade, deforestation, and habitat loss on individual Cyclemys species, have yet to be studied.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Juan Almonte was {{appointed}} Director of Colonization in Texas, ostensibly to ease {{relations with the}} colonists and mitigate their anxieties about Austin's imprisonment. He delivered promises of self-governance, and conveyed regrets that the Mexican congress deemed it constitutionally impossible for Texas to be a separate state.

This study examines links between RTC school students’ <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> relationships with teachers and <b>their</b> perceptions <b>of</b> self and others. Participants were 113 students in 2 RTC schools from 5 th to 12 th grade. Results indicate that male and female RTC students’ positive perceptions (of self and others) are linked to positive <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> relationships with teachers.

25|$|Dudley Docker {{had joined}} the board in 1906 and was {{appointed}} deputy chairman of BSA in 1909. He had made a spectacular financial success of a merger of five large rolling-stock companies in 1902 and become {{the leader of the}} period's merger movement. Believing he could buy the missing management skills that could not be found within BSA, he started merger talks with The Daimler Company Limited of Coventry. Daimler and Rover were then the largest British car producers. Daimler was immensely profitable. After its capital reconstruction in 1904, Daimler's profits were 57% and 150% returns on invested capital in 1905 and 1906. The attraction for Daimler shareholders, was the apparent stability of BSA. So, in 1910, BSA purchased Daimler with BSA shares, but Docker, who negotiated the arrangements, either ignored or failed in his <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> consequences for the new combine.

500|$|In the mid-1980s, Atsumu Ohmura, a {{geography}} {{researcher at}} the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, found that solar radiation striking the Earth's surface had declined by more than 10% over the three previous decades. His findings appeared to contradict global warming — the global temperature had been generally rising since the 70s. Less light reaching the earth seemed to mean that it should cool. Ohmura published his findings [...] "Secular variation of global radiation in Europe" [...] in 1989. [...] This was soon followed by others: Viivi Russak in 1990 [...] "Trends of solar radiation, cloudiness and atmospheric transparency during recent decades in Estonia", and Beate Liepert in 1994 [...] "Solar radiation in Germany — Observed trends and an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> causes". Dimming has also been observed in sites all over the former Soviet Union.

500|$|According to Rudolf Bultmann, {{there are}} three sacramental allusions: one to baptism (...) , one to the Eucharist (...) , and one to both (...) [...] He {{believed}} these passages to be later interpolations, though most scholars now reject this assessment. Some scholars on the weaker-sacramental side of the spectrum deny that there are any sacramental allusions in these passages or in the gospel as a whole, while others see sacramental symbolism applied to other subjects in these and other passages. Oscar Cullmann and Bruce Vawter, a Protestant and a Catholic respectively, and both on the stronger-sacramental end of the spectrum, have found sacramental allusions in most chapters. Cullmann found references to baptism and the Eucharist throughout the gospel, and Vawter found additional references to matrimony in , anointing of the sick in , and penance in [...] Towards {{the center of the}} spectrum, Raymond Brown is more cautious than Cullmann and Vawter but more lenient than Bultmann and his school, identifying several passages as containing sacramental allusions and rating them according to his <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> degree of certainty.|$|E

500|$|Between 1832 and 1839, Mary Shelley wrote many {{biographies of}} notable Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French {{men and a}} few women for Dionysius Lardner's Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men. These formed part of Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia, {{one of the best}} of many such series {{produced}} in the 1820s and 1830s in response to growing middle-class demand for self-education. Until the republication of these essays in 2002, their significance within her body of work was not appreciated. In the view of literary scholar Greg Kucich, they reveal Mary Shelley's [...] "prodigious research across several centuries and in multiple languages", her gift for biographical narrative, and her interest in the [...] "emerging forms of feminist historiography". Shelley wrote in a biographical style popularised by the 18th-century critic Samuel Johnson in his Lives of the Poets (1779–81), combining secondary sources, memoir and anecdote, and authorial evaluation. She records details of each writer's life and character, quotes their writing in the original as well as in translation, and ends with a critical <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> achievement.|$|E
