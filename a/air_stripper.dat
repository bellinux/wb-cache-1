40|$|The {{discovery}} of chlorinated {{volatile organic compounds}} (CVOCs) in the aquifer underlying a manufacturing facility prompted the initiation of an aggressive voluntary site wide soil and groundwater cleanup. Given {{a large number of}} potential source areas within the plant, delineation of CVOC impacts to the unsaturated zone was performed by the installation of an innovative soil vapor extraction system, rather than performing extensive soil sampling within the operating manufacturing facility. The system was designed with a pneumatically actuated valve manifold system to cycle the 120 extraction points which allowed for delineation of impacts, targeting hot spot source area removal, and overall contaminant reduction while remaining below regulatory discharge requirements, thereby eliminating the need for more costly air treatment. The innovative system design reduced equipment size by 80 % while improving system recovery by operating in the most productive range of the removal curve. The groundwater remediation system, consisting of 6 extraction wells and 7 injection wells, is capable of extracting up to 600 gallons per minute (gpm) of groundwater.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) was {{established}} in 1963 primarily to provide rocket engine testing services for several NASA programs. The groundwater underlying the site has been contaminated {{as a result of}} historical operations. Groundwater contaminants include several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and two semi-volatile compounds: N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrodimethylamine (DMN). This paper discusses some of the technical, analytical, regulatory, and health risk issues associated with the contaminant plume. The plume has moved approximately 2. 5 miles downgradient of the facility industrial boundary, with evidence of continued migration. As a result, NASA has proposed a pump and treat system using <b>air</b> <b>strippers</b> and ultraviolet (UV) oxidation to stabilize future movement of the contaminant plume. The system has been designed to treat 1, 076 gallons (4, 073 liters) per minute, with provisions for future expansion. The UV oxidation process was selected to treat NDMA-contaminated groundwater based on successes at other NDMA-contaminated sites. Bench- and pilot-scale testing of WSTF groundwater confirmed the ability of UV oxidation to destroy NDMA and generated sufficient data to design the proposed full-scale treatment system. NDMA is acutely toxic and is a probable human carcinogen. EPA-recommended health risk criteria for the residential consumption of NDMA/DMN-contaminated groundwater was used to determine that a 1. 0 x 10 (exp - 6) excess cancer risk corresponds to 1. 7 parts per trillion (ppt). EPA analytical methods are unable to detect NDMA and DMN in the low ppt range. EPA's current Appendix IX analytical method used to screen for NDMA, Method 8270, can detect NDMA only at levels that are orders of magnitude greater than the recommended health risk level. Additionally, EPA Method 607, the most sensitive EPA approved method, has a detection limit of 150 ppt. This corresponds to an excess cancer risk of 9. 0 x 10 (exp - 5), which exceeds the State of New Mexico's water quality standard of a cancer risk less than 1 x 10 (exp - 5). The treatment system has been engineered to treat contaminated groundwater to levels significantly below the New Mexico standard. However, the inability of EPA-approved analytical methods to detect NDMA and DMN at low ppt levels, and to provide verification of compliance with the 1 x 10 (exp - 5) cancer risk, introduces a notable risk to the long-term operation of the system. WSTF has been working with Southwest Research Institute to develop a non-EPA analytical method that can achieve a reporting limit of 1 ppt, which corresponds to an excess cancer risk of 7. 6 x 10 (exp - 7).

In the former, the tars have been removed in a scrubber by transferring them from the producer gas to a scrubbing liquid and then removed from the liquid to <b>air</b> in a <b>stripper</b> and finally recycled them into air to a gasifier to recover their energy. A tar removal test system involving a scrubber and stripper has been designed based on the predicted tar solubility in canola methyl ester (CME) as the scrubbing liquid and its measured properties (CME {{is a type of}} methyl ester biodiesel). The tar solubility has been predicted to decrease with increasing temperatures and thus its value increases at lower temperatures. In designing the test system, the design parameters are needed including equilibrium coefficients of the gas-liquid system, molar transfer coefficient and the optimum liquid to gas flow rate ratio. The equilibrium coefficients have been predicted based on thermodynamic theories where the required data are determined from CME composition and known properties of each component of the CME as well as the properties of the model tar (naphthalene). The molar transfer coefficients are then experimentally determined and the correlations as a function of liquid and gas flow rates are proposed which are consistent with literature. The optimum liquid to gas flow rate ratios {{have been found to be}} 21. 4 ± 0. 1 for the scrubber and 5. 7 ± 0. 1 for the stripper. Using these optimum ratios, the tar removal efficiencies in the scrubber and the stripper are 77 and 74 %, respectively. The analysis of the system performance has been achieved after an innovative method of determining tar concentrations in both the liquid and gas phase had been developed based on the concept of the density of liquid mixtures. However, these tar removal efficiencies are low due to the fact that the targeted tar concentration in the scrubber’s off-gas was large. As a result the system has been redesigned based on the determined design parameters and its operation performance retested. In the redesigned system, the tar removal efficiency in the scrubber and stripper is 99 %. The redesigned system would be integrated with the UC gasifier for downstream gas cleaning. Since 1 % of tars are not removed, a makeup tar free CME of 0. 0375 litres per hour for the 100 kW UC gasifier has been introduced in the recycle stream between the scrubber and stripper to avoid tar accumulation in the system...|$|R
40|$|Biogas {{produced}} by anaerobic digestion {{is often used}} in gas turbines to produceelectricity. In order to increase {{the value of the}} gas and to enable utilization of the gas in other applications, it may be advantageous to upgrade the biogas. In this way, the carbon dioxide as well as various impurities are removed and biomethane is produced. Biomethane is similar to natural gas and can be used in similar applications, e. g. fed into the natural gas grid, or as vehicle fuel. Several different biogas upgrading techniques are on the market today. Some of themmake use of the fact that carbon dioxide and methane have different solubility indifferent solvents. By choosing a solvent which has a high solubility for carbon dioxide but lets methane pass through unchanged, the carbon dioxide can be separated from the methane in biogas efficiently. Common solvents used for biogas upgrading are water, amines as well as organic solvents such as Genosorb®. The difference in adsorption behavior of carbon dioxide and methane on a surface at different pressures is used in pressure swing adsorption (PSA), which can be used to effectively separate carbon dioxide from methane. Another common biogas upgrading technique uses the fact that carbon dioxide is more likely to pass through a semi permeable barrier, e. g. a membrane, than methane. By letting biogas pass through such a membrane, the carbon dioxide can thus be removed from the gas, leaving concentrated methane in the product stream. Finally, the difference in boiling point between methane and carbondioxide may be used to separate the gases in cryogenic distillation. For this report, data on the specific investment cost was collected from companies supplying biogas upgrading plants using the above described processes. The data shows a span of investment costs, but it also shows that there is no significant general difference in investment cost between the different techniques when considering a given standard project. Also the energy consumption is rather similar for the different upgrading techniques. When deciding on a suitable biogas upgrading process, it is therefore important to rather consider other aspects. These may include the ability of the different processes to handle specific impurities present in the actual project orspecific requirements in product gas quality. Also the need for consumables such as anti-foam, chemicals for pH regulation as well as operational costs for any needed pretreatment differs between biogas upgrading processes but is of course also dependent on the pretreatment needed in a project. It {{is important to remember that}} the conclusion regarding specific investment cost in this report is related to a standard case. In a real project, where more or less pre- and posttreatment will be needed depending on the choice of upgrading technique, the investment cost for different biogas upgrading techniques will most likely differ. Biogas produced from various substrates such as agricultural residues, biological waste or sewage sludge contains low concentrations of unwanted substances, e. g. impurities, such as H 2 S, siloxanes, ammonia, oxygen and volatile organic carbons (VOC). H 2 S is separated from the methane in most biogas upgrading techniques. How efficient this removal is and thus whether it is enough to meet product gas requirements differs between the different techniques. Scrubbers using absorption in water, amines or organic solvent usually remove most of the H 2 S, while polishing filters are needed for membrane upgrading and PSA. When separated from the methane gas, H 2 S, however, ends up in a CO 2 rich side stream such as <b>stripper</b> <b>air</b> where it usually needs to beremoved due to environmental legislation. If the CO 2 stream is utilized, the necessity to remove H 2 S depends on what the gas is used for. H 2 S thus needs to be removed from the gas at some point in most cases, but depending on the biogas upgrading technique used, this may need to be done in the raw biogas or there may be a choice regarding where in the process to remove H 2 S. Siloxanes may be harmful to process equipment when present at too high concentrations. In scrubber systems the produced biomethane usually needs further drying and the main part of siloxanes are removed in the dryers. Ammonia is soluble in water and the concentrations commonly found in biogas are usually removed in the condensation which is usually part of a biogas upgrading system in order to protect the upgrading system from liquid water. Ammonia is not usually a problem in biogas upgrading systems. However, when H 2 S and ammonia arepresent simultaneously, it is important to prevent precipitation of compounds formed when these two react with each other. Since anaerobic digestion occurs under anaerobic conditions, e. g. with no oxygen present, the concentration of oxygen in biogas is usually low. Improper adjustment of oxygen injection systems used in order to biologically remove larger concentrations of H 2 S may increase the oxygen levels of the raw biogas. However, the oxygen concentration is commonly monitored carefully in biogas systems in order to minimize the explosion risk. Biomethane quality requirements when the gas is fed into a natural gas grid are currently limiting the oxygen content in biomethane to almost zero, especially in gas grids which include gas storage systems. It may therefore be necessary to remove oxygen from the product gas, or raw biogas if preferred, if the oxygen present in the raw biogas is passed to the produced biomethane. This is valid for scrubber techniques except membrane and PSAsystems which remove a significant amount of the oxygen. The product gas leaving the plant must uphold certain gas quality criteria, either set as a bilateral agreement with the transporter and/or buyer of the biomethane, which currently are based on national specifications. A new CEN standard on biogas injection of H gas quality has recently been sent to formal vote, regulating levels of minor impurities such as siloxanes and ammonia, and major ones such as hydrogen and oxygen. The minimum calorific content is specified, but the wobbe index is not. Allowed sulfur levels are still relatively high, and not including the contribution of odorization, which is still an issue handled nationally in Europe. Biomethane and compressed natural gas (CNG) delivered at the point of retail is also under standardization. There are efforts to introduce a second dedicated non-grid based grade, which will be beneficial to the sales of biomethane, since most of the parameters will easily be upheld by normal upgrading, with the exception of raw biogas containing larger amounts of siloxanes. In biogas upgrading with membrane separation, amine scrubbers and PSA, very pureCO 2 can be produced. In biogas upgrading using these techniques, besides biomethane, CO 2 can be produced and utilized. The most common ways to use CO 2 are for the use in greenhouses, in the food and cooling industry or to utilize access electricity to let the CO 2 react with H 2 to produce methane, co-called power-to-gas. Power to gas constitutes a way to store access electricity in the form of gas which is gaining increased interest during recent years...|$|R

Past uses of the site have included rail yards, newspaper and magazine printing, tanning, asphalt manufacturing, paint manufacturing, coal and coke yards, foundry operations, iron works, and industrial chemical manufacturing. In 1975, industrial solvent contamination was discovered in the Des Moines water supply by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR); the site is adjacent to the main pumping station for the city, the Des Moines Water Works. Portions of the site were placed on the EPA’s National Priority List (NPL) in 1983 when pesticide-contaminated soils were discovered during the construction of the groundwater treatment system. Remediation has included an <b>air</b> <b>stripper</b> system for treatment of contaminated groundwater and an asphalt cap for containment of contaminated soils...|$|E
40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} {{in water and}} wastewater can be removed using air stripping. The effects of temperature and air-water ratios on the air stripping of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) from wastewater have been examined at a temperature range of 30 – 50 °C and air-water ratios of 20 – 100. Removal efficiencies of > 99 %, > 93 % and 93 % for BTX, respectively, were obtained at 50 °C and air-water ratios of 100. The removal efficiencies increase non-linearly with temperature and air-water flow ratio. The effects of increasing temperature on the removal efficiency {{were found to be}} more significant at temperatures between 30 and 35 °C than at 45 and 50 °C. The effects of increasing water-air ratios on the removal efficiency were more significant at air-water ratios of 20 – 60 than at 80 – 100. The results indicate that a high removal of BTX can be achieved by operating the <b>air</b> <b>stripper</b> at high temperature conditions even at relatively low air-water ratios and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|The NPDES permit {{issued to}} the Savannah River Site (SRS) in 2003 {{contained}} very low metals limits for several outfalls. Copper, {{lead and zinc}} limits were as low as seven micrograms per liter (7 ug/l), 1 ug/l, and 100 ug/l, respectively. The permit contained compliance schedules that provided SRS with only {{three to five years}} to select and implement projects that would enable outfall compliance. Discharges from a few outfalls were eliminated or routed into other locations relatively inexpensively. However, some outfall problems were much more difficult to correct. SRS personnel implemented several innovative projects in order to meet compliance schedule deadlines as inexpensively as possible. These innovations included (1) connecting several outfall discharges to the site's Central Sanitary Wastewater Treatment Facility (CSWTF), (2) constructing a treatment wetlands and completing a water-effects ratio (WER) on its effluent, (3) installing a stannous chloride feed system to remove mercury in an existing <b>air</b> <b>stripper,</b> and (4) constructing a humic acid feed system to increase effluent dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and take advantage of biotic ligand modeling to raise effluent limits...|$|E
40|$|A common {{strategy}} for hydraulic containment and mass removal at VOC contaminated sites is `pump and treat (P&T) `. In P&T operations, contaminated ground water is pumped from wells, treated above ground, and discharged. Many P&T remediation systems at VOC sites rely on air stripping technology because VOCs are easily {{transferred to the}} vapor phase. In stacked-tray air strippers, contaminated water is aerated while it flows down {{through a series of}} trays. System operations at LLNL are strictly regulated by the California and federal Environmental Protection Agencies (Cal/EPA and EPA), the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD), the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) and the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC). These agencies set discharge limits, require performance monitoring, and assess penalties for non-compliance. National laboratories are also subject to scrutiny by the public and other government agencies. This extensive oversight makes it necessary to accurately predict field treatment performance at new extraction locations to ensure compliance with all requirements prior to facility activation. This paper presents treatability test results for a stacked- tray <b>air</b> <b>stripper</b> conducted at LLNL and compares them to the vendor`s modeling software results...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{reviews the}} performance of the groundwater (and wetlands) restoration program implemented by the Commodity Credit Corporation of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (CCC/USDA) at the former CCC/USDA grain storage facility in Utica, Nebraska, during the first five years (2004 - 2009) of this initiative. The report summarizes treatment system operational data and regulatory compliance monitoring results for the site during this period, together with the results of the targeted groundwater sampling and analysis for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) conducted in early 2010 (following completion of the fifth year of systems operation), to assess the initial five years of progress of the Utica remediation effort. On the basis of the 2003 groundwater sampling results, a remedial system employing 4 extraction wells (GWEX 1 -GWEX 4), with groundwater treatment by spray irrigation and conventional air stripping, was implemented with the concurrence of the CCC/USDA and the agencies (Table 1. 1). The principal components of the system are shown in Figure 1. 3 and are briefly described in Section 1. 2. Operation of well GWEX 4 and the associated <b>air</b> <b>stripper</b> began on October 29, 2004, and routine operation of wells GWEX 1 -GWEX 3 and the spray irrigation treatment units began on November 22, 2004...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} removal of mercury from {{wastewater}} using chemical reduction and air stripping using a full-scale treatment system at the Savannah River Site. The existing water treatment system utilizes air stripping as the unit operation to remove organic compounds from groundwater that also contains mercury (C ~ 250 ng/L). The baseline air stripping process was ineffective in removing mercury and the water exceeded a proposed limit of 51 ng/L. To test an enhancement to the existing treatment modality a continuous dose of reducing agent was injected for 6 -hours at the inlet of the <b>air</b> <b>stripper.</b> This action resulted in the chemical reduction of mercury to Hg(0), a species that is removable with the existing unit operation. During the injection period a 94 % decrease in concentration was observed and the effluent satisfied proposed limits. The process was optimized over a 2 -day period by sequentially evaluating dose rates ranging from 0. 64 X to 297 X stoichiometry. A minimum dose of 16 X stoichiometry was necessary to initiate the reduction reaction that facilitated the mercury removal. Competing electron acceptors likely inhibited the reaction at the lower 1 doses, which prevented removal by air stripping. These results indicate that chemical reduction coupled with air stripping can effectively treat large-volumes of water to emerging part per trillion regulatory standards for mercury...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{issued the}} second phase of the organic air {{emission}} standards for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) and hazardous waste generators in December 1994. These standards (referred to as the Subpart CC standards) are designed to further reduce organic air emissions from hazardous waste management activities. To comply with these new air standards, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is designing a volatile organic removal and destruction treatment train to modify its existing Waste Water Treatment Tank Farm (hereafter called Tank Farm). LLNL`s Tank Farm consists of six, 7, 000 -L open-top tanks used to store and treat aqueous low-level radioactive, mixed, and hazardous waste before discharging it to the local publicly owned treatment works. The waste stored and treated in the tanks have elevated volatile organic constituent (VOC) concentrations. According to the Subpart CC standards, tanks handling waste with similar VOC concentrations must be retrofitted with a cover and an emission control device for cover openings that achieves at least a 95 % reduction in the total organic content of the vented gas stream. However, LLNL concluded that the removal and destruction of VOCs from waste before they enter the Tank Farm would demonstrate compliance with the Subpart CC standards more effectively and be more cost effective than installation of air emission control devices on the Tank Farm. LLNL has designed this removal and destruction technique to consist of an <b>air</b> <b>stripper,</b> high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, catalytic oxidizer, scrubber, and mist eliminator...|$|E
40|$|Mercury (Hg) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a 'persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic' pollutant with widespread impacts throughout North America and the world (EPA. 1997 a, 1997 b, 1998 a, 1998 b, 2000). Although most of the mercury in the environment is inorganic Hg, a small proportion of total Hg is transformed through the actions of aquatic microbes into methylmercury (MeHg). In contrast to virtually all other metals, MeHg biomagnifies or becomes increasingly concentrated as it is transferred through aquatic food chains so that the consumption of mercury contaminated fish is the primary route of this toxin to humans. For this reason, the ambient water quality criterion (AWQC) for mercury is based on a fish tissue endpoint rather than an aqueous Hg concentration, as the tissue concentration (e. g., < 0. 3 {mu}g/g fillet) {{is considered to be a}} more consistent indicator of exposure and risk (EPA, 2001). Effective mercury remediation at point-source contaminated sites requires an understanding of the nature and magnitude of mercury inputs, and also knowledge of how these inputs must be controlled in order to achieve the desired reduction of mercury contamination in biota necessary for compliance with AWQC targets. One of the challenges to remediation is that mercury body burdens in fish are more closely linked to aqueous MeHg than to inorganic Hg concentrations (Sveinsdottir and Mason 2005), but MeHg production is not easily predicted or controlled. At point-source contaminated sites, mercury methylation is not only affected by the absolute mercury load, but also by the form of mercury loaded. In addition, once MeHg is formed, the hydrology, trophic structure, and water chemistry of a given system affect how it is transformed and transferred through the food chain to fish. Decreasing inorganic Hg concentrations and loading may often therefore be a more achievable remediation goal, but has led to mixed results in terms of responses in fish bioaccumulation. A number of source control measures have resulted in rapid responses in lake or reservoir fisheries (Joslin 1994, Turner and Southworth 1999; Orihel et al., 2007), but examples of similar responses in Hg-contaminated stream ecosystems are less common. Recent work suggests that stream systems may actually be more susceptible to mercury bioaccumulation than lakes, highlighting the need to better understand the ecological drivers of mercury bioaccumulation in stream-dwelling fish (Chasar et al. 2009, Ward et al. 2010). In the present study we examine the response of fish to remedial actions in Tims Branch, a point-source contaminated stream on the Department of Energy's (DOE) Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina. This second order stream received inorganic mercury inputs at its headwaters from the 1950 s- 2000 s which contaminated the water, sediments, and biota downstream. In 2007, an innovative mercury removal system using tin (II) chloride (stannous chloride, SnCl{sub 2 }) was implemented at a pre-existing <b>air</b> <b>stripper.</b> Tin(II) reduces dissolved Hg (II) to Hg (0), which is removed by the <b>air</b> <b>stripper.</b> During this process, tin(II) is oxidized to tin (IV) which is expected to precipitate as colloidal tin(IV) oxides and hydroxides, particulate materials with relatively low toxicity (Hallas and Cooney, 1981, EPA 2002, ATSDR, 2005). The objectives of the present research are to provide an initial assessment of the net impacts of the tin(II) based mercury treatment on key biota and to document the distribution and fate of inorganic tin in this small stream ecosystem after the first several years of operating a full scale system. To support these objectives, we collected fish, sediment, water, invertebrates, and biofilm samples from Tims Branch to quantify the general behavior and accumulation patterns for mercury and tin in the ecosystem and to determine if the treatment process has resulted in: (1) a measurable beneficial impact on (i. e., decrease of) mercury concentration in upper trophic level fish and other biota; this is a key environmental endpoint since reducing mercury concentration in fish is a primary regulatory driver for controlling mercury in streams; and (2) the potential for negative impacts associated with inorganic tin, including, biological transformation and uptake, and/or undesirable accumulation/focusing of tin to in key ecosystem compartments...|$|E
30|$|The key to an {{efficient}} stripping process {{lies in the}} design of the contact system between the TAN-rich digestate and the gas to strip out the NH 3. The aim is to maximize the level of contact while minimizing the energy costs. The most common stripping systems use continuously packed towers [17]. Other options are spray towers, low profile units, bubble diffusers, aspirators, surface aerators and high-intensity mixers. Selection of the appropriate technology is both case and site specific. Limoli et al. [18] investigated ammonia removal from raw manure digestate by means of a turbulent mixing stripping process. Batch tests demonstrated that sodium hydroxide was the most suitable alkaline chemical to control pH, as it is easy to handle and minimizes treatment time and costs. When NaOH was applied to treat raw digestate at pH 10 and a temperature of 296.15  K (23  °C), TAN removal efficiency reached 89 % after 24  h of turbulent mixing stripping. Provolo et al. [19] investigated the performance of a stripping process based on a new concept of installation in which slow-rate NH 3 volatilization was promoted in a closed reactor containing continuously mixed digestate. Jiang et al. [20] investigated ammonia removal through air stripping of digested dairy manure using packed columns. Temperature and pH were identified as sensitive parameters for the process. When the temperature of the digestate was maintained at mesophilic level (308.15  K or 35  °C) during the stripping process, the optimized pH for ammonia stripping was 10.3 resulting in 90 % ammonia removal. In various studies, self-built laboratory setups were used to strip ammonium from wastewater or digestate. Yuan et al. [21] demonstrated the removal of ammonia from wastewater using a continuous-flow rotating packed bed as an <b>air</b> <b>stripper</b> at ambient temperature. Bousek et al. [22] studied the impact of strip gas composition on side stream ammonia stripping of digestate. For this purpose, they used a laboratory-scale batch stripping and scrubbing plant constructed from glass elements. The stripping unit was equipped with a fast-rotating pedal at the upper end that functioned as a foam destruction device. The stripper was connected to the scrubber unit via a horizontal laboratory glass tube. The scrubber column (Vigreux column) and a 1 L round bottom flask were operated in parallel current mode using 1  M H 2 SO 4 as scrubbing media.|$|E
40|$|The Commodity Credit Corporation of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (CCC/USDA) {{operated}} a grain storage facility in Waverly, Nebraska, from 1952 to 1974. During this time, the grain fumigant ' 80 / 20 ' (carbon tetrachloride/carbon disulfide) {{was used to}} preserve stored grain. In 1982, sampling by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found carbon tetrachloride contamination in the town's groundwater. After {{an investigation of the}} contaminant distribution, the site was placed on the National Priority List (NPL) in 1986, and the CCC/USDA accepted responsibility for the contamination. An Interagency Compliance Agreement between the EPA and the CCC/USDA was finalized in May 1988 (EPA 1990). The EPA (Woodward-Clyde Consultants, contractor) started immediate cleanup efforts in 1987 with the installation of an <b>air</b> <b>stripper,</b> a soil vapor extraction system, a groundwater extraction well, and groundwater and soil gas monitoring wells (Woodward-Clyde 1986, 1988 a,b). After the EPA issued its Record of Decision (ROD; EPA 1990), the CCC/USDA (Argonne National Laboratory, contractor) took over operation of the treatment systems. The CCC/USDA conducted a site investigation (Argonne 1991, 1992 a,b), during which a carbon tetrachloride plume in groundwater was discovered northeast of the former facility. This plume was not being captured by the existing groundwater extraction system. The remediation system was modified in 1994 (Argonne 1993) with the installation of a second groundwater extraction well to contain the contamination further. Subsequently, a detailed evaluation of the system resulted in a recommendation to pump only the second well to conserve water in the aquifer (Argonne 1995). Sampling and analysis after implementation of this recommendation showed continued decreases in the extent and concentrations of the contamination with only one well pumping (Argonne 1999). The CCC/USDA issued quarterly monitoring reports from 1988 to 2009. Complete documentation of the CCC/USDA characterization and remediation efforts, including the quarterly monitoring reports, is on the compact disc inside the back cover of this report. The EPA reported on the progress of the remediation systems in a series of five-year reviews (EPA 1993, 1999, 2004, 2009). These reports and other EPA documentation are also on the compact disc inside the back cover of this report, along with the Woodward-Clyde (1986, 1988 a,b) documentation cited. Starting in 2006, the analytical results for groundwater (the only medium still being monitored) showed no carbon tetrachloride concentrations above the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 5. 0 g/L. Because the cleanup goals specified in the ROD (EPA 1990) had been met, the EPA removed the site from the NPL in November 2006 (Appendix A). In 2008 the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for the remediation system was deactivated, and a year later the EPA released its fourth and final five-year report (EPA 2009), indicating that no further action was required for the site and that the site was ready for unlimited use. In 2011 - 2012, the CCC/USDA decommissioned the remediation systems at Waverly. This report documents the decommission process and closure of the site...|$|E
