Monkshood and other Aconitum species are still used in Oriental and homeopathic medicine as analgesics, febrifuges and hypotensives. The neurotoxin aconitine is the principal alkaloid in most subspecies of monkshood. A review is presented, which includes historical aspects of monkshood as a poisonous and medicinal plant, the mode of action of aconitine, symptoms of toxicity, treatment and reports of recent poisoning incidents. In addition, results of quantitative HPLC examination of hypogeous and epigeous organs from a population of A. napellus ssp. vulgare cultivated in Iceland are discussed. The fact that children in Iceland have commonly been known to eat the sweet tasting nectaries in monkshood prompted an investigation of the alkaloidal content of these organs specifically. The low aconitine content found in the nectaries as well as in whole flowers accords with the absence of reported toxicity arising from the handling of flowers and consumption of nectaries from A. napellus in this country.

40|$|Background: High and ultra-high dilutions {{of various}} {{starting}} materials, e. g. copper sulfate, Hypericum perforatum and sulfur, showed {{significant differences in}} ultraviolet light (UV) transmission from controls and amongst different dilution levels [1, 2]. Verum and placebo globules of <b>Aconitum</b> <b>napellus</b> 30 c or calcium carbonate/quercus e cortice 6 x from the same packs as used in previous clinical trials and dissolved in water could be distinguished by UV spectroscopy [3]. However, {{it was unclear whether}} the differences in UV absorbance originated from specific characteristics of the starting materials, from differences in the production of verum and placebo globules, and/or other unknown interference factors. Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether globules produced with high and ultra-high dilutions (6 x, 12 x, 30 c, 200 c, 200 CF (centesimal discontinuous fluxion), 10, 000 CF) of various starting materials (<b>Aconitum</b> <b>napellus,</b> Atropa belladonna, phosphorus, sulfur, Apis mellifica, quartz) could be distinguished by UV spectroscopy. Methodology: The globules were specially produced for this study by Spagyros AG (Gümligen, Switzerland) and differed only in the starting materials of the dilutions (but not in the batch of globules or ethanol used). Globules were dissolved in water at 10 mg/ml, in quadruplicates, approximately 22 h prior to the measurements. Absorbance of the samples in the UV range (from 190 to 340 nm) was measured in a randomized order with a Shimadzu double beam UV- 1800 spectrophotometer equipped with an auto sampler. Samples of each starting material were prepared and measured on 5 independent days. The daily variations of the spectrophotometer as well as the drift during the measurements were corrected for. The average absorbance from 200 to 340 nm was compared among various starting materials within equal dilution levels using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Statistically significant differences were found among 30 c (Figure 1), 200 c and 200 CF dilutions of the various starting materials. No differences were found among 6 x, 12 x and 10, 000 CF dilutions. Conclusions: Globules prepared from high dilutions of various starting materials may show significantly different UV absorbance when dissolved in water.

60|$|Dr. W. Ogle has {{communicated to}} me a curious case. He {{gathered}} in Switzerland 100 flower-stems {{of the common}} blue variety of the monkshood (<b>Aconitum</b> <b>napellus),</b> {{and not a single}} flower was perforated; he then gathered 100 stems of a white variety growing close by, and every one of the open flowers had been perforated. (11/13. Dr. Ogle 'Popular Science Review' July 1869 page 267. Bailey 'American Naturalist' November 1873 page 690. Gentry ibid May 1875 page 264.) This surprising difference {{in the state of the}} flowers may be attributed with much probability to the blue variety being distasteful to bees, from the presence of the acrid matter which is so general in the Ranunculaceae, and to its absence in the white variety in correlation with the loss of the blue tint. According to Sprengel, this plant is strongly proterandrous (11/14. 'Das Entdeckte' etc. page 278.); it would therefore be more or less sterile unless bees carried pollen from the younger to the older flowers. Consequently the white variety, the flowers of which were always bitten instead of being properly entered by the bees, would fail to yield the full number of seeds and would be a comparatively rare plant, as Dr. Ogle informs me was the case.|$|R

Aim: To assess the action of homeopathic medicine Acon in the treatment of generalized anxiety in an experimental model using rats. Methods: 48 adult (two to three months old) male Wistar rats (Rattus rattus) were randomly divided in six groups (n= 8 /treatment) and given the following treatments by gastric tube along 10 days: 1) control (diazepam 1 mg/kg/day); 2) negative control (0. 15 mL saline solution/day); 3) ACH 6 (0. 15 mL Acon (6 cH/day); 4) ACH 12 (0. 15 mL Acon 12 cH/day); 5) ACH 30 (0. 15 mL Acon 30 cH/day); and 6) ALC 30 (0. 15 mL 30 % cereal alcohol/day). Behavioral effects were blindly and randomly assessed in elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test. Results: Acon in dilutions 12 cH and 30 cH exhibited possible anxiolytic effects on the central nervous system (CNS) since they increased the number of entries in the EPM open arms (12 cH and 30 cH) and the permanence time in the EPM open arms (30 cH only).

40|$|In {{invasion}} ecology, potential {{impacts of}} aliens on native flora {{are still under}} debate. Our aim {{was to determine the}} pollinator mediated effects of both proximity and abundance of an alien species on the reproductive success of natives. We chose the highly invasive Impatiens glandulifera and two native species: Epilobium angustifolium and <b>Aconitum</b> <b>napellus</b> ssp. lusitanicum. These species share characteristics allowing for pollination interactions: similar biotopes, overlapping flowering periods and same main pollinators. The effects of abundance (5, 25 and 100 individuals) and proximity (0 and 15 m) of the alien on visitation rate, insect behaviour, pollen deposition and reproductive success of both natives were investigated during 2 flowering seasons. We used centred visitation rates as they can be directly interpreted as a positive or negative effect of the invasive. Both abundance and proximity of the alien increased bumblebee visitation rates to both natives. On the other hand, abundance of the exotic species had a slight negative effect on honeybee visits to natives while its proximity had no effect. The behaviour of bumblebees changed as visitors left significantly more often the native plants for I. glandulifera when its abundance increased. As a consequence of this “inconstancy”, bees deposited considerable quantities of alien pollen on native stigmas. Nevertheless, this interspecific pollen transfer did not decrease seed set in natives. Self-compatibility and high attractiveness of both native species probably alleviate the risk of altered pollinator services and reproductive success due to the invader in natural populations. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective Homeopathic {{globules}} {{are commonly}} used in clinical practice, while research focuses on liquid potencies. Sequential dilution and succussion in their production process has been proposed to change the physico-chemical properties of the solvent(s). It {{has been reported that}} aqueous potencies of various starting materials showed significant differences in ultraviolet light transmission compared to controls and between different dilution levels. The aim {{of the present study was}} to repeat and expand these experiments to homeopathic globules. Methods Globules were specially produced for this study by Spagyros AG (Gümligen, Switzerland) from 6 starting materials (<b>Aconitum</b> <b>napellus,</b> Atropa belladonna, phosphorus, sulfur, Apis mellifica, quartz) and for 6 dilution levels (6 x, 12 x, 30 c, 200 c, 200 CF (centesimal discontinuous fluxion), 10, 000 CF). Native globules and globules impregnated with solvents were used as controls. Globules were dissolved in ultrapure water, and absorbance in the ultraviolet range was measured. The average absorbance from 200 to 340  nm was calculated and corrected for differences between measurement days and instrumental drift. Results Statistically significant differences were found for A. napellus, sulfur, and A. mellifica when normalized average absorbance of the various dilution levels from the same starting material (including control and solvent control globules) was compared. Additionally, absorbance within dilution levels was compared among the various starting materials. Statistically significant differences were found among 30 c, 200 c and 200 CF dilutions. Conclusion This study has expanded previous findings from aqueous potencies to globules and may indicate that characteristics of aqueous high dilutions may be preserved and detectable in dissolved globules...|$|R
40|$|Nectar robbery {{is usually}} thought to impact {{negatively}} on the reproductive success of plants, but also neutral or even positive effects have been reported. Very {{few studies have}} investigated the effects of nectar robbing on the behaviour of legitimate pollinators so far. Such behavioural changes {{may lead to the}} reduction of geitonogamy or to increased pollen movement. We simulated nectar robbing in experimental sites as well as in natural populations of <b>Aconitum</b> <b>napellus</b> ssp. lusitanicum, a rare plant pollinated by long-tongued bumblebees. In an experimental setup, we removed the nectaries of 40 % of the flowers, which is similar to rates of robbing observed in wild populations. Patches of plants with experimentally robbed flowers were compared with control patches containing plants with untreated flowers. We observed pollinator behaviour, mimicked male reproductive success (pollen dispersal) using fluorescent dye, and measured female reproductive success (seed set). The main legitimate visitors were bumblebees while honeybees were often observed robbing nectar. They did so by "base working", i. e. sliding between tepals. Bumblebees tended to visit fewer flowers per plant and spent less time per single flower when these had been experimentally robbed. This change in behaviour consequently increased the proportion of flowers visited by bumblebees in patches with robbed flowers. Fluorescent dye mimicking pollen flow was dispersed larger distances after pollinators had visited patches with robbed flowers compared to control patches. Average seed set per plant was not affected by nectar robbing. Our results demonstrated that A. napellus does not suffer from nectar robbery but may rather benefit via improved pollen dispersal and thus, male reproductive success. Knowledge on such combined effects of behavioural changes of pollinators due to nectar robbery is important to understand the evolutionary significance of exploiters of such mutualistic relationships between plants and their pollinators. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland...|$|R

40|$|Background: Monkshood (<b>Aconitum</b> <b>napellus),</b> {{commonly}} known as wolf’s bane, is a wild flowering plant native to the Northern Hemisphere which can also be cultivated. The plant has a long and well documented history as a poison, being used for hunting and homicide. Aconitine and other alkaloids found {{in all parts of}} the plant are responsible for the toxicity of monkshood. Many fatalities have been reported following ingestion and patients commonly present with gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular symptoms. Case report: We report the case of a 45 -year-old male patient who was hospitalised following an intentional ingestion of a 3 – 4 inch piece of monkshood root from his garden. The patient began to vomit and complain of dizziness within 2 h of ingestion. He was found collapsed and his heart rate, blood pressure and level of consciousness all dropped en route to hospital. Bradycardia (46 beats per minute) and hypotension (blood pressure 90 / 50 mmHg) were recorded on admission. An ECG revealed flattened T waves and bigeminy. The patient was moved into the Trendelenburg position and given 500 mL of normal saline. At this point the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) were contacted for advice. Atropine and colloid administration were recommended in accordance with ToxBase (The primary clinical toxicology database of the NPIS). It was also suggested that transfer to an intensive care unit and administration of an inotrope would be required should the patient’s pulse and blood pressure not improve. Atropine (3 mg) was given intravenously but no increase in heart rate was evidenced. At approximately 12 h post ingestion the patient’s blood pressure dropped to 60 / 40 mmHg and he was given one litre of gelofusine intravenously over a 30 min period. Following this intervention the patient’s blood pressure began to improve and continued to do so until he had made a full recovery. He was discharged from hospital 2 days later. Conclusion: Severe bradycardia and hypotension may occur when monkshood is ingested and bradycardia may, as in this case, be resistant to atropine. Supportive therapy with close monitoring of blood pressure and ECG is recommended for patients who have been poisoned by monkshood...|$|R
