They contrast their lives to Telemachus' <b>and</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> they would have killed him as a child if they knew he would kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E

Selene enters and tells them she has saved Sir Ethais's life, but the jealous fairies are not {{interested}} in listening to her. Selene is perplexed at her sisters' changed attitude.|$|E

The official website for The Office included two cut scenes from [...] "Casual Friday" [...] {{within a week of}} its original release. In the first 50-second clip, Jim welcomes Pam to her new sales desk with a gift of a model of an island with figures representing Jim, Pam and Dwight, who share the office pod together. Dwight insists he did not {{have anything to do with}} the gift and does not welcome Pam to the desk because she [...] "obscures my view of the shredder." [...] In the second 50-second clip, Dwight tells Andy, Stanley and Phyllis that they should [...] "put our balls in the guillotine, as they say," [...] by threatening to quit if Michael does not give their clients back.

60|$|Back in the house, Dick found Paula {{playing to}} the madrono sages, and ensconced himself on the couch to wait <b>and</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> she would kiss him good night when bedtime came. It was not, he recognized, as if they made a regular {{schedule}} of kissing. It had never been like that. Often and often {{he did not see}} her until midday, and then in the presence of guests.

60|$|Every one {{was kind}} to her; but {{nobody seemed to}} love her, to care when she was good, or wish to make her better when she was selfish or angry.

60|$|Yes, and again, {{as we walk}} home, I note some {{neighbours}} {{looking at}} my mother and at me, and whispering.
