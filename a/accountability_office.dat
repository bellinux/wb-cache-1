5|$|Spending {{reductions}} {{included a}} reduction in Medicare reimbursements to insurers and drug companies for private Medicare Advantage policies that the Government <b>Accountability</b> <b>Office</b> and Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found to be excessively costly relative to government Medicare; and reductions in Medicare reimbursements to hospitals that failed standards of efficiency and care.|$|E
5|$|Fogleman's {{investigation}} led {{to several}} of the officers involved in the incident receiving further administrative discipline. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) subsequently refused U.S. Senate subpoenas for four USAF officers {{to be interviewed for}} the Senate investigation, which was never publicly released. The U.S. House investigation, conducted in part by the Government <b>Accountability</b> <b>Office</b> (GAO), found that the military investigative and judicial systems had operated mostly as designed, but also noted that the DoD had refused access to key witnesses.|$|E
5|$|In September 1995 the House National Security Subcommittee on Military Personnel, {{chaired by}} Bob Dornan, {{requested}} that the Government <b>Accountability</b> <b>Office</b> (GAO) conduct its own investigation into the shootdown incident. Specifically, the GAO was asked {{to determine if the}} USAF accident investigation board had met its objectives, if the subsequent military justice investigations had followed established guidelines, and if the DoD and/or USAF had improperly or unlawfully influenced these investigations.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{approved}} in 2002 by the United States Congress, but {{federal funding for}} the site ended in 2011 under the Obama Administration via amendment to the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, passed on April 14, 2011. The project has had many difficulties and was highly contested by the non-local public, the Western Shoshone peoples, and many politicians. The Government <b>Accountability</b> <b>Office</b> stated that the closure was for political, not technical or safety reasons.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the US Government <b>Accountability</b> <b>Office</b> said a {{shortage}} of lithium-7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk”. The problem stems from the decline of US nuclear infrastructure. The equipment needed to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7 is mostly a cold war leftover. The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963, when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. The report {{said it would take}} five years and $10 million to $12 million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7.|$|E
5|$|In April 2006, the Government <b>Accountability</b> <b>Office</b> (GAO) {{assessed}} the F-22's cost to be $361million per aircraft, with $28billion invested in development and testing; the Unit Procurement Cost {{was estimated at}} $178million in 2006, based on a production run of 181 aircraft. It was estimated {{by the end of}} production, $34billion will have been spent on procurement, resulting in a total program cost of $62billion, around $339million per aircraft. The incremental cost for an additional F-22 was estimated at about $138million in 2009. The GAO stated the estimated cost was $412 million per aircraft in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In January 2005, the US101 was {{selected}} for the VXX Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program, and was promptly re-designated as the VH-71. However, development was subject to delays, cost overruns, and engineering issues; Lockheed attributed much of these issues to unanticipated and extensive modifications being demanded by the government that had been absent from the request for proposal (RFP) issued. A Government <b>Accountability</b> <b>Office</b> (GAO) report in 2011 also recognised {{that a lack of}} flexibility and compromise {{on the part of the}} government had negatively impacted the programme. By late 2008, the cancellation of the VH-71 was looking increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate has}} played out {{across a wide}} {{spectrum}} of media, including newspapers, magazines, web blogs, and congressional research arms like the Government <b>Accountability</b> <b>Office.</b> Each side has presented different arguments on the best approach to the problem, but most of the participants favor the continuation of the DD(X) program or the reinstatement of the Iowa-class battleships to the Naval Vessel Register. The s, the s, and s have entered the debate as options put forward for naval gunfire support, while others advocate the use of specifically designed close air support planes and newer missile systems that can loiter in an area as a replacement for naval gunfire.|$|E
5|$|The {{mayor and}} council set local taxes and a budget, {{which must be}} {{approved}} by Congress. The Government <b>Accountability</b> <b>Office</b> and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the District's local budget of anywhere between $470million and over $1billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as Medicaid and the operation of the local justice system; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.|$|E
5|$|Some reports {{suggested}} that the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle program to replace the M113 family of vehicles was being favored over the GCV program. While procurement of the AMPV fleet would cost over $5 billion, the Government <b>Accountability</b> <b>Office</b> estimated the GCV fleet would cost $37 billion. In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office said the AMPV {{would be a better}} buy because analysts had asserted that the vehicles the GCV was slated to replace should not be first. The GCV would replace 61 M2 Bradley IFVs per armored combat brigade, making up 18 percent of the 346 armored combat vehicles in each armored brigade. A 24 September 2013 Congressional Research Service report {{suggested that}} given budgetary constraints, the GCV program may be unrealistic, and that one potential discussion could focus on a decision by the Army to replace the GCV with the AMPV as their number one ground combat vehicle acquisition priority.|$|E
