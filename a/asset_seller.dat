40|$|We {{extend the}} concept of {{competitive}} search equilibrium to environments with private information, and in particular adverse selection. Principals (e. g. employers or agent who want to buy assets) post contracts, which are modeled as revelation mechanisms, to attract agents (e. g. workers or <b>asset</b> <b>sellers)</b> who have private information about the potential gains from trade. Agents observe the posted contracts and decided where to apply, trading off the terms of trade offered by a contract against the probability of matching, which depends in general on principals capacity constraints and market search frictions. We characterize equilibrium as the solution to a constrained opti-mization problem, and show that in equilibrium principals offer separating contracts to attract different types of agents. We then present a series of applications, including models of the rat race, insurance, and lemons in asset trading. These examples illus-trate the usefulness and generality of the approach, and serve to contrast our findings with standard results in both the contract and search literatures. ...|$|R

50|$|The put buyer either {{believes}} that the underlying asset's price will fall by the exercise date or hopes to protect a long position in it. The advantage of buying a put over short selling the asset is that the option owner's risk of loss {{is limited to the}} premium paid for it, whereas the <b>asset</b> short <b>seller's</b> risk of loss is unlimited (its price can rise greatly, in fact, in theory it can rise infinitely, and such a rise is the short seller's loss).

50|$|So, {{in order}} for an {{essentially}} one-sided contract to still be valid and binding, the contract will generally be written so that one side gives up something of value, while the other side gives a token sum—one pound, dollar, or literally one peppercorn. Peppercorn payments are sometimes used when selling a struggling company whose net worth may be negative. If some party agrees to take it over and assume its liabilities {{as well as its}} <b>assets,</b> the <b>seller</b> may actually agree to make a large payment to the buyer.

40|$|In Chapter 1, I {{explore how}} speculators can destabilize {{financial}} markets by amplifying negative shocks in periods of market turmoil, and confirm the main {{predictions of the}} theoretical analysis using data on money market funds (MMFs). I propose a dynamic trading model with two types of investors - long-term and speculative - who interact in a market with search frictions. During periods of turmoil created by an uncertainty shock, speculators react to declining asset prices by liquidating their holdings in hopes of buying them back later at a gain, despite the asset's cash flows remaining the same throughout. Interestingly, I show that a reduction in trading frictions leads to more severe fluctuations in asset prices. At the root of this result are the strategic complementarities between speculators expected to follow similar strategies in the future. Using a novel dataset on MMFs' portfolio holdings during the European debt crisis, I gauge the strength of funds' strategic interactions {{as the number of}} funding relationships each issuer has with MMFs. I show that funds are more likely to liquidate the securities of issuers that have fewer funding relationships with other funds, obliging them to borrow at shorter maturity and higher interest rates. In Chapter 2, co-authored with Marco Pagano, I study a model where some investors ("hedgers") are bad at information processing, while others ("speculators") have superior information-processing ability and trade purely to exploit it. The disclosure of financial information induces a trade externality: if speculators refrain from trading, hedgers do the same, depressing the asset price. Market transparency reinforces this mechanism, by making speculators' trades more visible to hedgers. As a consequence, <b>asset</b> <b>sellers</b> will oppose both the disclosure of fundamentals and trading transparency. This is socially inefficient if a large fraction of market participants are speculators and hedgers have low processing costs. But in these circumstances, forbidding hedgers' access to the market may dominate mandatory disclosure. In Chapter 3, I show that reputation concerns are important sources of discipline for institutional investors, but their effectiveness varies along the business cycle. I propose a dynamic model of reputation formation in which investors learn about fund managers' skill upon observing past returns. Managers can generate active returns at a disutility and determine the fund's exposure to tail risk. The model delivers rich dynamics for managers' behavior. Good reputation managers exploit their status by extracting higher rents from investors, while intermediate reputation managers tend to improve their returns to attract more funds. Finally, for bad performers there exists a reputation trap: their perceived low quality prevents them from attracting investors' capital and then also from improving their track record. Furthermore, when the economy is subject to aggregate shocks, fund managers tend to exacerbate fluctuations by exposing the fund to tail risk to increase short-term returns. The model provides a framework to analyze the investment strategies adopted by mutual funds and hedge funds during the recent financial crisis. by Marco Di Maggio. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|We {{develop a}} simple model of {{flexible}} specialization under demand uncertainty. A buyer faces multiple suppliers with heterogeneous quality {{who have the}} option of selling to other buyers. The more specific a <b>seller’s</b> <b>assets</b> are to the buyer, the lower is his flexibility to cater to the outside market and this cost is greater for higher quality suppliers. Therefore even if a buyer typically prefers high quality suppliers, some low quality suppliers might be kept as marginal suppliers because of their greater willingness to invest more in assets specific to the buyer, especially in the presence of contracting problems and high uncertainty. We then examine a primary dataset on contracts between the largest tractor assembler in Pakistan and its suppliers and examine how the extent of asset specificity and other supplier characteristics affect contractual outcomes such as prices and distribution of orders and find evidence that the more dedicated suppliers are indeed of lower quality. ...|$|R

30|$|Let us {{now turn}} to a simple example. At a microeconomic, partial equilibrium, level, {{it is true that}} a bank can {{increase}} the quantity of deposits when it provides a loan. But this is only true at the initiation of the loan. Consider a simple example that illustrates why this is not necessarily the case once the loan is being used. Assume I want to buy a house and I ask a mortgage loan from my bank. When my bank grants me the loan, the funds are available on my checking account. So in this initial operation, my bank indeed increases money. Then, I transfer immediately the funds to the seller of the house, who has an account in another bank and will see an increase in her checking account. If the seller keeps the funds in the checking account, her bank can use the funds to make a loan, as it happens in textbook examples of the money multiplier. But assume that the seller does not want to keep these funds in her checking account, as it bears a low interest, and transfers them to interest-bearing instruments of her bank (e.g., time deposits, bank bonds, savings account). Then, {{at the end of the}} day, my mortgage loan has no impact on the quantity of checking accounts and on M 1, as my loan is matched by an increase in interest-yielding <b>assets</b> of the <b>seller.</b> In other terms, there is no obvious link between credit and sight deposits even when considering a single loan.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} the potential bias induced in {{an index of}} <b>asset</b> prices when <b>sellers</b> use reservation rules that may include some component of private value. We develop a model in which the seller’s asking price is determined by private valuation while the buyer’s bid price {{is determined by the}} market valuation, and a transaction takes place only if the bid is higher than the ask. Therefore, the trading volume and the observed transaction prices are both affected by the ratio of seller’s private valuation to the market valuation, which is called the seller reserve ratio. The higher the seller reserve ratio, the lower is the trading volume and the larger is the difference between the market valuation estimated using observed prices and the actual market valuation. To address the estimation problem posed by the bias, we propose a three step-econometric procedure. We first estimate the unconditional index. We next estimate the average seller reserve ratio and the unconditional population variance of pricing errors. We then use these estimates in step two to correct for the bias in the index based on observed prices in either a hedonic regression or a repeat sale regression. Simulations show that this remedy effectively mitigates the bias. Moreover, the reserve-conditional indices are potentially more accurate than traditional hedonic and repeat sale indices. We apply this technique to Los Angeles housing market, and show that the reserve-conditional index could substantially differ from a traditional repeat sale index. In our application, the reserve-conditional index is more volatile, and appears to capture market downturns in a more timely fashion...|$|R
40|$|In online {{shopping}} buyers {{do not have}} enough information about sellers and cannot inspect the products before purchasing them. To help buyers find reliable sellers, online marketplaces deploy Trust and Reputation Management (TRM) systems. These systems aggregate buyers’ feedback about the sellers they have interacted with and about the products they have purchased, to inform users within the marketplace about the sellers and products before making purchases. Thus positive customer feedback has become a valuable <b>asset</b> for each <b>seller</b> in order to attract more business. This naturally creates incentives for cheating, in terms of introducing fake positive feedback. Therefore, an important responsibility of TRM systems is to aid buyers find genuine feedback (reviews) about different sellers. Recent TRM systems achieve this goal by selecting and assigning credible advisers to any new customer/buyer. These advisers are selected among the buyers who have had experience with a number of sellers and have provided feedback for their services and goods. As people differ in their tastes, the buyer feedback that would be most useful should come from advisers with similar tastes and values. In addition, the advisers should be honest, i. e. provide truthful reviews and ratings, and not malicious, i. e. not collude with sellers to favour them or with other buyers to badmouth some sellers. Defining the boundary between dishonest and honest advisers is very important. However, currently, there is no systematic approach for setting the honesty threshold which divides benevolent advisers from the malicious ones. The thesis addresses this problem and proposes a market-adaptive honesty threshold management mechanism. In this mechanism the TRM system forms a feedback system which monitors the current status of the e-marketplace. According to the status of the e-marketplace the feedback system improves the performance utilizing PID controller from the field of control systems. The responsibility of this controller is to set the the suitable value of honesty threshold. The results of experiments, using simulation and real-world dataset show that the market-adaptive honesty threshold allows to optimize the performance of the marketplace with respect to throughput and buyer satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Reducing foreign {{exchange}} settlement risk 1 Much {{progress has been}} made in reducing settlement risk in {{foreign exchange}} markets, particularly through use of CLS Bank. However, the remaining exposures are sometimes still significantly large and not always well managed, creating the potential for systemic risk. To address this problem, it is particularly important that prudential regulators promote effective management of the risk by market participants. JEL classification: G 15, G 18, G 2, G 21, G 28, G 32. Foreign exchange settlement risk has proved to be a persistent and problematic issue in financial markets. Despite much discussion and even a significant amount of action, the size and nature of the risk mean that it could still disrupt the stability of global financial markets. This special feature examines the results of a survey that took place in April 2006 to assess the degree of risk. The survey was carried out for the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) by 27 central banks and involved 109 institutions (both banks and non-banks) that were selected to cover 80 % of the foreign exchange (FX) market in 15 currency areas (CPSS (2008)). This feature first sets out the background to the survey, and then summarises the survey’s key findings. Next it explains why there is still a problem with FX settlement risk, and finally it suggests that there are two key actions which need to be taken if the problem is to be addressed effectively. The nature of FX settlement risk Trading in financial markets typically requires settlement – delivery of the <b>asset</b> by the <b>seller</b> and payment for it by the buyer. The market for foreign exchange is no different, except that settlement involves two payments – ie the exchange of one currency for another. Although FX settlement is often regarded as a routine activity that is less interesting than the trading itself, it deserves close attention because of the risk that can be involved, namely the risk that one party to an FX trade pays the currency it has sold but fails to receive the currency it has bought. The risk arises because, using the traditional method o...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – How {{to measure}} {{knowledge}} assets {{has become the}} focus of attention of scholars in two main fields: intellectual capital and knowledge management. This paper builds on the combination of reflections made by the authors focusing on complementary fields (so far developed separately despite their converging points) : knowledge management/knowledge economy on the one hand, and ontological approaches to knowledge modelling on the other hand. By integrating core elements derived from these fields, the paper aims at providing some fundamental insights into the issue of formal modelling of knowledge capital measurement. Our analysis concerns: 1) the literature of intellectual capital measurement and knowledge accounting, to understand how the current evaluation methods consider the notion of “stock” and “flow” of knowledge, and the relationships between one another; 2) the discussion of a possible model of knowledge transfer, which is intended as the mechanism that builds the connection between flows and stocks; 3) the formalization of the relationships between flows and stocks of knowledge, with the purpose to work on a suitable model that can represent the starting point for further reflections on knowledge accounting methods. Design/methodology/approach – The creation of value can be typically connected to two main activities: a) the production of value by means of operative activities over time (producing goods, selling, delivering, etc.); and b) the accumulation of value (i. e. its capitalisation in the company’s assets) in appropriate “repositories” (e. g. : goods bought; investments; financial assets, etc.). These two activities are recorded into the main accounting charts, i. e. the income statement (that measures the value produced over time) and the balance sheet (that accounts for the accumulated capital). The accounting charts of buyer and seller just record the effects of these transactions, in terms of flows of value between them, and stocks of value that change their level by means of these flows. Here, there is a clear analogy with a physical system consisting of pipelines, through which the amount of “something” (measured in some way) flows between different reservoirs. In other words, the similarity to the physical passage of a good from one deposit to another is used to account the transfer of a “valuable property” from a buyer’s <b>asset</b> to a <b>seller’s</b> <b>asset,</b> and its monetary payback. Our paper intends to explore the implications of this reasoning when it comes to knowledge. Originality/value – When trying to model a system for knowledge measurement, we should consider two elements: 1) Knowledge that is exchanged with external players; 2) Knowledge which is (or becomes) part of the internal capital. The current difficulty to measure knowledge in business is linked to the lack of understanding of the relationships between knowledge exchanged with external players (i. e. : knowledge flows) and knowledge that is or becomes part of the internal capital (i. e. : knowledge stocks). In the typical accounting models, a good solution to this problem has been found, but the traditional accounting criteria (such as reliability and relevance, Stone & Warsono, 2003) are still difficult to implement to knowledge in a consistent way. In this paper we claim that ontology-driven conceptual analysis (Guarino 1995) may provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} relations and distinctions between knowledge flows and knowledge stocks and can, by this way, provide a fresh perspective on knowledge accounting. Although the high effectiveness of ontological analysis has been widely assessed since the 90 ’s with regard to different domains and problems, only in recent years ontologists have started to focus on organization and management science (Borgo et al. 2006). Practical implications - The capitalisation of knowledge as asset requires appropriate measurement systems, which preliminarily need to be based on suitable models of the knowledge to be estimated. As the literature demonstrates, how to measure knowledge in a way that can be of use to managers, is still controversial (Bose, 2004). A first important issue is that the measurement of knowledge can imply an effort of assessing different “objects” or aspects. For this reason, distinct techniques have been developed (Grossman, 2006; Liebowitz and Suen, 2000), which however gave evidence of the lack of consensus on a unified conceptual approach. Companies are very interested in these topics, since they have constantly to face the difficult task of deciding how to leverage on knowledge resources and setting the proper plans accordingly. Although this paper is mainly focused on foundational issues, the proposed analysis of knowledge flows and knowledge stocks goes into the direction of the above-mentioned picture and has to be seen as an initial step toward the utilization of knowledge as a value to be rigorously estimated by managers, especially in the area of networked firms...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have vigorously {{enforced}} the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA prohibits bribery {{of foreign}} government officials, and the statute provides for significant {{civil and criminal}} sanctions. Settling and remediating violations can cost corporate defendants millions, with several corporate enforcement actions exceeding $ 100 million in sanctions. Moreover, enforcement actions related to the FCPA often are not brought until many years after the alleged violations. Because the massive potential liabilities associated with an FCPA violation may not manifest themselves until years after the violation occurred, prospective corporate acquirers have become acutely sensitive {{to the risk of}} “buying” an FCPA liability during a merger or an acquisition. Traditionally, an acquirer could avoid liabilities of the seller by structuring the acquisition as an asset purchase. Under the law of most U. S. jurisdictions, a court will not usually look beyond the allocation of liabilities in an asset purchase agreement, even when the acquirer purchases substantially all of the <b>assets</b> of the <b>seller.</b> Despite this general rule, even asset purchase agreements cannot contract around certain liabilities that arise from federal law. In several cases, the Supreme Court and federal appellate courts have imposed liability on good faith, arm’s-length asset purchasers through the federal common law of successor liability. In the FCPA context, there is no precedent directly on point. Influential guidance from the DOJ and SEC, however, emphasizes “successor liability” enforcement actions while failing to distinguish between companies that are “successors” by reason of a merger and “successors” by reason of an asset purchase. This silence by enforcers may lead overly conservative acquirers to abandon transactions out of an unfounded (but understandable) fear of being held liable for the violations of the seller, even when acquisitions would be socially and economically beneficial and likely could be accomplished without FCPA successor liability through an asset purchase. This Article concludes that asset purchasers typically cannot be held civilly liable for the pre-acquisition FCPA violations of sellers because the rule of decision for successor liability in FCPA cases is determined by state, not federal law, and the law of most states does not impose successor liability on arm’s-length asset purchasers. This conclusion is even stronger with respect to criminal FCPA liability because the remedial policy rationales that underlie expansive civil successor liability doctrines are not present in criminal law...|$|R

South Africa, essentially a developing country, is not like that. The legal system is strong, works off a firm human rights base, and sets out to grapple with the issues. That is how it should be, but it comes at a price – an oftengraphic exposure of the limits of the law in a stressed society. Businesses operate for profit and survival according to the unsentimental ways of the market, and employees back in a bid to save jobs, lifestyles and livelihoods. The stakeholders use power when they have it, and make claims on the law when they don’t. The legislation and the case law reflect, add to and, to a degree, shape the complexities of these contests, and no more so than in the area of business restructuring. 1 The new South Africa has quickly become the destination for foreign investment. The weakness of the rand against the dollar, pound, euro and with the “cost to sell and produce” being so low against these currencies, players on the corporate stage constantly change their make-up and composition. The larger engulfs the smaller, one company buys shares in another, or buys it out entirely, or all or part of its assets, and others are liquidated. In all these situations, employees in South Africa may find themselves with new bosses on the morning after. Under common law employees in this situation were deemed to have been discharged by the former employer, whether or not they have been offered positions in the transformed structure. If {{they did not want to}} work under it, they could not be forced to do so. That was because an employment contract was deemed in law to be one of a personal nature that could not be transferred from one employer to another without the employees consent. This research is conducted at an interesting time, when the amendments to the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 in respect of the transfer of a business, and in particular section 197, dealing with such matters comes into effect. It is also interesting in the sense that most judgements of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and judgements of the Labour Court were moving more or less to a common approach or interpretation of section 197 of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 (hereinafter “the LRA”). Section 197 of the LRA sought to regulate the transfer of a business as a going concern and altered the common law regarding the transfer of a business in two situations – firstly when there is no insolvency, factual or legal, concerned, and secondly in the instance where the transferor is insolvent. The first extreme was when an employer is declared insolvent and the contracts of employment terminated automatically. The second extreme was from the first whereby the employer has to terminate the services of his employees and be liable to pay severance pay in terms of section 1893 of the LRA, which has also been amended along with section 197 of the LRA. It is as if this section was introduced to remedy these extremes. These extremes will be dealt with in detail in this paper. The transfer of goodwill and <b>assets</b> from the <b>seller</b> to the buyer occurs when a business is sold as a going concern. At common law the employees of a business cannot be transferred in the same manner. The Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 altered this position. By enacting this section the legislature wanted to protect the interest of the employees in such transactions. Whether the legislature has succeeded or not is a matter that will be dealt with in this paper. It is all dependent on the interpretation of this section by the commissioners and judges. By including section 197 in the LRA, the legislature’s intention was to resolve the common law problem where employment contract terminated upon the sale of a business, and this section was intended to be an effective tool for protecting the employment of employees. In order to understand the labour law consequences of the transfer of a business, it is important to understand the provisions of sections 197 and 197 A of the Labour Relations Amendment Act 2002. This will be dealt with and each section will be discussed in detail using relevant case law and literature. In considering investing in a South African based company by way of purchasing a share of the company and giving it your own flavour, one has to carefully consider the effects of this transaction. Companies wishing to restructure, outsource, merge or transfer some of its operations will need to understand what the implications of the labour legislation will have on their commercial rationale. Section 197 regulates the employment consequences when a transfer of a business takes place. This is defined to mean the transfer of a business by one employer (the old employer) to another employer (the new employer) as a going concern. Business is defined to include the whole or part of the business, trade undertaking or service. Like the current provision, the new provision referrers to the transfer of a business. It is therefore a wider concept than the sale of a business. 4 No attempt is made to define what constitutes a going concern and the controversial issue of whether an outsourcing exercise can constitute a going concern transfer is also not explicitly dealt with. The fact that a business is defined to include a service may be an indication that it was intended to typify outsourcing as a going concern transfer, but this is not necessarily the case. 5 The amendments to the Act 6 came into effect on 1 August 2002. Sections 197 and 197 (A) of the Act consequently seeks to regulate the transfer of a business. These regulations will be dealt with individually and in a format that would make each of the sections in sections 197 and 197 (A), easy to understand and interpret. It will also become clear as to what the implications of each of the subsections will have on that commercial rationale. The issues highlighted above will be dealt with detail in this paper giving an overview of the Common Law, the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 and the new Labour Relations Amendment Act 2002...|$|R
