5|$|As {{the brain}} develops, {{by the fourth}} week of embryological {{development}} three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system: the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Subarachnoid spaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day. At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> first secrete CSF is not yet known.|$|E

5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a {{lipid bilayer}} can exist in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane. Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Walker Whiskey Trophy events, a number of Rush's admirers and backers held a banquet in his honour, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> {{presented}} him with an illuminated testimonial along with a sterling silver tea set, salver, and claret jug, valued at £200. These recognised his excellence as a sportsman, and his admirable qualities as a man. The salver was inscribed with a dedication, and each piece bore an inscribed caricature of Rush at the oars of an outrigger skiff. The silver items {{are now in the}} collection of the Clarence River Historical Society in Grafton, New South Wales.|$|E

The parade culminated with a reception at the Manchester Arena, for which 17,500 tickets were made available at £3 each, with proceeds going to Alex Ferguson's testimonial fund. Greater Manchester Police later estimated that the actual number of people who attended the parade was around 500,000.|$|E
5|$|The Briscoe Brothers have a {{somewhat}} checkered history with Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG).

5|$|The {{common toad}} emerges from {{hibernation}} {{in spring and}} there is a mass migration towards the breeding sites. The toads converge on certain ponds that they favour while avoiding other stretches of water that seem eminently suitable. Adults use the same location year after year and over 80% of males marked as juveniles have been found to return to the pond <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were spawned. They find their way to these mainly by using olfactory and magnetic cues. Toads experimentally moved elsewhere and fitted with tracking devices {{have been found to be}} able to locate their chosen breeding pond when the displacement exceeded three kilometres (two miles).|$|E

5|$|With the pre-War team dispersed, {{the club}} {{struggled}} to reassert its {{dominance in the}} late 1940s and eventually suffered relegation to the Second Division under Cliff Britton in the 195051 season. After finishing second in the 195354 season, the club returned to the top tier of English football, the level <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> have played ever since. In 1961, the club appointed Harry Catterick as manager who led the club to the league title again in both the 196263 and 196970 seasons, with the league successes punctuated by another FA Cup triumph, this time a 32 victory over Sheffield Wednesday at Wembley.|$|E
5|$|A {{delegation}} of landowners presented the ORD Real Estate Branch with a petition protesting {{the acquisition of}} their property on 23 November 1942, and that night over 200 landowners held a meeting <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> agreed to hire lawyers and appraisers to challenge the Federal government. Local newspapers and politicians were sympathetic to their cause. By the end of May 1943, agreements were reached covering 416 tracts totaling , but some landowners rejected the government's offers. The ORD Real Estate Branch invoked a procedure under Tennessee law that allowed for a jury of five citizens appointed by the Federal District Court to review the compensation offered. They handled five cases in which they proposed higher values {{than those of the}} ORD appraisers, but the landowners rejected them as well, so the Army discontinued the use of this method. In response to rising public criticism, O'Brien commissioned a review by the Department of Agriculture. It found that the appraisals had been fair and just, and that farmers had overestimated the size and productivity of their land.|$|E

5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In order to try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} a weekend getaway, {{surgeons}} Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) {{are involved in a}} vehicular collision, moments after Robbins proposes marriage. Torres suffers severe injuries, which endanger both her life and the life of her unborn child. She and Robbins are taken to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, the institute <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> both work. Their colleagues attempt to save Torres, while Robbins and Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the father of Torres's baby, stand by. Torres's many injuries include neurological trauma. While barely conscious, she hallucinates an uninjured version of herself standing beside her. The hallucinatory Torres begins to sing, and is gradually joined by the doctors treating her. This singing continues throughout the episode, as Torres's projection of herself attempts to reach out to Robbins.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September, {{with his}} men dying of {{starvation}} and disease {{at the rate}} of more than 100 a day, Vaubois called a council of his officers <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> unanimously decided to surrender. The next day, envoys were sent to the British and in the afternoon General Pigot and Captain Martin signed the agreed terms with Vaubois and Villeneuve. The Maltese were excluded from negotiations entirely, although their commander, Alexander Ball, subsequently became the first Civil Commissioner of Malta. The terms of the surrender were absolute: the island, its dependencies, fortifications and military supplies were all turned over to British control. This included the ships of the line Athenien and Dégo and the frigate Carthagénaise (these were all French ships previously captured from the Order), although only Athenien was of sufficient standard to be incorporated into the Royal Navy, becoming HMS Athenienne. The other ships were broken up in their berths. The British also took two merchant ships and a variety of smaller warships.|$|E

50|$|King {{angelfish}} are monogamous {{within their}} pairs and, during their spawning cycle, will mate daily around sunset. During a spawning cycle a pair can produce upwards of ten million fertilized eggs, averaging about 25-75,000 daily. These eggs then drift {{in the water}} column for about 20 hours, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> point <b>they</b> hatch. After hatching, the fin-less fry live off their yolk sack until it is completely absorbed, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> point <b>they</b> begin to eat small zooplankton.|$|R
5|$|Raynolds {{spent two}} months {{recovering}} from illness after the Valley Campaign, then was assigned as chief engineer of Middle Department and VIII Corps in January 1863. Promoted {{to major in}} the Corps of Engineers, {{he found himself in}} charge of the defenses of vital Harpers Ferry, West Virginia in March 1863 during Robert E. Lee's second Confederate invasion of the north during the Gettysburg Campaign. On March 31, 1863, the Corps of Topographical Engineers ceased to be an independent branch of the army and was merged into the Corps of Engineers and Raynolds served in that branch of the army for the remainder of his career. Officers from the two corps maintained their ranks based on the time <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> received their promotion.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} as fat as possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E
5|$|The flaw in Dalton's {{theory was}} {{corrected}} in principle in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain {{equal numbers of}} molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles {{does not affect the}} volume that it occupies). Avogadro's law allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms.|$|E
