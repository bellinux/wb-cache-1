5|$|In 1982, Sid Sheinberg, the {{president}} of MCA and Universal City Studios and <b>a</b> <b>seasoned</b> attorney, {{was trying to find}} a way to get his company into the booming video game market. In April, he learned of the success of Nintendo's Donkey Kong video game and sent Robert Hadl, vice president of legislative matters, to investigate. Hadl's analysis was that Donkey Kongs storyline was based on that of King Kong and was thus an infringement of Universal's rights to that film's characters and scenario.|$|E
5|$|Months later, the Washington State Department of Health's Office of Counselor Programs {{administratively}} charged Ahn {{with professional}} misconduct.

Concerned {{he would not be}} able to adequately represent himself pro se against <b>a</b> <b>seasoned</b> state attorney, he entered an Alford plea and agreed to a ten-year revocation of his counselor registration.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1850, Honório Hermeto {{was back}} in Rio de Janeiro. He had found the months in Pernambuco excruciating. Being named provincial {{president}} {{would have been considered}} a great achievement for a young politician, but it added no luster to the reputation of <b>a</b> <b>seasoned</b> politician and a founding member of his party. Instead of being at the center of power, he was put in the humiliating position of having to submit to a cabinet composed of men with less political experience, such as Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Paulino Soares de Sousa (Honório Hermeto's colleague along with Rodrigues Torres in Coimbra) and Eusébio de Queirós. It was particularly grating being subordinated to Paulino Soares and Eusébio de Queirós, protégés whom Honório Hermeto had advanced during the 1830s. While in Pernambuco, Honório Hermeto's actions were frequently reviewed and overturned by the cabinet, often with Eusébio de Queirós leading the criticism.|$|E

Forty-six of sixty-two lettermen returned (74percent), which included ten offensive and six defensive starters. The 2008 team contained 31 seniors, which was the largest group since Friedgen became head coach in 2001. Important returnees on the defensive unit included cornerback Kevin Barnes, who recorded four interceptions in 2007; defensive end Jeremy Navarre, who had recorded 5.5 sacks; and linebacker Dave Philistin, who had recorded 124 tackles. The offense's returning statistical leaders included quarterback Chris Turner, who threw for 1,958passing yards in 2007; wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, who had 786receiving yards; and running back Da'Rel Scott, who had 135rushing yards.|$|E
5|$|Hall had {{no special}} {{academic}} background or sailing experience (he was a blacksmith, engraver, then {{owner of a}} Cincinnati newspaper), {{but he was a}} voracious reader with an obsession for the Arctic. After John Franklin's 1845 expedition was lost, Hall's focus was directed toward the Arctic. He was able to launch two expeditions in search of Franklin and his crew; one in 1860–63, and a second in 1864–69. These experiences established him as <b>a</b> <b>seasoned</b> Arctic explorer, and gave him valuable contacts among the Inuit people. The renown he gained eventually allowed him to convince the United States government to fund his third expedition, an attempt on the North Pole.|$|E
5|$|In April , Sid Sheinberg, <b>a</b> <b>seasoned</b> {{lawyer and}} {{president}} of MCA and Universal City Studios, learned of the game's success and suspected {{it might be a}} trademark infringement of Universal's own King Kong. On April 27, 1982, he met with Arnold Greenberg of Coleco and threatened to sue over Coleco's home version of Donkey Kong. Coleco agreed on May 3, 1982 to pay royalties to Universal of 3% of their Donkey Kongs net sale price, worth about $4.6 million. Meanwhile, Sheinberg revoked Tiger's license to make its King Kong game, but O. R. Rissman refused to acknowledge Universal's claim to the trademark. When Universal threatened Nintendo, Howard Lincoln and Nintendo refused to cave. In preparation for the court battle ahead, Universal agreed to allow Tiger to continue producing its King Kong game as long as they distinguished it from Donkey Kong.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was rarely}} in London, EdwardI {{undertook}} an expensive remodelling of the Tower, costing £21,000 between 1275 and 1285, over double that {{spent on the}} castle during the whole of HenryIII's reign. EdwardI was <b>a</b> <b>seasoned</b> castle builder, and used his experience of siege warfare during the crusades to bring innovations to castle building. His programme of castle building in Wales heralded {{the introduction of the}} widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences. At the Tower of London, Edward filled in the moat dug by HenryIII and built a new curtain wall along its line, creating a new enclosure. A new moat was created in front of the new curtain wall. The western part of HenryIII's curtain wall was rebuilt, with Beauchamp Tower replacing the castle's old gatehouse. A new entrance was created, with elaborate defences including two gatehouses and a barbican. In an effort to make the castle self-sufficient, EdwardI also added two watermills. Six hundred Jews were imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1278, charged with coin clipping. Persecution of the country's Jewish population under Edward began in 1276 and culminated in 1290 when he issued the Edict of Expulsion, forcing the Jews out of the country.|$|E
5|$|During {{the primary}} campaign, Chandler focused his {{attacks on the}} Combs {{administration}} rather than the inexperienced Breathitt. <b>A</b> <b>seasoned</b> campaigner, he bitterly attacked the three percent sales tax enacted during the Combs administration. Breathitt struck back with accusations that, as a senator, Chandler had {{voted in favor of}} declaring war on Japan during World War II, but resigned his army commission shortly thereafter. He further charged that Chandler's son-in-law was collecting campaign donations from individuals who desired favors from state government. The younger Breathitt, thirty-eight years old when the campaign began, adapted well to the relatively new medium of television, while the aging Chandler did not. Breathitt won the primary by more than 60,000 votes and carried {{all but one of the}} state's congressional districts. Chandler's running mate, Harry Lee Waterfield, easily won the nomination for lieutenant governor over Breathitt's running mate, John B. Breckinridge, showing that the defeat was not so much a result of factionalism as a personal rebuff of Chandler. This campaign ended Chandler's political career.|$|E

The couple maintained a permanent home in Vienna throughout World War II. Initially assigned to 89th SS-Standarte, Göth {{was transferred to the}} 1st SS-Sturmbann of the 11th SS-Standarte {{at the start of the}} war and was promoted to SS-Oberscharführer (staff sergeant) in early 1941. He soon gained a reputation as <b>a</b> <b>seasoned</b> administrator in the Nazi efforts to isolate and relocate the Jewish population of Europe as an Einsatzführer (action leader) and financial officer for the Reichskommissariat für die Festigung deutschen Volkstums (Reichskommissariat for the Strengthening of German Nationhood; RKFDV).

5|$|When Leno {{was four}} years old, his {{alcoholic}} father died, aged 37. The family moved to Liverpool a few months later, where his mother married William Grant (1837–1896), on 7 March 1866. Grant was a comedian of Lancastrian and Irish descent, who performed in music halls throughout the British provinces under the stage name of William Leno. He was <b>a</b> <b>seasoned</b> actor and had previously been employed by Charles Kean in his theatre company at the Princess's Theatre in London. In 1866, the family home in Marylebone was demolished {{to make way for}} St Pancras railway station and, as a result, Leno's sister Frances was sent to live with an uncle, while his brother John, who performed occasionally with his parents, took full-time employment. Leno, his mother, stepfather and brother Henry moved north and settled in Liverpool, where they performed in various halls and theatres, including the Star Music Hall, but they often returned to London to perform in the capital's music halls.|$|E
