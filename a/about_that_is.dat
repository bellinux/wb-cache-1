500|$|Universal Music Group took extreme {{measures}} {{to prevent the}} album from leaking, offering pre-release listening sessions for critics instead of sending out review copies. However, Universal Music Australia's online music store, getmusic.com.au, accidentally released the album for digital sale on 18February 2009, almost {{two weeks before the}} scheduled release date. The complete album appeared on the website for a short time before it was removed, and the accidental sale led to the album's being leaked and shared across the Internet. U2 reacted to the leak with some positivity. The Edge stated, [...] "The one good thing <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a lot of our fans have already given us their thumbs up.

500|$|Gallagher {{has spoken}} about his {{political}} views on several occasions, most notably {{when he visited}} Tony Blair at No. 10 Downing Street in 1997. In an interview in 1997 {{when he was asked}} about why he visited Blair he replied, [...] "I've taken a lot of flack for going to No. 10 Downing Street but the thing <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> I never considered myself a rebel anyway. I wasn't going there representing the 'Indie community'. I wasn't representing anyone. I was going there for me. You have to understand that from when I went to school and from when I was born all we ever knew was conservative, Tory, right-wing government. What people don't mention is, they say 'He went to meet Tony Blair.' No. I went to meet the Labour prime minister. Our parents always drummed into us that the Labour Party was for the people and the Tory Party was not. I went to meet the Labour prime minister." ...|$|E

Though the executive producers never thought {{that they would be}} able to get Smith for the series, they developed and wrote Masters with the actor in mind. The character was intended to be killed off at the end of the season, and a version of that was filmed, but the writers ultimately decided to leave Masters' fate [...] "ambiguous" [...] as they enjoyed working with Smith, with Fazekas saying, [...] "The nice thing <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> we could go both ways on it. Maybe we never see him again or maybe we see him again and by the way he's full of Zero Matter now. The last thing you saw was Whitney Zero Mattering him and then getting interrupted.

Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and more of this kid. What's awesome <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> think about {{what it would be like}} to grow up in this world. It's one thing to have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in.

It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E

And all the parts of A.I. that people accuse me of {{sweetening}} and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film– all the stuff in the house– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." [...] "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've {{done a lot of}} movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of A.I., not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else.

2500|$|As author James Perone explains, Wilson's {{compositions}} include tempo changes, metrical ambiguity, {{and unusual}} tone colors that, culturally speaking, separates the album from any pop {{music of the}} era. It also adds to [...] "the background tenderness and melancholy—as well as the increased maturity—that ebb and flow throughout Pet Sounds." [...] He specifically touches upon the album's closer [...] "Caroline, No" [...] and its use of wide tessitura changes, wide melodic intervals, and instrumentation which contribute to his belief; also Wilson's compositions and orchestral arrangements which experiment with form and tone colors. Referring to [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice", Perone recalls that the track sounds [...] "significantly less like a rock band supplemented with auxiliary instrumentation... than a rock band integrated into {{an eclectic mix of}} studio instrumentation." [...] Arranger Paul Mertens believes that although there are string sections on Pet Sounds: [...] "...what's special <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not that Brian was trying to introduce classical music into rock & roll.

2500|$|Wilson avoided {{standard}} rock percussion {{because he}} wanted his productions to sound more [...] "delicate" [...] and less [...] "boomy". Van Dyke Parks said: [...] "The first thing I can remember in the studio was how Brian used tuneful percussion, like a piano or a Chinese gong. Even a triangle has pitch. Brian was very fond of pitched instruments. They {{reminded me of the}} orchestrations of the early 20th century done by people like Percy Grainger, the man who wrote 'Country Gardens', who was infatuated with tuneful percussion. He stood out in my youth as a great composer because of what he did with sound, and Brian was doing that." [...] Arranger Paul Mertens believes: [...] "There are string sections on Pet Sounds. But to me, what's special <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not that Brian was trying to introduce classical music into rock & roll. Rather, {{he was trying to get}} classical musicians to play like rock musicians. He's using these things to make music in the way that he understood, rather than trying to appropriate the orchestra. Often he'll direct a drummer to play in a very unconventional way, in a way that drummers don't normally play. He'll say, 'No, no, don't play the hi-hat, just go bomp...ba-domp...bomp...ba-domp on the tom and kick drum.' He's feeling a certain thing, but coming at it from a musical idea rather than the conventions of the instrument." [...] One of Wilson's favorite techniques was to apply reverb exclusively to a timpani, as can be heard in [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice", [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and [...] "Don't Talk".|$|E
2500|$|Many {{artists have}} cited Fripp as an {{influence}} or have expressed their admiration for him, including Steven Wilson, Omar Rodríguez-López,Omar Rodríguez-López: Selvfølgelig ikke! Jeg gjør faktisk ingen forsøk på å skjule min affekt for Fripps arbeider. [...] ble jeg introdusert for King Crimson, og på nytt kollapset alt, men på en konstruktiv måte. [...] Fripp tryllet i alle fall fram de vakreste toner jeg hadde hørt, og han kunne ikke ha gitt seg til kjenne på et mer gunstig tidspunkt i mitt liv. [...] Ingen kan nekte for at Robert Fripp, også helt tidlig i karrieren, var opptatt av jazz eller de blå notene. Durskalaer og oppstemte gjengroprefrenger har aldri appellert til meg, så da King Crimson ble meg til del var det som å smake på en bit av himmelriket. (Q: You can't deny that you're influenced by Robert Fripp and King Crimson, right?Omar Rodríguez-López: No, of course not! I make {{no attempt to}} hide my affection for Fripps work. [...] I was introduced to King Crimson and again everything collapsed, but in a constructive way. [...] Fripp made the most beautiful notes that I had heard, and he couldn't have been introduced to me at a better time in my life. [...] As soon as someone discovers jazz, it will influence their approach irrespective of which style or band the person concerned contributes to. It can't be denied that Robert Fripp was into jazz throughout his career or the blue notes. The major-scales and euphoric stadium-rock choruses have never appealed to me so when I got familiar with King Crimson's music it was like getting a taste of heaven.) }} Trey Anastasio of Phish, St. Vincent, Kirk Hammett of Metallica,Kirk Hammett: There are fewer 30-part orchestrated guitar sections, fewer massive, bludgeoning riffs perfectly replicated by lames. There are more flexible ideas, more artistic flourishes, more colors. I've probably been influenced in that direction by people like Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew and David Torn. I'm more interested in using guitar sounds as textures and using effects in a more textural fashion. To paraphrase Robert Fripp, I'm more interested in painting a soundscape like he and Adrian Belew do in King Crimson, on Bowie records and in Fripp's solo stuff.
