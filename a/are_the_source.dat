5|$|The National Diet is the legislature, {{the organ}} of the Legislative branch. It is bicameral, {{consisting}} of two houses with the House of Councillors being the upper house, and the House of Representatives being the lower house.

The Supreme Court and other inferior courts make up the Judicial branch, and they are independent from the executive and the legislative branches.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees as if they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.|$|E

5|$|Henrietta Lacks (born Loretta Pleasant; August 1, 1920 – October 4, 1951) was an African American {{woman whose}} cancer cells <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of the HeLa cell line, the first immortalized cell line {{and one of}} the most {{important}} cell lines in medical research. An immortalized cell line will reproduce indefinitely under specific conditions, and the HeLa cell line continues to be a source of invaluable medical data to the present day. As was then the practice, no consent was obtained to culture her cells, nor were she or her family compensated for their extraction or use.|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E
5|$|Mould fungi <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of the meaty (umami) flavour of the soybean {{products}} tempeh, miso and soy sauce. Tempeh {{has been}} produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, {{it is made}} into protein-rich blocks, but these have a firm texture and earthy flavour, since (unlike tofu) the whole beans are retained, providing a higher content of dietary fibre and vitamins. Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and cereals, forming a soft paste used to flavour soups and other Japanese dishes. Soy sauce {{has been used in}} China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and cereals with moulds such as Aspergillus oryzae.|$|E

Products derived from plants include soaps, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, turpentine, rubber, latex, lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, and gums. Renewable fuels from plants include firewood, peat and other biofuels. The fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including phytoplankton in geological time.|$|E
5|$|The 1991 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} season in over 24years in which no hurricanes developed from tropical waves, which <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> for most North Atlantic tropical cyclones. The {{hurricane season}} officially began on June1, and ended on November30. It was the least active in four years due to higher than usual wind shear across the Atlantic Ocean. The first storm, Ana, developed on July2 off the southeast United States and dissipated without causing significant effects. Two other tropical storms in the season– Danny and Erika– did not significantly affect land. Danny dissipated east of the Lesser Antilles, and Erika passed through the Azores before becoming extratropical. In addition, there were four non-developing tropical depressions. The second depression of the season struck Mexico with significant accompanying rains.|$|E
5|$|All {{seventeen}} of the confirmed {{heads in}} the Olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of the stone for the monuments. These boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes, {{which suggests that the}} Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads. Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head. The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head1 and Nestepe Colossal Head1 (also known as Tres Zapotes MonumentsA andQ) came from the same hill.|$|E

5|$|Magical healing spells, {{which were}} used by Egyptians of all classes, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> for an {{important}} portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The spells identify a sick person with Horus so {{that he or she}} can benefit from the goddess's efforts. The spells are known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions for healing rituals, and from a specialized type of inscribed stone stela called a cippus. People seeking healing poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to imbue the water with the healing power contained in the text, and then drank the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed healing spells that specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{provide the}} greater part of the food for people and their {{domestic}} animals: much of human culture and civilisation came into being through agriculture. While a large number of plants have been used for food, a small number of staple crops including wheat, rice, and maize provide most of the food in the world today. In turn, animals provide much of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of the}} power used for work and transport. A variety of living things serve as models in biological research, such as in genetics, and in drug testing. Until the 19th century, plants yielded most of the medicinal drugs in common use, as described in the 1st century by Dioscorides. Plants <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of many psychoactive drugs, some such as coca known to have been used for thousands of years. Yeast, a fungus, has been used to ferment cereals such as wheat and barley to make bread and beer; other fungi such as Psilocybe and fly agaric mushrooms have been gathered as psychoactive drugs.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the United Kingdom's position, {{judicial}} review in Singapore {{is confined to}} matters of public law, and the applicable tests <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> test and nature test. The Datafin decision was applied by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Public Service Commission v. Lai Swee Lin Linda (2001), where the respondent, an employee with the Land Office, had the probationary period of her employment extended without prior warning. Her employment contract was later terminated. She complained to various statutory bodies, and ultimately to the Public Service Commission ("PSC"), but was unsuccessful in having her employment reinstated. She then sought leave from the High Court to apply for {{judicial review}} against the PSC. In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal accepted that the source test {{is one of the}} tests that can be relied on to determine whether a decision by a body is amenable to judicial review. In addition, it noted that Datafin had held that the source test is not the only applicable test. However, the Court did not embark on a discussion of the nature test because it found that when the respondent's employer had made the decisions concerning her employment, it had acted pursuant to her contractual terms of service and had not exercised its statutory powers. Thus, the decisions were not susceptible to judicial review. It did not invariably follow that when a statutory body makes a decision it is exercising a statutory power.|$|E

5|$|Trees <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> {{of many of}} the world's {{best known}} fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E
