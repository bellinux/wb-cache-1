5|$|Alecto– The former Queen of the Furies, who {{aligned with}} Ares and bore their son Orkos. The {{leader of the}} sisters, she {{captured}} Kratos. Alecto tried deceiving Kratos into staying in imprisonment by becoming <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> of his wife, Lysandra, but Kratos saw through the lie. Despite morphing into a giant sea monster, she was ultimately killed by Kratos. The character was voiced by Jennifer Hale.|$|E
40|$|<b>A</b> new motion <b>illusion</b> is {{discussed}} {{in relation to the}} idea of vision as <b>a</b> Grand <b>Illusion.</b> An experiment shows that this 2 ̆ 7 Tinkerbell effect 2 ̆ 7 {{is a good example of}} <b>a</b> visual <b>illusion</b> supported by low-level stimulus information, but resulting from integration principles probably necessary for normal perception...|$|R
5000|$|The Aztec Lady is <b>a</b> stage <b>illusion</b> {{designed}} by British magician Robert Harbin. It {{is a classic}} [...] "big box" [...] <b>illusion</b> that involves <b>an</b> assistant in a cabinet and is probably best categorised as <b>a</b> restoration-type <b>illusion.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> Cognitive <b>illusion</b> is {{the mental}} {{analogue}} of <b>an</b> optical <b>illusion.</b> In <b>an</b> optical <b>illusion</b> we see something as other {{than it is}} and, even knowing {{this to be the}} case, continue to experience the <b>illusion.</b> In <b>a</b> cognitive <b>illusion</b> our mind presents us with an assumption, thought, or conclusion that appears to be correct even though we may know that it is untrustworthy or false. The source of these illusions is found in the very way that our mind processes information and forms judgments. It turns out that they are nothing other than misapplications, or biased applications, of certain heuristics that are used for making any form of judgment. In other words, the possibility of cognitive illusions is built into the structure of mind...|$|R
5|$|Kempelen was {{inspired}} to build the Turk following his attendance at the court of Maria Theresa of Austria at Schönbrunn Palace, where François Pelletier was performing <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> act.

5|$|Madhvacharya was {{critical}} of the teachings of Adi Shankara and argued the world is real and not <b>an</b> <b>illusion.</b> His Dvaita Vedanta gained popularity, enabling him to establish eight mathas in Udupi. Ramanuja, head of the Vaishnava monastery in Srirangam, preached the way of devotion (bhakti marga) and wrote Sribhashya, a critique on Adi Shankara's Advaita.|$|E
5|$|Sri Aurobindo {{argues that}} divine Brahman manifests as {{empirical}} reality through līlā, or divine play. Instead of positing {{that the world}} we experience is <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> (māyā), Aurobindo argues that world can evolve and become a new world with new species, far above the human species just as human species have evolved after the animal species.|$|E

The character was voiced by Debi Mae West.|$|E
5|$|At the episode's conclusion, Jenner {{purposely}} {{calls for}} the self-destruction of the building, which ultimately explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which hovered over pyrotechnics. The plate was turned upside down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. This created <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture glass of the building, while the last frame concluded {{with the collapse of}} the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{became friends}} with C. W. Post, who was a patient at the sanitarium, but Post was healed by a Christian Science faith healer, Mrs Elizabeth K. Gregory. In 1892, Post started La Vita Inn, a sanitarium {{of his own and}} brought Beilhart on as an associate. The two men took {{instruction}} in Christian Science. Both Post and Beilhart rejected the doctrine of the religion but they embraced the view that illness was <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> and could be overcome by mental suggestion, prayer, and self-sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Children of Men used several lengthy single-shot {{sequences}} {{in which}} extremely complex actions take place. The longest {{of these are}} a shot in which Kee gives birth (199 seconds; 3:19); an ambush on a country road (247 seconds; 4:07); and {{a scene in which}} Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and runs down a street and through a building {{in the middle of a}} raging battle (378 seconds; 6:18). These sequences were extremely difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes <b>an</b> <b>illusion,</b> aided by CGI effects.|$|E
5|$|Christian Science {{is a set}} {{of beliefs}} and {{practices}} belonging to the metaphysical family of new religious movements. It was developed in 19th-century New England by Mary Baker Eddy, who argued in her book Science and Health (1875) that sickness is <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> that can be corrected by prayer alone. The book became Christian Science's central text, along with the Bible, and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies.|$|E
5|$|In early 2003, Angel {{performed}} at {{the release of the}} new branding for Miller Lite beer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on the 80th anniversary of Houdini's last performance in that city. For the performance, he was suspended ten stories in the air and bound in a straitjacket, from which he escaped. He also performed <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> at Ozzfest in 2005. During this period Angel also earned money selling signed merchandise, making up to $50,000 a day.|$|E

5|$|Long ago, King Childeric I came to {{the forest}} to build a city while the Queen experimented with black magic to gain eternal life. A plague swept through the land, and she hid in her tower, while her husband and {{everyone}} below her perished. Her spell granted her immortal life, but not the youth and beauty {{to go along with}} it. Her youthful appearance now only exists in her mirror, the source of her life, as <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|Lysandra– Kratos' wife. Although she was {{responsible}} in granting Kratos {{his quest for}} the Ambrosia to save Calliope, she was killed with her daughter. After being spiritually reunited with both Lysandra and Calliope in his psyche, Lysandra aided Kratos in forgiving himself for his crime. The character was voiced by Gwendoline Yeo in God of War and God of War III, and Jennifer Hale in Ascension as <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> created by Alecto.|$|E
5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E

5|$|Microbial mats {{are areas}} of {{sediment}} stabilised {{by the presence}} of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. They appear to migrate upwards when covered by a thin layer of sediment but this is <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. If too thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it, parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and tubercular texture.|$|E
5|$|The Robillon wing {{contains}} an {{entrance to the}} palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> of a longer and higher perspective, centred on a corner of a terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight {{so as not to}} lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (see key 11). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone (see illustration).|$|E
5|$|The fourth movement, in sonata form {{but with}} {{characteristics}} of a rondo, is replete with Haydnesque false recapitulations and conclusions. In one example, the music lands in the tonic {{at the end of}} the recapitulation and apparent coda, and is followed by two measures of complete silence, creating <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> of finality. However, the main theme is then reprised, and the real conclusion to the work follows some 20 measures later.|$|E
