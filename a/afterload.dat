25|$|In crude terms, this {{measurement}} compares {{left and}} right cardiac activity and calculates preload and <b>afterload</b> flow and pressures which, theoretically, can be stabilized or adjusted with drugs to either constrict or dilate the vessels (to raise or lower, respectively, the pressure of blood flowing to the lungs), {{in order to maximize}} oxygen for delivery to the body tissues.|$|E
25|$|Losartan is a selective, {{competitive}} angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonist, {{reducing the}} end organ responses to angiotensin II. Losartan administration {{results in a}} decrease in total peripheral resistance (<b>afterload)</b> and cardiac venous return (preload). All of the physiological effects of angiotensin II, including release of aldosterone, are antagonized {{in the presence of}} losartan. Reduction in blood pressure occurs independently of the status of the renin-angiotensin system. As a result of losartan dosing, plasma renin activity increases due to removal of the angiotensin II feedback.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{contraindicated}} or not tolerated, ACE inhibitor (ACE) {{therapy is}} recommended for all patients with systolic heart failure, irrespective of symptomatic severity or blood pressure.

Angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy (also referred to as AT1-antagonists or angiotensin receptor blockers), particularly using candesartan, is an acceptable alternative if the patient is unable to tolerate ACEI therapy. ACEIs and ARBs decrease <b>afterload</b> by antagonizing the vasopressor effect of angiotensin, thereby decreasing {{the amount of work}} the heart must perform. It is also believed that angiotensin directly affects cardiac remodeling, and blocking its activity can thereby slow the deterioration of cardiac function.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>afterloading</b> brachytherapy following radical neck dissection (RND) {{in the management of}} extensive cervical lymph node disease in nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy; and to examine prospectively prognostic factors and the pathologic behavior of neck disease. Patients: Twenty-seven patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who had extensive cervical lymph node metastasis following external radiotherapy were treated with RND. Thirteen of them also underwent <b>afterloading</b> brachytherapy with iridium wire (Ir 192). The RND specimens of the 27 patients were also examined with step serial whole-specimen sectioning. Results: All patients survived and their wounds healed primarily. Pathologic examination revealed 183 tumorbearing lymph nodes that contained tumors in the neck: level I, 4 % (8 / 183); level II, 53 % (96 / 183); level III, 34 % (62 / 183); level IV, 5 % (9 / 183); and level V, 4 % (8 / 183). Extracapsular tumor extension was seen in 84 % of patients. Multivariate analysis identified the number of tumor-bearing lymph nodes detected in the specimens to be the only significant factor that affected control of disease. Although the neck disease in the group of patients who had <b>afterloading</b> brachytherapy was more extensive, the 3 -year actuarial tumor control for the groups with and without brachytherapy were 60 % and 61 %, respectively. Conclusions: Recurrent cervical lymph nodes after radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma are extensive and RND is mandatory for a successful salvage. When the nodal metastasis infiltrate or adhere to surrounding tissue, <b>afterloading</b> brachytherapy with iridium wire can provide satisfactory local tumor control. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|This {{vasodilation}} {{does not}} decrease {{the volume of}} blood the heart pumps, but rather it decreases the force the heart muscle must exert to pump the same volume of blood. Nitroglycerin pills, taken sublingually (under the tongue), are used to prevent or treat acute chest pain. The nitroglycerin reacts with a sulfhydryl group (–SH) to produce nitric oxide, which eases the pain by causing vasodilation. There is a potential role {{for the use of}} nitric oxide in alleviating bladder contractile dysfunctions, and recent evidence suggests that nitrates may be beneficial for treatment of angina due to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption both by decreasing preload and <b>afterload</b> and by some direct vasodilation of coronary vessels.|$|E
25|$|Medical therapy {{of chronic}} aortic {{insufficiency}} that is stable and asymptomatic {{involves the use}} of vasodilators. Trials have shown a short term benefit in the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, nifedipine, and hydralazine in improving left ventricular wall stress, ejection fraction, and mass. The goal in using these pharmacologic agents is to decrease the <b>afterload</b> so that the left ventricle is somewhat spared. The regurgitant fraction may not change significantly, since the gradient between the aortic and left ventricular pressures is usually fairly low at the initiation of treatment. Other rather conservative medical treatments for stable and asymptomatic cases include low sodium diet, diuretics, digoxin, calcium blockers and avoiding very strenuous activity.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac arrhythmias are {{a common}} {{characteristic}} of the human diving response. As part of the diving reflex, increased activity of the cardiac parasympathetic nervous system not only regulates the bradycardia, but also is associated with ectopic beats which are characteristic of human heart function during breath-hold dives. Arrhythmias may be accentuated by neural responses to face immersion in cold water, distension of the heart due to central blood shift, and the increasing resistance to left ventricular ejection (<b>afterload)</b> by rising blood pressure. Arrhythmias commonly measured in the electrocardiogram during human breath-hold dives include ST depression, heightened T wave, and a positive U wave following the QRS complex, measurements associated with reduced left ventricular contractility and overall depressed cardiac function during a dive.|$|E
40|$|Many {{investigations}} of ventricular energetics have used isolated papillary muscles {{as a model}} of ventricular muscle. These muscles have myocytes arranged in parallel along their length, can be readily dissected and can have ties or clips attached to either end, allowing them to be attached to apparatus for measuring mechanical properties. The most common protocols used in vitro have involved either isometric or <b>afterloaded</b> isotonic contractions, with muscle length set to that giving maximum active force output. As a model of ventricular function, isometric contraction protocols are less than ideal since, unlike the contracting ventricle, no mechanical work is performed during contraction. However, even <b>afterloaded</b> isotonic contractions produce no net work because the muscle shortens and lengthens against a constant force (Gibbs et al., 1967). Consequently, the amount of work done on the muscle to lengthen it is the same as that done by the muscle during shortening. Another criticism of the <b>afterloaded</b> isotonic protocol is that the combination of force and length changes is unrealistic.

40|$|The multielectrode {{current source}} (MECS) {{interstitial}} hyperthermia (IHT) system uses thermocouple thermometry. To obtain a homogeneous temperature distribution and {{to limit the}} number of traumas due to the implanted catheters, most catheters are used for both heating and thermometry. Implications of temperature measurement inside applicators are discussed. In particular, the impact of self-heating of both the applicator and the <b>afterloading</b> catheter were investigated. A one-dimensional cylindrical model was used to compute the difference between the temperature rise inside the applicators (deltaTin) and in the tissue just outside the <b>afterloading</b> catheter (deltaTout) as a function of power absorption in the <b>afterloading</b> catheter, self-heating of the applicator and the effective thermal conductivity of the surrounding tissue. Furthermore, the relative artefact (ERR), i. e. (deltaTin - deltaTout) /deltaTin, was measured in a muscle equivalent agar phantom at different positions in a dual-electrode applicator and for different catheter materials. A method to estimate the tissue temperature by power-off temperature decay measurement inside the applicator was investigated. Using clinical dual-electrode applicators in standard brachytherapy catheters in a muscle-equivalent phantom, deltaTin is typically twice as high as deltaTout. The main reason for this difference is self-heating of the thin feeder wires in the centre of the applicator. The measurement error caused by energy absorption in the <b>afterloading</b> catheter is small, i. e. even for materials with a high dielectric loss factor it is less than 5 %. About 5 s after power has been switched off, Tin in the electrodes represents the maximum tissue temperature just before power-off. This delay time (t(delay)) and ERR are independent of Tin. However, they do depend on the thermal properties of the tissue. Therefore, ERR and t(delay) and their stability in perfused tissues have to be investigated to enable a reliable estimation of the tissue temperatures around electrodes in clinical practic...|$|R
25|$|While diastolic blood {{pressure}} is diminished and the pulse pressure widens, systolic {{blood pressure}} generally remains normal or can even be slightly elevated, this is because sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis of the kidneys compensate for the decreased cardiac output. Catecholamines will increase the heart rate and increase the strength of ventricular contraction, directly increasing cardiac output. Catecholamines will also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, which causes increased systemic vascular resistance and ensures that organs are adequately perfused. Renin, a proteolytic enzyme, cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II. In the case of chronic aortic insufficiency with resultant cardiac remodeling, heart failure will develop, {{and it is possible}} to see systolic pressures diminish. Aortic insufficiency causes both volume overload (elevated preload) and pressure overload (elevated <b>afterload)</b> of the heart.|$|E

2500|$|Since blood {{pressure}} is in intimate feedback with cardiac output and peripheral resistance, with relatively low {{blood pressure}}, the <b>afterload</b> on the heart decreases; this decreases how hard the heart must work to eject blood into the aorta, so the amount of oxygen required by the heart decreases accordingly.

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether esmolol, an ultrashort-acting beta-adrenergic antagonist, possesses cardioprotective properties unrelated to a concomitant decrease in heart rate. Background. Previous studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with unchanged heart rates. Methods. The effect of esmolol (100 μg/kg per min) on the response of global cardiovascular and regional myocardial contractile function (sonomicrometry) to pacing-induced tachycardia and acute left ventricular <b>afterloading</b> was assessed in dogs with a critical stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). These responses were observed at the baseline hemoglobin level (12. 5 ± 0. 3 g/ 100 ml) as well as after hemodilution-induced mild regional contractile dysfunction (7. 4 ± 0. 4 g/ 100 ml) in the area supplied by this artery (LAD area). Data were analyzed by using a repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance with complete block design treating pacing rate and <b>afterloading,</b> respectively, as the repeated measure. Results. Esmolol decreased the maximal first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dtmax); global cardiovascular and regional myocardial contractile function were otherwise unchanged. Esmolol did not alter the response of global cardiovascular or regional myocardial function to pacing-induced tachycardia or to acute left ventricular <b>afterloading,</b> both at the baseline hemoglobin level as well as during mild hemodilution-induced LAD area contractile dysfunction.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the potential effects of tumor hypoxia induced by <b>afterloading</b> catheter implantation {{on the effectiveness}} of brachytherapy in a rat tumor model. Methods and Materials: <b>Afterloading</b> catheters (4) Here implanted in subcutaneously growing R 1 M rhabdomyosarcoma in female Wag/Rij rats. A MicroSelectron (Nucletron) was used for interstitial high-dose-rate irradiation (Ir- 192). Tumor oxygenation, perfusion, anti cell survival were assessed by pO(2) histography (Eppendorf), Tc- 99 m injection, and excision assay, respectively. Results: Tumor perfusion was markedly reduced at 1 h after catheter implantation (33. 9 +/- 6. 0 % (SEM, n = 9) of control) and partly recovered after 5 h (61. 5 +/- 12. 2 %). At 24 h, the perfusion level reached control values (100. 6 +/- 25. 7 %), but was highly variable with some elf the tumors showing hardly any recovery at all. Tumor oxygenation showed a similar pattern, but with less recovery. Median pO(2) readings were 13. 5, 1. 2, and 5. 3 mm Hg before and at 1 and 24 h after implantation, respectively (7 tumors). The percentages of pO(2) readings {{less than or equal to}} 2. 5 mm Hg were 18. 9 %, 55. 6 %, and 41. 3 % at these time points. The difference in cell survival after irradiation (10 Gy) at 1 or 24 h after implantation was compatible with a radiobiological oxygen effect. Conclusion: Implantation of brachytherapy <b>afterloading</b> catheters induces an increased level of hypoxia for several hours by disrupting tumor perfusion, causing both a modest degree of direct cell kill and a significant reduction of the radiation effect. This transient hypoxia might be exploited by combining irradiation with properly timed treatments targeting hypoxic cells. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|R
