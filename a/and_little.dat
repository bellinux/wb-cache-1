Disgusted, Randyll further insults Sam and Gilly, prompting Melessa and Talla {{to leave the room}} with Gilly in anger. Randyll tells Sam that Gilly <b>and</b> <b>Little</b> Sam can remain at Horn Hill, but that he must never set foot in Horn Hill again.

5|$|Ian Rowley {{proposed}} that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north, which molecular evidence indicates occurred in the early Pliocene epoch around 4 million years ago. The raven diverged into the ancestor of the forest <b>and</b> <b>little</b> ravens {{in the east and}} Australian raven in the west, this split occurring around 2 million years ago in the early Pleistocene. As the climate became cooler and drier, the aridity of central Australia split them entirely. Furthermore, the eastern birds diverged into nomadic little ravens and, in forested refuges, forest ravens. As the climate eventually became warmer, the western birds spread eastwards and almost outcompeted forest ravens on mainland Australia. Rowley noted that the western subspecies of the Australian raven had features intermediate between the eastern subspecies of Australian <b>and</b> <b>little</b> ravens.|$|E
