500|$|The four {{ships of}} Battleship Division Nine—accompanied by the {{destroyer}} —got underway from Lynnhaven Roads, Virginia on 25 November 1917, {{bound for the}} anchorage of the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands. What should have been an uneventful transit was complicated by weather that began bad and only got worse as the voyage progressed. After battling a vicious northwester that brought sleet, hail, and snow, the division was further buffeted by a severe gale off the Grand Banks that began on 29 November. Captain Henry Wiley of Wyoming would later recall of that storm, [...] "At {{the height of the}} gale, it blew <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have ever seen it, and the seas were the worst I could recollect." ...|$|E

He has the [...] "ability to hold the ball up, and cause the defenders problems" [...] and is in possession of the long throw-in ability. After Rankine signed for Bournemouth, manager Jimmy Quinn said [...] "He's big, he's strong and I'm pleased to get him in". York manager Martin Foyle said Rankine [...] "will also work hard, close down and give us a presence in the final third. He's a good size, mobile and will certainly run the channels." ...|$|E
500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. [...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could. [...] Imagine my surprise when he looked up and said, 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon.

500|$|As {{a member}} of Harvard's class of 1829, Holmes lived at {{home for the first}} few years of his college career rather than in the dormitories. Since he {{measured}} only [...] "five feet three inches when standing in a pair of substantial boots", the young student had no interest in joining a sports team or the Harvard Washington Corps. Instead, he allied himself with the [...] "Aristocrats" [...] or [...] "Puffmaniacs", a group of students who gathered in order to smoke and talk. As a town student and the son of a minister, however, he was able to move between social groups. He also became a friend of Charles Chauncy Emerson (brother of Ralph Waldo Emerson), who was a year older. During second year, Holmes was one of 20 students awarded the scholastic honor Deturs, which came with a copy of The Poems of James Graham, John Logan, and William Falconer. Despite his scholastic achievements, the young scholar admitted to a schoolmate from Andover that he did not [...] "study <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> ought to'. He did, however, excel in languages and took classes in French, Italian and Spanish.|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast on November 12, 2009, [...] "The Camel" [...] {{was seen by}} 4.67 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. It drew a 2.1 rating/6 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49, about a five percent drop from the previous week's episode, [...] "Ron and Tammy". The episode received generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "The Camel" [...] was a particularly funny episode, and that the parks department's collaboration on the mural allowed [...] "each character being able to instill their own level of brand-specific insanity into the mix". Fowler also praised the sewer department jokes, the [...] "murinal" [...] scene involving Jerry {{and the fact that}} no department ended up winning the mural contest, which Fowler called a commentary on [...] "the futility of local government in their attempts to accomplish anything". The Star-Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall declared [...] "The Camel" [...] one of the episodes he would suggest to newcomers seeking to become familiar with Parks and Recreation. Sepinwall said the Ron and Andy subplot [...] "made me laugh <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have in a very long time", and said the episode had a good mix of funny, sweet and ridiculous moments, and said the ensemble cast was starting to work extremely well together.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the park}} and Twitter posts {{selected}} by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive; Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults. On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carl {{began his}} season on a low-note, {{wrecking}} in {{the ending of}} the Daytona 500 and losing the draft late in the race in Atlanta. He rebounded at Las Vegas with a terrific run. While running close to the lead and leading a couple laps, Edwards tangled with Kasey Kahne with less than 20 laps to go. Edwards — while moving under Kahne —knocked Kahne into the SAFER barrier. In an apparent act of retaliation, Kahne forced Edwards out of the draft, wrecking Edwards and himself. Despite the payback, Edwards took responsibility for the collision stating: [...] "I was just racing <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can. It's completely my fault, Kasey did a good job. I just got sucked up into him there off of turn 4 and tore up the right side a little bit and got loose into Turn 1 and that was it. ... That's definitely my fault. I feel bad for Kasey." ...|$|E

[...] The report noted a published newspaper report regarding Martin's difficulties with the position change the Dolphins made with him days before he left the team and alleged harassment. The Miami Herald noted that the Dolphins were concerned about Martin's reaction to the move, and noted that [...] "It was clear Martin isn't thrilled about the move. [...] "You can approach this two different ways," [...] Martin said. [...] "You can go in the tank and be {{one of those guys who}} bitches and moans and is a cancer in the locker room, or you can be a guy who goes out there and can be a professional and plays <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can."

2500|$|Smith was {{replaced}} as writer/director by Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence, {{in what would}} have been his directorial debut.

Consider me obsessed— I'm going to try <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can not to screw this up." [...] Lawrence was signed to direct both Fletch Won and a sequel. Scrubs star Zach Braff was rumored to be in talks for the lead role, and in January 2007, Braff posted on his web site that [...] "Bill Lawrence is writing and directing Fletch in the spring and he wants me to play young Fletch, but no firm plans are in place yet. He is still writing the script." [...] In April 2007, Braff announced that he had dropped out of the film to work on his own film, Open Hearts. In June 2007, it was announced that Lawrence was off the project and had been replaced by Steve Pink.|$|E

2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her? We ain't got no problem.

2500|$|As {{the show}} progressed, Colbert {{gradually}} began {{to tone down}} the character, allowing guests in interviews to [...] "get {{his or her own}} message across." [...] The show's longevity created what The New York Times described as [...] "a winking quality to the act, a sense that we’re all in on the joke." [...] Colbert himself acknowledged that he [...] "rarely hit it <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> used to," [...] noting that [...] "You have to be vigilant to stay ignorant." [...] He noted that his own personal opinions can occasionally align with his character's, when liberal guests' agendas appeared based on dislike rather than logical argument. [...] Politician and former vice president Al Gore accidentally referred to the persona as a [...] "character" [...] in a 2011 interview on the show, and in 2013, Colbert further blurred lines when he spoke regarding the death of his mother on the program. In doing so, many commentators referred the show's longevity {{and the development of a}} [...] "third" [...] Colbert — one a faux pundit and one informed by the performer's own life. In the show's credits, Colbert was credited with a title, which became increasingly long and humorous as the show progressed: Her Excellency The Rev. Sir Doctor Stephen Tyrone Mos Def Colbert, D.F.A., Heavyweight Champion of the World✱✱ featuring Flo Rida La Premiere Dame De France.|$|E
