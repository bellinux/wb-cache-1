40|$|This article {{examines}} the court's jurisdiction in section 23 A of the Wills Ordinance to order that a will be rectified so as {{to carry out the}} testator's intentions with contrasting reference to the general equitable remedy of rectification. The types of mistake that can be rectified are analysed {{in the light of the}} section's providence and of the relevant case law on the analogous English provision. The important practical impact of the jurisdiction on actions against solicitors for negligence in relation to the drafting of wills is illustrated by showing how an initial <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>rectification</b> may be required to mitigate any tortious liability arising out of an alleged mistake in a will. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The large {{electronic}} polarization in III-V nitrides {{allow for}} novel physics not possible in other semiconductor families. In this work, interband Zener tunneling in wide-bandgap GaN heterojunctions {{is demonstrated by}} using polarization-induced electric fields. The resulting tunnel diodes are more conductive under reverse bias, which has <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> zero-bias <b>rectification</b> and mm-wave imaging. Since interband tunneling is traditionally prohibitive in wide-bandgap semiconductors, these polarization-induced structures and their variants can enable a number of devices such as multijunction solar cells that can operate under elevated temperatures and high fields.

This sharp “tip” or edge with a collector anode constitutes a tunnel junction. In these devices the rectenna (consisting of the antenna and the tunnel junction) acts as the absorber of the incident radiation and the rectifier. Using current nanofabrication techniques and the selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, junctions of 1 [*]nm can be fabricated, which allow <b>for</b> <b>rectification</b> of frequencies up to the blue portion of the spectrum. To assess the viability of our approach, we review the development of nanoantenna structures and tunnel junctions capable of operating in the visible region.
