These proceedings operate on a timetable governed by U.S. law. The Department of Commerce has regularly found that products have been sold at less than fair value in U.S. markets. If the domestic industry is able to establish that it is being injured by the dumping, then <b>antidumping</b> duties are imposed on goods imported from the dumpers' country at a percentage rate calculated to counteract the dumping margin.|$|E

50|$|There is {{one notable}} {{exception}} to the Court's jurisdiction.

50|$|Critics of this {{methodology}} charge that, because negative amounts are excluded, zeroing {{results in the}} calculation of a margin and an <b>antidumping</b> duty {{in excess of the}} actual dumping practiced by the countries concerned.

50|$|Zeroing {{refers to}} a {{controversial}} methodology used by the United States for calculating <b>antidumping</b> duties against foreign products. The foreign domestic price (FDP) of the product is compared with its U.S. import price (USIP) adjusted for transportation and handling costs. Under zeroing, the United States sets at zero the negative differences (that is whenever FDP minus USIP is less than zero).|$|E
50|$|Also {{contentious}} is NAFTA's Chapter 19, which subjects <b>antidumping</b> and {{countervailing duty}} (AD/CVD) determinations to binational panel review instead of, or in addition to, conventional judicial review. For example, in the United States, review of agency decisions imposing <b>antidumping</b> and countervailing duties are normally heard before the U.S. Court of International Trade, an Article III court. NAFTA parties, however, {{have the option}} of appealing the decisions to binational panels composed of five citizens from the two relevant NAFTA countries. The panelists are generally lawyers experienced in international trade law. Since the NAFTA does not include substantive provisions concerning AD/CVD, the panel is charged with determining whether final agency determinations involving AD/CVD conform with the country's domestic law. Chapter 19 can be considered as somewhat of an anomaly in international dispute settlement since it does not apply international law, but requires a panel composed of individuals from many countries to re-examine the application of one country's domestic law.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2001, {{the nations}} agreed {{to settle the}} long-running dispute related to China's {{interest}} in three EU nations through a seven-year agreement.

The review committee had also observed that the production of garlic in China amounted to a 60 percent increase over the 2000 level. In spite of this high production recorded till 2004, the FAO reported that there was a shortage of production in 2005 which resulted in increase of garlic price in the export market to US $13 per box in 2005. Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Thailand, Venezuela and South Africa joined the US and Canada in imposing an <b>antidumping</b> duty. However, China's export of garlic to the European Union was duty provided with an exemption up to a limit of 29.1 million pounds of garlic every year, with duty imposed on rising scale on any quantify exceeding this amount.|$|E

50|$|Third country dumping is a {{situation}} in which exports of a product from one country are being injured or threatened with injury because of exports of the same product from a second country into a third country at less than fair value. Section 1318 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-418) establishes procedures for U.S. industries to petition the U.S. Trade Representative to request a foreign government that is a signatory to the GATT Anti-Dumping Code to initiate an <b>antidumping</b> investigation on behalf of a U.S. industry that claims it is being injured by dumping in that country’s market.|$|E
