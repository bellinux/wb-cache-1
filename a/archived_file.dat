Working with the wave equation in mixed rather than irreducible form allows one to directly account for both, the acoustic pressure field and the acoustic particle velocity field. Indeed, this becomes the natural option in many problems, such as those involving waves propagating in moving domains, because the equations can easily be set in an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) frame of reference. Yet, when attempting a standard Galerkin finite element solution (FEM) for them, it turns out that an inf-sup compatibility constraint has to be satisfied, which prevents from using equal interpolations for the approximated acoustic pressure and velocity fields. In this work it is proposed to resort to a subgrid scale stabilization strategy to circumvent this condition and thus facilitate code implementation. As a possible application, we address the generation of diphthongs in voice production. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|E

To further establish {{the feasibility of}} this approach, this study investigated the interaction between spatial resolution of different reproduction methods and technical and perceptual hearing aid performance measures using computer simulations. Three spatial audio reproduction methods [...] discrete speakers, vector base amplitude panning and higher order ambisonics [...] were compared in regular circular loudspeaker arrays with 4 to 72 channels. The influence of reproduction method and array size on performance measures of representative multi-microphone hearing aid algorithm classes with spatially distributed microphones and a representative single channel noise-reduction algorithm was analyzed. Algorithm classes differed in their way of analyzing and exploiting spatial properties of the sound field, requiring different accuracy of sound field reproduction. Performance measures included beam pattern analysis, signal-to-noise ratio analysis, perceptual localization prediction, and quality modeling. The results show performance differences and interaction effects between reproduction method and algorithm class {{that may be used}} for guidance when selecting the appropriate method and number of speakers for specific tasks in hearing aid research.

We also prove the following local version of this result. Let gj(z, x), j = 1, 2 be the diagonal Green’s matrices of the self-adjoint Schrödinger operators Hj = − d 2 dx 2 Im + Qj(x) in L 2 (R) m. Suppose that for fixed a> 0 and x 0 ∈ R, ‖g 1 (z, x 0) − g 2 (z, x 0) ‖ C m×m + ‖g ′ 1 (z, x 0) − g ′ 2 (z, x 0) ‖ C m×m = |z|→ ∞ O (e − 2 Im(z 1 / 2) a) for z inside a cone along the imaginary axis with vertex zero and opening angle less than π/ 2, excluding the real axis. Then Q 1 (x) = Q 2 (x) for a. e. x ∈ [x 0 − a, x 0 + a]. Analogous results are proved for matrix-valued Jacobi and Dirac-type operators.

One of the well-known ways of damping resonant flexural vibrations of different engineering structures or their elements, e. g. finite plates or bars, is to reduce reflections of flexural waves from their free edges. In the present paper, a new efficient method of reducing edge reflections is described that utilises gradual change in thickness of a plate or a bar from the value corresponding to the thickness of the basic plate to almost zero. It is proposed to use specific power-law shapes of plates of variable thickness (wedges) that ideally provide zero reflection even for negligibly small material attenuation – the so-called ‘acoustic black hole effect’. In particular, for powers m ≥ 2 - in free wedges, and m ≥ 5 / 3 – in immersed wedges, incident flexural waves become trapped near the edge and do not reflect back. Since, because of ever-present edge truncations in real manufactured wedges, the corresponding reflection coefficients are always far from zero, to make up for real wedges and make the systems more efficient it is proposed to deposit absorbing thin layers on wedge surfaces. It is shown that the deposition of thin damping layers on the wedge surfaces can dramatically reduce the reflection coefficients. Thus, the combination of a wedge with power-law profile and of thin damping layers can utilise the acoustic ‘black hole’ effect resulting in very effective damping systems for flexural vibrations...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} and present satisfaction rates {{of our patients}} and their partners after 3 part inflatable penile prosthesis implantation. Materials and methods: We searched our hospital electronic data for patients who underwent inflatable penile prosthesis implantation between January 2008 and July 2013. Computer and <b>archived</b> <b>file</b> data were used to get information and reach the patients. We made telephone calls to patients and asked questionnaires about self and partner satisfaction rates. Results: 36 patients underwent prosthesis implantation during the 5 year period. We were able to reach by telephone call 18 of them. The mean age of 18 patients was 55. 7 ± 9. 4 years and mean body mass index was 24. 6 ± 2. 1 kg/m 2. The etiology was diabetes mellitus on 14 (77. 8 %) and radical pelvic surgery on 4 (22. 2 %) patients. 14 of 18 patients had penile Doppler ultrasound test. Doppler ultrasound demonstrated venous insufficiency in 8 and arterial insufficiency in 6 patients. Mean time from implantation to study was 20. 8 ± 13. 9 months. Out of 18 patients 2 had prosthesis removal operation because of infection in one patient and perforation in the other. Satisfaction rate was 88. 9 %, and recommendation rate was 94. 4 %. Causes of dissatisfaction were pain in one patient and insufficient rigidity plus shortening of the penis in the other one. Partner satisfaction rate was 94. 4 %. Conclusion: Penile Prosthesis Implantation (PPI) is the gold standard treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) irresponsive to medical treatment. Infection and mechanical failure rates {{are going to be}} less according to the improvements in synthetic materials and coverings of the prosthesis, so patient and partner satisfaction rates will be higher...|$|E
40|$|This <b>archived</b> <b>file</b> {{includes}} the primary data and preliminary {{results of a}} semester long, ethnographic research project that sought to describe the experiences {{of students with disabilities}} at the University of Illinois. I suggest that many of the student???s involved in this project came to the University of Illinois with a strong sense of self-advocacy and awareness of their identity as an individual with a disability. However, through their interactions with peers and participation in several university arenas, including classrooms, student organizations, wheelchair athletics, and residential living, these students developed a broader social network involving individuals with a diverse range of disabilities. Preliminary findings from this project suggest that these broader social interactions and networks among students with disabilities allow students to both understand the experiences of others, as well as to advocate for programs and policies that benefit both students and community members with disabilities. Thus, the university through it???s many features (just some of which include educational, extracurricular, leisure, social, and residential) provide settings and interactions through which a student with a disability can become engaged in advocacy behaviors for themselves and others, give primacy to their identity as a disabled individual, and perform a disabled subjectivity.

Hirzel Verlag/European Acoustics Association. The definitive publisher-authenticated version is available online at: [URL] must contact the publisher for reprint or {{permission to use the}} material in any form. International audienceThe loudness related to a sound may vary according to the localization of its source. This phenomenon is described as directional loudness and has been mainly observed for high-frequency sounds and for sources located in the horizontal plane. Because of the acoustic shadow of the head, the left and right ear pressures are modified depending on the source azimuth and the global loudness resulting from a summation process may vary accordingly. But directional loudness has also been reported to occur at 400 Hz, where shadowing effects are usually rather small. It might therefore be suspected that directional loudness effects could be influenced by other parameters involved in the localization process. In a previous study, a small but significant increase of loudness with increasing interaural time difference (ITD) was shown for low-frequency pure tones (200 and 400 Hz) at a low loudness level (40 phon). The present study aimed at getting insight into the potential cause and extent of this effect by assessing the loudness of similar pure tones lateralized with headphones by applying an interaural level difference (ILD) in addition to an ITD and by measuring the effect of ITD at the hearing threshold. It showed significant effects of both ILD and ITD on loudness, and no interaction between these factors. As the effects added even when the factors were contradictory, it supports the hypothesis that the effect is caused by the ITD itself and is not related to the localization process. However, the ITD effect was not significant at the hearing threshold...|$|E
40|$|I {{had been}} told {{a couple of times}} that I had to clear out from the {{university}} server, a great mass of computer files from previous research projects – gigabytes of notes, videos, spreadsheets, ethics applications, reports, notes and reflections - associated with different projects over the years, all rather badly organised. Working in a relatively new, relatively remote Australian university, I enjoy being relatively unencumbered by academic traditions, but am suddenly constrained by the limits of our technology and my ability to use it. I must put all the files on a ‘USB Pen Drive’ and take them to ‘Records and Archives’ for storage. Then I must wipe the V: drive. If I want any <b>archived</b> <b>file,</b> I can walk down to ‘Records & Archives’ with a memory stick and request a copy. It is a strange feeling looking through all those files. They contain traces of so much interesting work undertaken since the computer server was introduced to store the objects of our work. There was a tinge of pride in all the complex collaborative work I had undertaken with Yolŋu Aboriginal people, and with colleagues and government workers, but that pride was spoilt by the feeling that so much of the material has remained unexamined, and never retold or reworked, and worse, that so many of the papers and reports – mostly to governments but also to industry and NGOs – really didn’t lead to much change on the ground. We seem to have been given more and more work over the past twenty years, with those who fund the research paying less and less attention to what we produce. In my cleaning work, I spotted a folder called ‘Financial Literacy Evaluation 2008 ’. Our cross-cultural consultancy group, which we called the Yolŋu Aboriginal Consultancy Initiative, had been asked to evaluate a program of Financial Literacy training for a small credit union based in the Northern Territory (which I’ll call ‘Small Bank’), dedicated to serving the financial needs of remote Aboriginal communities. The evaluation was being funded by a major national financial institution (which I’ll call ‘Big Bank’) as part of its commitment to ‘reconciliation’ 1. I began to piece back together in my mind why and how we had been invited to undertake this consultancy as I, pretty much randomly, opened up the most interesting-sounding files in {{what turned out to be}} a large trove of documents...|$|E
