5|$|In the Croatian {{part of the}} Adriatic Sea, {{there are}} 718 islands, 389 islets and 78 reefs, making the Croatian <b>archipelago</b> {{the largest in the}} Adriatic Sea and the second largest in the Mediterranean Sea, the Greek <b>archipelago</b> being the largest.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard has {{permafrost}} and tundra, {{with both}} low, {{middle and high}} Arctic vegetation. 165 species of plants have been found on the <b>archipelago.</b> Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetations, which accounts for about 10% of the <b>archipelago.</b> Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land, around Isfjorden and where affected by guano. While there is little precipitation, giving the <b>archipelago</b> a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation. The growing season is very short, and may last only a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Malay <b>Archipelago</b> {{influenced}} many works {{starting with}} those of Wallace's contemporaries. The novelist Joseph Conrad used it as source material for some of his novels, including Almayer's Folly, An Outcast of the Islands, and The Rescue. Commentators have suggested it had a particularly profound influence on Lord Jim, crediting it with among other things {{the inspiration for the}} character Stein the entomologist. Conrad's assistant Richard Curle wrote that The Malay <b>Archipelago</b> was Conrad's favourite bedside book; Conrad refers directly to what he calls Alfred Wallace's famous book on the Malay <b>Archipelago</b> in The Secret Agent. In his short story, Neil MacAdam, W. Somerset Maugham has the title character read The Malay <b>Archipelago</b> while travelling to Borneo, and its influence can be felt in the story's description of that island.|$|E

40|$|The 78 bryozoan species {{collected}} by the German R/V "Polarstern" during the LAMPOS cruise in April 2002, encompassing the Scotia Arc <b>archipelagos</b> between Tierra del Fuego and the Antarctic Peninsula, were studied to discern the biogeographical patterns of the Magellan region of South America, the Scotia Arc <b>archipelagos</b> and the Antarctic. The resulting dendrogram shows three clusters: an isolated one with the three easternmost <b>archipelagos</b> {{and the other two}} linking some of the northern and southern Scotia Arc <b>archipelagos</b> with Tierra del Fuego. A more comprehensive analysis using all the species previously recorded from the Scotia Arc <b>archipelagos</b> and adjacent areas (214 spp.) produced a clearer zoogeographical pattern without isolated clusters of localities. The Antarctic Peninsula plus the Scotia Arc <b>archipelagos</b> form a large cluster distinct from the Magellan-Falkland Subantarctic area. A third analysis making use of 78 genera present in the study area plus Australia and New Zealand reinforces this pattern, showing two clusters: one uniting South America and the Australian-New Zealand realm and the other linking the Scotia Arc <b>archipelagos</b> with the Antarctic Peninsula. These results indicate that the Scotia Arc <b>archipelagos</b> represent merely a very narrow bridge connecting two different bryozoan faunas with only a few bryozoan species in common between the study areas...|$|R
25|$|All {{along the}} Galician coast are various <b>archipelagos</b> near {{the mouths of}} the rías. These <b>archipelagos</b> provide {{protected}} deepwater harbors and also provide habitat for seagoing birds. A 2007 inventory estimates that the Galician coast has 316 <b>archipelagos,</b> islets, and freestanding rocks. Among {{the most important of}} these are the <b>archipelagos</b> of Cíes, Ons, and Sálvora. Together with Cortegada Island, these make up the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park. Other significant islands are Islas Malveiras, Islas Sisargas, and, the largest and holding the largest population, Arousa Island.|$|R
5|$|The <b>archipelago</b> {{features}} an Arctic climate, although with significantly higher temperatures than other areas {{at the same}} latitude. The flora {{take advantage of the}} long period of midnight sun to compensate for the polar night. Svalbard is a breeding ground for many seabirds, and also features polar bears, reindeer, the Arctic fox, and certain marine mammals. Seven national parks and twenty-three nature reserves cover two-thirds of the <b>archipelago,</b> protecting the largely untouched, yet fragile, natural environment. Approximately 60% of the <b>archipelago</b> is covered with glaciers, and the islands feature many mountains and fjords.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian {{victory against}} Sweden in 1743, the Swedes {{established}} {{a commission to}} identify weaknesses in the eastern defenses. In 1747, the commission concluded that the fortifications in southeastern Finland needed to be improved and expanded, and that Sweden needed to build a strong coastal navy. Augustin Ehrensvärd (1710–72), an artillery officer, was {{the driving force behind}} these changes. The committee based many of its conclusions and decisions on his ideas. In 1756, Sweden established the <b>archipelago</b> fleet with the official name arméns flotta ("fleet of the army") under the command of the army department, Krigskollegium, with Ehrensvärd as supreme commander. For two decades, the struggle for power between the Hats and the Caps, the dominant political factions at the time, and rivalries between army and navy brought about changes to the <b>archipelago</b> fleet. The parliamentary victory of the Hats in the Riksdag in 1769–70 and the coup d'ètat by King Gustav III in 1772 secured the <b>archipelago</b> fleet's status as an independent branch of the army. Starting in 1770, the <b>archipelago</b> fleet merged with the Finnish Squadron (Finska eskadern) based at Sveaborg. In 1777, it incorporated the Swedish Squadron (Svenska eskadern), the galley fleet based at Stockholm. The Swedish armed forces invested considerable resources in the new army branch and made it a professional, independent organization. The <b>archipelago</b> fleet attracted members of the social and cultural elite who enjoyed the protection and patronage of King Gustav III, who had established himself as an absolute monarch in the 1772 coup.|$|E

Over two decades the <b>archipelago</b> fleet went through several changes caused by the competition between the Hats and the Caps, the dominant political fractions at the time, and because of rivalries between army and navy. With the parliamentary victory of the Hats in the riksdag of 1769–70 and the coup d'état by Gustav III in 1772, the <b>archipelago</b> fleet's status as an independent organization within the army was secured.

40|$|Since the {{contributions}} of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, oceanic <b>archipelagos</b> have {{played a central role}} in the development of biogeography. However, despite the critical influence of oceanic islands on ecological and evolutionary theory, our focus has remained limited to either the island-level of specific <b>archipelagos</b> or single <b>archipelagos.</b> Recently, it was proposed that oceanic <b>archipelagos</b> qualify as biotic provinces, with diversity primarily reflecting a balance between speciation and extinction, with colonization having a minor role. Here we focus on major attributes of the archipelagic geological dynamics that can affect diversity at both the island and the archipelagic level. We also re-affirm that oceanic <b>archipelagos</b> are appropriate spatiotemporal units to frame analyses in order to understand large scale patterns of biodiversity. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} current debates on {{global climate change}} it has become {{important}} to know more on how large, roaming species have responded to environmental change in the past. Using the highly variable mitochondrial control region, we revisit theories of Rangifer colonization and propose that the High Arctic <b>archipelagos</b> of Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, and Novaia Zemlia were colonized by reindeer from the Eurasian mainland after the last glacial maximum. Comparing mtDNA control region sequences from the three Arctic <b>archipelagos</b> showed a strong genetic connection between the populations, supporting a common origin in the past. A genetic connection between the three <b>archipelagos</b> and two Russian mainland populations was also found, suggesting colonization of the Eurasian high Arctic <b>archipelagos</b> from the Eurasian mainland. The age of the Franz Josef Land material (> 2000 years before present) implies that Arctic indigenous reindeer colonized the Eurasian Arctic <b>archipelagos</b> through natural dispersal, before humans approached this region...|$|R
40|$|Island studies {{research}} has traditionally focused on relatively rural, peripheral, and isolated communities, yet island cities (strongly urbanized small islands or <b>archipelagos</b> or major population centres of large islands or <b>archipelagos)</b> also represent an important research area. Island spatiality has {{a host of}} historical and continuing effects on urban development, influencing urban densification and agglomeration, zonal differentiation, and neighbourhood formation in cities both big and small. This special section of Island Studies Journal includes papers on the island cities and urban <b>archipelagos</b> of Peel (Isle of Man, British Isles), Nuuk (Greenland), Palma de Majorca (Spain), Belize City (Belize), and Mumbai (India). The Island Cities and Urban <b>Archipelagos</b> research network seeks to help enrich wider island studies scholarship and contribute to introducing the island dimension to urban studies...|$|R
5|$|Before the {{founding}} of Sandakan, Sulu <b>Archipelago</b> {{was the source of}} dispute between Spain and the Sultanate of Sulu for economic dominance in the region. By 1864, Spain had blockaded the Sultanate possessions in the Sulu <b>Archipelago.</b> The Sultanate of Sulu awarded a German consular service ex-member a piece of land in the Sandakan Bay to seek protection from Germany. In 1878, the Sultanate sold north-eastern Borneo to an Austro-Hungarian consul who later left the territory to a British colonial merchant. The German presence over the area raised concern among the British. As a result, a protocol was signed between the British, German and the Spanish to recognise Spanish sovereignty over the Sulu <b>Archipelago,</b> in return for the Spanish not intervening in British affairs in northern Borneo.|$|E
5|$|Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the Malay <b>Archipelago</b> was {{gradually}} {{taken over by}} the European colonial powers, beginning {{with the arrival of the}} Portuguese at Malacca in 1509. The early dominance of the Portuguese was challenged during the 17th century by the Dutch, who came to control most of the ports in the region. The Dutch established a monopoly over trade within the <b>archipelago,</b> particularly in spices, then the region's most important product. Other colonial powers, including the British, were limited to a relatively minor presence.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's <b>archipelago</b> frigates {{provided}} better {{protection for}} their crew than the galleys they replaced, {{and up to}} three times the capacity for stores and provisions. They could operate in the narrow, shallow waters around skerries in all weathers and in open water {{in all but the}} worst storms. They had a deeper draft than galleys, but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships. The new ship types also increased the <b>archipelago</b> fleet's firepower, provided it with better defensive capabilities, and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{affected}} Papua New Guinea on {{two separate}} occasions {{while it was}} active, with the cyclone first affecting the <b>archipelago</b> between 28December and 1January, before grazing the <b>archipelago</b> between 12-14January. Before Rewa affected the country, cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands, while authorities urged people {{not to go to}} beaches. As it affected the <b>archipelago,</b> Rewa brought heavy rainfall, high seas, and wind gusts of up to 100km/h (60mph) to parts of the <b>archipelago</b> including Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands. The hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems, with the cyclone blocking roads, destroying a church, bridges, homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and copra destroyed. In total, Cyclone Rewa left around 3500people homeless and caused 17deaths, 8 of which were due to flooding. Nine other people went missing while travelling to Rossel Island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with Rewa. They were later presumed dead by the National Disaster and Emergency Service, after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the boat. At 00:00UTC on 30December, the automatic weather station at Jingo on Rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55km/h (35mph).|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Tropical Storm Beryl {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} and gusty winds on the Cape Verde island of Sal.

In the period after the storm's passage, the United States provided humanitarian aid and economic assistance to the country, helping the <b>archipelago</b> to reverse the effects of Beryl.|$|E
5|$|Earthsea {{itself is}} an <b>archipelago</b> {{or group of}} islands. In the fictional history of this world, the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero.

The world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody {{in each of the}} original trilogy of novels. The setting of Earthsea is preindustrial, and has many cultures within the widespread <b>archipelago.</b> Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands. Some of the Eastern islands are populated by the white-skinned Kargish people, who see the Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The far western regions of the <b>archipelago</b> are where the dragons live.|$|E
