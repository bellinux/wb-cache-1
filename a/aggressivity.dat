2500|$|In the Ecosocialist manifesto, Kovel and Löwy {{suggest that}} {{capitalist}} expansion causes both [...] "crises of ecology" [...] through [...] "rampant industrialization" [...] and [...] "societal breakdown" [...] that springs [...] "from {{the form of}} imperialism known as globalization". They believe that capitalism's expansion [...] "exposes ecosystems" [...] to pollutants, habitat destruction and resource depletion, [...] "reducing the sensuous vitality of nature to the cold exchangeability required for the accumulation of capital", while submerging [...] "the majority of the world's people to a mere reservoir of labor power" [...] as it penetrates communities through [...] "consumerism and depoliticization". Furthermore, Kovel sees the form of neo-liberal globalization as [...] "a return to the pure logic of capital" [...] that [...] "has effectively swept away measures which had inhibited capital’s <b>aggressivity,</b> replacing them with naked exploitation of humanity and nature"; for Kovel, this [...] "tearing down of boundaries", which was [...] "a deliberate response to a serious accumulation crisis" [...] in the 1970s, has become the definition of modern 'globalization'.|$|E

50|$|Classification {{of breast}} cancer is usually, but not always, {{primarily}} based on the histological appearance of tissue in the tumor. A variant from this approach, defined {{on the basis of}} physical exam findings, is that inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), a form of ductal carcinoma or malignant cancer in the ducts, is distinguished from other carcinomas by the inflamed appearance of the affected breast, which correlates with increased cancer <b>aggressivity.</b>|$|E
50|$|The main use of serum {{thymidine}} kinase activity assay {{now is in}} non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

This is reflected in the values of serum {{thymidine kinase}} activity, that range from close to the normal range for slow-growing tumors to very high levels for rapidly growing forms.|$|E
5000|$|In medicine, a nesidioblastoma is an uncommon, insulin-secreting, {{pancreatic}} neuroendocrine tumor (PanNET). The term {{dates to}} at least 1938. In that report, these lesions were adjudicated as histologically benign adenoma growths, that were associated with severe, long-standing hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism. Surgical removal corrected the low glucose problems. There is no rigorous definitional separation from insulinoma, other than the original emphasis that {{was placed on the}} observed precise histological recapitulation of normal islet cell structure within the adenomas, which lacked microscopic features of <b>aggressivity.</b>|$|E

50|$|CIP2A is over-expressed {{in several}} common human {{malignancies}} including, human {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), colon cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer. Notably, in these cancer types CIP2A over-expression is observed with very high frequency; in breast cancer around 40% of cancer patients are over-expressing CIP2A whereas in all other studied cancer types the frequency is between 65-87 percent. In breast cancer CIP2A expression correlates with disease <b>aggressivity</b> whereas in gastric and lung cancer CIP2A expression predicts for poor patient survival. To date high CIP2A expression has been observed to predict poor patient prognosis in more than dozen human cancer types, which makes {{it one of the}} most frequently altered human oncoprotein with clinical relevance.|$|E

50|$|This {{idea was}} first {{advanced}} by Kenneth Waltz, in his neorealist text, Man, the State and War, and expanded {{on in his}} Theory of International Politics. For Waltz, {{the absence of a}} higher authority than states in the international system means that states can only rely on themselves for their own survival, requiring paranoid vigilance and constant preparation for conﬂict. In Man, the State, and War, Waltz describes anarchy as a condition of possibility or a “permissive” cause of war. He argues that “wars occur because there is nothing to prevent them”. Similarly, American political scientist John Herz argues that international anarchy assures the centrality of the struggle for power “even in the absence of <b>aggressivity</b> or similar factors”, emphasizing that a state’s interests and actions are determined by the anarchic structure of the international system itself.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{as regards}} certain {{personality}} traits, like {{the degree of}} introversion or of sourness, there was research carried out by psychologists at Michigan State University and the University of Minnesota, based on a relatively huge data base of 1,296 couples who {{have been married for}} an average of 19.8 years, suggesting that only the degree of <b>aggressivity</b> actually tended to converge. What they found is that couples who had been married for a long time -- up to 39 years -- were no more alike in fundamental personality traits than newlyweds, leading the researchers to conclude that personalities do not grow more similar as the years pass. More likely, the couples were looking for specific traits during the courtship and they ended up with someone who was very much like themselves.

50|$|Significant {{toxicity}} from benzodiazepines {{can occur}} in the elderly {{as a result of}} long-term use. Benzodiazepines, along with antihypertensives and drugs affecting the cholinergic system, are {{the most common cause of}} drug-induced dementia affecting over 10 percent of patients attending memory clinics. Long-term use of benzodiazepines in the elderly can lead to a pharmacological syndrome with symptoms including drowsiness, ataxia, fatigue, confusion, weakness, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, reversible dementia, depression, impairment of intellect, psychomotor and sexual dysfunction, agitation, auditory and visual hallucinations, paranoid ideation, panic, delirium, depersonalisation, sleepwalking, <b>aggressivity,</b> orthostatic hypotension and insomnia. Depletion of certain neurotransmitters and cortisol levels and alterations in immune function and biological markers can also occur. Elderly individuals who have been long-term users of benzodiazepines have been found to have a higher incidence of post-operative confusion. Benzodiazepines have been associated with increased body sway in the elderly, which can potentially lead to fatal accidents including falls. Discontinuation of benzodiazepines leads to improvement in the balance of the body and also leads to improvements in cognitive functions in the elderly benzodiazepine hypnotic users without worsening of insomnia.|$|E

5000|$|Lacan saw {{the roots}} of {{intra-group}} aggression in a regression to the [...] "narcissistic moment in the subject", highlighting [...] "the <b>aggressivity</b> involved in the effects of all regression, all arrested development, all rejection of typical development in the subject". Neville Symington also saw narcissism as {{a key element in}} group conflict, singling out [...] "organizations so riven by narcissistic currents that...little creative work was done". Such settings provide an opening for [...] "many egoistic instinct-feelings - as the desire to dominate and humiliate your fellow, the love of conflict - your courage and power against mine - the satisfaction of being the object of jealousy, the pleasures derived from the exercise of cunning, deceit and concealment". Fischer (2012) distinguished between two forms of intragroup conflict in organizations. In a [...] "restorative" [...] form, paranoid-schizoid [...] "splitting" [...] can be transformed through scapegoating dynamics to produce reparative ("depressive") intragroup relations. In a contrasting [...] "perverse" [...] form, intragroup trauma causes paranoid-schizoid functioning to fragment, resulting in an intersubjective [...] "entanglement" [...] with sadomasochistic dynamics.|$|E
50|$|Neighbourhoods and {{communities}} provide {{the context for}} school violence. Communities with high rates of crime and drug use teach youth the violent behaviors that are carried into schools. Dilapidated housing in the neighbourhood of the school {{has been found to}} be associated with school violence. Teacher assault was more likely to occur in schools located in high-crime neighbourhoods. Exposure to deviant peers is a risk factor for high levels of <b>aggressivity.</b> Research has shown that poverty and high population densities are associated with higher rates of school violence. Well controlled longitudinal research indicates that children's exposure to community violence during the early elementary school years increases the risk of aggression later in elementary school, as reported by teachers and classmates. Other, well controlled longitudinal research that utilized propensity score matching indicates that exposure to gun violence in early adolescence is related to the initiation of serious physical violence in later adolescence. Neighbourhood gangs are thought to contribute to dangerous school environments. Gangs use the social environment of the school to recruit members and interact with opposing groups, with gang violence carrying over from neighbourhoods into some schools.|$|E

5000|$|At Pride 6, Matsui {{fought against}} future UFC Welterweight Champion and fan-favorite, Carlos Newton. In an {{entertaining}} fight, Matsui fended off increasingly difficult submission attempts from the Brazilian jiu-jitsu specialist and struck when possible, including a notable haymaker exchange {{at the end}} of the bout. However, Newton's superior control lost the fight by decision, handing the Japanese fighter his first professional loss via unanimous decision. Matsui fought again at Pride 7 against Dutch kickboxer [...] "Dirty" [...] Bob Schrijber, in a fight in which he performed impressively, holding his own against the striker and taking advantage of his superior wrestling skills. Controversy ensued when Matsui was punched in his face while being attended to by the referee because of a problem with his gloves. The two fighters exchanged heated words had to be prevented from brawling before the fight was continued. Matsui continued with renovated <b>aggressivity,</b> performing a takedown attempt which made Schrijber fall through the ropes and brutally land on a table ringside. Well after the bell marking the end of the first round sounded, Schrijber landed a powerful kick to the back of Matsui, who was still down on the ground. The foul immediately resulted in a disqualification win for Matsui, and the first win of his career.|$|E
