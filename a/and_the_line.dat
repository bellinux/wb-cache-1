Construction began in January 2011, on its own right-of-way parallel to the existing road;, the track was completed in October 2012.

5|$|During the 1890s, {{plans were}} made to extend the tramway to Oxford, but the scheme was abandoned. Instead, the {{operation}} of the line was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1899, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> became one of the railway's two north-western termini. It was upgraded and better-quality locomotives were introduced making the journey time three times faster.|$|E
5|$|On 10, 12 and 13 April, {{the lines}} {{held by the}} 104th Infantry in Bois Brule (near Apremont), and by the French to the left, were heavily {{attacked}} by the Germans. At first the enemy secured a foothold in some advanced trenches which were not strongly held, but sturdy counterattacks succeeded in driving the enemy out with serious losses, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was entirely re-established.|$|E

5|$|Passenger numbers fell {{during the}} 1960s, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> became {{economically}} unviable. Following a train crash in 1965, the owners closed {{the line at}} the end of September that year. The tunnel still exists, but no trace remains of the stations.|$|E
5|$|The Cuckoo Line closed {{shortly after}} the Hospital Railway. Hellingly station closed to {{passengers}} on 14June 1965, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> closed for goods traffic on 26April 1968. The station building complete with platform is now a private residence, and the Cuckoo Line trackbed was converted to the Cuckoo Trail long-distance footpath in 1990.

5|$|The canyon {{was finally}} {{bypassed}} completely with {{the completion of}} the Surf Line on August 12, 1888, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> through the canyon was relegated to branch line status. By 1900 it had been abandoned by AT Finally, the 1928 construction of Railroad Canyon Dam submerged the section of track between Elsinore and Perris beneath Railroad Canyon Lake (now known as Canyon Lake).|$|E

5|$|Work {{commenced}} {{again in}} 1933 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> opened on 10 October 1934. At first {{the line was}} built with double track from Frøen to Østhorn and single track to Sognsvann. Between 1937 and 1939, the upper section was converted to double track. The construction spurred a massive residential construction along the line giving a good foundation for ridership.|$|E
5|$|A fairly strong easterly {{wind had}} been blowing for three days; {{on the evening}} of the third day, the mosquitos arrived, flying high, about fifty feet, and looking like a cloud of mist over Carancahua Bay. At the ranch, they set {{everything}} on fire that had blood in it, and all work was suspended by unanimous consent...little or nothing was done for nearly five days; by this time the main body had passed, though plenty remained to make everything uncomfortable for about two weeks. This migration was from east to west <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was about three miles wide.|$|E

5|$|A new mineral venture was {{attempted}} in 1907, {{for which}} {{much of the}} line was re-opened and a -gauge extension was added, but this failed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> closed again in 1910. A section of the track {{was used to test}} and demonstrate an automatic signal warning device in 1911 and occasionally used in that connection up to 1914. The tracks were lifted for scrap in 1917, after which a light railway was laid on part of the trackbed in 1918 to carry timber. This ended in 1920 and the company was wound up in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Acting on MacArthur's instructions, General Walton Walker of the Eighth Army {{started the}} Home-by-Christmas Offensive at 10 a.m. on November 24, 1950. With a reconstituted ROK II Corps {{placed on the}} Eighth Army's right flank, the advance was led by the US I Corps to the west, US IX Corps in the center, and the ROK II Corps to the east. The three UN Corps {{advanced}} cautiously in a continuous front line {{in order to prevent}} more ambushes similar to the Chinese First Phase Campaign, but the lack of manpower stretched the UN forces to the limit. Except for the strong Chinese resistances against the ROK II Corps, the Eighth Army met little opposition, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> between Chongju to Yongwon was occupied {{on the night of the}} November 25.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{construction}} of the Bristol Portway along the Avon Gorge necessitated {{the closure of the}} line from Sneyd Park Junction to Hotwells, with trains along it ceasing on 3 July 1922. By this point there were nine trains per day from Hotwells, and eight return. To compensate for the loss of service, the Great Western provided an additional four trains daily from Avonmouth Dock to Bristol and six return. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. The engine shed was closed in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Although some {{preparatory work}} was carried out, the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to a halt. First class travel was abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman cars, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was operated entirely as a shuttle service. In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to autotrain working, in which the trains could be driven from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury passenger cars dating from 1898.|$|E
5|$|As {{reinforcements}} {{from the}} 9th Battalion began to arrive, Newland {{was able to}} repulse a third attack by the Germans. Reorganising the 9th and 12th Battalions, a combined counter-attack {{was able to be}} launched <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> recaptured by approximately 11:00. The 12th Battalion had suffered 125 casualties during the engagement, with 66 killed or missing. Whittle and Newland were both subsequently awarded a Victoria Cross for their actions that day; the pair were the only two permanent members of the Australian military to receive the decoration during the war.|$|E
5|$|At the start, {{there were}} {{one or two}} daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced {{as if they were the}} length of the road, and the price was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to operate with a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} {{most of the}} 3rd Brigade men had been killed or wounded, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was held by the five {{depleted}} companies from the 1st Brigade. On the left, Gordon's company 2nd Battalion, with the 11th and 12th Battalion's survivors, charged five times and captured the summit of Baby 700, but were driven back by Turkish counter-attacks; Gordon was among the casualties. For the second time Maclagen requested reinforcements for Baby 700, but the only reserves Bridges had available were two 2nd Battalion companies and the 4th Battalion. It was now 10:45 and the advance companies of the 1st New Zealand Brigade were disembarking, so it was decided {{they would go to}} Baby 700.|$|E
