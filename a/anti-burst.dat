40|$|Abstract: With the {{excavation}} depth increase, the bursting stabilization {{had become a}} major factor affecting the security of foundation pit. On the base of research situation about foundation pit stabilization {{and a large number}} engineering practices, the factors and the complexity that affected the stability of foundation pit were analyzed. The new ideas about mechanism and determining methods of bursting in foundation pit were proposed, that with the “hydraulic fracturing ” to explain the mechanism of bursting and the factors that affect the stability of foundation pit as a system to analyze the <b>anti-bursting</b> stability and the factors that affect bursting stability could be divided into two types, system strength and system stiffness...|$|R
50|$|In late 1967 (1968 model year), US-spec cars {{received}} several safety additions: a padded fascia (dashboard) with smaller main gauges, collapsible steering column, scissor-type hood hinges, a third windshield wiper, additional side marker lights, and <b>anti-burst</b> door latches. The rear axle gear ratio was increased from 4.22:1 to 3.9:1, giving 16.5 mph for every 1000 rpm. This increased {{final drive ratio}} gave the 1275 model slightly better fuel economy than the 1098 model.|$|E
40|$|A {{post-tensioned}} prestressed system basically {{consists of}} a high strength tendon or strand running through {{the length of the}} concrete structure. The strand is stressed using a hydraulic jack, the tensile stressing force of the strand is transferred into the concrete by the use of anchorages. One of the most critical aspects of post-tensioned construction, which is also necessary for the success of the system, is the "anchorage zone". The relatively large compressive forces generated from the strand are applied to the concrete over a small area. For this reason steel reinforcement known as <b>anti-burst</b> is used in the anchorage zone to control cracking caused by tensile forces {{as a result of the}} tensioning. Eight 150 mm thick 400 mm x 1000 mm post-tensioned concrete slabs with varying types of <b>anti-burst</b> reinforcements and two different concrete strengths were designed and tested to failure. Pull out tests were conducted at up to 95 % of the tendon's tensile strength to find out the most effective type of <b>anti-burst</b> reinforcement and the effect of variation in concrete strengths. The rectangular helices type was found to be the best performer while the higher concrete strength was the better. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringNo Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{limitations}} in complexity and scalability of current combined input and cross-point queuing switching scheduling policies are first analyzed. To overcome the deficiencies in supporting fair and QOS scheduling, we propose {{a fair and}} simple high-performance scheduling algorithm for Combined Input-Cross-point-Queued Switches, which is called Fair Service and Group Smoothed Round Robin (FGSR). The main idea of FGSR is that it first groups flows according to their weight, then decides which group to be scheduled by SRR and finally decides which flow from the selected group to be scheduled. FGSR is based on round robin mechanism, whose complexity is only O(1). FGSR groups and schedules flows according to the weight of flows, thus it has good fairness and can adapt to the need of real-time performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that FGSR exhibits good delay, throughput and <b>anti-burst</b> performance. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Scheduling {{policies}} are playing significant roles in guaranteeing {{the performance of}} core routing and switching devices. The limitations in complexities and extensibilities of current combined input and cross-point queueing switching fabric’s scheduling {{policies are}} first analyzed. Then, based on this analysis, the principle for designing high extensible scheduling policies {{and the concept of}} virtual channel are proposed. Based on the principle and virtual channel, it comes up with a dynamic round robin scheduling algorithm-FDR (fair service and dynamic round robin), which is simple, and of high efficiency and fair service. FDR is based on round robin mechanism, whose complexity is only O(1). It allocates the scheduling share for each virtual channel according to its current states, thus, FDR has good dynamic and real-time performance, and it can adapt to unbalanced traffic load network environment. Simulation results under SPES (switching performance evaluation system) show that FDR exhibits good delay, throughput and <b>anti-burst</b> performance.
