40|$|Groundwater {{management}} practices {{need to take}} hydrogeology, the agro-climate and demand for groundwater into account. Since <b>agroclimatic</b> zones have already been demarcated by the Government of India, it would aid policy makers to understand the status of groundwater recharge and discharge in each <b>agroclimatic</b> zone. However, developing effective policies to manage groundwater at <b>agroclimatic</b> zone and state levels is constrained due to a paucity of temporal data and information. With {{the launch of the}} Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission in 2002, it is now possible to obtain frequent data at broad spatial scales and use it to examine past trends in rain induced recharge and groundwater use. In this study, the GRACE data were used to estimate changes to monthly total water storage (TWS) and groundwater storage in different <b>agroclimatic</b> zones of Rajasthan, India. Furthermore, the long-term annual and seasonal groundwater storage trends in the state were estimated using the GRACE data and the trends were compared with those in rainfall data.

40|$|The recent warming trends {{have led}} to rising {{concerns}} on how the changing climate has been altering {{and will continue to}} alter <b>agroclimatic</b> conditions in China.

Uncertainties in the projected impacts of climate change on <b>agroclimatic</b> conditions are also discussed with respect to (1) RCM outputs for different emission scenarios, and (2) differences in projections obtained from two different RCMs under the same emission scenario.

Producers, however, {{do not know if}} their areas are {{suitable}} for its cultivation and so are not investing in its implementation. <b>Agroclimatic</b> zoning would provide guidance to the producers. Identifying potential areas for the production of this crop would thus contribute to the <b>agroclimatic</b> zoning of B. orellana in Minas Gerais. We collected data for air temperature and precipitation from 852 meteorological stations in the state to classify regions as suitable, marginally suitable, or unsuitable for the crop. Suitable regions had an air temperature between 22 and 27 °C and precipitation between 800 and 1600 mm. y- 1. Marginally suitable regions had an air temperature between 22 and 27 °C and precipitation less than 800 mm. y- 1. Unsuitable regions had air temperature less than 22 °C or greater than 27 °C.

40|$|Rice {{producers}} in the Philippines operate in different physical environments that are largely beyond their control, {{especially in terms of}} the <b>agroclimatic</b> conditions they face. Each rice area requires a unique set of location-specific technologies to match its location-specific needs. The rice production frontier is expected to vary, depending on the degree of yield-enhancing interventions implemented by the government and adopted by farmers. Understanding differences in specific production frontiers in different production systems should provide better assessments of yield performance across different locations and enable rice scientists to develop location-specific technologies as well as disseminate appropriate technologies to farmers in different climatic zones. A precise analysis of productive efficiencies, technology gaps and technical change among these zones may contribute to a more accurate targeting and effective design of the government’s rice program. We measure technical efficiencies and technological gaps in rice production for farmers in four <b>agroclimatic</b> zones in the Philippines who may employ different production technologies according to environmental conditions. Climatic zone 3 is considered most favourable for rice production based on the intensity and distribution patterns of rainfall. A stochastic metafrontier function is used to compare mean technical efficiency and the environmental and technological gap ratio (ETGR) across climatic zones. We estimated four regional stochastic frontiers using the standard stochastic frontier model based on a translog functional form. A deterministic metafrontier production function was then fitted to the regional frontiers. Farm-level panel data were used from a three-round survey covering six cropping periods – the wet seasons of 1996, 2001 and 2006 and the dry seasons of 1997, 2002 and 2007. Results show surprisingly little interzonal variation in productivity. First, the production frontiers are quite stable across the different <b>agroclimatic</b> zones. The mean ETGR is quite high in all zones and varies in a narrow range from 0. 83 to 0. 87. Farmers operating in <b>agroclimatic</b> zone 3 are the most productive group followed by those operating in <b>agroclimatic</b> zone 2. Mean technical efficiencies of farmers in respect of their group frontiers are also closely grouped, ranging from 0. 74 to 0. 76.
