25|$|Several of Ayckbourn's {{observations}} about celebrity culture have obvious influences in the play. One notable quote was his opinion that a dangerous mistake celebrities can make is to believe <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> said about them, both in publicity and {{what other people}} (particularly agents) say. He also suggested that {{in an age of}} increasing anonymity, some are increasingly desperate to be noticed. The play also follows the theory that when one quickly rises to the top, one can fall just as quickly and mercilessly.|$|E

500|$|Navy {{athletic}} director Chet Gladchuk stated that Maryland's snub {{was the basis}} for their rejection of Maryland offers to renew the series in 2010: [...] "The stage was set for everything we had talked about, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> that could have happened for fans—a big rematch, a bowl setting, a great city ... It would have been a sellout in Charlotte, and they decided to do something else. That has caused us to pause a little bit and think through the whole relationship." [...] Ralph Friedgen responded by saying [...] "He's gotta get over it," [...] and that the Navy rivalry never entered into the decision-making process.|$|E
500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{gave it a}} [...] "fresh" [...] 95% {{approval}} rating, {{based on}} 43 reviews and Metacritic gave it a 73, signifying [...] "generally favorable reviews". Many focused on the film's ending title cards: several compared them to a public service announcement, and Philip Kemp of Sight & Sound wrote, [...] "All that's missing is the address we should send donations to." [...] Zhang Xiaoling, on the other hand, considered the titles to be an implicit criticism {{of the state of}} rural education in China, saying, [...] "the news that voluntary contributions have helped 15 percent of the pupils to return to school is aimed to give rise to a question: what about the remaining 85 percent?" [...] The disagreement about the title cards is also reflected in the critical reaction {{to the rest of the}} film's resolution. Kemp described the ending as [...] "feelgood" [...] and criticized the film for portraying officials and generous cityfolk as coming to the rescue, The Washington Posts Desson Howe called the ending [...] "flag-waving", and The Independents Gilbert Adair called it [...] "sugary". Alberto Barbera of the Venice Film Festival, on the other hand, said that while the end of the film may have been like propaganda, the rest was a [...] "strong denunciation of a regime that is unable to assure proper education for the country children". Likewise, Zhang Xiaoling argued that although the film superficially appears to praise the city people and officials, its subtext is harshly critical of them: he pointed out that the apparently benevolent TV station manager seems to be motivated more by audience ratings than by altruism, that the receptionist's callous manner towards Wei is a result of Chinese [...] "bureaucratism and nepotism", and that for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> about the city, Zhang Huike's clearest memory of city life is having to beg for food. Zhang and Kraicer both argued that critics who see the film as pro-government propaganda are missing the point and, as Kraicer put it, [...] "mistaking [...] layer as the message of the film... mistaking the part for the whole". David Ansen of Newsweek and Leigh Paatsch of the Herald Sun each pointed out that, while the film is [...] "deceptive" [...] positive at face value, it has harsh criticism [...] "bubbling under the surface". Chinese critics Liu Xinyi and Xu Su of Movie Review recognized the dispute abroad over whether the film was pro- or anti-government, but made no comment; they praised the film for its realistic portrayal of hardships facing rural people, without speculating about whether Zhang intended to criticize or praise the government's handling of those hardships. Hao Jian of Film Appreciation, on the other hand, was more critical, claiming that the movie was organized around a political message and was intended to be pro-government. Hao said that Not One Less marked the beginning of Zhang's transformation from an outspoken independent director to one of the government's favorites.|$|E

They, along with the WFM's Bill Haywood and others, were instrumental in launching the Western Labor Union, which soon became the American Labor Union, which in 1905 {{led the way to}} the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Boyce proclaimed that labor must [...] "abolish the wage system which is more destructive of human rights and liberty than any other slave system devised", and the IWW later echoed his words in its Preamble.

40|$|In June 2002, AIC will {{celebrates its}} 30 thannual meeting. By almost any measure-ment, {{this is a}} milestone. Not much {{more than thirty years}} ago, those of us not yet thirty were warned not to trust anyone over the age of thirty. “Thirty ” {{generally}} meant “washed-up ” or certainly “over the hill,” especially from those looking up from a decade or more away. In hindsight, such admonitions were really as much acknowledgments of the changes in responsibilities that come with age as they were declarations against a particular view-point or gain in years. Thirty years conveys longevity with a concomitant level of matu-rity and wisdom. For individuals, that may mean settling down in a relationship or job, building a family or career, making a large financial commitment to something like a new car or mortgage, or simply beginning to have a clearer view of how you see yourself in the world. And like any individual approaching a significant decade marker, it behooves us as an organization to also reflect on how far we have traveled before thinking about <b>all</b> <b>the</b> new <b>good</b> <b>things</b> we will do.
