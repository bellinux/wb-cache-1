Results revealed that (a) schoolchildren with reactive-proactive aggression have the highest <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> provoked aggression, the highest <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> unprovoked aggression, and the lowest <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> weakness; (b) schoolchildren with proactive aggression have higher <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> unprovoked aggression and lower <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> weakness than reactive aggressors; and (c) schoolchildren without aggression have the lowest <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> provoked aggression, the lowest <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> unprovoked aggression, and the highest <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> weakness.

40|$|Abstract The {{attendance}} {{of the demand}} for freight transport {{is related to the}} process of allocation <b>of</b> the <b>wagons</b> that in turn is associated with {{the way in which the}} decision is taken. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> to the shipment terminals depends on the planning as well as on movement <b>of</b> the empty <b>wagons.</b> In addition, the trips <b>of</b> the empty <b>wagons</b> have the major financial impact on the railroad system. In such a way, an efficient mechanism <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> distribution is vital to the railroads, because it provides important operational profits and of costs. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the problem related to the distribution <b>of</b> the load <b>wagons</b> and to develop a mathematical model that can propose an optimal scheduling <b>of</b> the <b>wagons...</b>|$|R

The running smoothness <b>of</b> the freight <b>wagon</b> is evaluated considering the parameters of vibrations and the oscillation process. During the process <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> running on the track, the forced oscillations {{of the elements of}} the body, chassis and suspension are excited. Four-axle freight wagon movement down the track taking into account the given vertical and lateral irregularities has been simulated using software package “Universal Mechanism”. The dependencies of the oscillation amplitudes <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> body on track irregularities and vertical and lateral suspension settings have been defined. The dependencies <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> suspension settings and derailment stability on changes in the wagon mass have been examined in the paper. Finally, basic conclusions have been given...|$|R

40|$|The article {{assesses the}} {{contributions}} of FlexCargoRail for enhancement <b>of</b> single <b>wagon</b> transport, makes calculation for economic efficiency and derives recommendations for further research in single wagon transport. FlexCargoRail can enhance flexibility <b>of</b> single <b>wagon</b> transport due to the possibility for shunting without a shunting engine. Just-in-time delivery to the loading place is possible from a central point of the siding. A target-costing calculation is made to identify maximum of possible investment cost for each FCR wagon. The maximum investment depends on the number <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> uses per year {{and the rate of}} FCR and conventional (not propelled) Wagons. Critical is to reduce time <b>of</b> circulation <b>of</b> <b>wagons.</b> This leads to conception of direct trains between sidings or regional bundling sites, For this a calculation for minimum number <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> for cost savings of direct trains in comparison with single wagon transport is made.
