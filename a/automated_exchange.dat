25|$|When a {{subscriber}} {{dialed the}} number of a manual station, an operator at the destination office answered the call after seeing the number on an indicator, and connected the call by plugging a cord into the outgoing circuit and ringing the destination station. For example, if a dial customer calling from TAylor 4725 dialed a number served by a manual exchange, e.g., ADams 1383-W, the call was completed, from the subscriber’s perspective, exactly as a call to LEnnox 5813, in an <b>automated</b> <b>exchange.</b> The party line letters W, R, J, and M were only used in manual exchanges with jack-per-line party lines.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{literature}} {{has suggested that}} <b>automated</b> <b>exchanges</b> such as the Deutsche Termin-borse (DTB) may be less liquid than their open-outcry counterparts such as the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE), although evidence provided on this issue has been mixed. This paper provides new evidence on the relative magnitudes of bid-ask spreads in the Bund contract traded on the DTB and LIFFE using intraday data from {{a period in which}} each exchanges share of total Bund trading was closer than previous research. The findings suggest that quoted bid-ask spreads are wider on the LIFFE than the DTB, even after controlling for their determinants. Furthermore, bid-ask spreads on the DTB increase more rapidly as price volatility increases relative to the LIFFE. Overall, this evidence implies that while <b>automated</b> <b>exchanges</b> are capable of providing more liquidity than floor traded exchanges, the relative performance of <b>automated</b> <b>exchanges</b> deteriorates during periods of higher volatility. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.

5000|$|Automated trading {{systems are}} often used with {{electronic}} trading in automated market centers, including electronic communication networks, [...] "dark pools", and <b>automated</b> <b>exchanges.</b> <b>Automated</b> trading systems and electronic trading platforms can execute repetitive tasks at speeds with orders of magnitude greater than any human equivalent. Traditional risk controls and safeguards that relied on human judgment are not appropriate for automated trading and this has caused {{issues such as the}} 2010 Flash Crash.

50|$|CATS (Computer Assisted Trading System) was an <b>automated</b> <b>exchange</b> system {{developed}} by the Toronto Stock Exchange. It went live on November 18, 1977, with 90 stocks. CATS was introduced, piloted and {{developed by}} Harold B. Hofmann, then the Vice President of Operations at the Toronto Stock Exchange. CATS {{was one of the}} first technologies allowing for a full automation of the price-setting process in a stock exchange. This technology was implemented in several other stock exchanges in the 1980s. In some cases, it was used as an assistance to open-outcry, but in others it allowed for a full dismantlement of the open-outcry institution. The Paris Bourse purchased this system in the early 1980s and implemented it as CAC (Cotation Assistée en Continu).|$|E

50|$|North Korea has an {{adequate}} telephone system, with 1.18 million fixed lines available in 2008. However, most phones are only installed for senior government officials. Someone wanting a phone installed must {{fill out a}} form indicating their rank, why he wants a phone, and how he will pay for it. Most of these are installed in government offices, collective farms, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with only perhaps 10 percent controlled by individuals or households.By 1970 automatic switching facilities were in use in Pyongyang, Sinŭiju, Hamhŭng, and Hyesan. A few public telephone booths were beginning to appear in Pyongyang around 1990. In the mid-1990s, an <b>automated</b> <b>exchange</b> system based on an E-10Asystem produced by Alcatel joint-venture factories in China was installed in Pyongyang. North Koreans announced in1997 that automated switching had replaced manual switching in Pyongyang and 70 other locales. North Korean press reported in 2000 that fiber-optic cable had been extended to the port of Nampho and that North Pyong'an Province had been connected with fiber-optic cable.|$|E
50|$|In {{telephone}} systems where {{calls from}} distant <b>automated</b> <b>exchanges</b> arrive for manual subscribers or non-dialable points, there often {{would be a}} ringdown operator (reachable from the distant operator console by dialling NPA+181) who would manually ring the desired subscriber on a party line or toll station. On some systems, this function {{was carried out by}} the inward operator (NPA+121). In both cases, this is a telephone operator at the destination who provides assistance solely to other operators on inbound toll calls; the ringdown operator nominally cannot be dialled directly by the subscriber.|$|R

By 1987, Timber Hill had 67 {{employees}} {{and had become}} self-clearing in equities. In 1987, the CBOE was about to close down its S&P 500 options market due to the options not attracting sufficient trader interest. Because of this, Peterffy pledged that Timber Hill would make tight markets in the product for a year if the exchange would allow the traders to use handheld computers on the trading floor. The exchange agreed, and more traders were attracted by the change in pricing; today S&P 500 options are the most actively traded index options in the U.S. In 1990, Timber Hill Deutschland GmbH was incorporated in Germany, and shortly thereafter began trading equity derivatives at the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), marking {{the first time that}} Timber Hill used one of its trading systems on a fully <b>automated</b> <b>exchange.</b> In 1992, Timber Hill began trading at the Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange, which merged with DTB in 1998 to become Eurex.
