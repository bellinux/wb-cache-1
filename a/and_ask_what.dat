5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra for the first time <b>and</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>what</b> is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
25|$|Irving was {{promoted}} to colonel in February 1943, and had 20,000 women serving under her when the AWAS reached its peak strength in 1944. At {{the end of the}} war she encouraged AWAS members to undertake further training to find jobs in the civilian labour force, but only a small proportion of servicewomen did so. Irving left the Army in January 1947 when the AWAS was disbanded. She later wrote to all her former officers to inquire after their welfare <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> they were doing in the post-war world.|$|E
25|$|The ADA {{provides}} explicit {{coverage for}} service animals. Guidelines {{have been developed}} not only to protect persons with disabilities, but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> tasks it is trained to perform, {{but they are not}} allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special ID of the animal. They can not ask what the person's disabilities are. A person with a disability can not be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen: the animal is out of control and its owner can not get it under control (e.g. a dog barking uncontrollably in a restaurant), or the animal is a direct threat to people's health and safety. Allergies and fear of animal would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety so {{it would not be a}} valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premise. In this case, businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals nor do they have to provide a designated area for the service animal to use the bathroom. Lastly, people that require service dogs can not be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly. For example, being isolated from people at a restaurant. People with disabilities can not be treated less than other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, the customer with a disability will be charged for his/her service animal's damages to the property.|$|E

500|$|After {{spending}} {{the early part}} of his career naming his songs with random words, he decided to use more personal titles. [...] "As Serious as Your Life" [...] takes its name from a 1977 Val Wilmer book about free jazz in New York City. Hebden was given a copy of the book by his father and said [...] "I did hope that some kid would get interested <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> the title was and then check out the book, so it's a bit like leaving little trails for people." [...] He was inspired to title the album Rounds after hearing that his sister had been singing a musical round, telling an interviewer: [...] "It seemed totally relevant; a round is all about repetition and phasing, which is the essence of what I've been doing since I've been making music." ...|$|E
500|$|Amy Benfer of Salon.com {{wrote in}} 2010 that, {{according}} to figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnancy rates for all teenagers dropped 2 percent between 2007 and 2008, meaning that [...] "the slight uptick in teen pregnancy rates between 2005 and 2006 were probably just an anomaly and not some heinous trend brought about by pop culture", and that {{if there had been}} {{such a thing as a}} [...] "Juno effect", it would have caused pregnancies to go down, not up. She criticized proponents of the theory, stating that they believed that teenagers [...] "somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman's particular situation, and instead make some sort of primitive cause-and-effect connection" [...] and that [...] "by talking about pregnant girls, and most of all, by daring to portray some of them as ordinary, even likable, we'd get way more babies having babies." [...] She concluded that [...] "depicting teen parents may not glamorize them, so much as humanize them. You know, that thing that happens when one person recognizes that someone else is a person too? So, now that we can firmly state that realistically depicting the lives of the tiny percentage of girls who do become pregnant won't necessarily contaminate the rest of them, it's time to stop worrying <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> we can do to help." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When it is asked, What is {{the nature}} of all our reasonings {{concerning}} matter of fact? the proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked, What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation? it may be replied in one word, experience. But if we still carry on our sifting humor, <b>and</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>What</b> is the foundation of all conclusions from experience? this implies a new question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication." [...] (Hume 1974:328) ...|$|E

2500|$|But now, we may ask, how {{are these}} 'consequences' {{to test the}} 'truth' claimed by the assertion? Only by {{satisfying}} or thwarting that purpose, by forwarding or baffling that interest. If they do the one, the assertion is 'good' and pro tanto 'true' if they do the other, 'bad' and 'false'. Its 'consequences,' therefore, when investigated, always turn out to involve the 'practical' predicates 'good ' or 'bad,' and to contain a reference to ' practice' in {{the sense in which}} we have used that term. So soon as therefore we go beyond an abstract statement of the narrower pragmatism, <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> in the concrete, and in actual knowing, 'having consequences ' may mean, we develop inevitably the fullblown pragmatism in the wider sense.|$|E
2500|$|At his {{memorial}} service Leikny Øgrim told {{of growing up}} with a big brother who would read the dictionary {{from beginning to end}} and who from reading even the telephone book could learn something to relate to acquaintances. Douglas Draper, secretary of the Norwegian Esperanto League, also delivered a short talk on behalf of the NEL, by turns bantering and earnest. He said there were three kinds of Esperantists. There were active members engaged in management and organizational duties. There were passive members satisfied with paying their dues. Then there was Tron Øgrim. It might happen that for long periods the NEL would hear nothing from him; then he would telephone to ask: [...] "Skylder jeg noe gryn?" [...] ("Do I owe any groats?"—i.e., membership dues.) He might show up at the NEL office in Oslo and purchase not one or two books, but a whole load. While most Esperantists would plan their trips to major Esperanto congresses more than six months in advance, Tron might call up three days {{before the start of the}} event <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> he could do to help out.|$|E

6000|$|... "It isn't fair to {{come here}} <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> you're asking. You don't know what's {{in the future for}} you, you don't know that you can keep a wife. It isn't pleasant, either, to think you can't hold up your head in your own country." ...|$|E
