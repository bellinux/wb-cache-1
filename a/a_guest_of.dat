5|$|Anderson's {{return to}} Germany {{generated}} press interest, and drew more {{members of the}} German aristocracy to her cause. She again lived itinerantly as <b>a</b> <b>guest</b> <b>of</b> her well-wishers. In 1932, the British tabloid News of the World published a sensational story accusing her of being a Romanian actress who was perpetrating a fraud. Her lawyer, Fallows, filed suit for libel, but the lengthy case continued until the outbreak of World War II, at which time the case was dismissed because Anderson was living in Germany, and German residents could not sue in enemy countries. From 1938, lawyers acting for Anderson in Germany contested {{the distribution of the}} Tsar's estate to his recognized relations, and they in turn contested her identity. The litigation continued intermittently without resolution for decades; Lord Mountbatten footed some of his German relations' legal bills against Anderson. The protracted proceedings became the longest-running lawsuit in German history.|$|E
5|$|At {{the inauguration}} on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai was <b>a</b> <b>guest</b> <b>of</b> honour, {{which was a}} signal for much closer {{cooperation}} {{between the two nations}} in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the capital gains tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as President.|$|E
5|$|But {{in early}} August, Holmes à Court {{contacted}} Jackson and talks resumed.

He also agreed to visit Australia as <b>a</b> <b>guest</b> <b>of</b> Holmes à Court and appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Holmes à Court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in Jackson's name at a U.S. university. Branca closed the deal and purchased ATV Music on Jackson's behalf for $47.5million on August 10. 1985. In October 1985, Jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit Perth, Western Australia and appear on the telethon, where he spoke briefly and met with two children.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to Romania on an official visit in late 1946-early 1947, {{as part of}} a tour of the emerging Eastern Bloc during which he also stopped in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. The speeches he and Sașa Pană gave on the occasion, published by Orizont journal, were noted for condoning official positions of the PCF and the Romanian Communist Party, and are credited by Irina Livezeanu with causing a rift between Tzara and young Romanian avant-gardists such as Victor Brauner and Gherasim Luca (who rejected communism and were alarmed by the Iron Curtain having fallen over Europe). In September of the same year, he was present at the conference of the pro-communist International Union of Students (where he was <b>a</b> <b>guest</b> <b>of</b> the French-based Union of Communist Students, and met with similar organizations from Romania and other countries).|$|E

5|$|Some monastic cells, {{thought to}} belong to the friary, survive under the Red Lodge, which had its origins as a {{prospect}} house for the prior of Whitefriars. This building became the lodge house of an Elizabethan mansion, the Great House, built in the late 16th century by John Young, who had bought the friary from Bristol Corporation after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The Great House was where Elizabeth I stayed, as <b>a</b> <b>guest</b> <b>of</b> John Young, in 1574. In the 18th century, the house was acquired by Edward Colston, who established the original Colston's School there. After the school moved to Stapleton in 1857, the Colston Hall Society purchased the premises, and demolished the house to build the Colston Hall, which now occupies the site. Excavations during the building of the adjacent Colston House in the early 20th century found medieval walls, burials and floor tiles.|$|E
