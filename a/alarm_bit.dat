40|$|An optimal {{power and}} bit {{allocation}} scheme for rate maximization in the ultra wideband (UWB) cognitive radio system {{is presented in}} this paper. The scheme generates a series of M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) zones over each UWB subcarrier. Total transmit power is optimally distributed among the UWB subcarriers {{for the use of}} the M-QAM modulation with a maximum M on each subcarrier. This optimization is constrained by the probability of detection, probability of false <b>alarm,</b> <b>bit</b> error rate and the UWB transmit power spectral density mask. The performance of the scheme is analyzed over different UWB fading channels. The results show that the system data rate is significantly improved by using the proposed power and bit allocation scheme. JRC. DG. G. 6 -Security technology assessmen...|$|E

5000|$|In any of {{the groups}} {{containing}} the FAS in the 8, 34, and 140 Mbit/s frames, <b>alarm</b> <b>bits</b> and spare bits are also to be found. These are known as service <b>bits.</b> The A-bits (<b>alarm)</b> carry an alarm indication to the remote multiplexing device, when certain breakdown conditions are detected in the near-end device. The spare bits are designed for national use, and must be set to [...] "1" [...] in digital paths that cross international boundaries.|$|R

50|$|A {{rumor has}} it that the song was {{influenced}} by an experience Anastasio and Fishman had while swimming in the Mediterranean, and Fishman got a bit too far out to sea. Anastasio was a <b>bit</b> <b>alarmed,</b> and the main introduction to the song was composed as a consequence.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. BIT {{is a new}} {{technology}} about the system test, fault diagnosing and separating. It is {{more important in the}} design for the reliability and main tainability of system. The key technique, such as the fault tree and equation, the test location, the test signal picking and generating, the fault distinguish rule, the design of preventing error <b>alarm</b> and <b>BIT</b> software. The result showed that the key technology is useful, and the reliability, maintainability and ability of management to fault can be increased by means of BIT. The debugging of system becomes convenient. The method can be used in the system of intelligent-in-strument and industrial control computer...|$|R
2500|$|No fault found (NFF) is a {{term used}} {{in the field of}} maintenance, where a unit is removed from service {{following}} a complaint of a perceived fault by operators or an <b>alarm</b> from its <b>BIT</b> (built-in test) equipment. [...] The unit is then checked, but no anomaly is detected by the maintainer. Consequently, the unit is returned to service with no repair performed.|$|R

40|$|Design, Experimentation, Measurement, PerformanceInternational audienceA 60 GHz {{wireless}} Gigabit Ethernet (G. E.) {{communication system}} is developed at IETR. As the 60 GHz radio link operates {{only in a}} single-room configuration, an additional Radio over Fibre (RoF) link is used to ensure the communications in all the rooms of a residential environment. The realized system covers 2 GHz bandwidth. Due to the hardware constraints, a symbol rate at 875 Mbps is attained using simple single carrier architecture. In the baseband (BB) processing block, an original byte/frame synchronization process {{is designed to provide}} a smaller value of the preamble missing detection and false <b>alarm</b> probabilities. <b>Bit</b> error rate (BER) measurements have been realized in a large gym for line-of-sight (LOS) conditions.

50|$|With {{regards to}} active defense, attraction, landing, buzzing and angular flights are typical <b>alarm</b> behaviors. <b>Biting</b> {{is also a}} {{prominent}} form of defense among T. fuscipennis bees and they make use of their strong, sharp 5-toothed mandibles. Trigona fuscipennis bees have been discovered to engage in suicidal biting in order to defend the nest and against predators. Humans standing {{in the vicinity of}} nests are almost always attacked and experience painful bites. The bees also crawl over the intruder into the ears, eye, mouth, and other cavities. The Trigona workers give a painful and persistent bite, are difficult to remove, and usually die during the attack. They have long durations of the attacks as well, with one recorded at 51 minutes and 45 seconds. Trigona bees also have the most painful bites as compared to Partamona helleri, Scaptotrigona depilis, Tetragona clavipes, Tetragonisca angustula, Frieseomelitta varia, Melipona scutellaris, Melipona quadrifasciata, and Melipona rufiventris.|$|R

Much remains to be done, though, and some of it will be difficult. Are we ready for what comes next? What needs to be done in terms of strategic effort now? What will it take from those who believe Open Access is the right way forward? And are we up to it? If this all sounds a <b>bit</b> <b>alarming,</b> please don't leave the conference early in fright!

60|$|In this Browning is, of course, {{the supreme}} {{embodiment}} of his time. The {{characteristic of the}} modern movements par excellence is the apotheosis of the insignificant. Whether it be the school of poetry which sees more in one cowslip or clover-top than in forests and waterfalls, or the school of fiction which finds something indescribably significant {{in the pattern of}} a hearth-rug, or the tint of a man's tweed coat, the tendency is the same. Maeterlinck stricken still and wondering by a deal door half open, or the light shining out of a window at night; Zola filling note-books with the medical significance of the twitching of a man's toes, or the loss of his appetite; Whitman counting the grass and the heart-shaped leaves of the lilac; Mr. George Gissing lingering fondly over the third-class ticket and the dilapidated umbrella; George Meredith seeing a soul's tragedy in a phrase at the dinner-table; Mr. Bernard Shaw filling three pages with stage directions to describe a parlour; all these men, different in every other particular, are alike in this, that they have ceased to believe certain things to be important and the rest to be unimportant. Significance is to them a wild thing that may leap upon them from any hiding-place. They have all become terribly impressed with and a little <b>bit</b> <b>alarmed</b> at the mysterious powers of small things. Their difference from the old epic poets is the whole difference between an age that fought with dragons and an age that fights with microbes.|$|R
