25|$|Usage of {{emergency}} vehicle lighting is restricted in the United Kingdom through the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989. It is illegal for any vehicle {{to show a}} flashing colored light (with {{the exception of the}} normal direction indicators or a green <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brake</b> warning indicator), unless it is an emergency or other authorized vehicle. However recently pedal cycles can exhibit a flashing rear red lamp and flashing white front lamp.|$|E
50|$|A {{much more}} {{successful}} system was {{to fit the}} tractor with <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes.</b> Fitted originally to airplanes in the 1950s, <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> have significantly {{reduced the number of}} heavy vehicle accidents.|$|R
50|$|No changes. A {{version of}} the S Bandit with <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> was {{introduced}} for certain world markets. The 1997 ABS (<b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system) 1200 Bandit used a 114 link chain {{as opposed to the}} standard 110 link chain.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{simulation of}} integrated controller of vehicle <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system, {{which consists of}} the traditional continuous PID and finite state machine theory. Based on the integrated controller, slip ratio and deceleration are selected as the main control parameters to optimize ABS. Vehicle speed, wheel speed, braking distance, pressure state and slip ratio are investigate to reveal the performance of <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system. Single-wheel system is studied in this paper {{to prove that the}} controller can effectively reduce braking distance and time and also can improve the stability of <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system, which can provide a guideline to the design of <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system.

25|$|In 1958, a Royal Enfield Super Meteor {{motorcycle}} {{was used}} by the Road Research Laboratory to test the Maxaret <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brake.</b> The experiments demonstrated that anti-lock brakes can be of great value to motorcycles, for which skidding is involved in a high proportion of accidents. Stopping distances were reduced in most of the tests compared with locked wheel braking, particularly on slippery surfaces, in which the improvement could be as much as 30percent. Enfield's technical director at the time, Tony Wilson-Jones, saw little future in the system, however, and it was not put into production by the company.|$|E
25|$|ESC {{is built}} {{on top of an}} <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brake</b> system, and all ESC-equipped {{vehicles}} are fitted with traction control. The ESC components include a yaw rate sensor, a lateral acceleration sensor, a steering wheel sensor, and an upgraded integrated control unit. In the US, Federal regulations require that ESC be installed as a standard feature on all passenger cars and light trucks as of the 2012 model year. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration research, ABS in 2005 cost an estimated US$368; ESC cost a further US$111. The retail price of ESC varies; as a stand-alone option it retails for as little as $250 USD. ESC was once rarely offered as a sole option, and was generally not available for aftermarket installation. Instead, it was frequently bundled with other features or more expensive trims, so the cost of a package that included ESC was several thousand dollars. Nonetheless, ESC is considered highly cost-effective and it might pay for itself in reduced insurance premiums.|$|E

All Mustang GT and Convertibles came with a rear sway bar with white links during these years; the bar diameter varied with options and was 18mm, 19mm, 20mm, or 22.4mm.

2500|$|On February 9, 2010, Toyota {{announced}} a voluntary global recall of third generation 2010 Prius models manufactured {{from the current}} model's introduction through late January. Affected models, including 133,000 Prius vehicles in the U.S. and 52,000 in Europe, are to receive an <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brake</b> software update to fix brake response over rough roads, following reports of delayed braking response on certain surface conditions. Apple co-founder and Prius collector Steve Wozniak was also quoted by media outlets regarding a possible cruise control issue {{on one of his}} several Priuses, where the steps for [...] "upping the speed" [...] using the Dynamic Radar Cruise Control system allegedly caused unintended acceleration. Wozniak later maintained that he was misquoted, but did have an individual vehicle and customer service issue, while auto journalists and other Prius drivers suggested user error. On March 8, 2010, a publicized incident of alleged Prius acceleration in San Diego was later suspected to be a hoax or not repeatable. The manufacturer shared that 713,000 Prius in North America, 997,000 in Japan, another 130,000 in Europe and the rest in other regions are being recalled.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2012, General Atomics {{released}} a new trailing arm {{design for the}} Reaper's main landing gear; benefits include an over 30 percent increase in landing weight capacity, a 12 percent increase in gross takeoff weight (from [...] to [...] ), a maintenance-free shock absorber (eliminating the need for nitrogen pressurization), a fully rejected takeoff brake system, and provisions for automatic takeoff and landing capability and <b>Anti-lock</b> <b>Brake</b> System (ABS) field upgrades. In April 2012, General Atomics announced possible upgrades to USAF Reapers, including two extra [...] fuel pods under the wings to increase endurance to 37 hours. The wingspan can also be increased to , increasing endurance to 42 hours. The USAF has bought 38 Reaper Extended Range (ER) versions, carrying external fuel tanks (which don't affect weapon capacity), the heavy-weight landing gear, a four-bladed propeller, a new fuel management system which ensures fuel and thermal balance among external tank, wing, and fuselage fuel sources, and an alcohol water injection (AWI) system to shorten required runway takeoff length; these features increase endurance from 27 to 33â€“35 hours, while the company is still pitching the lengthened wing option. The Reaper ER first flew operationally in August 2015. The aircraft also has the sensor ball replaced with a high-definition camera, better communications so ground controllers can see the higher quality video, software to enable automatic detection of threats and tracking of 12 moving targets at once, {{and the ability to}} [...] "super ripple" [...] fire missiles within 0.32 seconds of each other.|$|E

50|$|An actuary may {{refer to}} risk homeostasis, where (for example) {{people who have}} <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> have no better safety record than those without <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes,</b> because the former unconsciously {{compensate}} for the safer vehicle via less-safe driving habits. Previous to the innovation of <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes,</b> certain maneuvers involved minor skids, evoking fear and avoidance: Now the anti-lock system moves the boundary for such feedback, and behavior patterns expand into the no-longer punitive area. It has also been suggested that ecological crises are an instance of risk homeostasis in which a particular behavior continues until proven dangerous or dramatic consequences actually occur.|$|R

2500|$|In North America, Westinghouse Air Brake {{supplied}} High Speed Control {{brake equipment}} for several post-World War II streamlined passenger trains. [...] This was an electrically controlled overlay on conventional D-22 passenger and 24-RL locomotive brake equipment. [...] On the conventional side, {{the control valve}} set a reference pressure in a volume, which set brake cylinder pressure via a relay valve. On the electric side, pressure from a second straight-air trainline controlled the relay valve via a two-way check valve. This [...] "straight air" [...] trainline was charged (from reservoirs on each car) and released by magnet valves on each car, controlled electrically by a 3 wire trainline, in turn controlled by an [...] "electro-pneumatic master controller" [...] in the controlling locomotive.

[...] Each axle was also equipped with <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brake</b> equipment. [...] The combination minimized braking distances, allowing more full-speed running between stops.
