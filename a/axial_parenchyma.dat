Wood species studied include: ketapang (Terminalia complanata K. Schum.); pala hutan (Gymnacranthera paniculata (A. DC.) Warb.); bipa (Pterygota horsfieldii (R. Br.) Kosterm).; kelumpang (Sterculia shillinglawii F. Muell.); manggis/kandis (Pentaphalangium parviflorum); and lancat/lebani (Mastixiodendron pachyclados (K. Schum) Melch.). Anatomical properties were observed according to IAWA (International Association of Wood Anatomists) checklist. The anatomical main properties observed in ketapang wood were vestured pits, prismatic crystals in non-chambered <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells, and druses. Pala hutan main anatomical properties were the presence of tannin tubes and oil cells which were associated with <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> Prismatic crystals in <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells, and rays of two distinct sizes were two main anatomical characteristics of bipa and kelumpang wood. Prismatic crystals in chambered <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells was one of characteristics of manggis wood. Vestured pits and scanty paratracheal parenchyma were two main characteristics of lancat wood. For identification pur poses, bipa wood could be distinguished by banded parenchyma; polygonal alternate pits; and prismatic crystals in non- chambered <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells...|$|E

40|$|The {{variation}} in wood anatomy within 30 hardwood species, {{each with a}} distribution covering both rain forest and savanna areas of the Ivory Coast, Africa, has been studied. Compared to specimens from the rain forest, material from the savanna tends to have more wood ray tissue (rays are higher, wider, and more numerous) and slightly more vessel tissue (vessels are more numerous and wider, although they are often composed of shorter vessel members).

40|$|The {{secondary}} xylem of Craterispermeae, Coussareeae, Morindeae s. str., Prismatomerideae, Pauridiantheae, Urophylleae, and Triainolepideae (Rubiaceae, Rubioideae) is described and illustrated in detail. Genera {{that were previously}} placed in the Morindeae or Psychotrieae such as Damnacanthus, Lasianthus, Saldinia, and Trichosfachys are also included. Wood anatomical characters are compared with recent phylogenetic insights into the study group {{on the basis of}} molecular data. The observations demonstrate that the delimitation and separation of several taxa from the former Coussareeae/Morindeae/Prismatomerideae/Psychotrieae aggregate is supported by wood anatomical data. The Coussareeae can be distinguished from the other Rubioideae by their scanty parenchyma, septate libriform fibres, and the combination of uniseriate and very high multiseriate rays with sheath cells. <b>Axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> bands and fibre-tracheids characterise Gynochtodes and some species of Morinda (Morindeae sstr.), but the latter genus is variable with respect to several features (e. g. vessel groupings and <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> distribution). Wood data support separation of Rennelia and Prismatomeris from Morindeae s. str.; vessels in both genera are exclusively solitary and <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> is always diffuse to diffuse-in-aggregates. Damnacanthus differs from the Morindeae alliance by the occurrence of septate fibres, absence of <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> and the occasional presence of fibre wall thickenings. There are interesting similarities between members of the Lasianfhus clade and the Pauridiantheae/Urophyleae group such as the sporadic occurrence of spiral thickenings in <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells...|$|E
30|$|By {{contrast}} to the above observations, there were no clear variations in the autofluorescence of cell walls of <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells in LH- 1 samples (Fig.  5 b). However, we did observe the disappearance of starch grains from <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells during cell death (Fig.  4 e). It has been suggested that, in Cryptomeria japonica, axial and ray parenchyma cells in xylem might synthesize and accumulate different kinds of heartwood substances [13, 25]. Nobuchi and Harada [26] reported differences {{in terms of the}} ultrastructural changes during heartwood formation between axial and ray parenchyma cells in xylem. These observations together suggest that <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells might play a different role in heartwood formation from that of ray parenchyma cells and perimedullary cells in Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis.|$|E
30|$|This is {{the first}} report to {{ascertain}} potassium location in black heartwood of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica). The objective {{of this study was}} to understand the distribution of potassium in sugi black heartwood in connection with anatomical morphology. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDXA) was used to investigate the distribution of inorganic elements, especially potassium. In black heartwood, potassium was detected in all tissues (tracheids, ray parenchyma, and <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma),</b> but its concentrations were different in each xylem tissue. Potassium was particularly accumulated in the droplets in <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells. In addition, calcium was also detected in all tissues. Phosphorus sometimes existed in the granules in ray parenchyma cells. From optical microscopy, the <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells were observed to be arranged in a tangential direction on transverse section and the droplets in these cells were distributed in areas of high ash and green moisture content. For red heartwood, potassium detected by SEM-EDXA was far lower in all tissues than in the black heartwood, while the trend for calcium was the converse. Potassium in <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells was more abundant in black heartwood than in typical pale red heartwood.|$|E
40|$|Stems of Ipomoea obscura Ker Gawl., {{increase}} in thickness by forming multiple rings of cambia. Stems 5 - 6 mm thick produce parenchymatous derivatives which divide repeatedly to form small arcs of cambium. Several such small arcs initiate simultaneously {{and form a}} ring of small cambial arcs. After {{the formation of a}} few xylem and phloem elements, all these arcs are interconnected by transdifferentiation of parenchyma cells present between the cambial arcs and constitute a complete cambial cylinder. This newly formed cambium is functionally bidirectional: earlier- formed arcs produce xylem centripetally and phloem centrifugally, while later-formed segments exclusively produce thin-walled parenchyma cells on either side. Young stems are circular in cross section but as stem thickness increases they become oval to elliptic or lobed and dumbbell-shaped. Xylem rays are mostly uni- or biseriate and thin-walled, but multiseriate rays characteristic for a climbing habit are observed occasionally. In thick stems, the marginal ray parenchyma in most of the samples becomes meristematic and develops ray cambia which exclusively produce sieve elements. Similarly, parenchyma cells produced from later-formed cambial segments give rise to several irregularly oriented vascular bundles. The secondary xylem is diffuse porous, with indistinct growth rings and is composed of fibriform and wider vessels, fibres, and <b>axial</b> and ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells, while phloem consists of sieve elements, companion cells, and <b>axial</b> and ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells...|$|R

Dilatation meristem is formed in the rays in various patterns: {{in the center of the}} ray, at one or two of the ray 2 ̆ 7 s margins, in horizontal or diagonal strips (relative to the axis) in the ray, or in more than one pattern in a single ray...|$|R
5000|$|As a tree grows, its cambium adds {{an annual}} {{increment}} (or ring) of new wood, {{and in many}} species of trees the older wood towards {{the centre of the}} tree becomes less important for physiological processes like water and nutrient transportation, and this is converted by the tree to heartwood. This heartwood has no active defenses against infection, but is protected from infection and decay by the blockage of the xylem vessels with tyloses and various substances such as gums, resins and waxes containing high concentrations of volatile organic compounds such as terpenes that are toxic to insect larvae and tree pathogens such as bacteria and fungi. These products are produced by the cambium and transported to the centre of the stem by cellular structures called medullary rays radiating {{from the center of the}} stem [...] and then enter living <b>axial</b> paratracheal <b>parenchyma</b> cells. As the wood ages, the contents of the parenchyma cell burst into the dead vessel through the pit linking the two. The parenchyma cell then dies as its contents are disgorged into the empty space of the dry vessel and highly effective decay-inhibiting substances, notably tannin, are formed and absorbed by the adjacent vessel walls.|$|R
40|$|The {{microtubule}} (MT), microfilament (MF) and myosin {{components of}} the cytoskeleton were studied in the long-lived ray and <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells of the secondary xylem (wood) and secondary phloem of two angiosperm trees, Aesculus hippocastanum L. (horse-chestnut) and Populus tremula L. × P. tremuloides Michx. (hybrid aspen), using indirect immunofluorescence localisation and transmission electron microscopy. MTs and MFs were bundled and oriented axially (parallel to the cell's long axis) within all parenchyma cell types after they had fully differentiated. Additionally, actin and myosin were immunolocalised at the thin-walled membranes of the pits, which linked cells in neighbouring files of both ray and <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> and at the pits between axial and ray parenchyma cells themselves. Anti-callose antibody immunolocated the plasmodesmata at the pit membranes, {{and in the same}} pattern as that of anti-myosin. Ray cells are important symplasmic pathways between the xylem and the phloem throughout the life of trees. We hypothesise that the MT and MF {{components of the}} cytoskeleton in the ray and <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells are involved in the transport of materials within those cells, and, in association with the acto-myosin of plasmodesmata at pit fields, are also important in intercellular transport. Thus, the symplasmic coupling between ray cells, between <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells, and between <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> and ray cells represents an extensive three-dimensional communication pathway permeating the tree from the phloem through the cambium into the wood. We suggest that this cytoskeletal pathway has an important role in delivery of photosynthate, and mobilised reserves, to the actively dividing cambium, and in the movement of materials to sites of reserve deposition, principally within the wood. This pathway could also have an important role in co-ordinating developmental processes throughout the tree...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Developmental {{changes in}} the storage organ of Brassica campestris L. were {{followed}} from {{the organization of the}} embryonic radicle and hypocotyl to the mature storage organ. Three independent primary meristems gave rise to the cortex, the stele, and the root cap-epidermis. The primary development is typical of the Cruciferae. Cambial activity was followed through serial tangential sections of the phloem from four areas of the storage organ; the crown, the hypocotyl, the upper root and the middle root. The anticlinal divisions of the crown's cambium were primarily longitudinal and transverse. The divisions in the hypocotyl, although greatly oblique had fewer 'longitudinal divisions. The cambium of the upper root had fewer longitudinal and greatly oblique anticlinal divisions. The anticlinal divisions of the middle root showed few greatly oblique divisions with most divisions being oblique to slightly oblique. New ray initials originated by transverse divisions of fusiform initials. Both ray and fusiform initials that were lost differentiated into parenchyma cells. Decline of fusiform initials was rare and in no case did ray initials originate in this fashion. As the storage organ expanded, interxylary phloem strands and vascular bundles appeared. Phloem strands differentiated following longitudinal divisions of the <b>axial</b> xylem <b>parenchyma.</b> As the organ enlarged, parenchyma cells surrounding the phloem strand divided, a cambium was formed, and tertiary phloem and xylem were produced.

Although the presence of calcium oxalate and silica accumulation has been reported for some tree species,the chemical composition, abundance, and quantification of biominerals remain poorly documented. However, biominerals may play important physiological and structural roles in trees, especially in forest ecosystems, which are characterized by nutrient-poor soils. In this context, our study aimed at investigating the morphology, distribution, and relative abundance of biominerals in the different vegetative compartments (foliage, branch, trunk, and root) of Fagus sylvatica L. and Acer pseudoplatanus L. {{using a combination of}} scanning electron microscopy and tomography analyses. Biomineral crystallochemistry was assessed by X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses, while calcium, silicon, and oxalic acid were quantified in the compartments and at the forest scale. Our analyses revealed that biominerals occurred as crystals or coating layers mostly in bark and leaves and were identified as opal, whewellite, and complex biominerals. In both tree species, opal was mostly found in the external tissues of trunk, branch, and leaves, but also in the roots of beech. In the stand, opal represents around 170 kg/ha. Whewellite was found to suit to conductive tissues (i. e., <b>axial</b> phloem <b>parenchyma,</b> vascular bundles, vessel element) in all investigated compartments of the two tree species. The shape of whewellite was prismatic and druses in beech, and almost all described shapes were seen in sycamore maple. Notably,the amount of whewellite was strongly correlated with the total calcium in all investigated compartments whatever the tree species is, suggesting a biologic control of whewellite precipitation. The amount of whewellite in the aboveground biomass of Montiers forest was more important than that of opal and was around 1170 kg/ha. Therefore, biominerals contribute in a substantial way to the biogeochemical cycles of silicon and calcium...|$|R

40|$|Wood {{density is}} {{considered}} a key plant trait, affectingmechanical and physiological performance, yet its biological meaning is still rather unclear. Accordingly we investigated the anatomical underpinnings of wood density in trees and shrubs. We measured wood density and anatomical traits in distal stems 4 - 10 mm diameter under bark in 24 Australian species. Proportions of wood components that are functionally distinct were analysed, including fibre wall and lumen, vessel wall and lumen, and <b>axial</b> and ray <b>parenchyma.</b> Wood density was mainly driven by the density of wood outside vessel lumens (densityNV) rather than by vessel lumen fraction. In turn, densityNV variation was chiefly affected by fibre wall and lumen fractions. Considerable anatomical variation was observed at a given densityNV, especially among medium-densityNV species (0. 60 - 0. 85 g cm⁻³); this range of medium densityNV roughly translates to 0. 50 - 0. 75 g cm⁻³ of overall density. The anatomy of these species formed a continuum from low fibre lumen and medium parenchyma fractions to medium fibre lumen and low parenchyma fractions. Our data suggest that wood density is an emergent property influenced by a complex anatomy rather than an unambiguous functional trait, particularly in medium-density species.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the formation of successive rings of cambia in Rivea hypocriteriformis Choisy (Convolvulaceae). The mature stem is composed of four to five rings of xylem alternating with phloem. Successive cambia originate as smaller and larger segments; union and anastomosing of small cambial segments often leads {{to the formation of}} discontinuous rings. In the initial stage of growth, several vascular bundles interconnect to form the first ring of vascular cambium. The cambium remains functional for one complete season and becomes dormant during summer; a new ring of cambium is completed prior to the subsequent monsoon season and sprouting of new leaves. Successive cambia are initiated from the pericyclic parenchyma situated three to four cell layers outside of the protophloem. Functionally, all the successive cambia are bidirectional and produce secondary xylem centripetally and phloem centrifugally. The secondary xylem is diffuse-porous, with indistinct growth rings and consisting of wide fibriform vessels, fibre tracheids, and <b>axial</b> and ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells. The xylem rays are uni- to multiseriate and heterocellular. The multiseriate rays contain lignified marginal ray cells and thin-walled, unlignified central cells. The central ray cells also show accumulations of starch and druses. Discrete strands of intraxylary phloem occur at the periphery of the pith, and additional intraxylary phloem develops from adjacent cells as secondary growth progresses. Earlier-formed phloem shows heavy accumulation of callose, followed by its compaction.

We found an image of 900 [*]×[*] 900 -pixel size at a pixel resolution of ca. 3  µm, corresponding to the actual size of 2.65 [*]×[*] 2.65 mm 2, as the minimum requirement for the image dataset {{in terms of the}} accuracy of the recognition at both the genus and species levels. Among the several classifiers investigated, the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) presented the best performance reaching a maximum of 89.4 % in the genus with a species identification of approximately  96.3 %. Cluster analysis of all the SIFT descriptors for each image yielded practical information regarding the descriptors; they recognize selectively the cell lumina, cell corners, vessels, and <b>axial</b> and ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells. Therefore, the difference between the genus or species levels was determined per the variation in the quantities of these computer-based properties. Another clustering approach, the hierarchal dendrogram, was applied to visualize the numerical distances between the genus and species. Interestingly, even Machilus and Phoebe, which are difficult to distinguish by conventional visual inspection, are quite distantly classified at the genus level. In contrast, some species in Cinnamomum, Machilus and Litsea were categorized into different subgroups rather than the original genus. Microscopic wood identification is found to be possible at the genus level; however, the numerical dataset of the morphological features has various overlapping clusters, causing the genus-level identification of the Lauraceae to be more difficult than species-level identification.|$|R
40|$|The wood {{products}} sector in Nigeria is currently performing below optimal capacity {{as a result}} of increasing scarcity of economic wood species. In order to adequately cater for products requirement of Nigerians locally, the sector has incorporated lesser used wood species into its stream of raw materials requirement. One of these species commonly found in sawmills and plank depots in the country is Detarium senegalense. As the properties of wood determine its utilization potentials, this study was carried out to determine the wood properties of D. senegalense. The basic density is 610 kg/m 3. This is within the range of the economic species currently used in the {{wood products}} sector. However, the heartwood constitutes only 9. 02 % of the total volume fraction. The sapwood constitutes 75. 98 %, and the bark 15 %. The low percentage of heartwood in contrast with the high volume of sapwood indicated that the wood may not be durable in service. The mean age is 47 years while the mean diameter is 21 cm indicating that it is a small diameter hardwood. The vessels elements, fibres, <b>axial</b> and ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells constitute 9. 28, 31. 4, 30. 6 and 28. 72 % respectively. The number of vessel per mm 3 is 13. 62 while those of fibres are 3301 per mm 3. The relative high proportions of the fibres may have contributed to its high density. The wood and wood products sector of the national economy is currently facing wood shortage problems. According to RMRDC (2010) the total volume of useable wood down to 30 cm cutting diameter in the reserved forest areas is 239, 775, 500...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Different {{medicinal}} plant species {{can be sold}} under the same common name. Considering {{the importance of the}} correct identification, this study aims to separate, using wood anatomy, seven species popularly known as pau-para-tudo. The results show that Drimys brasiliensis is separated from the others by the presence of tracheids. Capsicodendron dinisii hhas scalariform perforation plates and oil cells associated with the <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> <b>Axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> paratracheal vasicentric and in marginal bands beyond the rays' width, can separate Osteophoeum platyspermum from Simaba cedron. Handroanthus serratifolius has the unique presence of the axial unilateral paratracheal parenchyma and storied cell elements (parenchyma, fibers and vessel elements). Rauvolfia sellowii and Leptolobium dasycarpum can be separated by the number of square/upright marginal ray cells, greater in Rauvolfia sellowii. Thus, this work shows that wood anatomy is a valuable tool for species separation, helps with the identification and consequently is important for the quality control of plant product...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{anatomical}} {{study of}} P. radiata grafts revealed that phloem tissues of incompatible grafts are abnormally thick. Grafts with thick phloem often displayed "pitted " stems. Thickened bark resulted jointly from overproduction of sieve cells and underproduction of tracheids. Normal pattern of phloem differ-entiation was altered and phloem areas formed which lacked <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> Other internal symptoms in union zones of some incompatible grafts were suberisation and necrosis of cortex cells, excessive tannin accumulation indicated by abnormally darkly-stained bark tissues, formation of abnormal parenchyma in the xylem, and atypical dilation of horizontal ray cells and <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> Increasingly more grafts developed symptoms of incompatibility as graft age increased: 10 %, 24 %, 35 %, 54 %, and 72 % of 1 -, 3 -, 5 -, 8 -, and 13 - to 18 -year-old grafts, respectively. Possible interactions between occult viruses and true stock-scion incompatibility {{may be responsible}} for the graft survival and vigour problems...|$|E
40|$|Fifty-one Brazilian {{species and}} {{varieties}} of Swartzia Schreber and eight other genera from the tribe Swartzieae were examined. Features {{with the greatest}} diagnostic value for the tribe are intervascular pit size, ray width and frequency, storied structure, <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> strand length, parenchyma band width, and vessel diameter. We analyzed the wood anatomical data using average linkage cluster analysis and canonical discriminant analysis. With weighted features, cluster analysis grouped the species and varieties of Swartzia into four distinct groups and tribe Swartzieae into seven groups. With unweighted features for both Swartzia and Swartzieae, the canonical discriminant analysis showed that linear combinations of the variables storied structure, number of tiers per millimetre, <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> strand length, ray height, intervas-cular pit size, and exclusively uniseriate rays were good discriminators among the groups. We discuss the grouping of the species of Swartzia and compare other genera within the tribe Swartzieae to the four groups of Swartzia...|$|E
40|$|Wood of Caryophyllaceae is {{more diverse}} {{than has been}} appreciated. Imperforate tracheary {{elements}} may be tracheids, fiber-tracheids, or libriform fibers. Rays may be uniseriate only, multiseriate only, or absent. Roots of some species (and sterns of {{a few of those}} same genera) have vascular tissue produced by successive cambia. The diversity in wood anatomy character states shows a range from primitive to specialized so great that origin close to one of the more specialized families of Chenopodiales, such as Chenopodiaceae or Amaranthaceae, is unlikely. Caryophyllaceae probably branched from the ordinal clade near the clade 2 ̆ 7 s base, as cladistic evidence suggests. Raylessness and abrupt onset of multiseriate rays may indicate woodiness in the family is secondary. Successive cambia might also be a subsidiary indicator of secondary woodiness in Caryophyllaceae (although not necessarily dicotyledons at large). Although a small shrub, Gymnocarpos may be primitively woody, and because that genus appears primitive in many wood features the family as a whole may derive from woody ancestors, despite apparent secondary woodiness in many phylads. Systematic distribution of wood character states in the family corresponds closely to the Pax and Hoffmann system of three tribes and their progressive degrees of specialization (Paronychieae, Alsineae, Sileneae). Wood data support the idea that Caryophyllaceae represent a branch from near the base of the order Caryophyllales. Wood of Caryophyllaeeae is highly xeromorphic, comparable in quantitative vessel features to wood of desert shrubs; insular species have less xeromorphic wood. Instances of storying and druse presence in <b>axial</b> and ray <b>parenchyma</b> are newly reported for the family, as is the inverted orientation of xylem, phloem, and periderm produced by a cambium at the periphery of the pith in Dianthus caryophyllus...|$|R
40|$|Maytenus guyanensis, conhecida popularmente por chichuá, possui ações analgésicas, antiinflamatórias, afrodisíacas e antireumáticas. Sendo assim foram estudados seus aspectos anatômicos e etnofarmacológicos a fim de se localizar sítios ou locais de produção da droga através dos testes microquímicos e traçar o perfil dos usuários e feirantes de produtos naturais nas feiras e mercados de Manaus-AM. Para análise anatômica do {{material}} coletado na Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke, foram selecionados 3 indivíduos e de cada um deles foram retirados fragmentos do caule e raiz de 1 cm 3. Fragmentos do caule foram incluídos em resina metacrilato para obtenção de cortes em micrótomo rotativo, os quais foram corados com azul de toluidina e montados em resina sintética. Seções do caule em crescimento secundário e da raiz foram obtidas com o auxílio de micrótomo de deslize e coradas com azul de astra e safranina. Os cortes histológicos do caule e raiz foram submetidos a testes microquímicos visando identificar a natureza química das substâncias secretadas. A investigação etnobotânica nas feiras e mercados foi realizada através de entrevistas, usando questionários com perguntas abertas e semi-estruturadas. A análise estrutural do caule e da raiz revelou-se de acordo com o registrado pela literatura para o gênero Maytenus. A periderme do caule origina-se na subepiderme, lenticelas estão presentes. A casca do caule secundário apresenta periderme desenvolvida constituída por felema espesso, seqüencialmente são observados o felogênio e feloderme. Córtex internamente rodeado por dois anéis esclerenquimáticos, sempre contínuo e composto por fibras e inúmeras células pétreas. Cilindro vascular com floema externo ao xilema, tecido floemático e xilemático entremeado com inúmeras fibras. O xilema secundário da raiz e do caule apresenta parênquima axial apotraqueal, raios multisseriados, heterogêneos, vasos solitários, de distribuição difusa, uniforme, seção circular, com parede delgada, pontoações intervasculares alternas e areoladas. O sistema floemático percorrido por grupos de células pétreas, células em processo de esclerificação, fibras e raios parenquimáticos. Medula homogênea formada de células parenquimáticas isodiamétricas e células pétreas. As estruturas do caule e da raiz apresentaram inúmeras células-pétreas e células em processo de esclerificação as quais possuem um lúmen denso que reagiu ao teste de alcalóides. Os testes microquímicos também revelaram a presença de amido, pectina e proteínas (somente no caule). Monocristais prismáticos estão presentes no parênquima radial da raiz e do caule. A pesquisa permitiu avaliar o perfil dos feirantes e usuários de plantas medicinais de Manaus-AM demonstrando que o comércio de fitoterápicos tem crescido nos últimos 10 anos através do aumento da procura de plantas medicinais. A abordagem etnofarmacológica realizada revelou que a espécie M. guyanensis não é comercializada e utilizada pelos feirantes, e sim uma outra espécie com o mesmo nome vulgar de chichuá, Salacia impressifolia. Contudo os informantes que conhecem as duas espécies afirmam que elas apresentam o mesmo uso terapêutico (relaxante muscular, reumatismo, impotência sexual e frigidez). O presente estudo vem enfatizar a importância da anatomia e da etnofarmacologia para o conhecimento das plantas medicinais. Maytenus guyanensis, known popularly for chichuá, possess analgesic, anti-inflammatory, aphrodisiac and anti-rheumatic actions. Here, its anatomical and ethnopharmacological aspects {{had been}} studied through the microchemical tests {{in order to}} locate the small farms where the drug is produced, and to trace {{the profile of the}} users and traders of natural products in the fairs and markets in Manaus-AM. Anatomical analysis of the material collected in the Forest Reserve Adolpho Ducke where conducted for 3 selected individuals, from which fragments of stem and root of 1 cm 3 had been removed. Fragments from stems were embedded in methacrylate resin for sectioning in a rotating microtome, stained with toluidine blue and mounted with synthetic resin. Sections from the stem in secondary growth and root were cut with slide microtome, and stained with astra blue and safranina. The histological cuts of stem and root were submitted to microchemical tests aiming the identification of the chemical properties of the secreted substances. The ethnobotanical aspects were studied through interviews carried in the fairs and markets of Manaus-AM, based on questionnaires with open and semi-structuralized questions. The structural analysis of stems and roots were in accordance with those showed in the literature available for the Maytenus genus. Periderm of stem arising in the sub-epidermis, lenticels is gifts. The bark of stem presented periderm developed constituted by a thick phellem, and subsequently to which the phellogen and phelloderm were observed. Vascular cylinder with phloem external to xylem, weaved phloematic and xylematic larded with innumerable staple fibres. The secondary xylem of the root and stem presented <b>parenchyma</b> <b>axial</b> apotracheal, multiseriates, heterogeneous rays, solitary vessels, of diffuse distribution, uniform, circular section, with thin wall, bordered and alternate intervascular pits. Cortex internally bounded by two sclerenchymatic rings, almost continuous and composed of fibers and innumerable stone cells. The phloem system has a group of stone cells, cells in process of sclerification, fibers and parenchyma rays. Homogeneous pith formed of isodiametric parenchyma cells and stone cells. Staple fibers and rays of the structures in stems and the root presented innumerable stone cells and cells in sclerification process, possessing a dense lumen reactive to alkaloids test. The microchemical tests also disclosed presence of starch, pectin and proteins (only in stem). Prismatic monocrystals were present in the radial parenchyma of roots and stems. The research on the profile of traders and users of medicinal plants in Manaus-AM revealed that the commerce of phytotherapics has grown in last the 10 years because of increasing search of medicinal plants. M. guyanensis is neither commercialized nor used for the traders, but instead another species bearing the same vulgar name of chichuá, Salacia impressifolia. Nevertheless, informers knowing both species affirmed that they are used in similar therapeutical treatments use (rheumatism, sexual impotence and frigidity). The present research emphasizes the importance of anatomical and ethnopharmacological aspects for the knowledge of medicinal plants...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePremise of the study: During the Devonian, the {{evolution}} of secondary phloem produced by a bifacial vascular cambium was a key innovation that increased the ability of plants within the lignophyte clade to redistribute photosynthates and other organic compounds throughout their body. Unraveling the secondary phloem anatomy of the first arborescent lignophytes is crucial to understand {{the evolution}} of this tissue and the physiology of early trees. * Methods: A 10 cm wide stem of Callixylon with preserved secondary phloem from the Famennian of Morocco is described using thin-sections. * Key results: The secondary phloem of this Callixylon zalesskyi-type of stem is composed of fibers, sclereids, rays, <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> and putative sieve cells. Fibers differentiate early and are relatively abundant in the inner phloem. In the older phloem, fibers are arranged in tangential bands alternating with extensive layers of <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> Changes between the young and old phloem involve the periclinal division and radial elongation of the <b>axial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells. The presence of fibers in the inner, presumably functional phloem, combined with evidence for rhythmicity {{in the production of}} different phloem cell types are documented {{for the first time in}} detail in an archaeopteridalean progymnosperm. No periderm was observed within the preserved seven millimeters of bark tissues. * Conclusions: The secondary phloem anatomy supports a close affinity of archaeopteridalean progymnosperms with both aneurophytalean progymnosperms and seed plants. The production of secondary phloem might have provided an advantage to these first arborescent lignophytes over other types of Devonian early trees, especially in dry conditions...|$|E
