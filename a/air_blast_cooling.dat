40|$|Comparatively to the as {{received}} {{soda lime glass}} samples, the strength distribution after thermal shocks showed {{the appearance of a}} second branch in the Weibull curves. This branch is observed for temperature differences (ΔT) equal or higher than the critical temperature difference (ΔTc) for both water and motor oil cooling baths. The dispersion is more spread out in these two baths in comparison with the olive oil bath probably because of more pronounced slow crack growth effect. The Weibull modulus varies according to the used cooling bath and the considered temperature difference. In the case of thermal shock caused by <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> <b>cooling</b> at T = 20 °C, a bimodal distribution is observed for only the critical state. The initial cracking time, obtained by acoustic emission, corresponds to the unstable propagation of the most critical defect. The number of cracks induced by thermal shock is proportional to the number of acoustic events...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{establishment}} of correlation between thermal behaviour {{and quality of}} cold preserved fish. Experiments were designed and transient temperature-time variations were recorded at the center and other three equidistant locations during <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> <b>cooling</b> of slab shaped pieces of fresh water fish. A number of pieces from the same lot were cold preserved at 3 ˚C {{for a period of}} 28 days and experiments were repeated daily. Time-temperature records were used to determine thermal diffusivity of each sample using the empirical approach of the first author, reported elsewhere. It was observed that the measured thermal diffusivity increased up to 14 days and then stayed approximately constant up {{to the end of the}} preservation period (28 days). According to the reported literature, it was found that the shelf life of fish preserved at 3 ˚C is 14 days. Regression analysis was made to develop an empirical correlation between thermal diffusivity and preservation time of the fish under investigation.

Burner rigs were used which operated on JP- 5 fuel and air, producing a gas velocity of 0. 85 (2000 to 2500 ft/sec) at the specimen's leading edge. One-hour heating cycles were used with three minutes of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> <b>cooling.</b> Results of testing at temperatures ranging from T sub max of 1850 to 2050 F indicate that coated B 1900 has the longest oxidation life at all temperatures, followed by IN- 100 X- 40 WI- 52, based on a weight change criterion. Coatings on nickel-base alloys provided {{more than twice the}} life of coating on cobalt-base alloys at comparable temperatures. The coatings with higher aluminum content and comparable thickness had longer lives. Silicon appeared to be a beneficial additive in the nickel-base alloy coatings for long term, low temperature life, but not for short term, high temperature performance. Chromium was identified in all coatings. Extrapolating the life results obtained to 1600 F, all the selected coatings on the four alloys would be protective for at least 10, 000 hours...|$|E

40|$|During {{rehabilitation}} of 16 km {{at the road}} 563 between Sjulsmark and Ersnäs Norrbotten County, Sweden in 2006, a 800 m long test road was constructed. Three different fractions of <b>Air</b> <b>Cooled</b> <b>Blast</b> Furnace Slag were used. The fractions were 0 / 63, 0 / 125 and unsorted material. In addition normal crushed stone was used in one section as a reference. The test road was built by SSAB Tunnplåt AB, SSAB Merox, the Swedish Road Administration Northern region and BDX AB. The purpose was to evaluate <b>Air</b> <b>Cooled</b> <b>Blast</b> Furnace Slag as a road construction material and compare it with normal geological rock materials. A second purpose was to update “ATB Väg” and “ATB Hyttsten”. The test road was divided into 8 parts each part being 100 m long. This study deals with the fifth part of the test road, which was constructed using unsorted <b>Air</b> <b>Cooled</b> <b>Blast</b> Furnace Slag and compacted by using ring compactors. <b>Air</b> <b>Cooled</b> <b>Blast</b> Furnace slag (Hyttsten) is a byproduct produced in steel industry was used for 30 years. A Percostation, {{which is used to}} measure and visualize measured parameters like dielectric constant (Dielectricity), Electrical Conductivity and Temperature, was installed in the studied part to collect data from 5 different depths (15 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm, 80 cm and 110 cm) in the road section. It is normally used in detecting critical bearing capacity of road materials and to assess the frost and water effects on the road materials. Data obtained from the percostation in the test road was analyzed and compared with data obtained from two other stations in Finland. The purpose was to investigate the differences between the behaviors of <b>Air</b> <b>Cooled</b> <b>Blast</b> Furnace Slag, which was used to construct the test road, with the behavior of natural geological road materials, which were used in the two Finnish stations. The idea was to be able to explain the facts that may cause the difference between <b>Air</b> <b>Cooled</b> <b>Blast</b> Furnace Slag and other road construction materials. This study showed that <b>Air</b> <b>Cooled</b> <b>Blast</b> Furnace Slag due to its low water content will have lower Dielectricity values compared with the other road construction materials being used in the other test stations. And since <b>Air</b> <b>Cooled</b> <b>Blast</b> Furnace Slag contains a lot of Sulfur and Vanadium, that may leach down to lower layers or may help to produce H 2 SO 4. The Electrical conductivity values in the layers beneath <b>Air</b> <b>Cooled</b> <b>Blast</b> Furnace Slag were found to be will be higher than those measured at the other test sections.

40|$|This thesis {{consider}} {{alternatives for}} {{heating and cooling}} planned office buildings at Arlanda airport. The thesis {{is divided into three}} parts where the third part is a shorter synthesis of the two first. In the first part the energy demands of the buildings are modelled in a computer program. Two different building models are created, one more conventional and one with good energy properties. The results shows that with proper construction and ventilation systems etc. the energy required for heating and cooling could be very low. Whether the consumption will be so low that normal energy installations could be omitted is although hard to predict from the results. The second part of the work concerns different ways of producing the required energy for the buildings. Four energy producing systems (aquifer, rape seed diesel generator, snow-cooling and air blast cooler) are compared with today’s systems (districts heating and compression cooling machines) with respect to environmental impact and economy. District heating and diesel generator with rape seed oil are systems with negative global warming potential, mainly due to the simultaneous production of power together with heat. Compression cooling has the highest GWP and the remaining systems shows a small GWP. Rape seed diesel generator and (in less extent) district heating has a relative large impact on acidification and eutrophication while the other systems have a much smaller impact. Economically the aquifer and <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> <b>cooling</b> are the most competitive systems; the per-kWh price of energy is lower than for today’s systems. Snow cooling also has promising economical potential but the high price on rape seed oil makes the diesel alternative less interesting at the moment...|$|E

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>blast,</b> {{a sudden}} mass {{movement}} of air, {{can occur in}} underground mining system where caving develops an extensive mass of unsupported rock spanning a large void. <b>Air</b> <b>blast</b> can result in injury to mine personnel, damage to equipment or disrupts mine operation. Evaluation of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> parameters is, therefore, an essential part to develop strategies to mitigate the hazard. The properties of a muckpile or a caved zone are significant factors affecting the magnitude of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> in particular on the undercut and extraction levels. This research investigates the effect of muckpile properties on air flow using the numerical code, PFC 2 D. The critical parameters such as thickness, block size and porosity (swell factor) of the muckpile have been studied to quantify how much they could change the magnitude of air pressures and velocities while the air flows through the muckpile. It {{was found that the}} porosity of the muckpile is the most effective parameter on the magnitude of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> and by designing a thick layer of blasted rock with low porosity in the caved zone, the intensity of the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> can be significantly reduced. The findings of this study can be used to design <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> plugs or bulkheads in order to isolate any potential <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> from the active workings, or to quantify the minimum thickness of the muckpile above extraction levels to manage <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> hazards...|$|R
2500|$|The Lowe {{process is}} {{performed}} {{in a series of}} three chambers, the generator, the carburettor and the superheater. [...] The original <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> is used to produce air gas in the generator. [...] The heat of primary combustion heats the coal sufficiently, while the air gas is burned by a second <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> in the other two chambers in which the oil for carburetting is decomposed.

When the coal and checker work are hot enough, the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> is shut off and the steam blast is turned on. Heat stored in the checker work pyrolyzes the mixture of water gas and oil, which is led through the chambers while the steam blast is on the producers. The Lowe process is endothermic, and cools the generator and checker work, so the process has to alternate between <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> for heating and steam blast for gas production.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{evaluated}} whether <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> or rinsing particle remnants {{with water}} would impair adhesion of resin composite to metal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Commercially pure titanium plates (1 mm x 25 mm x 50 mm) were wet polished down to 1200 -grit silicone carbide abrasive and ultrasonically cleaned. They were then embedded in auto-polymerizing acrylic with the bonding surfaces exposed. Specimens {{were randomly assigned}} to one of the following particle deposition protocols (N = 60, n = 10 per group) : group 1 : particle deposition with aluminum trioxide (50 µm Al 2 O 3) (AL) + <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> + silane (ESPE-Sil); group 2 : particle deposition with 30 µm SiO 2 (CoJet) (CSC) + <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> + silane; group 3 : particle deposition with Rocatec Pre 110 µm Al 2 O 3 +Rocatec Plus 110 µm SiO 2 (LSC) + <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> + silane. In groups 4 (AL-W), 5 (CSC-W) and 6 (LSC-W), the same protocols were used, but instead of <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> only, particle-deposited specimen surfaces were rinsed with water and <b>air</b> <b>blasted.</b> Adhesive resin (VisioBond) was applied and resin composite (Quadrant Posterior, Cavex) was bonded using polyethylene molds and photopolymerized. The specimens were then submitted to thermocycling (6000 cycles, 5 °C- 55 °C, dwell time: 30 s, transfer time: 5 s). Pre-test failures during thermocycling were assigned a value of 0 MPa. Failure modes were identified using an optical microscope. SEM images of particles were obtained. Bond strength data (MPa) were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests (a = 0. 05). RESULTS: Particle type significantly affected the bond results (p 0. 05). While AL groups showed exclusively adhesive failure between the resin composite and the substrate, the incidence of cohesive failures in the composite was more frequent in groups CSC and LSC after either <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> or rinsing. SEM images of particles showed sharp morphology of the particles in AL compared to CSC and LSC. Conclusion: Rinsing and <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> following particle deposition methods did not impair adhesion of resin composite to titanium.
