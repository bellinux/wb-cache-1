5|$|In 1992 Michael filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit against}} Terri's obstetrician {{on the basis}} that he failed to diagnose bulimia as the cause of her infertility. Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped menstruating but the doctor had failed to take her medical history into account which might have revealed <b>an</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> During the case, one of Terri's friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition. After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri's medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.|$|E

40|$|Eating {{disorders}} {{are a significant}} public health problem for individuals across the lifespan. Currently, {{it is estimated that}} approximately 5 million Americans have <b>a</b> diagnosable <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> These disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> not otherwise specified (EDNOS). EDNOS is diagnosed when an individual suffers from binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> or has <b>a</b> clinically significant <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> but does not currently meet all the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Research indicates that EDNOS is more prevalent and as serious a problem as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (Levine & Smolak, 2006; Norring & Palmer, 2005). It is unknown how many others may suffer from <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> which does not meet criteria for <b>a</b> diagnosable <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> <b>Disordered</b> <b>eating</b> behaviors may be risk factors for the development of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> While <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> of all types are consistently more common in women than in men, approximately 40 % of individuals seeking treatment for binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> are male (Hudson...|$|R

Susan reopens the PirateNet radio station for the students, after Jack Lassiter (Alan Hopgood) donates money to the school. Susan has doubts about employing Gemma Reeves (Kathryn Beck), but Toadie persuades her to give his cousin a chance. Susan and Karl allow Rhiannon (Teressa Liane) and Jackson Bates (Finn Woodlock) to stay with them and Susan tries to help Rhiannon better herself. Susan suffers an MS relapse, but hides it from Karl as he is preoccupied by the local mayoral election. Susan confides in Kate instead. As the election heats up, Paul discovers Susan's MS relapse and reveals it to everyone, including Karl, during his campaign announcement, leaving Karl upset to why she did not confide in him. They soon make up, and Susan recovers from her relapse to support Karl through the election; however, Paul ultimately beats him to becoming mayor. When Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele) discovers she is pregnant, Susan supports her as she decides not to confide in her family and the baby's father Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan).|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{models of}} <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> suggest that {{interpersonal}} problems {{contribute to the}} maintenance of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> This study examined whether baseline interpersonal problems differed across <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> diagnoses and across <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> subtypes (“restrictors” vs. “binge-purge” patients) in a large clinical sample. Patients with <b>a</b> primary <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> diagnosis (N = 406) completed measures of interpersonal problems, <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms, and mood prior to treatment at <b>a</b> specialist <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> clinic. Across the sample, more severe <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology was associated with significantly greater difficulty socializing. Anorexia Nervosa (AN) / restrictor patients reported significantly greater difficulty socializing than Bulimia Nervosa (BN) / binge-purge patients. AN patients reported significantly greater difficulty on a measure of competitiveness/assertiveness compared to BN and Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified patients. All findings were significant after controlling for comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms. Interpersonal problems appear to be unique risk factors for <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> Specific interpersonal mechanisms include difficulties socializing and being assertive, which were most pronounced in AN patients.

25|$|Binge eating {{disorder}} is <b>an</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> characterized by frequent and recurrent binge eating episodes with associated negative {{psychological and social}} problems, but without subsequent purging episodes (e.g. vomiting).

25|$|Other {{psychological}} {{issues may}} factor into anorexia nervosa; some fulfill {{the criteria for}} a separate Axis I diagnosis or a personality disorder which is coded Axis II and thus are considered comorbid to the diagnosed eating disorder.

25|$|Anorexia nervosa, often {{referred}} to simply as anorexia, is <b>an</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> characterized by low weight, fear of gaining weight, and {{a strong desire to}} be thin, resulting in food restriction. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are in fact underweight. If asked they usually deny they have a problem with low weight. Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} {{self-stigma}} of seeking psychological help and being male {{would be associated}} with an increased likelihood of having <b>an</b> undiagnosed <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> METHOD: <b>A</b> multi-national sample of 360 individuals with diagnosed <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> and 125 individuals with undiagnosed <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> were recruited. Logistic regression was used to identify variables affecting the likelihood of having <b>an</b> undiagnosed <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> including sex, self-stigma of seeking psychological help, and perceived stigma of having a mental illness, controlling for a broad range of covariates. RESULTS: Being male and reporting greater self-stigma of seeking psychological help was independently associated with an increased likelihood of being undiagnosed. Further, the association between self-stigma of seeking psychological help and increased likelihood of being undiagnosed was significantly stronger for males than for females. DISCUSSION: Perceived stigma associated with help-seeking may be a salient barrier to treatment for eating disorders-particularly among male sufferers. 4 page(s...|$|R
25|$|Bulimia nervosa, {{also known}} as simply bulimia, is <b>an</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> {{characterized}} by binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating refers to eating {{a large amount of}} food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to the attempts {{to get rid of the}} food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking laxatives. Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics, stimulants, water fasting, or excessive exercise. Most people with bulimia are at a normal weight. The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles and breakdown of the teeth. Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and problems with drugs or alcohol. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm.|$|E
25|$|Tony Stonem (Nicholas Hoult) is an attractive, {{intelligent}} and popular boy.

Sid Jenkins (Mike Bailey) is Tony's best friend and has an entirely opposite personality. He lacks confidence, is socially uneasy and struggles with school work. Tony's girlfriend is Michelle Richardson (April Pearson), a girl who can never stay angry at his mischievous behaviour for long. Outwardly, Michelle appears shallow, vain and conceited, but she works hard, has a strong interest in French and Spanish, and is very emotionally mature. She is friends with Cassie Ainsworth (Hannah Murray), an eccentric girl who suffers from <b>an</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> Cassie attempts to hide her own struggles with mental health while her flamboyant parents ignore her in favour of their new baby.|$|E
25|$|Episode one, 'Tony', is an {{ensemble}} piece that introduces {{the characters and}} the format. We meet the effortlessly attractive, popular and intelligent Tony as he arranges for his friends to attend a party held by upper-class girl Abigail Stock (Georgina Moffat). The second episode, 'Cassie', focuses on Cassie's final visit to <b>an</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> clinic {{under the supervision of}} Abigail's mother Dr Stock. In her day-to-day life, she hallucinates messages instructing her to eat which seem to come from Sid, for whom she develops feelings. Jal's episode follows her attempt to win BBC Young Musician of the Year, and her strained relationship with her famous musician father. When a drug dealer 'Mad Twatter' smashes her clarinet as pay back for Sid not giving him money for drugs he bought, Jal's father sees to it he will not bother the gang again. In 'Chris', Chris' mother abandons him, leaving £1,000 in cash. He blows the money on a party, and is eventually helped into temporary student accommodation by his psychology teacher, Angie (Siwan Morris). Episode five, 'Sid', shows Sid's struggle with his parents' break-up while Tony organises a scheme to set him up with Michelle. A heartbroken and fragile Cassie attempts suicide by drug overdose.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{effectiveness}} of enhanced cognitive behavioural Therapy (CBT-E) for adults with <b>a</b> range of <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> presentations within routine clinical settings has been examined {{in only two}} known published studies, neither of which included a follow-up assessment period. Aim: The current study aimed to evaluate the {{effectiveness of}} CBT-E within <b>an</b> out-patient <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> service in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, and incorporated a follow-up assessment period of approximately 20 weeks post-treatment. Method: The study involved 114 adult females with <b>a</b> diagnosed <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> who attended <b>an</b> average of 20 – 40 individual CBT-E sessions with a psychologist or a psychiatry registrar between 2009 and 2013. Results: Of those who began treatment, 50 % did not complete treatment, and the presence of psychosocial and environmental problems predicted drop-out. Amongst treatment completers, statistically and clinically significant improvements in <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> and general psychopathology were observed at post-treatment, which were generally maintained at the 20 -week follow-up. Statistically significant improvements in <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> and general psychopathology were observed amongst the total sample. Conclusions: The findings, which were comparable to the previous Australian effectiveness study of CBT-E, indicate that CBT-E is an effective treatment for adults with all <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> within out-patient settings. Given the high attrition rate, however, minimizing drop-out appears to be an important consideration when implementing CBT-E within clinical settings...|$|R
40|$|Body image dissatisfaction and <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> {{are more}} {{prevalent}} in today?s society than ever, making the prevention of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> and its symptoms crucial for women?s health. <b>A</b> couple-based <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> prevention program was developed based on the dual pathway model of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> and some efficacy has been established.
