5|$|The player {{character}} is a prisoner being led to an Imperial execution in Helgen. Alduin unexpectedly interrupts the procession, destroying the town before the player can be executed. The player escapes in the chaos and journeys {{to the city of}} Whiterun to request aid against the dragon threat. After slaying a different dragon that attacks nearby, the player absorbs the dragon's soul which grants them the ability to perform <b>a</b> <b>shout.</b> The city's guards inform the player that they must be Dragonborn. The player is summoned to meet with the Greybeards, an order of monks who live in seclusion. The Greybeards train the player in using shouts and inform the player of their role in stopping Alduin. The player learns that Skyrim's civil war is the last in a sequence of prophetic events foretold by the Elder Scrolls, which also predicted the return of Alduin.|$|E
5|$|The Maya leader {{returned}} {{the following day}} with twelve canoes, as promised. The Spanish could see from afar that the shore was packed with natives. The conquistadors put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats; {{a few of the}} more daring Spaniards boarded the native canoes. The Spanish named the headland Cape Catoche, after some words spoken by the Maya leader, which sounded to the Spanish like cones catoche. Once ashore, the Spaniards clustered loosely together and advanced towards the city along a path among low, scrub-covered hillocks. At this point the Maya leader gave <b>a</b> <b>shout</b> and the Spanish party was ambushed by Maya warriors armed with spears, bows and arrows, and stones. Thirteen Spaniards were injured by arrows in the first assault, but the conquistadors regrouped and repulsed the Maya attack. They advanced to a small plaza bordered by temples upon the outskirts of the city. When the Spaniards ransacked the temples they found a number of low-grade gold items, which filled them with enthusiasm. The expedition captured two Mayas to be used as interpreters and retreated to the ships. Over the following days the Spanish discovered that although the Maya arrows had struck with little force, the flint arrowheads tended to shatter on impact, causing infected wounds and a slow death; two of the wounded Spaniards died from the arrow-wounds inflicted in the ambush.|$|E

25|$|Denmark were {{batted out}} of the game by Bas Zuiderent and Daan van Bunge who both made centuries as the Danish spin bowling was taken to all corners. Van Bunge made 137 and Zuiderent 107 as the Dutch amassed 314 for 6, also helped by Ryan ten Doeschate who made 32. Despite Thomas Hansen bowling a maiden and taking three for 41, it was not enough. In reply, the Danes were in with <b>a</b> <b>shout</b> as long as Frederik Klokker was at the crease, but when he was gone for 52, it was quickly over.

With <b>a</b> <b>shout,</b> the 15th Alabama emerged from their ravine and began to climb the hill toward the battery, precipitating a melee. Trimble advanced his other two regiments (16th Mississippi Infantry on the left and 21st Georgia Infantry on the right) from their position on Victory Hill, forcing back the Union line. The Union battery limbered hastily and withdrew, saving its guns. A Union regiment counterattacked briefly, striking the left flank of the 16th Mississippi, but was forced back in desperate fighting.|$|E

25|$|With {{the series}} tied at 1–1 with two matches to go, New Zealand had <b>a</b> <b>shout</b> at gaining their first series win. That was quickly {{quenched}} – Cameron bowled 30 wicketless overs {{in the fourth}} Test at the Wanderers, and New Zealand's batting yielded twice as South Africa registered a win by an innings and 51 runs. Still, New Zealand drew the series, after Cameron took the final wicket. His match bowling figures then read 28.5–7–94–2, but with the final ball of the over he had South Africa's number 11 Harry Bromfield caught. Bromfield had been batting for the past half hour without scoring a run, {{though he had been}} in a partnership of 14 with 55 runs required for the win or 21 minutes required for the draw. Thus, Cameron finished his maiden Test series with 20 wickets at a bowling average of 24.65.|$|E
25|$|Grout's last Test {{was played}} in the 1965-66 Ashes series.

25|$|The Adelaide Oval was {{notoriously}} flat, but Garth McKenzie was {{an expert}} on getting batsmen out on dull wickets and used the humid atmosphere and fresh pitch to bowl Bob Barber for a duck and have John Edrich caught by the ever-reliable Simpson at slip. Ian Chappell took a superb catch off Neil Hawke to remove Geoff Boycott and England were 33/3. Ken Barrington (60) and Colin Cowdrey (38) began to rebuild the innings with a 72 run partnership, until Cowdrey heard <b>a</b> <b>shout</b> from the Australian wicketkeeper Wally Grout, thought he was being called and was run out. Debutant Keith Stackpole took a great catch off Jim Parks (49) to give McKenzie his third wicket, who then removed Dave Allen and Dave Brown to give him his second five wicket haul in successive Tests. England were 240/9 {{at the end of}} the first day, which soon became 241 all out as McKenzie caught Fred Titmus (33) leg before wicket first thing in the morning to give him 6/48, his best Test bowling figures to date.|$|E

25|$|At about 4:00 PM, a {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} flying the red flag with children in the lead had assembled but when {{at the behest of}} their leaders they let out <b>a</b> <b>shout</b> and tried to descend on the riverfront, a Japanese naval landing force came ashore and firstly shot blanks but then fired off several live rounds. The rioters then retreated and surged like an avalanche out of the concession, plundering all the way. Though the rioters stubbornly refused to move out once they had reached Pinghe Street, when the Japanese landing party was compelled to fire off warning shots with their machine guns {{in the direction of the}} Honganji temple’s embankment the crowd fled. The crowd which was thus driven from the Japanese concession attacked Japanese businesses located in the concessions of other countries. They attacked a restaurant where six sailors were dining, beat them mercilessly, and then carried them away and imprisoned them at the headquarters of the communist-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions. That night, 25 Japanese people escaped to the British ship HMS Bee and were protected. Dojin Hospital also pulled out from Hankou.|$|E
25|$|Some of the Frenchmen {{living in}} the {{outbuildings}} set up <b>a</b> <b>shout</b> on seeing two of their number killed, at which a man within the fort opened the wicket of the main entrance to admit the fugitives. The camp master closed with him and killed him, and the Spaniards poured into the enclosure. Laudonnière's trumpeter had just mounted the rampart, and seeing the Spaniards coming towards him sounded the alarm. The French—most of whom were still asleep in their beds—taken entirely by surprise, came running out of their quarters into the driving rain, some half-dressed, and others quite naked. Among the first was Laudonnière, who rushed out of his quarters in his shirt, his sword and shield in his hands, and began to call his soldiers together. But the enemy had been too quick for them, and the wet and muddy courtyard was soon covered {{with the blood of}} the French cut down by the Spanish soldiers, who now filled it. At Laudonnière's call, some of his men had hastened to the breach on the south side, where lay the ammunition and the artillery. But they were met by a party of Spaniards who repulsed and killed them, and who finally raised their standards in triumph upon the walls. Another party of Spaniards entered by a similar breach on the west, overwhelming the soldiers who attempted to resist them there, and also planted their ensigns on the rampart.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that speaker {{identification}} yields very high performance in a neutral talking environment, on the other hand, the performance has been sharply declined in <b>a</b> <b>shouted</b> talking environment. This work aims at proposing, implementing, and evaluating novel Third-Order Circular Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (CSPHMM 3 s) to improve the low performance of text-independent speaker identification in <b>a</b> <b>shouted</b> talking environment. CSPHMM 3 s possess combined characteristics of: Circular Hidden Markov Models (CHMMs), Third-Order Hidden Markov Models (HMM 3 s), and Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs). Our results show that CSPHMM 3 s are superior to each of: First-Order Left-to-Right Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (LTRSPHMM 1 s), Second-Order Left-to-Right Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (LTRSPHMM 2 s), Third-Order Left-to-Right Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (LTRSPHMM 3 s), First-Order Circular Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (CSPHMM 1 s), and Second-Order Circular Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (CSPHMM 2 s) in <b>a</b> <b>shouted</b> talking environment. Using our collected speech database, average speaker identification performance in <b>a</b> <b>shouted</b> talking environment based on LTRSPHMM 1 s, LTRSPHMM 2 s, LTRSPHMM 3 s, CSPHMM 1 s, CSPHMM 2 s, and CSPHMM 3 s is 74. 6 %, 78. 4 %, 81. 7 %, 78. 7 %, 83. 4 %, and 85. 8 %, respectively. Speaker identification performance that has been achieved based on CSPHMM 3 s is close to that attained based on subjective assessment by human listeners.
