The scans were correlated with clinical and electroencephalographic findings of brain deterioration. The salient features of the CT presentations are described. Necropsies performed in two of the three cases revealed liquefactive necrosis. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIOS) is the abrupt and inexpli-cable death of an apparently healthy infant. This event {{is said to be the}} most common cause of death in infants between 2 weeks and 1 year of age. Statistically it occurs in one to three or four individuals per 1, 000 live births [1]. Most of these infants are discovered after death has occurred. In rare cases, sudden death occurs in the presence of persons who try to revive the infants. Sometimes resuscitation attempts result in stabili zation of c irculatory param-eters and subsequent hospital admission. These comatose patients can <b>be</b> <b>inc</b> <b>luded</b> in the definition of SIOS although complete brain death is temporarily postponed.

Hence, their formalization as computer interpretable guidelines (CIG) and their implementation in clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are emerging to support clinicians in their decision making process and potentially improve medical outcomes. However, guideline compliancy in the clinical daily practice is still “low”. Some of the reasons for such low compliance rate are (i) lack of a complete guideline to cover special clinical cases (e. g. oncogeriatric cases), (ii) absence of parameters that current guidelines do not consider (e. g. lifestyle) and (iii) absence of up-to-date guidelines due to lengthy validation procedures.

40|$|Mass {{accretion}} rate determinations are fundamental for {{an understanding of}} the evolution of pre-main sequence star circumstellar disks. Magnetospheric accretion models are used to derive values of the mass {{accretion rate}}s in objects of very different properties, from brown dwarfs to intermediate-mass stars; we test the validity of these models in the brown dwarf regime, where the stellar mass and luminosity, as well as the mass accretion rate, are much lower than in T Tauri stars. We have measured simultaneously two infrared hydrogen lines, Pab and Brg, in a sample of 16 objects in the star-forming region rho-Oph. The sample <b>inc</b> <b>ludes</b> 7 very low mass objects and brown dwarfs and 9 T Tauri stars. Brown dwarfs where both lines are detected have a ratio Pab/Brg of ~ 2. Larger values, >= 3. 5, are only found among the T Tauri stars. The low line ratios in brown dwarfs indicate that the lines cannot originate in the column of gas accreting from the disk onto the star along the magnetic field lines, and we suggest that they form instead in the shocked photosphere, heated to temperatures of ~ 3500 K. If so, in analogy to veiling estimates in T Tauri stars, the hydrogen infrared line fluxes may provide a reliable measure of the accretion rate in brown dwarfs.
