5|$|Giant Schnauzers require regular grooming. Their beard {{can collect}} drool and food particles, making {{frequent}} cleanings essential. If being shown, their coat {{needs to be}} stripped every two to four weeks. If they are simply a companion animal, the coat can be clipped instead. Some Giant Schnauzers have <b>an</b> <b>allergy</b> to shampoo.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> fruit <b>allergy</b> is <b>a</b> food <b>allergy.</b> Fruit allergies make {{up about}} ten percent of all food related allergies.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> milk <b>allergy</b> is <b>a</b> food <b>allergy,</b> <b>an</b> adverse immune {{reaction}} {{to one or}} more of the constituents of milk from any animal (most commonly alpha S1-casein, a protein in cow's milk). This milk-induced allergic reaction can involve anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition.|$|R
50|$|Highly {{allergenic}} {{species of}} cypress with <b>an</b> OPALS <b>allergy</b> scale rating of 8 or higher include: Taxodium, Cupressus, Callitris, Chamaecyparis, Asutrocedrus males, and Widdringtonia males and monoecious. Species of cypress with very low potential for causing <b>allergies</b> (<b>an</b> OPALS <b>allergy</b> scale rating of 2 or lower) include: Austrocedrus females and Widdringtonia females.|$|R
5|$|Allergic symptoms, {{including}} rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, {{have been}} documented in laboratory animal workers who {{come into contact with}} guinea pigs. Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander. People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well. Allergy shots can successfully treat <b>an</b> <b>allergy</b> to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} can {{be difficult}} to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting. There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction that the patient is suffering from. Photopatch tests are patch tests conducted when it is believed that a patient is experiencing certain symptoms due to <b>an</b> <b>allergy</b> that will only occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, the patient is given a low dosage of UVA radiation.|$|E
5|$|The three reconnoiter Bobby's house, and Kurt steals Bobby's phone. They next go to Harken's house, where Kurt and Nick {{go inside}} while Dale waits in the car. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has <b>an</b> <b>allergy</b> {{attack from the}} peanut butter on the litter. Dale saves Harken by {{stabbing}} him with an EpiPen. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him. Nick and Dale reluctantly wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders, despite neither of them wanting to. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda (Julie Bowen) is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, with Nick as a secret witness.|$|E

50|$|Identifying <b>a</b> drug <b>allergy</b> can {{sometimes}} be the hardest part. Sometimes drug allergies are confused with nonallergic drug reactions because they both cause somewhat similar reactions.

5|$|Their sting {{generally}} only {{causes a}} mild local reaction in humans; however, {{it is one}} of the few ant species that can be dangerous to humans, along with other ants in the genus Myrmecia. The ant venom is particularly immunogenic for an insect venom; the venom causes about 90% of Australian ant allergies. In endemic areas, up to 3% of the human population has developed <b>an</b> <b>allergy</b> to the venom and about half of these allergic people can suffer from anaphylactic reactions (increased heart rate, falling blood pressure, and other symptoms), which can lead to death on rare occasions. Between 1980 and 2000, there were four deaths due to anaphylaxis from jack jumper stings, all of them in Tasmania. Individuals prone to severe allergic reactions caused by the ant's sting can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).|$|E
5|$|As a young child, Thorpe was sidelined by <b>an</b> <b>allergy</b> to chlorine. As a result, {{he did not}} swim in {{his first}} race until a school {{carnival}} {{at the age of}} seven. The allergy forced Thorpe to swim with his head out of the water; despite this ungainly technique, he won the race, primarily because of his significant size advantage. Thorpe gradually overcame the ailment and progressed to the captaincy of New South Wales for the Australian Primary Schools Championships in 1994. He subsequently won nine individual gold medals at the New South Wales Short Course Age Championships in September of the same year. In 1995, Thorpe started his secondary education at East Hills Boys Technology High School and switched coaches to swim alongside his sister under the tutelage of Doug Frost. It was a busy year for the family; Christina was selected for the Australian team to compete at the 1995 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Atlanta. Now six feet tall, Ian competed at his first Australian Age Championships, winning bronze medals in the 200m and 400m freestyle. He won all ten events at the New South Wales Age Championships.|$|E
5|$|M.regularis is {{a highly}} {{aggressive}} ant that will pursue any intruder to a distance of 1.8–2.7 metres (2–3 yards) if their nests are disturbed. Their stings are very painful and particularly powerful. In some cases, human victims of M.regularis bites have displayed <b>an</b> <b>allergy</b> to the venom. In a 2011 study which investigated the causes of ant sting anaphylaxis in Australia, 265 of the 376 human participants reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, nine serum samples taken from patients were IgE positive to the venom of M.regularis. These ants are both diurnal and nocturnal, foraging on the trunks of Eucalyptus trees to feed on sap and nectar, or capturing small insects (such as caterpillars and ants in the genus Camponotus or subgenus Orthocrema). The larvae are carnivorous and exclusively feed on insects, either consuming small portions of the insect or all of it. Unlike most Myrmecia species, trophallaxis takes place among adults or between adults and larvae. All stages of the frog Metacrinia nichollsi are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies, where they use several galleries constructed by the ants. The parasitic ant M.inquilina may attempt to enter M.regularis nests to establish colonies, but M.inquilina queens may be seized and killed {{as soon as the}} two species come into contact.|$|E
50|$|People {{can also}} {{experience}} {{adverse effects of}} wheat as result of <b>a</b> wheat <b>allergy.</b> <b>As</b> with most <b>allergies,</b> <b>a</b> wheat <b>allergy</b> causes the immune system to abnormally respond to a component of wheat that it treats as a threatening foreign body. This immune response is often time-limited and does not cause lasting harm to body tissues. Wheat allergy and celiac disease are different disorders. Gastrointestinal symptoms of wheat allergy {{are similar to those}} of celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, but there is a different interval between exposure to wheat and onset of symptoms. An allergic reaction to wheat has a fast onset (from minutes to hours) after the consumption of food containing wheat and could include anaphylaxis.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> seafood <b>allergy</b> is <b>a</b> {{hypersensitivity}} to an allergen {{which can}} be present in fish, and particularly in shellfish. This can result in an overreaction {{of the immune system}} and lead to severe physical symptoms. Most people who have <b>a</b> food <b>allergy</b> also have <b>a</b> seafood <b>allergy.</b> Allergic reactions can result from ingesting seafood, or by breathing in vapours from preparing or cooking seafood. The most severe seafood allergy reaction is anaphylaxis, an emergency requiring immediate attention. It is treated with epinephrine.|$|R
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of male Ginkgo biloba trees {{is that they}} are highly allergenic. Male Ginkgo biloba trees have <b>an</b> OPALS <b>allergy</b> scale rating of 7 (out of 10), whereas female trees, which can produce no pollen, have <b>an</b> OPALS <b>allergy</b> scale rating of 2.|$|R
25|$|<b>An</b> <b>allergy</b> {{blood test}} is quick and simple, {{and can be}} ordered by a {{licensed}} health care provider (e.g., <b>an</b> <b>allergy</b> specialist), GP, or PED. Unlike skin-prick testing, a blood test can be performed irrespective of age, skin condition, medication, symptom, disease activity, and pregnancy. Adults and children of any age can take <b>an</b> <b>allergy</b> blood test. For babies and very young children, a single needle stick for allergy blood testing is often more gentle than several skin tests.|$|E

50|$|Lanolin is a {{relatively}} common allergen and is often misunderstood as <b>a</b> wool <b>allergy.</b> However, <b>allergy</b> to <b>a</b> lanolin-containing product is difficult to pinpoint and often other products containing lanolin may be fine for use. Patch testing can be done if <b>a</b> lanolin <b>allergy</b> is suspected.|$|R
25|$|Lactose {{intolerance}} {{is distinct}} from milk <b>allergy,</b> <b>an</b> immune response to cow's milk proteins. They may be distinguished in diagnosis by giving lactose-free milk, producing no symptoms {{in the case of}} lactose intolerance, but the same reaction as to normal milk in the presence of <b>a</b> milk <b>allergy.</b> <b>A</b> person can have both conditions. If positive confirmation is necessary, four tests are available.|$|R
