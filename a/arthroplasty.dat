40|$|ABSTRACTThe study's {{objective}} is to evaluate the characteristics and problems of patients who underwent shoulder <b>arthroplasties</b> between July 2004 and November 2006. Methodology: During {{the period of the}} study, 145 shoulder <b>arthroplasties</b> were performed. A prospective protocol was used for every patient; demographic, clinical and surgical procedure data were collected. All gathered data were included in the data base. The patients were divided in three major groups: fractures, degenerative diseases and trauma sequels. Information obtained from the data base was correlated in order to determine patients' epidemiologic, injuries, and surgical procedure profiles. Results: Of the 145 shoulder <b>arthroplasties</b> performed, 37 % presented trauma sequels, 30 % degenerative diseases, and 33 % proximal humerus fracture. 12 % of the cases required total <b>arthroplasties</b> and 88 % partial <b>arthroplasties.</b> Five major complications were observed on early postoperative period.

40|$|Treatment of {{displaced}} femoral neck fractures {{in the elderly}} with <b>arthroplasties</b> has become standard practice {{during the last decade}} and results in good and predictable outcomes regarding hip function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). There is, however, a lack of evidence concerning certain types of <b>arthroplasties</b> and different subgroups of patients. Patients with severe cognitive dysfunction have a very limited life expectancy after a hip fracture and low functional demands, as well a low HRQoL before the injury. Many surgeons have concerns regarding <b>arthroplasties</b> in these patients. The bipolar hemiarthroplasty (HA) is designed to reduce stress and erosion on the patient`s natural acetabulum and should, in theory, render a better functional outcome and HRQoL than the unipolar HA. Patients with <b>arthroplasties</b> after displaced femoral neck fractures are at higher risk of sustaining a late periprosthetic fracture (PPF) compared to patients treated due to degenerative joint disease. In addition, some prosthetic designs have been pointed out as being a risk factor for PFF. Uncemented <b>arthroplasties</b> are widely used for various indications and show excellent clinical results. In addition, there are concerns about cementing in older frail patients with multiple comorbidities. All patients in Studies I to IV have been treated with <b>arthroplasties</b> because of a displaced femoral neck fracture. Study I is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing treatment with internal fixation (IF) and treatment with HA in patients with severe cognitive dysfunction. Compared to treatment with IF, HAs appear to result in a better HRQoL and fewer reoperations. Study II is an RCT with a 48 -month follow-up comparing bipolar and unipolar HAs. Treatment with a bipolar HA resulted in a better HRQoL after four years. In Study III a cohort of 2757 patients with primary or secondary <b>arthroplasties</b> after femoral neck fractures were investigated. A single cemented femoral implant was used. The incidence of PPFs was high (2. 3 %) in the cohort, but the surgical outcome after reoperation for a PFF was better compared to previous reports. Study IV is an RCT with a 12 -month follow-up comparing uncemented <b>arthroplasties</b> with cemented <b>arthroplasties.</b> The uncemented <b>arthroplasties</b> showed inferior results regarding functional outcome and HRQoL. The main conclusions of this thesis are: Treatment {{of displaced}} femoral neck fractures with <b>arthroplasties</b> is safe, even for patients with severe cognitive dysfunction; the use of uncemented <b>arthroplasties</b> should be avoided and there are still controversies regarding the use of bipolar Has...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} burden of total joint <b>arthroplasties</b> (TJAs) {{performed}} for symptomatic hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) in the Italian population. Methods We analyzed national hospitalizations and diagnosis-related group databases to compute incidence, annual percent change (APC), direct costs, and working days lost between 2001 and 2005 following TJA due to OA. Results In 2005, we recorded a total of 41, 816 (APC + 5. 4; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 5. 1 - 5. 8) and 44, 051 (APC + 13. 4; 95 % CI 13. 1 - 13. 8) hip and knee <b>arthroplasties,</b> respectively. Women represented the majority of patients undergoing TJA procedures (female:male ratio 1. 7 : 1 for hip <b>arthroplasties</b> and 2. 9 : 1 for knee <b>arthroplasties).</b> When analyzing the data by age groups, most of the patients were in the age groups 65 - 74 years and ‚àº 75 years, although the highest increases were observed in those ages < 65 years. Revisions accounted for 6, 387 (APC + 4. 9; 95 % CI 4. 0 - 5. 7) and 2, 295 (APC + 17. 4; 95 % CI 15. 7 - 19. 2) procedures for the hip and knee, respectively. Loss of working days in patients ages < 65 years was estimated between 805, 000 and 1 million days. Hospital costs increased from 741 million to 1 billion euros over the 5 -year period (from 412 to 538 million euros for hip <b>arthroplasties</b> and from 329 to 517 million euros for knee <b>arthroplasties).</b> Rehabilitation costs increased from 228 to 322 million euros. Postoperative complications were estimated between 3. 1 and 4. 4 million euros. The average costs per patient were 16, 835 and 15, 358 euros for hip and knee <b>arthroplasties,</b> respectively.

30|$|The {{demographic}} {{change in our}} society yielded in a more frequent need of endoprostheses. Furthermore, total joint <b>arthroplasties</b> due to arthrosis {{become more and more}} common at younger ages as there is a progressive incidence of obesity in society. In Germany, around 150, 000 total hip <b>arthroplasties</b> are implanted each year and approximately 1.3 million worldwide (Berry et al. 2000; Katzer and L√∂hr 2003). 10 years after implantation endoprostheses survivorship rates of 88 - 95 % in total hip replacements and 93 % in total knee <b>arthroplasties</b> could be proven (Argenson et al. 2013; Allami et al. 2006). After 15 years implant survival rates of only 58 - 62 % in total hip <b>arthroplasties</b> and 79 % in total knee replacements were described (M√§kel√§ et al. 2011; Newman et al. 2009). The most common reasons for failure are aseptic loosening and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) (Lima et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2013). The differentiation between both complications remains a key challenge in orthopedic surgery as the treatment of aseptic loosening is completely different to the treatment of PJI (Ellenrieder et al. 2011).|$|R

25|$|<b>Arthroplasty</b> is an {{orthopedic}} surgery where the articular {{surface of a}} musculoskeletal joint is replaced, remodeled, or realigned by osteotomy or some other procedure. It is an elective procedure that is done to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis (rheumasurgery) or some other type of trauma. As well as the standard total knee replacement surgery, the uni-compartmental knee replacement, in which only one weight-bearing surface of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a popular alternative.|$|E
25|$|Doctors examine {{patients}} and conduct imaging tests {{to identify the}} causes of continued discomfort. Depending upon the diagnosis, several treatment alternatives are available. They include revision repair, nonanatomic repair, tendon transfer and <b>arthroplasty.</b> When possible, surgeons make tension-free repairs in which they use grafted tissues rather than stitching to reconnect tendon segments. This {{can result in a}} complete repair. Other options are a partial repair, and reconstruction involving a bridge of biologic or synthetic substances. Partial repairs typically are performed on patients with retracted cuff tears.|$|E
25|$|Knee replacement, {{also known}} as knee <b>arthroplasty,</b> is a {{surgical}} procedure to replace the weight-bearing surfaces of the knee joint to relieve pain and disability. It is most commonly performed for osteoarthritis, and also for other knee diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. In patients with severe deformity from advanced rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, or long-standing osteoarthritis, the surgery may be more complicated and carry higher risk. Osteoporosis does not typically cause knee pain, deformity, or inflammation {{and is not a}} reason to perform knee replacement.|$|E

25|$|The modern total hip {{replacement}} was pioneered by Sir John Charnley, expert in tribology at Wrightington Hospital, England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could {{be replaced by}} implants cemented to the bone. His design consisted of a stainless steel one-piece femoral stem and head and a polyethylene, acetabular component, {{both of which were}} fixed to the bone using PMMA (acrylic) bone cement. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction <b>Arthroplasty</b> and its derivative designs were the most-used systems in the world. This formed the basis for all modern hip implants.|$|E
25|$|Hip {{modification}} surgeries include excision <b>arthroplasty,</b> {{in which}} {{the head of the}} femur is removed and reshaped or replaced, and pelvic rotation (also known as triple pelvic osteotomy, or pubic symphodesis) {{in which the}} hip socket is realigned, may be appropriate if done early enough. These treatments can be very effective, but as a rule tend to become less effective for heavier animals - their ability to treat the problem becomes reduced if the joint has to handle more pressure in daily life. Pelvic rotation is also not as effective if arthritis has developed {{to the point of being}} visible on X-rays.|$|E
25|$|Many {{long-term}} {{problems with}} hip replacements {{are the result}} of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip <b>arthroplasty)</b> were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal <b>arthroplasty</b> releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.|$|E
