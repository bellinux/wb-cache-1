5|$|Islam has {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of aniconism, and it is considered highly blasphemous in most Islamic traditions to visually depict Muhammad. This, compounded with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cartoons insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. Danish Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic countries and the Danish government to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After the Danish government refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of Danish imams visited the Middle East in late 2005 {{to raise awareness of}} the issue. They presented a dossier containing the twelve cartoons from the Jyllands-Posten, and other information some of which was found to be falsified.|$|E

25|$|Coming {{off their}} third NBA Championship in seven years, there was <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Spurs were {{the class of}} the NBA, and once again would be {{the team to beat}} in the NBA for the Championship. For the 2005–06 season, the Spurs {{acquired}} the two-time All-Star Michael Finley and one-time All Star Nick Van Exel. Not surprisingly, the Spurs would come flying out of the gate, winning 16 of their first 19 games. Once again, the Spurs would get challenged within their own division by the Dallas Mavericks as they held the two best records in the Western Conference all season, battling for first place. In the end, the experience of the Spurs would be the difference as they won the Southwest Division again with a new franchise best record of 63–19. The Spurs met the Mavericks {{in the second round of}} the playoffs, but it would be Dallas coming out on top 4–3, including a 119–111 overtime victory in Game 7.|$|E

25|$|In Livy’s account {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{peace with the}} Samnites {{had been on a}} thin edge for years. It has also to be noted that Cales was in an {{important}} strategic position not only for the route from Rome to Capua but also for some of the routes which gave access to the mountains of Samnium. Yet the Samnites had not responded militarily to Roman interventions in Campania. One factor might have been the conflict between the Lucanians (the Samnites’ southerly neighbours) and the Greek city of Taras (Tarentum in Latin, modern Taranto) on the Ionian Sea. The Tarentines called for the help of the Greek king Alexander of Epirus, who crossed over to Italy in 334 BC. In 332 BC Alexander landed at Paestum, which was close to Samnium and Campania. The Samnites joined the Lucanians and the two were defeated by Alexander, who then established friendly relations with Rome. However, Alexander was killed in battle in 331 or 330 BC. The grievance of the Samnites about Fregellae might have been an addition to aggravations caused by Roman policy in Campania in the previous eight years.|$|E
500|$|The four-part {{setting of}} the closing chorale, [...] "" [...] (Although the sins among us are many), begins with a dissonant chord, {{interpreted}} by Hofmann as a last cry of anguish [...] "in an almost 'Romantic' manner". Gardiner comments: [...] "With all the voices given full orchestral doubling (again, those four trombones!), this chorale is impressive, terrifying in its Lutheran zeal". Mincham notes the setting's [...] "enigmatic" [...] final cadence which [...] "leaves us with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> human condition is ongoing".|$|E
500|$|As for the insanity, {{historians have}} noted that many {{religious}} leaders the past have exhibited behavior that looks exactly like insanity. Flanigan emphasizes that Riel exemplified the tradition of religious mystics involved in politics, especially those with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world {{was about to be}} totally transformed by their religious vision. In his case it meant his delivering the Métis from colonial domination. More broadly, Flanagan argues that Riel was devoutly religious and rejected equalitarianism (which he equated with secularism), concluding he was [...] "a millenarian theocrat, sympathetic to the 'ancien régime' and opposed to the French Revolution, democracy, individualism, and secular society." ...|$|E

500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said [...] "The Stakeout" [...] was [...] "the best Parks & Recreation episode {{by a long}} shot". He said Poehler {{seemed more}} at ease with the Leslie character, and thought [...] "the {{intersection}} of business and personal stress" [...] served the episode well. He also praised the supporting cast and particularly the Ron Swanson subplot. Matt Fowler of IGN said with [...] "The Stakeout", the second season of Parks and Recreation continued to be [...] "significantly funnier" [...] than the first season. Fowler {{said he thought the}} pairing between Leslie and Tom helped ground both characters, and said he was interested to see Leslie dealt with the growing romance between Ann and Mark. Entertainment Weekly writer Henning Fog said [...] "The Stakeout" [...] showed growth improvement for the series, and praised the guest performance of Louis C.K. Fog said the disparate pairing of Leslie and Tom, Mark and Ann, and Ron and April, created <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> characters [...] "really knew each other [...] had lives outside of Leslie's immediate orbit". Chicago Tribune columnist Maureen Ryan particularly praised the performance of Offerman, of whom she said, [...] "His pained reactions and stoic silence are hilarious." ...|$|E

Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly felt the video was [...] "rather sweet" [...] and [...] "heartwarming" [...] in <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> song [...] "seems to have a happy ending." [...] Leah Collins of the Dose.ca lamented the video for its typical fairytale element even though the plot ended with a blissful marriage. She {{concluded}} her review by writing, [...] "Swift happens to include dirty diapers and recreating scenes from The Notebook." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV described the video as [...] "a coming-of-age story" [...] where Swift is depicted to endure [...] "many adult life cycle events and major milestones." [...] In a different perspective, James Montgomery of MTV compared the music video with Katy Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream," [...] writing that although both videos are [...] "essentially about the same thing: the fantasies of young, thoroughly modern women," [...] the fantasies are [...] "about as different as the women presenting them." [...] The Improper reviewer also compared the music video with Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] and noticed that the two music videos presented two contrasting end points, writing [...] "for Swift, it’s a marriage, a home and babies. For Perry, it's independence {{and the ability to}} define your own life." [...] To date, the video has over 243 million views on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} has an irregular trapezoidal footprint corresponding {{to that of}} the group of buildings that formerly occupied the site presenting some difficulties in symmetry. It was also originally enclosed by other buildings, so Hoffmann's design emphasizes its appearance from close by rather than from a distance. The facades, executed in grey muschelkalk, are articulated with reference to the principles of Palladian architecture and based on the Palazzo Thiene in Vicenza. A rusticated plinth comprising the first floor and half the height of the mezzanine is surmounted by columns and pilasters in Tuscan order comprising two and a half stories, above which is a mansard roof. The lack of alignment with the stories is an intentional variation from the model. The facades facing the Jüdenstraße, Klosterstraße, Parochialstraße and Stralauer Straße are , , [...] and [...] long, respectively. The main entrances are in the centre of projecting bays on the Jüdenstraße (front) and Klosterstraße (rear) facades, with the [...] "Bear Hall" [...] on the axis between them. The side wings forming the facades on the Parochialstraße and Stralauer Straße sides terminate in projecting bays at the ends of these two primary facades. Cross wings and an opening in the main axis between the vestibule on the rear, Klosterstraße side and the [...] "Bear Hall" [...] create five courtyards within the building. The vestibules at the main, Judenstraße entrance and the rear entrance on Klosterstraße are lined with the same stone as the exterior to create <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> grand public rooms were also part of the city outside; in the latter, Hoffmann placed a large wall fountain also of Verona marble.|$|E

2500|$|Although for Leibniz the situs of a {{sequence}} of points is completely determined by {{the distance between them}} and is altered if those distances are altered, his admirer Euler, in the famous 1736 paper solving the Königsberg Bridge Problem and its generalizations, used the term geometria situs in such <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> situs remains unchanged under topological deformations.

2500|$|Wilson {{regarded}} {{himself as}} a [...] "man of the people" [...] and did much to promote this image, contrasting himself with the stereotypical aristocratic conservatives who had preceded him. Features of this portrayal included his working man's Gannex raincoat, his pipe (the British Pipesmokers' Council voted him Pipe Smoker of the Year in 1965 and Pipeman of the Decade in 1976, though in private he smoked cigars), his love of simple cooking and fondness for popular British relish HP Sauce, and his support for his home town's football team, Huddersfield Town. His speech showed a Yorkshire accent at times. Eschewing continental holidays, he returned every summer {{with his family to}} the Isles of Scilly.
