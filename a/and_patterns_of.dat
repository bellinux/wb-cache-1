5|$|In biology, natural {{selection}} {{can cause the}} development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including camouflage, sexual selection, and different kinds of signalling, including mimicry and cleaning symbiosis. In plants, the shapes, colours, <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> insect-pollinated flowers like the lily have evolved to attract insects such as bees. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as nectar guides {{that can be seen}} at a distance.|$|E
5|$|Patterns in Rule 184 {{typically}} quickly stabilize, {{either to}} {{a pattern in}} which the cell states move in lockstep one position leftwards at each step, or to a pattern that moves one position rightwards at each step. Specifically, if the initial density of cells with state 1 is less than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of cells in state 1, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells in state 0. Patterns of this type move rightwards. If, on the other hand, the initial density is greater than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of cells in state 0, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells in state 1, <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> this type move leftwards. If the density is exactly 50%, the initial pattern stabilizes (more slowly) to a pattern that can equivalently be viewed as moving either leftwards or rightwards at each step: an alternating sequence of 0s and 1s.|$|E
5|$|The shell {{shape of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is similar to}} that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of the {{aperture}} of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large morphological plasticity, which makes them difficult to differentiate. The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a broad rib (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar muscle is attached to the rib. The rib is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the callus is thin; a peg is lacking. The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the rib shield of the operculum, which is straight in females, but curved in males.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes emit on the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum, with sferics and E-field effects detected. There are observed correlations between tornadoes <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> lightning. Tornadic storms {{do not contain}} more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface {{and returns to the}} baseline level when the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. Electromagnetics and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a thermodynamic phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} pillars of REBT is that irrational and {{dysfunctional}} ways <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> thinking, feeling and behaving are contributing to much, though hardly all, human disturbance and emotional and behavioral self-defeatism and social defeatism. REBT generally teaches that when people turn flexible preferences, desires and wishes into grandiose, absolutistic and fatalistic dictates, this tends to contribute to disturbance and upset.|$|E
25|$|One study {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} four interventions: improving social skills, enhancing social support, increasing opportunities for social interaction, addressing abnormal social cognition (faulty thoughts <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> thoughts).

Results of the meta-analysis suggest that correcting maladaptive social cognition offers the best chance of reducing loneliness.|$|E

25|$|The archetypes form {{a dynamic}} {{substratum}} {{common to all}} humanity, upon the foundation of which each individual builds his own experience of life, colouring them with his unique culture, personality and life events.

Mead favored hybridizing the unusual and in 1920 he crossed the narrow-leaved species, C. albanense, C. speciosum and C. venosum, with the {{standard}} caladium varieties to create the “arrow and lance” type caladium, bringing intriguing narrow strap-leaves and dwarf growth habits to a race of caladium that still possessed the high coloration <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> the larger fancy-leaved forms.|$|E

50|$|The Complex for Forensic Anthropology Research (CFAR) {{opened at}} Southern Illinois University (Carbondale, IL) in October 2010 working with pigs as human proxies. The co-founders, Gretchen R.

In comparison to the other facilities open at the time, CFAR has the lowest average temperature, highest average wind speed, second lowest elevation, the most acidic soil, and the worst soil drainage. Since climate and environment are major factors affecting the rate <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> decomposition, these differences between southern Illinois and the other established facilities were expected (and have proven) to heavily influence the rate <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> decomposition.

25|$|The {{historian}} Walter Rodney {{contends that}} it was a decline in the profitability of the triangular trades that made it possible for certain basic human sentiments to be asserted at the decision-making level in a number of European countries- Britain being the most crucial because it was the greatest carrier of African captives across the Atlantic. Rodney states that changes in productivity, technology, <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> exchange in Europe and the Americas informed the decision by the British to end their participation in the trade in 1807. In 1809 President James Madison outlawed the slave trade with the United States.|$|E
25|$|During the migrations, or Völkerwanderung (wandering of the peoples), {{the earlier}} settled populations were {{sometimes}} left intact though usually partially or entirely displaced.
