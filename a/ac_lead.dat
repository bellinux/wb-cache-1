40|$|According to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it {{is clear}} that the {{buildings}} sector presents the biggest potential for deep and fast [CO. sup. 2] emission reductions on a cost-effective basis. Interestingly, this assessment was premised exclusively on technical (engineering) measures, but ignored completely the behavioural and lifestyle dimensions of energy consumption in the buildings sector. Behavioural change in buildings, however, can deliver even faster and zero-cost improvements in energy efficiency and greenhouse gas (ghg) emission reductions. With this in mind, designers are beginning to shift their attention to how they can widen the range of opportunities available in a building to provide comfort for the occupants, both in new-build and retrofit contexts. This in turn has re-awakened an interest in the role of natural ventilation in the provision of comfort. This discussion about adaptive comfort raises several questions, including the following: How can we shift occupants' comfort expectations away from the static indoor climates of the past towards the more variable thermal regimes found in naturally ventilated buildings? Are building occupants 'addicted' to static environments, i. e. air-conditioning (AC) ? If so, how tolerant or compliant will they be when the thermally constant conditions provided by AC are replaced by the thermally variable conditions that characterize naturally ventilated spaces? Does the frequency of prior exposure to AC bias building occupants' thermal expectations and, if so, what are the implications of this bias for their acceptance of naturally ventilated indoor climates? Does prior exposure to <b>AC</b> <b>lead</b> building occupants to actually prefer AC over natural ventilation? This article addresses these questions in the context of a large field study of building occupants in a hot and humid climate zone in Brazil (Maceio). The temperature preferences registered on 975 questionnaires in naturally ventilated buildings are statistically analysed in relation to occupants' prior exposure to AC in their workplaces. 6 page(s...|$|E

30|$|It was {{demonstrated}} that the tested MR-based <b>AC</b> <b>leads</b> to insufficient quantification results and to degraded image quality as compared to CT-based AC for the evaluated NEMA IQ phantom. Specifically, the activity quantification values for the four “radioactive spheres” were lower than activity values {{reported in the literature}} for NEMA IQ measurements on the Biograph mMR system [2]. The low values indicate insufficient AC of the phantom, which is associated with the fact that MR-based AC only considers the fluid phantom filling but neglects the attenuating phantom housing made from acrylic glass and glass components. On the other hand, the contrast recovery values for the two “non-radioactive spheres” show higher values when compared to the values reported in the literature [2]. Because these spheres are filled with non-radioactive water only, the corresponding contrast recovery values are highest when no counts are detected from inside these spheres. Applying an insufficient attenuation correction, such as the MR-based <b>AC,</b> <b>leads</b> to less counts being detected from inside the non-radioactive spheres resulting in a higher contrast recovery value than when using CT-based AC. Based on the resulting contrast recovery parameters for radioactive and non-radioactive spheres it can be concluded that MR-based attenuation correction performed with the current AC sequence is inadequate to determine representative PET image quality parameters in the tested NEMA IQ phantom.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Cu(II) ion adsorption onto oxidized {{activated carbon}} with HNO 3. The modifications introduced on the activated carbon (AC) surface {{were characterized by}} surface area measurement, FT-IR spectroscopy, titration by the traditional Boehm procedure, and potentiometric titration. A nonlinear method for fitting acid-base potentiometric titration data was applied to determine the concentration and pKa distributions of the ionizable acidic sites on AC, before and after HNO 3 oxidation. Adsorption studies were conducted in batch mode for the concentration range 0. 08 to 1. 75 mmol L- 1 and pH = 4. 0. Results showed that the acid treatment of <b>AC</b> <b>leads</b> to a decrease in apparent surface areas and produces slight modifications in pore structure. However, oxidation strongly influenced the AC surface chemical structures by increasing the concentration of acidic groups with pKa < 6. 0, which significantly improved Cu(II) ion adsorption.

Preliminary analyses are aimed at constructing a realistic finite element model representing a conventional pavement system in terms of geometry, loading system, boundary conditions and materials mechanical behavior. The dynamic implicit mode is used to handle dynamic equilibrium equations of the pavement system under traffic triangular wave load. Different strategies and provisions are made for considering the domain dimensions, choice of mesh and the constraints. In these preliminary analyses, the asphalt concrete (AC) viscoelastic behavior, the elastoplastic and elastoplastic strain hardening behavior of the base and subgrade, {{in addition to the}} linear elastic material of each layer are all covered in details and tested for the suggested finite element mesh. As a result of such analyses, a linear elastic asphalt concrete layer resting on a Drucker-Parger granular base underlined by a Cam Clay subgrade are adopted for conducting the parametric studies for reinforced and unreinforced conventional pavement systems.

Pertussis toxin-insensitive mutations of Gα i/o subtypes, {{in which the}} pertussis toxin-sensitive cysteine is mutated to isoleucine (G), {{were used to determine}} whether each of the Gα i/o subtypes is able to mediate sensitization of AC. G, G, G or G were individually transiently transfected into C 6 glioma cells stably expressing the mu-opioid receptor, or transiently co-expressed with the mu-opioid receptor into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells. Cells were treated with pertussis toxin to uncouple endogenous Gα i/o proteins, followed by acute or chronic treatment with the mu-opioid agonist, [D-Ala 2,N-Me-Phe 4,Gly 5 -ol]enkephalin (DAMGO). Each Gα i/o subtype mediated acute DAMGO inhibition of AC and DAMGO-induced sensitization of AC. The potency for DAMGO to stimulate sensitization was independent of the Gα i/o subtype, but the level of sensitization was increased in clones expressing higher levels of Gα i/o subunits. Sensitization of AC mediated by a component of fetal bovine serum, which was also dependent on the level of functional Gα i/o subunits in the cell, was observed. This serum-mediated sensitization partially masked mu-opioid-mediated sensitization when expressed as percentage overshoot due to an apparent increase in AC activity...|$|R

Ac and Ds excisions generate footprints in the donor T-DNA that support the hairpin model for transposon excision. Two complete integration events into genomic sugar beet DNA were obtained by IPCR. Integration of <b>Ac</b> <b>leads</b> to an eight bp duplication, while integration of Ds in a homologue of a sugar beet flowering locus gene did not induce a duplication.

40|$|Long term ageing {{experimental}} {{results show that}} degradation resulting from coupled DC and <b>AC</b> current waveforms <b>lead</b> to additional degradation of lithium-ion batteries above that experienced through pure DC cycling. More profoundly, such experiments show a dependency of battery degradation on the frequency of AC perturbation. This paper addresses the underlying causality of this frequency dependent degradation. Cell autopsy techniques, namely X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the negative electrode surface film, show growth of surface film components with the superimposition of an AC waveform. XPS results show that high frequency <b>AC</b> perturbations <b>lead</b> to the increased formation of a passivating film. In {{order to determine the}} cause of this increased film formation, a heterogeneous electrochemical model for the LiNiCoAlO 2 /C 6 lithium ion battery coupled with governing equations for the electrical double-layer and solid electrolyte interface film growth is developed. Simulation results suggest that the increased growth of surface film is attributed to frequency dependent heat generation. This is due to ion kinetics in the double layer which are governed by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Additional thermal and reference cell relaxation experiments are undertaken that further corroborates the conclusion that heat generation within the battery {{is a function of the}} AC excitation frequency through resistive dissipation and the entropy of the cell reaction...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{positron}} emission tomography/magnetic {{resonance imaging}} (PET/MR) scanners {{are one of}} the latest tools available in the field of medical imaging, and are expected to outperform the well-established PET/X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanners in a large range of fields. The perhaps largest challenge that has to be overcome before this can be achieved, is that of attenuation correction (AC) of the acquired PET images, as there is no direct relation between the MR image intensity of a tissue and its attenuating properties, {{as is the case in}} CT. This study investigated the performance of two PET AC methods provided with the biograph mMR PET/MR scanner installed at St. Olavs Hospital (Trondheim, Norway); one for head imaging based on an ultra-short echo-time (UTE) sequence, and one for whole-body imaging based on a Dixon sequence. These AC methods were compared to the `gold standard' of CT-based AC, based on activity concentrations in PET images from mMR examinations of lymphoma and lung cancer patients, corrected with the different AC methods (UTE, Dixon and CT). The results of the study show that the UTE-based <b>AC</b> method <b>leads</b> to an underestimation of PET activity in the brain of up to 9 % in the investigated regions of interest. This is caused by underestimation of bone in the cranial region. The exclusion of bone in the Dixon-based <b>AC</b> method <b>leads</b> to underestimation of PET activity in the thorax/abdomen, indicated by an underestimation of 4 % in the liver.

40|$|Cellular {{adaptation}} to microbial stresses {{has been demonstrated}} in several cell types. Macrophages (MФ) are sentinel immune cells fending off invading microbes. Anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) is a key virulence factor released by Bacillus anthracis that causes rapid cell death, pyroptosis. A small number of RAW 246. 7 macrophages (~ 4 %) exposed to a non-lethal dose of LeTx become resistant to LeTx-induced pyroptosis for ~ 4 weeks, termed “toxin-induced resistance (TIR) ”. Here, I showed that high levels of DNA methyl transferase 1 (DNMT 1) expression were maintained although global genomic methylation levels were not high in TIR. TIR cells treated with the DNMT inhibitor 5 -azacitidine or (si) RNA targeting DNMT 1 became susceptible to LeTx-induced pyroptosis. Knocking down DNMT 1 also increased expression of the mitochondrial cell death proteins Bnip 3 and Bnip 3 L involved in pyroptosis. However, DNA methylation of CpG islands in Bnip 3 and Bnip 3 L were not different between wild type and TIR cells. Among histone modification genes examined, histone deacetylase (HDAC) 8 was up-regulated in TIR cells. The HDAC inhibitor panobinostat or siRNAs against HDAC 8 rendered TIR cells sensitive to LeTx-induced pyroptosis and induced Bnip 3 and Bnip 3 L expression. Acetylation of histone H 3 lysine 27 (H 3 K 27 <b>Ac)</b> <b>leads</b> to binding of BNIP 3 to H 3, but this association was decreased in TIR cells.

This indicates that AC alone cannot contribute to increase in GT (Table 2). GT in addition, might potentially be influenced by medium chain length contribution of amylopectin (Miura et al. 2018).
