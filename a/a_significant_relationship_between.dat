25|$|A {{study of}} {{norepinephrine}} levels in gamblers found high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{levels of the}} norepinephrine (NE) metabolite 3-methoq-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MI-IPG). This could suggest {{a relationship between the}} noradrenergic system and gambling, and gambling could be seen as a reward-dependent behavior, but according to Cloninger’s theory these gamblers should exhibit low levels of NE, not high. Cloninger suggests that had these gamblers been retested after they had refrained from gambling for a determined period, their CSF MHPG levels might have been low. A study of norepinephrine levels in alcoholics with high reward dependence also showed a significant decrease of MHPG in their CSF. This finding demonstrates <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> reward dependence and norepinephrine.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{investigation}} into human CD36 as well. A study examined oral detection of fat in obese subjects with genetic bases for high, medium, and low expression of the CD36 receptor. Those subjects with high CD36 expression were eight times more sensitive to certain fats (oleic acid and triolein) than the subjects with low CD36 expression. Those subjects with an intermediate amount of CD36 expression were sensitive to fat at a level between {{the high and low}} groups. This study demonstrates that there is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> oral fat sensitivity and the amount of CD36 receptor expression, but further investigation into CD36 could be useful for learning more about lipid tasting in the context of obesity, as CD36 may be a target for therapies in the future.|$|E
25|$|Analysis {{revealed}} <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> {{the number}} of extended-duration work shifts and the reported rates of fatigue-related noteworthy medical errors. Specifically, {{the number of}} reported fatigue-related medical errors increased {{as the number of}} extended-duration shifts per month increased. At least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 3.8% of months with no extended-duration work shifts; and at least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 9.8% of months that had between one and four extended-duration work shifts and in 16% of months that had five or more extended-duration work shifts. Furthermore, the frequency of attentional failures was strongly associated with the frequency of extended-duration work shifts. Evidence from this study further corroborates the negative impact that extended-duration work shifts may have on performance, as well as increased accidents and injuries.|$|E
25|$|The Tremolite Asbestos Registry {{contains}} {{people who}} lived in or worked in Libby, Montana, while vermiculite was mined there; these people were at risk for exposure to the tremolite asbestos that was naturally occurring in the vermiculite. ATSDR began addressing public health concerns in Libby in 1999 and created the registry in 2004. The purpose of the registry was to monitor the long-term health effects of people in Libby exposed to tremolite asbestos and to assist with communicating important health information to registrants. Researchers have used the registry to study how asbestos exposure affects human health. This research has yielded several important findings. Registry data was used to conduct the first study of the relationship between asbestos exposure and respiratory problems in children. Another study using registry data found <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> asbestos exposure and death from cardiovascular disease.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the relationship among locus of control (LOC), religious orientation (RO) and test anxiety (TA) among Iranian EFL learners. Furthermore, it scrutinized the role of gender on these variables. To achieve such goals, 100 Iranian EFL students (57 females, 43 males) studying English at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman participated in the study. These students were randomly selected from junior and senior students majoring in English Translation and English Literature. In order to obtain the required data, three questionnaires were utilized: Rotters’s (1966) locus of control scale (LOCS) to measure participants’ level of LOC, Sarason’s (1975) test anxiety scale (TAS) to measure participants’ TA, and Allport and Ross’s (1967) religious orientation scale (ROS) to determine participants’ intrinsic or extrinsic religious orientation. For analysis of data, Pearson Product Moment Correlation and T-test were used. The results revealed that there was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> negative <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> ILOC and TA and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> ELOC and TA. Furthermore, there was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> ILOC and IRO and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> ELOC and ERO. Also, there was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> negative <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> ILOC and TA, and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> ELOC and TA.

25|$|Another {{method used}} to assess the amount and effects of water {{pollutants}} is to measure the amount of PM2.5 in rainfall. Measuring PM2.5 (the amount of aerodynamic diameter of particle≤2.5 μm in a given amount of air) is a common metric for assessing air quality. Comparing PM2.5 levels between air and rainfall samples allows scientists to determine the amount of air pollution being transferred to water sources. Pollutants in rainfall quickly and directly affect pollution in groundwater sources. In 2013, researchers in Beijing found <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the amount of PM2.5 concentrations in the air and in rainfall. Studies showed that rainfall had a significant “washing” effect on PM2.5 in the air, transferring a large portion of these pollutants from the air to water sources. In this way, Beijing’s notorious air pollution has a direct and significant impact on rainfall, and therefore, on water resources throughout the region.|$|E
500|$|In 2015 {{researchers}} Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb {{published a}} paper on their study into the effect of surnames on medical specialisation. They looked at 313,445 entries in the medical register from the General Medical Council, and identified surnames that were apt for the speciality, for example, Limb for an orthopaedic surgeon, and Doctor for medicine in general. They found that the frequency of names relevant to medicine and to subspecialties was much greater than expected by chance. Specialties that had the largest proportion of names specifically relevant to that specialty were those for which the English language has provided {{a wide range of}} alternative terms for the same anatomical parts (or functions thereof). Specifically, these were genitourinary medicine (e.g., Hardwick and Woodcock) and urology (e.g., Burns, Cox, Ball). Neurologists had names relevant to medicine in general, but far fewer had names directly relevant to their specialty (1 in every 302). Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb did not report on looking for any confounding variables. In 2010 Abel came to a similar conclusion. In one study he compared doctors and lawyers whose first or last names began with three-letter combinations representative of their professions, for example, [...] "doc", [...] "law", and likewise found <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> name and profession. Abel also found that the initial letters of physicians' last names were significantly related to their subspecialty. For example, Raymonds {{were more likely to be}} radiologists than dermatologists. Two separate studies by Krajick and Neimi in 2005, both analysing large samples of names of scientists, showed 1.35% of geologists having names referring to their field, and in political science, 1.26%.|$|E

[...] High total cholesterol levels, {{which may be}} caused by many factors, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, other indicators measuring cholesterol such as high total/HDL cholesterol ratio are more predictive than total serum cholesterol. [...] In a study of myocardial infarction in 52 countries, the ApoB/ApoA1 (related to LDL and HDL, respectively) ratio was the strongest predictor of CVD among all risk factors. [...] There are other pathways involving obesity, triglyceride levels, insulin sensitivity, endothelial function, and thrombogenicity, among others, that play a role in CVD, although it seems, {{in the absence of an}} adverse blood lipid profile, the other known risk factors have only a weak atherogenic effect.

2500|$|Bullying is abusive social {{interaction}} between peers which can include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted {{by those who}} are in a position of power over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> bullying and emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use and management of emotion as it relates to one's self and others. Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: [...] "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion". The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes. Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems {{to play an important role}} in both bullying behavior and victimization in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decorative}} {{similarities between}} the Sutton Hoo helmet and its Anglo-Saxon contemporaries are peripheral, if not substantial. The helmets from Wollaston and Shorwell were designed for use rather than display; the latter was almost entirely utilitarian, while the former, [...] "a sparsely decorated 'fighting helmet,'" [...] contained only a boar crest and sets of incised lines along its bands as decoration. Its boar crest finds parallel with that atop the Benty Grange helmet, the eyes on which are made of garnets [...] "set in gold sockets edged with filigree wire [...] [...] [...] and having hollow gold shanks [...] [...] [...] which were sunk into a hole" [...] in the head. Though superficially similar to the garnets and wire inlays on the Sutton Hoo helmet, the techniques employed to combine garnet, gold and filigree work are of a higher complexity more indicative of Germanic work. A helmet sharing more distinct similarities with the Sutton Hoo example is the one from Coppergate. It features a crest and eyebrows, both hatched {{in a manner that}} may reflect [...] "reminiscences or imitations of actual wire inlays" [...] akin to those on the Sutton Hoo helmet. The eyebrows and crests on both helmets further terminate in animal heads, though in a less intricate manner on the Coppergate helmet, where they take a more two-dimensional form. These similarities are likely indicative of [...] "a set of traditional decorative motifs which are more or less stable {{over a long period of}} rime," [...] rather than of <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the two helmets. Compared with the [...] "almost austere brass against iron of the Coppergate helmet," [...] the Sutton Hoo helmet, covered in tinned pressblech designs and further adorned with garnets, gilding, and inlaid silver wires, radiates [...] "a rich polychromatic effect." [...] Its appearance is substantially more similar to the Staffordshire helmet, which, while still undergoing conservation, has [...] "a pair of cheek pieces cast with intricate gilded interlaced designs along with a possible gold crest and associated terminals." [...] Like the Sutton Hoo helmet it was covered in pressblech foils, including a horseman and warrior motif so similar to design 3 as to have been initially taken for the same design.|$|E
