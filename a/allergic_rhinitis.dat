40|$|Background: No {{literature}} {{data are available}} on the skin reactivity of patients with respiratory atopy alone. Objective: Our purpose was to assess skin reactivity to detergents in patients with <b>allergic</b> asthma, <b>rhinitis,</b> or bath. Methods: The skin of the volar aspect of the forearm of 19 subjects with <b>allergic</b> asthma or <b>rhinitis</b> (or both) was challenged with a single exposure to 0. 5 % sodium lauryl sulfate. The skin response was evaluated by transepidermal water loss (TEWL), capacitance, and echogenicity measurements. Results were compared with those obtained in 19 patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and 20 healthy subjects. Results: In patients with AD preexposure TEWL values were higher than in healthy subjects, whereas capacitance values were lower. In this patient group, postexposure TEWL, capacitance, and echogenicity values showed more pronounced variations than in healthy subjects. Conversely, in patients with <b>allergic</b> asthma or <b>rhinitis</b> (or both), both baseline and post-exposure TEWL, capacitance, and echogenicity values were similar to those in healthy subjects. Conclusion: Patients with respiratory atopy without AD do not have the functional abnormalities characteristic of skin affected by AD, either under baseline conditions or after exposure to sodium lauryl sulfate...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{parasympathetic}} {{nervous system}} contributes to the pathophysiology of multiple forms of <b>allergic</b> and nonallergic <b>rhinitis.</b> Stimulation of the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} leads to glandular activation, which produces watery secretions. In excess, these secretions discharge from the anterior Nares and produce the symptom of watery anterior rhinorrhea. Method: Review of literature. Results: Treatment with topical, intranasal anticholinergic drugs inhibits activation of the nasal mucosal glands and is effective in reducing the watery secretions associated with parasympathetic stimulation of the glands with little, if any, effect on the symptoms of congestion and sneezing. In general, these drugs have no systemic adverse effects, but can cause crusting and local irritation. Conclusion: Anticholinergic drugs are useful {{for the treatment of}} anterior rhinorrhea associated with <b>allergic</b> and nonallergic <b>rhinitis.</b> Key Words: anticholinergic, atropine, ipratropium bromide, rhinitis, nonallergic rhiniti...|$|R
40|$|Abstract For decades, fungi {{have been}} {{recognized}} as associated with asthma and other reactive airway diseases. In contrast to type I-mediated allergies caused by pollen, fungi cause {{a large number of}} allergic diseases such as <b>allergic</b> bronchopulmonary mycoses, <b>rhinitis,</b> <b>allergic</b> sinusitis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Amongst the fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus is the most prevalent cause of severe pulmonary allergic disease, including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), known to be associated with chronic lung injury and deterioration in pulmonary function in people with chronic asthma and cystic fibrosis (CF). The goal of this review is to discuss new understandings of host-pathogen interactions in the genesis of allergic airway diseases caused by A. fumigatus. Host and pathogen related factors that participate in triggering the inflammatory cycle leading to pulmonary exacerbations in ABPA are discussed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Topical {{treatment}} of <b>allergic</b> or vasomotor <b>rhinitis</b> is possible {{by means of}} pressurized metered dose inhalers, aqueous spray, or dry powder inhalers. In children, {{little is known about}} nasal drug delivery by dry powder inhalation. The airflow through the device is critical for the drug release and a sufficient nasal inspiratory flow is needed for intranasal drug delivery from a dry powder inhaler. In order to investigate from what age children with <b>allergic</b> or vasomotor <b>rhinitis</b> can reliably use such a device, device-dependent nasal peak inspiratory flow (DnPIF) was measured. The maximal DnPIF was measured in children aged 4 - 13 years making use of a dry powder inhaler (Turbuhaler(R)) connected to a spirometer (Vitalograph(R)). In the clinically relevant context, instructions from the doctor and one week's use of a Turbuhaler at home were found to be sufficient to obtain a good inhalation technique and were shown to improve DnPIF at least as effectively as visual feedback training at the clinic. Children with rhinitis, as well as healthy children from the age of 6 years, were able to generate a DnPIF sufficient to obtain a reliable nasal delivery of a dry powder drug dose. DnPIF values correlated with age. Consequently, a recommendation to use a nasal Turbuhaler from the age of 6 for topical drug delivery in the {{treatment of}} <b>allergic</b> or vasomotor <b>rhinitis</b> seems reasonable...|$|R
50|$|Epicoccum nigrum {{produces}} the glycoprotein allergen Epi p 1 which binds to IgE, sometimes cross-reacting with other fungal allergens. Cross-reactivity {{was found to}} exist with Alternaria alternata, Curvularia lunata, Cladosporium herbarum, and Penicillium citrinum. Epicoccum nigrum is associated with respiratory fungal allergies, including <b>allergic</b> asthma, <b>rhinitis,</b> hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and allergic fungal sinusitis. Two pediatric cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by E. nigrum were reported in children living in a damp and mouldy home, with daily exposure to E. nigrum in the shower. The fungus has been found on human skin and in spit samples. It does not typically cause systemic infection, although one case {{has been reported in}} an immunocompromised patient.|$|R

40|$|Background: Environmental {{control has}} been put forward as an {{integral}} part of the management of house dust mite (HDM) allergy in sensitized patients. To validate this statement allergic disorders involved in HDM allergy - <b>allergic</b> asthma, <b>rhinitis</b> and atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (AEDS) - should be taken together and studied in terms of the efficacy of environmental control. Because a generic quality of life questionnaire exceeds the border of disease, this may be used as major outcome parameter. Research objective: To study the effects of bedding encasings in HDM allergic patients with asthma, rhinitis and AEDS. Material and methods: A total of 224 adult HDM <b>allergic</b> patients with <b>rhinitis</b> and/or asthma and/or dermatitis were randomly allocated impermeable or nonimpermeable encasings for mattress, pillow and duvet. Short form 36 (SF- 36) was filled in at baseline and after 12 months. Results: Lower physical (P = 0. 01) and emotional (P < 0. 001) sumscores were seen in females. Also, the presence of asthma resulted in lower physical sumscore (P = 0. 01). However, no effect was seen of encasings on either sumscore. Conclusion: Bedding encasings do not improve quality of life in a mixed population of subjects with combinations with rhinitis, asthma and atopic dermatitis and sensitized to HDMs...|$|R
40|$|Immunomodulators, {{including}} toll-like receptors (TLRs) and defensins, {{produced in}} response to pathogenic stimuli, can direct the developing immune system toward a TH 1 nonallergic phenotype. Increased human -defensin (HBD) 4 expression is associated with infection. Objective: To determine whether reduced mucosal levels of TLRs and defensins contribute to the inflammation seen in chronic <b>allergic</b> and nonallergic <b>rhinitis.</b> Methods: Real-time polymerase chain reaction {{was used to determine}} gene expression levels of HBDs 1 through 4 and TLRs 2 and 4. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to study the localization and distribution of protein for a-defensins 1 through 3, HBD 2, neutrophil elastase, and TLR 2 in sections of nasal turbinate tissue from adults with persistent <b>allergic</b> and idiopathic <b>rhinitis,</b> healthy nasal mucosa, and tonsil tissue. Results: Allergic mucosa showed a significant (P = 3 D. 02) reduction in TLR 2 messenger RNA expression compared with control mucosa and generally reduced expression for TLR 4 and HBDs. Although not significant, the nonallergic group also showed reduced expression for TLRs and HBDs. With the exception of HBD 4, increased target gene levels were seen in tonsil tissue. Protein expression of HBD 2 and TLR 2 was localized in lining and submucosal glandular epithelium but insignificant differences were seen for HBDs, TLRs, neutrophils, and a-defensin between the rhinitic and control patient groups. Conclusions: Subjects with <b>allergic</b> and nonallergic <b>rhinitis</b> show reduced TLR and HBD gene expression. The significant reduction in TLR 2 gene expression in allergic adults supports the concept that increased TLR 2 protects against the development of allergy. The low levels of HBD 4 detected in both rhinitis groups suggest lack of an underlying infection pathophysiological featur...|$|R
25|$|Before a {{diagnosis}} of allergic disease can be confirmed, other possible causes of the presenting symptoms should be considered.

40|$|SummaryAimThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the link between the severity of upper and lower airways diseases in mite allergic patients with respiratory allergy. Patients and methodA multicentre, observational, cross-sectional study was carried out in 556 consecutively enrolled mite <b>allergic</b> patients with <b>rhinitis</b> and asthma comorbidity attending a specialist unit. Severity assessment of rhinitis and asthma was evaluated in accordance with ARIA and GINA guidelines. ResultsReliable data were available for 518 patients. The distribution of rhinitis severity was: 15. 6 % mild intermittent rhinitis, 4. 4 % moderate-severe intermittent rhinitis, 30. 3 % mild persistent rhinitis and 49. 6 % moderate persistent rhinitis. The distribution of asthma severity was: 41. 3 % mild intermittent asthma, 14. 3 % mild persistent asthma, 19. 1 % moderate persistent asthma and 25. 3 % severe persistent asthma. In patients with moderate-severe persistent rhinitis (49. 5 %) a significant trend (p =  0. 005) was found pointing to an increased link with asthma severity.

40|$|Allergy is a {{hypersensitivity}} reaction initiated by immunological mechanisms. It can be IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated. Atopy is the inherited tendency to produce increased amounts of IgE {{in response to}} small quantities of allergen, which can produce clinical syndromes.
