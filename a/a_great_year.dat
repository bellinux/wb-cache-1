25|$|An astrological {{age is a}} {{time period}} in astrology that {{parallels}} {{major changes in the}} development of Earth's inhabitants, particularly relating to culture, society and politics, and there are twelve astrological ages corresponding to the twelve zodiacal signs. Astrological ages occur because of a phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes, and one complete period of this precession is called <b>a</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Year</b> or Platonic Year of about 25,920 years.|$|E
25|$|A symphonic {{band that}} would have <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>year</b> in 1976 was ALAS. Their music was even more {{intellectual}} and unorthodox. ALAS would feature artists such as Rodolfo Mederos and Pedro Aznar. Luis Alberto Spinetta would begin his third band Invisible later in that year. Their symphonic sound tinged with tango would bring critical praise. A band that showed a lot of promise that never materialised was Reino de Munt. Formed by Raul Porchetto, it featured a young Alejandro Lerner, and musicians like Gustavo Basterrica and Frank Ojsterseck.|$|E
25|$|For the 1987 season, {{the main}} sponsor became Superconfex. In that year, {{the team was}} officially known as Superconfex– Kwantum– Yoko– Colnago. Jan Raas {{remained}} the team leader. After a victory in Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne for Ludo Peeters, the new sprinter Jean-Paul van Poppel (coming from the Skala cycling team) gave the team <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>year,</b> with three stage wins in the Tour de France (of which two for van Poppel) and the victory in the points classification in the Tour de France for Jean-Paul van Poppel. Joop Zoetemelk ended his career with {{a victory in the}} Amstel Gold Race.|$|E

25|$|Frank Williams {{had been}} a motor-racing enthusiast since a young age, and after a career in saloon cars and Formula Three, backed by Williams' shrewd {{instincts}} as a dealer in racing cars and spares, he realised he'd reached his peak as a driver and started entering other drivers, in particular his friend and sometime flatmate Piers Courage. After Williams backed Courage in a successful 1968 Formula Two season, he purchased a Brabham Formula One car for Courage in 1969. This allegedly angered Jack Brabham, as the car had been sold to Williams {{with the expectation that}} it would be used in the Tasman Series and then converted to Formula 5000. Courage in fact had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>year,</b> taking second place at both the Monaco and US Grands Prix.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with {{new life in}} 1994–95. Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists in his rookie season, and {{led the league in}} triple-doubles. Roy Tarpley was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points, but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February which caused him to miss the remainder of the regular season. Second-year forward Popeye Jones had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>year</b> as well, as he averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds.|$|E
25|$|The Astros {{were playing}} great {{baseball}} throughout the season. José Cruz and Enos Cabell both stole 30 bases. Joe Niekro had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>year</b> with 21 wins and 3.00 ERA. J. R. Richard won 18 games {{and set a}} new personal strikeout record at 313. Joe Sambito came into his own with 22 saves as the Astros closer. Things were going as they should {{for a team that}} could win the west. The Astros and Reds battled the final month of the season. The Reds pulled ahead of the Astros by a game and a half. Later that month they split a pair and the Reds kept the lead. That would be how it would end. The Astros finished with their best record to that point at 89–73 and 1½ games behind the NL winner Reds.|$|E

25|$|After a {{few months}} of being together, happy and in love, Robin has a {{pregnancy}} scare. Although the test is negative, she realizes she wants different things from life than Patrick. She wants more from him (children), while he is happy just the way they are. They eventually break up. Robin wants to be a mother and decides to be a single mom. She and her friend, Dr. Kelly Lee (Minae Noji), put a list of possible sperm donors together. Robin picks people in Port Charles, because she feels that they have redeeming qualities she will like to pass on to her child, and does not like the idea of her child's father being a stranger. On November 30, 2007, Patrick tells Robin that he still loves and misses her. He just wants them to be together again and asks her to table the discussion of children for a year, and while she has stated that she has never been happier than when she was with him, she knows nothing would be different in a year - she would still want kids and he would not, to which he sadly replies that she is probably right, {{but it would have been}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
25|$|Greece had to {{wait for}} the EuroBasket 2001 in order to make its {{comeback}} to the international scene. The team obviously {{was in the middle of}} a transition period, during which young stars Theo Papaloukas, Antonis Fotsis, and Lazaros Papadopoulos were unable to build a highly competitive team right away. Alvertis, coming off <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>year</b> with Panathinaikos, and Giorgos Sigalas, had to show to the young generation the road to success. The first game against Italy, the reigning champion, proved that Alvertis was ready to fulfill his role. A buzzer-beating three pointer gave Greece a very impressive 83–82 win. The team, however, had not reached the level of a medal contender yet. The 105–82 loss against Russia in the next game confirmed that. Consequently, in order to reach the quarter finals, Greece's game against rising power Germany appeared to be a difficult task. After leading the game by 22, the Greek team actually collapsed against superstar Dirk Nowitzki and his teammates, giving Germany an 80–75 win. Alvertis averaged 16 points in the tournament, but Greece ended up in ninth place. It was his last opportunity to reach success with the national team as its leader, especially since Greece had not qualified for the 2002 FIBA World Championship. The transition period for the young generation was soon going to be over.|$|E
500|$|Afterward, Johnson began celebrating {{his fifth}} {{consecutive}} Sprint Cup Series championship. During the celebration, Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus commented, [...] "I think finally, finally after pulling this off Jimmie {{will get the}} respect that he deserves. Knowing {{what we had to}} do— come down here and beat them— and we beat them." [...] Hamlin, the points leader before the race, described his disappointment by saying, [...] "I’m disappointed. Our car was lightning fast until that last wreck. When we hit the 16 (Biffle) that knocked the toe-in out. It wasn’t as fast after that. It’s just circumstances but we had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>year.</b> We won the most races (8) and we contended like we have never contended before but circumstances took us out of this one. I don’t think the 48 (Johnson) showed the strength this year like they did in the past and that opened the door for the rest of us." [...] Harvick, who finished third in points, stated: ...|$|E

500|$|In the Solar System, {{the planets}} and the Sun lie roughly {{within the same}} flat plane, known as {{the plane of the}} ecliptic. From our {{perspective}} on Earth, the ecliptic is the path taken by the Sun across the sky {{over the course of the}} year. The twelve constellations that line the ecliptic are known as the zodiacal constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called [...] "precession", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a spinning top wobbles as it slows down. Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called <b>a</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Year,</b> the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac. In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the March equinox, one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation Pisces moving back into Aquarius. This signaled the end of one astrological age (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the Age of Aquarius).|$|E

2500|$|... 1864 was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>year</b> for George Griffith. Regarded at {{the time}} as the biggest hitter in cricket, he played {{seventeen}} first-class matches and scored 489 runs. His left-handed round-arm fast bowling was also very highly thought of, and he took 69 wickets that season – although some of them came via slow lobs. That figure was supplemented by 26 catches, more {{than anyone else in the}} country. The previous season he had been even more successful with the bat, though rather less so with the ball, and made his highest score of 142 against Sussex at Hove.|$|E

I was confused, it started to feel like fulfilling a commitment where the game had changed. It was interesting, I’m still sort of unpacking that experience. We all had to sign confidentiality agreements, so I can’t really talk about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1997–98 was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>year</b> for the club. Emley {{knocked out}} Morecambe in the First Round of the FA Cup. In the Second Round they faced, Lincoln City {{and after a}} replay and extra-time, Emley won the tie 4–3. They faced off against West Ham United who were 8th in the Premier League. The game was {{broadcast}} on Match of the Day. The match ended 2–1 with Paul David scoring for Emley, Frank Lampard and John Hartson grabbed the two Hammers goals (The team that day also featured Rio Ferdinand). The season was rounded off with the club's eighth Sheffield Cup win against Parkgate. The season also saw the club finish sixth in the NPL.|$|E

[...] Mike Piazza, who finished second to Walker in the 1997 NL MVP voting, commented the same year that [...] "Walker is a great player having <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>year.</b> [...] He plays in a great hitter's park, and I think it's unfortunate that some of their players don't get the credit they deserve because of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|But {{other stars}} on the 49ers' offense began to emerge, {{enabling}} the team to spread the ball around.
