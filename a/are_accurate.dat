40|$|The {{probability}} {{density of the}} integrated output of a photomultiplier tube (PMT) is approximated by the Gaussian, Rayleigh, and Gamma probability densities. The accuracy of the approximations depends on the signal energy alpha: the Gamma distribution <b>is</b> <b>accurate</b> for all alpha, the Raleigh distribution <b>is</b> <b>accurate</b> for small alpha (approximate or less than 1 photon) and the Gaussian distribution <b>is</b> <b>accurate</b> for large alpha (approximate or greater than 10 photons) ...|$|R

5|$|In 2010 the Land Transport Authority began {{exploring}} {{the potential of}} Global Navigation Satellite System as a technological option for a second generation ERP.

5|$|Because of its asymmetry, the {{reaction}} between 249Cf and 50Ti was predicted {{to be the}} most favorable practical reaction for synthesizing unbinilium, although it is also somewhat cold, and is further away from the neutron shell closure at N = 184 {{than any of the other}} three reactions attempted. No unbinilium atoms were identified, implying a limiting cross-section of 200fb. Jens Volker Kratz predicted the actual maximum cross-section for producing unbinilium by any of these reactions to be around 0.1fb; in comparison, the world record for the smallest cross section of a successful reaction was 30fb for {{the reaction}} 209Bi(70Zn,n)278Nh, and Kratz predicted a maximum cross-section of 20fb for producing the neighbouring ununennium. If these predictions <b>are</b> <b>accurate,</b> then synthesizing ununennium would be at the limits of current technology, and synthesizing unbinilium would require new methods.|$|E
5|$|Drivers from a {{total of}} 40 {{different}} countries have entered a World Championship race. The United Kingdom is the most heavily represented with 161 drivers. Second is the United States with 158; between 1950 and 1960 the American Indianapolis 500 race, rarely contested by drivers from outside the United States, {{was part of the}} World Drivers' Championship. Third is Italy with 99. Nine of these countries were represented in the very first race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, and the most recent newly represented country is Indonesia, with Rio Haryanto making his debut at the 2016 Australian Grand Prix. Statistics <b>are</b> <b>accurate</b> as of the 2017 Mexican Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{the above}} details <b>are</b> <b>accurate</b> or not, {{it is clear}} that Svein, Olaf the Swede and Eirik had ample reason to oppose Olaf Tryggvason. Olaf had taken control of Viken in south Norway, an area long under Danish overlordship. Olaf and Svein had been in England together, but Olaf had made peace while Svein kept campaigning. Svein was on {{friendly}} terms with Olaf the Swede and connected to him by marriage, so the two were natural allies. Finally, Jarl Eirik had been driven from his patrimony by Olaf Tryggvason, as arguably had his father, Jarl Hakon, whom he may have wished to avenge.|$|E

25|$|For today's botanists, Ellis Rowan’s {{painting}} {{has limited}} scientific research value {{because they are}} lacking the critical details that {{is necessary for the}} botanical illustrations.

Although Ellis confessed that she knew very little about plants, she maintained her passion and love to discovering the botanical world, dried many specimens as her collections.|$|E
25|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} as possible reasons for sex-selective abortion. Culture is favored by some researchers, while some favor disparate gender-biased access to resources. Some demographers question whether sex-selective abortion or infanticide claims <b>are</b> <b>accurate,</b> because underreporting of female births may also explain high sex ratios. Natural reasons may also {{explain some of the}} abnormal sex ratios. Klasen and Wink suggest India and China’s high sex ratios are primarily the result of sex-selective abortion.|$|E

25|$|When the {{surfaces}} are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes {{a very poor}} approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even {{when there is no}} normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships <b>are</b> <b>accurate</b> enough to be useful in many applications.|$|E
25|$|A feature-length film, The New World (2005), {{directed}} by Terrence Malick, covers {{the story of}} Jamestown's colonization. Although the historical details <b>are</b> <b>accurate</b> in most ways, the plot focuses on a dramatized relationship between John Smith, played by Colin Farrell, and Pocahontas, played by Q'orianka Kilcher. It also features John Rolfe, played by Christian Bale. Many scenes were filmed on-location along the James and Chickahominy Rivers and at Henricus Historical Park in Chesterfield County, Virginia.|$|E

If one product has a much higher availability of data, it cannot be justly compared to another product which has less detailed data.|$|E
