[...] Andrew Rennie of Now considered it the album's strongest track and noted Ciara and Elliott's [...] "trademark chemistry". IGN's Finn White wrote that the song [...] "will make all the bad girls sweat on the dance floor". In his review of Fantasy Ride, Marrio Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote that [...] "Love Sex Magic" [...] is a [...] "dance-floor corker", and noted that [...] "Work" [...] is [...] "similarly club-ready", referring both songs to as [...] "ultra-catchy". Regarding [...] "Work", Tarradell wrote, [...] "The rapid-fire 'work, work, work' refrain will bond to your head <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>with</b> Krazy Glue." [...] Writing for Metro Weekly, Doug Rule called the song an [...] "instant classic" [...] and referred it to as a [...] "sequel of sorts to Elliott's marvelous 2002 hit 'Work It'."

2500|$|Scipio Africanus (235–183). His {{father a}} Roman general died at war in Hispania; years earlier his son Publius Cornelius Scipio (later Africanus) had saved his life. As {{then no one}} offered to succeed to his father's post, the son offered himself. The people's comitia {{accepted}} the son for the father, [...] "all this made a wonderful and indelible impression on the citizens and farmers of Rome." [...] Publius Scipio [...] "himself enthusiastic" [...] about others, accordingly [...] "inspired enthusiasm." [...] The Roman Senate acquiesqued to the mere military tribune serving {{in place of a}} praetor or consul, i.e., his father. [...] "He was not {{one of the few who}} by their energy and iron will constrain the world to adopt and to move in new paths for centuries, or who at any rate grasp the reins of destiny for years till its wheels roll over them." [...] Though he won battles and conquored nations, and became a prominent statesman at Rome, he was not an Alexander or a Caesar. [...] "Yet a special charm lingers around the form of that graceful hero; it is surrounded, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>with</b> a dazzling halo... in which Scipio with mingled credulity and adroitness always moved." [...] His enthusiasm warmed the heart, but he did not forget the vulgar, nor fail to follow his calculations. [...] "ot naïve enough to share the belief of the multitude in his inspirations... yet in secret thoroughly persuaded that he was a man specially favored of the gods." [...] He would accept merely to be an ordinary king, but yet the Republic's constitution applied even to heroes such as him. [...] "o confident of his own greatness that he knew nothing of envy or of hatred, [...] courteously acknowledged other men's merits, and compassionately forgave other men's faults." [...] After his war-ending victory over Hannibal at Zama, he was called Africanus. He was an excellent army officer, a refined diplomat, an accomplished speaker, combining Hellenic culture with Roman. [...] "He won the hearts of soldiers and of women, of his countrymen and of the Spaniards, of his rivals in the senate and of his greater Carthaginian antagonist. His name was soon on every one's lips, and his was the star which seemed destined to bring victory and peace to his country." [...] Yet his nature seemed to contain [...] "strange mixtures of genuine gold and glittering tinsel." [...] It was said he set [...] "the fashion to the nobility in arogance, title-hunting, and client-making." [...] In his politics Scipio Africanus [...] "sought support for his personal and almost dynastic opposition to the senate in the multitude." [...] No demagogue, however, he remained content to merely be [...] "the first burgess of Rome".|$|E
2500|$|Harald Høffding {{wrote an}} article about him in A brief history of modern {{philosophy}} (1900). Høffding mentioned Kierkegaard in Philosophy of Religion 1906, and the American Journal of Theology (1908) printed an article about Hoffding's Philosophy of Religion. Then Høffding repented of his previous convictions in The problems of philosophy (1913). Høffding was also {{a friend of the}} American philosopher William James, and although James had not read Kierkegaard's works, as they were not yet translated into English, he attended the lectures about Kierkegaard by Høffding and agreed with much of those lectures. James' favorite quote from Kierkegaard came from Høffding: [...] "We live forwards but we understand backwards". William James wrote:"We live forward, we understand backward, said a Danish writer; and to understand life by concepts is to arrest its movement, cutting it up into bits <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>with</b> scissors, and, immobilizing these in our logical [...] where, comparing them as dried specimens, we can ascertain which of them statically includes or excludes which other. This treatment supposes life to have already accomplished itself, for the concepts, being so many views taken after the fact, are retrospective and post mortem. Nevertheless, we can draw conclusions from them and project them into the future. We cannot learn from them how life made itself go, or how it will make itself go; but, on the supposition that its ways of making itself go are unchanging, we can calculate what positions of imagined arrest it will exhibit hereafter under given conditions." [...] William James, A Pluralistic Universe, 1909, p. 244 Kierkegaard wrote of moving forward past the irresolute good intention:The yes of the promise is sleep-inducing, but the no, spoken and therefore audible to oneself, is awakening, and repentance is usually not far away. The one who says, [...] "I will, sir," [...] is at the same moment pleased with himself; the one who says no becomes almost afraid of himself. But this difference if very significant in the first moment and very decisive in the next moment; yet if the first moment is the judgment of the momentary, the second moment is the judgment of eternity. This is precisely why the world is so inclined to promises, inasmuch as the world is the momentary, and at the moment a promise looks very good. This is why eternity is suspicious of promises, just as it is suspicious of everything momentary. And so it is also with the one who, rich in good intentions and quick to promise, moves backward further and further away from the good. By means of the intention and the promise, he is facing {{in the direction of the}} good, is turned toward the good but is moving backward further and further away from it. With every renewed intention and promise it looks as if he took a step forward, and yet he is not merely standing still, but he is actually taking a step backward. The intention taken in vain, the unfulfilled promise, leaves despondency, dejection, that in turn perhaps soon blazes up into an even more vehement intention, which leaves only greater listlessness. Just as the alcoholic continually needs a stronger and stronger stimulant-in order to become intoxicated, likewise the one who has become addicted to promises and good intentions continually needs more and more stimulation-in order to go backward. Søren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, Hong p. 93-94 (1850) ...|$|E
