The book portrayed Nielsen as a popular actor {{with a long history}} of prestigious films.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{legacies}} of colonial rule in Kasai was the arbitrary redivision of the population into new ethnic groups. Despite the shared language (Tshiluba) {{and culture of the}} two groups, colonial administrators believed the inhabitants of the Lulua river area to be ethnically different from the Baluba and dubbed them the Bena Lulua. The colonists believed the Baluba to be more intelligent, hardworking and open to new ideas than the Bena Lulua who were believed to be more reactionary <b>and</b> <b>stupid.</b> As a result, from the 1930s, the state began to treat the two groups differently and applied different policies to each and promoted the Baluba to positions above other ethnicities.|$|E

25|$|Allenby {{returned}} to Britain in 1890 and he sat– and failed– the entry exam for the Staff College in Camberley. Not deterred, he sat the exam {{again the next}} year and passed. Captain Douglas Haig of the 7th Hussars also entered the Staff College at the same time, thus beginning a rivalry between the two that ran until the First World War. Allenby was more popular with fellow officers, even being made Master of the Draghounds in preference to Haig who was the better rider; Allenby had already developed a passion for polo. Their contemporary James Edmonds later claimed that the staff at Staff College thought Allenby dull <b>and</b> <b>stupid</b> but were impressed by a speech that he gave to the Farmers' Dinner, which had in fact been written for him by Edmonds and another.|$|E

Craig is wealthier than the other characters, and mocks them with stereotypes about northerners as poor <b>and</b> <b>stupid.</b> For one critic, {{the significance of the}} north/south divide in the episode means {{that it could have been}} called [...] "Revenge of the Northerners".|$|E

500|$|Achebe {{started to}} explore the school's [...] "wonderful library". There he {{discovered}} Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery (1901), the autobiography of an American former slave; Achebe [...] "found it sad, but it showed him another dimension of reality". He also read classic novels, such as Gulliver's Travels (1726), David Copperfield (1850), and Treasure Island (1883), together with tales of colonial derring-do such as H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain (1887) and John Buchan's Prester John (1910). Achebe later recalled that, as a reader, he [...] "took sides with the white characters against the savages" [...] and even developed a dislike for Africans.

Yet, she wrote {{to him in a}} poem, [...] "You have neither read my book, nor won my love." [...] In her diary she records having to avoid advances from Michinaga—one night he sneaked into her room, stealing a newly written chapter of Genji. However, Michinaga's patronage was essential if she was to continue writing. Murasaki described his daughter's court activities: the lavish ceremonies, the complicated courtships, the [...] "complexities of the marriage system", and in elaborate detail, the birth of Shōshi's two sons.|$|E

Varietys Scott Foundas also {{wrote that the}} film [...] "doesn't have an original bone in its body or a compelling thought in its head" [...] and called it [...] "insufferable", [...] "self-conscious" [...] and [...] "smug". Olly Richards of Empire gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and described it as [...] "a tragic waste of acting talent, with nothing new to say." [...] The A.V.

500|$|Richardson {{returned}} to the Malvern Festival in August 1932. He was in four plays, the last of which, Bernard Shaw's Too True to Be Good, transferred to the New Theatre in London the following month. The play was not liked by audiences and ran for only forty-seven performances, but Richardson, in Agate's phrase, [...] "ran away with the piece", and {{established himself as a}} West End star. In 1933 he had his first speaking part in a film, playing the villain, Nigel Hartley, in The Ghoul, which starred Cedric Hardwicke and Boris Karloff. The following year he was cast in his first starring role in a film, as the hero in The Return of Bulldog Drummond. The Times commented, [...] "Mr Ralph Richardson makes Drummond as brave <b>and</b> <b>stupid</b> on the screen as he is in print." ...|$|E

[...] However, they later find her resting {{at the foot of a}} statue of Mishakal (the Goddess of Healing), which now bears the Blue Crystal Staff, and Goldmoon is blessed with true clerical powers. The Companions leave with the Disks of Mishakal. Bupu gives an ancient spellbook (formerly belonging to the archmage Fistandantilus) to Raistlin.

[...] The Confucian principle of [...] "ritual propriety" [...] or [...] "ceremony" [...] (lǐ [...] ) is seen as governing all actions, including war, and to bring bad consequences if transgressed. [...] However, the observance of li is never shown as guaranteeing victory, and the Zuo zhuan includes many examples of the good and innocent suffering senseless violence.
