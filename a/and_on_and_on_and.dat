500|$|Bear called City at the End of Time his [...] "longest {{and most}} ambitious science fiction novel" [...] {{he has written}} for a while. He said it is a [...] "significant departure" [...] from any of his {{previous}} works, {{and that it has}} a future history unlike anything he had tackled before. In an interview with Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine in September 2008, Bear said that what inspired him to write City at the End of Time was the question, [...] "What if we're still primitive in our thinking ?", and this led to the idea for a story of [...] "a Universe that goes on <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> how reality might have to be changed by that circumstance." ...|$|E

That little path there by the clipped edge goes up to the highroad. I want to go up that path and to walk along the highroad, and so on <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> to know all kinds of people. Did you ever think that the roads are the only things that are endless; that one can walk on <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> never be stopped by a gate or a wall? They are the serpent of eternity. I wonder they have never been worshipped. What are the stars beside them? They never meet one another. The roads are the only things that are infinite.

Nixon was succeeded by Vice President Gerald Ford as President, who on September 8, 1974, issued a full and unconditional pardon of Nixon, immunizing him from prosecution for any crimes he had “committed or may have committed or taken part in” as president.

Guy only shared the common fate of all new-comers to [...] "the fields" [...] in feeling much distressed and really ill. The very horses in the cart snorted and sneezed and showed their high displeasure by trying {{every now and then}} to jib and turn back again. Here and there, on either side, to right and left, where the gloom {{permitted}} it, Guy made out dimly a few round or oblong tents, with occasional rude huts of corrugated iron. A few uncertain figures lounged vaguely in the background. On closer inspection they proved to be much-grimed and half-naked natives, resting their weary limbs on piles of dry dust after their toil in the diggings.|$|E
60|$|One such man Daylight {{danced with}} that night. Among frontiersmen {{it has always}} been a test of {{endurance}} for one man to whirl another down; and when Ben Davis, the faro-dealer, a gaudy bandanna on his arm, got Daylight in a Virginia reel, the fun began. The reel broke up and all fell back to watch. Around and around the two men whirled, always in the one direction. Word was passed on into the big bar-room, and bar and gambling tables were deserted. Everybody wanted to see, and they packed and jammed the dance-room. The musicians played on <b>and</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> on the two men whirled. Davis was skilled at the trick, and on the Yukon he had put many a strong man on his back. But after a few minutes it was clear that he, and not Daylight, was going.|$|E
60|$|That is {{the reason}} why you should always be sure that a story you repeat is a good story. Then you will be glad to have it travel on <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> will never want to call it back. But if you tell a story that isn't true or nice, the time is almost sure to come when you will want to call it back and cannot. You see stories are just like rivers,--they run on and on forever. Little Mrs. Peter Rabbit knew this, and that is why she advised Peter not to tell any one else the strange story he had told her of the dreadful {{creature}} without legs or head or tail that had chased him in the Green Forest. Peter knew by that that she didn't believe a word of it, but he was too tired and sleepy to argue with her then, so he settled himself comfortably for a nice long nap.|$|E

However,' said Miss La Creevy, relapsing into the cheerful, chattering tone, which was habitual to her, 'I have said my say, and a very long say it is, and a very wrong say too, I shouldn't wonder at all.

Ye Crow was very, very sick, as you may quickly see By just looking at ye picture th't is drawn h're by me.

The great, heavy, stone balconies, one above another, and tier over tier: with here and there, one larger than the rest, towering high up--a huge marble platform; the doorless vestibules, massively barred lower windows, immense public staircases, thick marble pillars, strong dungeon-like arches, and dreary, dreaming, echoing vaulted chambers: among which the eye wanders again, and again, and again, as every palace is succeeded by another--the terrace gardens between house and house, with green arches of the vine, and groves of orange-trees, and {{blushing}} oleander in full bloom, twenty, thirty, forty feet above the street--the painted halls, mouldering, and blotting, and rotting in the damp corners, and still shining out in beautiful colours and voluptuous designs, where the walls are dry--the faded figures on the outsides of the houses, holding wreaths, and crowns, and flying upward, and downward, and standing in niches, and here and there looking fainter and more feeble than elsewhere, by contrast with some fresh little Cupids, who on a more recently decorated portion of the front, are stretching out {{what seems to be}} the semblance of a blanket, but is, indeed, a sun-dial- -the steep, steep, up-hill streets of small palaces (but very large palaces for all that), with marble terraces looking down into close by-ways--the magnificent and innumerable Churches; and the rapid passage from a street of stately edifices, into a maze of the vilest squalor, steaming with unwholesome stenches, and swarming with half-naked children and whole worlds of dirty people--make up, altogether, such a scene of wonder: so lively, and yet so dead: so noisy, and yet so quiet: so obtrusive, and yet so shy and lowering: so wide awake, and yet so fast asleep: that it is a sort of intoxication to a stranger to walk on, <b>and</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> look about him.
