5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> down at them. The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E

500|$|... "Conflict Resolution" [...] was {{the fifth}} episode of the series written by Greg Daniels, {{who is also the}} {{executive}} producer and show runner for The Office. The episode was the third of the series directed by Charles McDougall; he had previously directed the earlier season two episodes [...] "Christmas Party" [...] and [...] "Dwight's Speech". The episode features Angela and Oscar arguing over Angela's poster of two babies playing saxophones. [...] Jenna Fischer said that [...] "As a cast, the baby poster is one of our favorite props... Angela received the poster from her Secret Santa in the Christmas episode." [...] Fischer {{went on to say that}} [...] "I had to stand in between Angela and Oscar as they bicker about the poster while Michael tries to mediate the situation. The whole time, the cute jazz babies <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> at me from the poster. It was hilarious!" ...|$|E

500|$|Lester's fantasies are {{emphasized}} by slow- and repetitive-motion shots; Mendes uses double-and-triple cutbacks in several sequences, and the score alters {{to make the}} audience aware that it is entering a fantasy. One example is the gymnasium scene—Lester's first encounter with Angela. While the cheerleaders perform their half-time routine to [...] "On Broadway", Lester becomes increasingly fixated on Angela. Time slows to represent his [...] "voyeuristic hypnosis" [...] and Lester begins to fantasize that Angela's performance is for him alone. [...] "On Broadway"—which provides a conventional underscore to the onscreen action—is replaced by discordant, percussive music that lacks melody or progression. This nondiegetic score is important to creating the narrative stasis in the sequence; it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length. The effect is one that Stan Link likens to [...] "vertical time", described by the composer and music theorist Jonathan Kramer as music that imparts [...] "a single present stretched out into an enormous duration, a potentially infinite 'now' that nonetheless feels like an instant". The music is used like a visual cue, so that Lester and the score <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> at Angela. The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of [...] "On Broadway" [...] and teleological time.|$|E

60|$|This, this is death, indeed; {{the death}} of sin; the death in which human beings may go on for years, walking, eating, and drinking; worse than those who walk in their sleep, and see nothing, though their eyes <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> wide.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know, sahib. When I went to him, {{he did not}} move. He {{was wide}} awake, and his eyes <b>are</b> <b>staring.</b> When I went beside him, {{he shook his head}} a little, and said, 'S-s-s-h.' He seems quite rigid, and is as pale as death." ...|$|E

6000|$|I ran on and on, still spared this spectacle, but {{saying to}} myself: [...] "I shall {{see it at}} the turn of the road; they never can pass that turn alive." [...] When I came in sight of that turn I saw two wagons there bunched together--one of them full of people. I said, [...] "Just so--they <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> petrified at the remains." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} bigger coming," [...] he said. [...] "Here {{everything seems to}} be going on much the same, but over there you feel it. Something growing silently out of all this blood and mud. I find myself wondering what the men <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> at, but when I look there's nothing as far as my field- glasses will reach but waste and desolation. And it isn't only on the faces of our own men. It's {{in the eyes of the}} prisoners too. As if they saw something. A funny ending to the war, if the people began to think." ...|$|E

60|$|MARTELLUS. Not at all. If {{they were}} alive they would tell the truth. You can provoke them to tell any silly lie; and you can foresee {{exactly the sort of}} lie they will tell. Give them a clip below the knee, and they will jerk their foot forward. Give them a clip in their appetites or vanities or any of their lusts and greeds, and they will boast and lie, and affirm and deny, and hate and love without the {{slightest}} regard to the facts that <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> them in the face, or to their own obvious limitations. That proves that they are automata.|$|E
6000|$|SCENE--The firemen's forecastle. Yank's watch {{has just}} come off duty and had dinner. Their faces and bodies shine from a soap and water {{scrubbing}} but around their eyes, where a hasty dousing does not touch, the coal dust sticks like black make-up, giving them a queer, sinister expression. Yank has not washed either face or body. He stands out in contrast to them, a blackened, brooding figure. He is seated forward {{on a bench in}} the exact attitude of Rodin's [...] "The Thinker." [...] The others, most of them smoking pipes, <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> at Yank half-apprehensively, as if fearing an outburst; half-amusedly, as if they saw a joke somewhere that tickled them.|$|E
60|$|At last {{you reach}} the front line trench. On an {{offensive}} sector it has none of the architectural interest of first line trenches at such places as Soissons or Arras. It was made {{a week or so}} ago by joining up shell craters, and if all goes well we move into the German trench along by the line of scraggy trees, at which we peep discreetly, to-morrow night. We can peep discreetly because just at present our guns are putting shrapnel over the enemy at the rate of about three shells a minute, the puffs follow each other up and down the line, and no Germans <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> out to see us.|$|E

6000|$|I am now {{comparatively}} safe. The shacks think I am ditched. But {{the long}} {{day and the}} strenuous night are beginning to tell on me. Also, {{it is not so}} windy nor cold underneath, and I begin to doze. This will never do. Sleep on the rods spells death, so I crawl out at a station and go forward to the second blind. Here I can lie down and sleep; and here I do sleep--how long I do not know--for I am awakened by a lantern thrust into my face. The two shacks <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> at me. I scramble up on the defensive, wondering as to which one is going to make the first [...] "pass" [...] at me. But slugging is far from their minds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Confetti--that's {{the little}} {{pink and white}} and blue things--plenty o' that," [...] and she added fiercely: [...] "My own brother didn' know me--let alone my girl. How should she?--I haven't seen her {{since she was a}} baby--she was a laughin' little thing," [...] and she gazed past me with that look in the eyes as of people who <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> back into the bygone. [...] "I guess we was laughin' when we got her. 'Twas just here--summer-time. I 'ad the moon in my blood that night, right enough." [...] Then, turning her eyes on my face, she added: [...] "That's what a girl will 'ave, you know, once in a while, and like as not it'll du for her. Only thirty-five now, I am, an' pretty nigh the end o' my tether. What can you expect?--I'm a gay woman. Did for me right enough. Her father's dead, tu." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{door opens}} softly. Newte steals in. He fumbles {{his way across}} to the windows, draws the blinds. The morning sun streams in. He listens--no {{one seems to be}} stirring. He goes out, returns {{immediately}} with a butler's tray, containing all things necessary for a breakfast and the lighting of a fire. He places the tray on table, throws his coat over a chair, and is on his knees busy lighting the fire, when enter the Misses Wetherell, clad in dressing-gowns and caps: yet still they continue to look sweet. They also creep in, hand in hand. The crouching Newte is hidden by a hanging fire- screen. They creep forward till the coat hanging over the chair catches their eye. They <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> at it as Robinson Crusoe might at the footprint, when Newte rises suddenly and turns. The Misses Wetherell give a suppressed scream, and are preparing for flight.|$|E
