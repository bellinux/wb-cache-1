5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like {{situations}} should be treated alike. Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> discriminated against, and all persons not discriminated against <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> not discriminated against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> immune from it. The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where {{all members of the}} Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally.|$|E
5|$|The Agaonidae (fig wasps) are {{the only}} pollinators of nearly 1000 species of figs, and thus are crucial to the {{survival}} of their host plants. Since the wasps <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> dependent on their fig trees for survival, the coevolved relationship is fully mutualistic.|$|E

Marathi speaking Deshastha {{can also be found}} in large numbers outside Maharashtra such as in the cities of Indore, Gwalior, Baroda and Thanjavur, which were a part of or were influenced by, the Maratha Empire. The Deshastha Brahmins of Baroda are immigrants who came from the Desh for State service during the rule of Gaekwads.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} not been {{conclusively}} dated.

Architecture writer Stefan Stamov gives a possible range from the 12th to the 14th century.|$|E

5000|$|Upeksha {{as a power}} {{includes}} {{freedom from}} all kinds of desires and birth because it has no preference for one thing more than the other. It is opposed to individuality. This power manifests as ten kinds which are - Sadangopeksha (when there is neither pleasure nor displeasure), Brahma-wiharopeksha (when the mind <b>is</b> <b>equally</b> affected towards all beings), Bowdyangopeksha (when the mind <b>is</b> <b>equally</b> affected towards all thoughts), Wiryopeksha (when the mind <b>is</b> <b>equally</b> affected by the same force of determination), Sankharopeksha (when the mind <b>is</b> <b>equally</b> affected towards all kinds of wisdom), Wedanopeksha (when the mind is sensible to neither pleasure nor pain), Widarsanopeksha (when the mind is not affected by what is seen), Tatramadyastopeksha (when all modes of upeksha are applied together), Dhyanopeksha (when the impermanency of sensible-objects is regarded with an even mind)and Parisudi-upeksha (when the mind <b>is</b> <b>equally</b> affected towards all that is necessary to secure freedom from the cleaving to existence). All upekshas may be possessed by one and the same person but the second cannot be possessed without the first.|$|R
5|$|The {{sport is}} {{classified}} as a B1 event, meaning that it is for blind athletes, however vision-impaired athletes are also able to take part as all competitors wear eyeshades to ensure they <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> disadvantaged.

5|$|A {{separate}} 2008 {{study from}} Western Michigan University found that hybrids and conventional vehicles <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> safe when travelling {{more than about}} , because tire and wind noise generate most of the audible cues at those speeds. Hybrid cars were also tested safe when leaving a stoplight and {{it was found that}} under this condition they do not pose a risk to pedestrians. All Prius models used in the study engaged their internal combustion engines when accelerating from a standstill and produced enough noise to be detected.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E

About 40% of people have LBP {{at some point in}} their lives, with {{estimates}} as high as 80% among people in the developed world. Difficulty most often begins between 20 and 40years of age. Men and women <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> affected. Low back pain is more common among people aged 4080years, with the overall number of individuals affected expected to increase as the population ages.|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} (BHD), also Hornstein–Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, Hornstein–Knickenberg syndrome, and fibrofolliculomas with trichodiscomas and acrochordons {{is a human}} {{autosomal dominant}} genetic disorder that can cause susceptibility to kidney cancer, renal and pulmonary cysts, and noncancerous tumors of the hair follicles, called fibrofolliculomas. The symptoms seen in each family are unique, and can include any combination of the three symptoms. Fibrofolliculomas {{are the most common}} manifestation, found on the face and upper trunk in over 80% of people with BHD over the age of 40. Pulmonary cysts <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> common (84%), but only 24% of people with BHD eventually experience a collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothorax). Kidney tumors, both cancerous and benign, occur in 14–34% of people with BHD; the associated kidney cancers are often rare hybrid tumors.|$|E
5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes {{are a sign}} of a patriarchal {{organization}} because men are only forbidden from growing their hair long or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E

5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} for non-commercial plants is the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves). This {{is the most}} serious disease of Narcissus. Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Homer threatens Bart to win {{no matter}} what. In an {{extremely}} close match, Bart and Todd each do well, and tie by the time they reach the eighteenth hole. Bart and Todd agree that the competition is not worth the stress, that they <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> good and that they should call it a draw, splitting the award evenly. As a result, Ned and Homer are forced to wear their respective wives' Sunday dresses and mow each other's lawn. People around the neighborhood laugh at them and Ned actually enjoys it (commenting that it reminds him of his fraternity days in college), much to Homer's dismay.|$|E

5|$|Quantitative {{chemicals}} {{are those that}} are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most quantitative metabolites are digestibility reducers that make plant cell walls indigestible to animals. The effects of quantitative metabolites are dosage dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.|$|E
5|$|Tennyson is not {{the only}} one that uses the image; John Everett Millais's {{painting}} Mariana is based on Tennyson's version of Mariana, and lines 9 through 12 of Tennyson's poem were used for the catalogue description of the painting. Similarly, Millais's version served as the inspiration for Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, Mariana. Tennyson's Mariana and Gaskell's main character, Ruth, are sensitive to the sounds around them and are constantly looking out of their window in image that represents their imprisonment within their homes. The image of Mariana used by Tennyson and the later works <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> of a woman who is weary.|$|E
