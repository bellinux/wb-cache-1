5|$|Cucurbitin is an {{amino acid}} and a carboxypyrrolidine that {{is found in}} raw Cucurbita seeds. It retards the {{development}} of parasitic flukes when administered to infected host mice, although the effect is only seen if administration begins immediately <b>after</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days <b>after</b> <b>infection.</b> This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In {{a small proportion of}} cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E
5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years <b>after</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E

30|$|LPS {{administration}} 4 days <b>after</b> influenza <b>infection</b> {{resulted in}} a synergistic increase in TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6 concentrations in lung tissue, but not in plasma. This effect was also observed 10 days <b>after</b> influenza <b>infection,</b> albeit to a lesser extent. LPS-induced plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 were enhanced 4 days <b>after</b> influenza <b>infection,</b> whereas a trend towards increased pulmonary IL- 10 concentrations was found. LPS-induced increases in pulmonary MPO content tended to be enhanced as well, but only at 4 days post-infection.|$|R

5|$|Severe malaria {{is usually}} caused by P.falciparum (often {{referred}} to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days <b>after</b> <b>infection.</b> Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms, including abnormal posturing, nystagmus, conjugate gaze palsy (failure of the eyes to turn {{together in the same}} direction), opisthotonus, seizures, or coma.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time <b>after</b> <b>infection</b> is 11years.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} {{poliomyelitis}} result in only temporary paralysis. Nerve impulses {{return to the}} formerly paralyzed muscle within a month, and recovery is usually complete in six to eight months. The neurophysiological processes involved in recovery following acute paralytic poliomyelitis are quite effective; muscles are able to retain normal strength even if half the original motor neurons have been lost. Paralysis remaining after one year {{is likely to be}} permanent, although modest recoveries of muscle strength are possible 12 to 18 months <b>after</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E

30|$|Elderly people, {{especially}} those with underlying comorbidities, {{are at risk of}} developing complications <b>after</b> <b>infections</b> caused by influenza viruses (Memoli et al. 2014). In developed countries, the majority of deaths attributable to influenza occur in people aged over 65  years, especially in those over 80  years with pre-existing health problems (Nicholson et al. 2003).|$|R
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time <b>after</b> <b>infection</b> with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given <b>after</b> <b>infection.</b> Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{not readily}} prone to {{infestation}} with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I.hexagonus {{are not uncommon}} in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei {{is the most important}} cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting {{from the base of the}} tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die <b>after</b> <b>infection.</b> Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in the ear canal), Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Host-parasite {{interactions}} during coccidial infection are complex, {{and host}} responses leading to parasite elimination {{are not well}} understood. Interactions between host cells and parasites were investigated using two-color immunofluorescent staining of duodenal tissue infected with Eimeria acervulina. Tissues were removed from TK strain chickens 24, 48, and 72 h <b>after</b> primary <b>infection</b> with 2. 5 x 107 normal or irradiated oocysts and also following secondary infection with 2. 5 x 107 normal oocysts. The tissues were embedded in freezing compound, frozen, sectioned, and fixed in cold acetone. Sections were stained with monoclonal antibodies to identify CD 4 +, CD 8 +, Ig+, and Bula+ lymphocytes, as well as macrophages and parasites. At 24 h <b>after</b> all <b>infections,</b> sporozoites were seen primarily in CD 8 + lymphocytes and macrophages. Many CD 8 + lymphocytes were seen at all times in infected tissues and frequently {{appeared to be in}} contact with infected epithelial cells. Sporozoites were occasionally seen in CD 4 + lymphocytes but none were noted in Ig+ or Bula+ lymphocytes. Meront development was extensive <b>after</b> primary <b>infection</b> with normal oocysts, sparse <b>after</b> primary <b>infection</b> with irradiated oocysts, and moderate <b>after</b> secondary <b>infection...</b>|$|R

5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon <b>after</b> <b>infection</b> of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} subcomponents {{are often}} referred to by their Svedberg sedimentation coefficient (denoted S). The proteasome most exclusively used in mammals is the cytosolic 26S proteasome, which is about 2000 kilodaltons (kDa) in molecular mass containing one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded; openings at the two ends of the core allow the target protein to enter. Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory subunit that contains multiple ATPase active sites and ubiquitin binding sites; it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core. An alternative form of regulatory subunit called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially {{the same manner as}} the 19S particle; the 11S {{may play a role in}} degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced <b>after</b> <b>infection</b> by a virus.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more {{commonly}} causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. <b>After</b> <b>infection,</b> the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence may include: decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be negative in new infections.|$|E
30|$|Although {{efficient}} transient transformation {{system of}} aseptically grown ice plant seedlings was successfully established in this study, no stable transformed roots were acquired from these seedlings. Andolfatto et al. (1994) and Konieczny et al. (2011) both reported labor-intensive and time-consuming transformation and tissue culture protocols to establish ice plants containing transgenic roots with relatively low transformation rates, 6 – 20 %. In order {{to circumvent the}} long and grueling tissue culture system of whole-plant regeneration from ice plant callus or seedlings, pot-grown ice plants were first syringe-injected with A. rhizogenes A 8196 or NCPPB 1855 bacteria cultures and then grown hydroponically to induce transgenic root formations; more than 35 % of plants contained transgenic roots at 1  week after infected with A. rhizogenes A 8196. Two weeks <b>after</b> <b>infections,</b> more than 75 % of plants had transgenic roots <b>after</b> <b>infections.</b> These infected plants were continuously grown hydroponically for transgene expressions in root tissues without generating whole new transgenic plants.|$|R

25|$|The virus assembles by {{the cell}} {{membrane}} {{and leaves the}} cell by budding. For THOV grown in baby hamster kidney cells, virus particles start to be released 6–8hours <b>after</b> <b>infection,</b> with substantial quantities still being produced 24hours <b>after</b> <b>infection.</b> This growth rate is slower than that of influenza viruses, and is more similar to Quaranfil virus.|$|E

40|$|The immune {{response}} <b>after</b> streptococcal <b>infections</b> {{of the skin}} and of the joints was studied in an experimental animal model. Hamsters were challenged intradermally or intra-articularly with different streptococcal serotypes, and antibodies for streptolysin O (ASO), deoxyribonuclease B (anti-deoxyribonuclease B), and group A carbohydrate (anti-group A CHO) were determined. After a single injection at either site, 7 of 48 animals (14 %) developed group A-CHO antibodies; however, none of the animals developed detectable levels of ASO or anti-deoxyribonuclease B. <b>After</b> repeated <b>infections</b> of the skin or joint, anti-deoxyribonuclease B antibodies were detectable in 13 % (4 of 30) and 30 % (5 of 17) of the animals, respectively. Elevations of ASO occurred <b>after</b> repeated joint <b>infections</b> in 4 of 16 animals (25 %), whereas none of 30 hamsters repeatedly infected intradermally developed antibodies against streptolysin O. For all three antibodies tested, elevated levels were more frequently noted <b>after</b> repeated joint <b>infections</b> than <b>after</b> repeated skin <b>infections</b> with the same streptococcal serotype. These data, similar to ones previously noted in human impetigo, indicate that ASO responses are feeble <b>after</b> streptococcal skin <b>infections</b> and that the site of infection per se, rather than the infecting strain, appears {{to be responsible for}} this poor response...|$|R
