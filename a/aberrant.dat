5|$|However, other taxonomists {{challenged}} {{the validity of}} the species as early as 1939, noting that the Lānai hookbill was only known from one specimen and arguing that it was merely an <b>aberrant</b> and partially albino female ōū. The hookbill's validity was not confirmed until 1989 when the specimen's skull was removed and examined. The bird's cranial osteology, myology, plumage, and bill morphology confirmed the distinctness of the species.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost any}} herbivore, they consume other plants if {{presented}} with them, but their diet in nature consists {{almost entirely of}} grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. Hippos are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' feces to digest vegetation. Hippos have (rarely) been filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are other reports of meat-eating, and even cannibalism and predation. The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by <b>aberrant</b> behaviour or nutritional stress.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{is a key}} {{complex in}} {{cellular}} RNA quality control. Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes possess highly active RNA surveillance systems that recognise unprocessed and mis-processed RNA-protein complexes (such as ribosomes) prior to their exit from the nucleus. It is presumed that this system prevents <b>aberrant</b> complexes from interfering with important cellular processes such as protein synthesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} proper {{neuronal}} migration through the cortical plate (CP) is an inside-out arrangement of neurons, where the younger neurons migrate past the older neurons to their proper locations. Studies in reeler mutant mice show that knocking out the reeler gene results in <b>aberrant</b> migration {{as well as}} outside-in layering, in which younger neurons are unable to travel past the older ones. Such abnormal layering is also seen in VLDLR−apoER2− and dab1- mutants, indicating {{the importance of this}} entire pathway in cortical migration of the developing embryo.|$|E
5|$|Different {{subspecies}} of plains zebra were recognised {{as members}} of Equus quagga by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described {{on the basis of}} differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus, were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of <b>aberrant</b> quagga specimens. Some authors have described the quagga as a kind of wild horse rather than a zebra, and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (Equus caballus). It has been pointed out that early morphological studies were erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile terns {{typically}} have brown- or yellow-tinged upperparts, and the feathers have dark edges {{that give the}} plumage a scaly appearance. They have dark bands on the wings and short tails. In most species, the subsequent moult does not start until after migration, the plumage then becoming more like the adult, but with some retained juvenile feathers and a white forehead with only a partial dark cap. By the second summer, the appearance is very like the adult, and full mature plumage is usually attained by the third year. After breeding, terns moult into a winter plumage, typically showing a white forehead. Heavily worn or <b>aberrant</b> plumages such as melanism and albinism are much rarer in terns than in gulls.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{is driven}} back to Area 51 {{along with two}} other Men in Black, Howard Grodin and Jeff Smoodge. After an angry {{telephone}} call from Fletcher's wife, Joanne, Mulder—still inside Fletcher's body—goes to Fletcher's home. Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives {{a telephone call from}} Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed the wreckage of the craft from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's <b>aberrant</b> behavior.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the PRKACA {{gene that}} promote {{abnormal}} enzyme activity {{have been linked}} to disease of the adrenal gland. Several mutations in PRKACA have been found in patients with Cushing’s syndrome that result in an increase in the ability of PKA to broadly phosphorylate other proteins. One mutation in the PRKACA gene that causes an amino acid substitution of leucine to arginine in position 206, was found in over 60% of patients with adrenocortical tumors. Other mutations and genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene have been identified in adrenocortical adenomas that also disrupt PKA signaling, leading to <b>aberrant</b> PKA phosphorylation. The Cα gene has also been incriminated in a variety of cancers, including colon, renal, rectal, prostate, lung, breast, adrenal carcinomas and lymphomas.|$|E
5|$|On 3 or 4January 1644, {{the five}} leading dissenting brethren signalled {{a break with}} the rest of the Assembly when they {{published}} An Apologeticall Narration, a polemical pamphlet appealing to Parliament. It argued that the congregational system was more amenable to state control of religious matters than that of the presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain any real power except to withdraw fellowship from <b>aberrant</b> congregations. By 17January, the majority of the Assembly had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system similar to that of the Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they could eventually be reconciled. It was hoped that by avoiding asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right, the congregationalists could be accommodated.|$|E
5|$|The Hadoram Shirihai {{expeditions to}} the Madeira {{archipelago}} in 2008, 2009 and 2010 each had sightings of a Pterodroma petrel (possibly the same bird) with largely white underwings, but upperwings like Zino's or Fea's. This plumage does {{not correspond to}} any known Pterodroma species. It {{may have been an}} unusual variant of Zino's but this is unlikely since no similar bird has been seen amongst the more than 100 caught at the nest. It may alternatively be a single <b>aberrant</b> individual, a hybrid or an unknown taxon from Madeira or elsewhere. No conclusion is possible on current knowledge.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, renowned British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas {{described}} Oryzomys wavrini as a {{new species}} of Oryzomys from Paraguay. In the next decades, it was viewed as an <b>aberrant</b> species of Oryzomys (then used in a much broader sense than now), but it was moved to a separate genus, named Pseudoryzomys, by Hershkovitz in 1959, who noted that although it is similar to Oryzomys palustris in appearance, other features suggest it is {{more closely related to}} Phyllotis. Thus, he viewed the animal {{as a member of the}} phyllotine group of rodents, which includes Calomys and Phyllotis, not of the oryzomyine group, which includes Oryzomys, and his opinion was mostly accepted in the next few decades. Scientific knowledge of the rare Pseudoryzomys wavrini—only three specimens were known when Hershkovitz described the genus Pseudoryzomys in 1959—increased in the following years, and in 1975 the Bolivian population was named as a separate subspecies, Pseudoryzomys wavrini reigi, because Bolivian animals are slightly larger and darker than those from Paraguay.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} {{spots of}} the spotted green pigeon {{are not unique}} among pigeons, but are also seen in the spot-winged pigeon (Columba maculosa) and the speckled pigeon (C. guinea), and {{are the result of}} lack of melanin deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in <b>aberrant</b> plumage).|$|E
25|$|The <b>aberrant</b> nerve {{regeneration}} hypothesis {{is the most}} widely accepted mechanism for synkinesis. The hypothesis states that, after trauma, axons project from the facial nucleus to incorrect peripheral muscle groups. These <b>aberrant</b> branches can simultaneously innervate different subdivisions of the facial nerve.|$|E

25|$|<b>Aberrant</b> {{hosts of}} F. magna are sheep and goats. However, {{the course of}} {{infection}} is similar in guinea pigs, rabbits, bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) that were infected experimentally. Infections in <b>aberrant</b> hosts are characterized by excessive wandering of juvenile flukes and death of the host. <b>Aberrant</b> hosts die usually within 6 months post-infection and the death is associated with acute peritonitis or extensive haemorrhage caused by migrating flukes. In <b>aberrant</b> hosts, flukes do not mature and migrate until the host dies. Occasionally, a few flukes mature and eggs {{can be found in}} the faeces. Hepatic lesions in <b>aberrant</b> hosts generally include firm adhesions of the liver to the diaphragm, black pigmentation, hematomas, necroses, and haemorrhagic tracts in which juvenile flukes are located. While a lack of fibrous capsules within hepatic parenchyma has been reported by several authors, flukes in fibrous capsules have also been documented in sheep. However, the wall of the capsule is different from those found in cervids and large bovids. The dominant feature is a diffuse fibrosis throughout the liver and haemorrhagic migratory tracts containing erythrocytes, black pigment, and cell detritus. The liver lesions are infiltrated by eosinophils, plasma cells, and pigment-laden macrophages.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Iwata {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} the first experimental {{analysis of the}} maintaining variables for self-injurious behavior. In the paper, the researchers alternated between specific conditions to examine {{whether or not the}} behavior occurred under specific environmental conditions. Through direct manipulation of the environment, the researchers could accurately identify the controlling variables of the <b>aberrant</b> behavior, and provide interventions that targeted the functional relationship between the behavior and the environment. Since this seminal article was published, a wide range of research has been published in the area of functional analyses of <b>aberrant</b> behaviors. The methodology has since become the gold standard in assessment and treatment of <b>aberrant</b> behaviors.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{proposed}} mechanisms for synkinesis: <b>aberrant</b> nerve regeneration, interneuronal ephaptic transmission, and nuclear hyperexcitability.|$|E

25|$|The Wnt {{signaling}} pathways are complex, involving {{many different}} elements, and therefore have many targets for misregulation. Mutations that cause constitutive {{activation of the}} Wnt signaling pathway lead to tumor formation and cancer. <b>Aberrant</b> activation of the Wnt pathway can lead to increase cell proliferation. Current research {{is focused on the}} action of the Wnt signaling pathway the regulation of stem cell choice to proliferate and self renew. This action of Wnt signaling in the possible control and maintenance of stem cells, may provide a possible treatment in cancers exhibiting <b>aberrant</b> Wnt signaling.|$|E

25|$|B. c. eques (Eydoux & Souleyet, 1842): Based on {{a single}} {{specimen}} from Peru that had one large orbital scale, no other such specimens have been found and the snake was probably an <b>aberrant</b> B. c. imperator.|$|E
25|$|The mitosis {{promoting}} factor MPF also regulates DNA-damage induced apoptosis. Negative {{regulation of}} MPF by WEE1 causes <b>aberrant</b> mitosis and thus resistance to DNA-damage induced apoptosis.

25|$|It is {{considered}} that endogenous sulfur dioxide plays a significant physiological role in regulating cardiac and blood vessel function, and <b>aberrant</b> or deficient sulfur dioxide metabolism {{can contribute to}} several different cardiovascular diseases, such as arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, stenocardia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aberrant</b> B cell receptor-mediated {{feedback}} – A {{feature of}} human autoimmune disease {{is that it}} is largely restricted to a small group of antigens, several of which have known signaling roles in the immune response (DNA, C1q, IgGFc, Ro, Con. A receptor, Peanut agglutinin receptor(PNAR)). This fact gave rise to the idea that spontaneous autoimmunity may result when the binding of antibody to certain antigens leads to <b>aberrant</b> signals being fed back to parent B cells through membrane bound ligands. These ligands include B cell receptor (for antigen), IgG Fc receptors, CD21, which binds complement C3d, Toll-like receptors 9 and 7 (which can bind DNA and nucleoproteins) and PNAR. More indirect <b>aberrant</b> activation of B cells can also be envisaged with autoantibodies to acetyl choline receptor (on thymic myoid cells) and hormone and hormone binding proteins. Together with the concept of T-cell-B-cell discordance this idea forms the basis of the hypothesis of self-perpetuating autoreactive B cells. Autoreactive B cells in spontaneous autoimmunity are seen as surviving because of subversion both of the T cell help pathway and of the feedback signal through B cell receptor, thereby overcoming the negative signals responsible for B cell self-tolerance without necessarily requiring loss of T cell self-tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Many {{transcription}} {{factors are}} either tumor suppressors or oncogenes, and, thus, mutations or <b>aberrant</b> regulation {{of them is}} associated with cancer.

25|$|Current {{research}} {{includes the}} search for the genes that are disregulated in HCC, anti-heparanase antibodies, protein markers, non-coding RNAs (such as TUC338) and other predictive biomarkers. As similar research is yielding results in various other malignant diseases, it is hoped that identifying the <b>aberrant</b> genes and the resultant proteins could lead to the identification of pharmacological interventions for HCC.|$|E

25|$|Autism: Oxytocin {{has been}} implicated in the {{etiology}} of autism, with one report suggesting autism is correlated with genomic deletion of the gene containing the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR). Studies involving Caucasian and Finnish samples and Chinese Han families provide support for the relationship of OXTR with autism.

25|$|Autoimmune reaction: Having some MHC {{molecules}} {{increases the}} risk of autoimmune diseases more than having others. HLA-B27 is an example.

25|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{perceived}} literary examples of albino bias was H. G.

25|$|Shipboard {{discipline}} aboard merchant {{and naval}} vessels was notoriously harsh, and, {{more often than}} not, violent. Pirates, having suffered under these measures, used a more democratic process when determining how <b>aberrant</b> sailors would be punished, and there were fewer transgressions that were considered punishable. These punishments were still often violent, which was the norm in the early 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} {{sometimes}} a preceding viral infection, or skin or eye trauma, the exact underlying initiator of VKH disease remains unknown. However, VKH is attributed to <b>aberrant</b> T-cell-mediated immune response directed against self-antigens found on melanocytes. Stimulated by interleukin 23 (IL-23), T helper 17 cells and cytokines such as interleukin 17 (IL-17) appear to target proteins in the melanocyte.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{types of}} neural {{oscillations}} may also appear in pathological situations, such as Parkinson's disease or epilepsy. Interestingly, these pathological oscillations often consist of an <b>aberrant</b> {{version of a}} normal oscillation. For example, {{one of the best}} known types is the spike and wave oscillation, which is typical of generalized or absence epileptic seizures, and which resembles normal sleep spindle oscillations.|$|E
25|$|Other {{interesting}} candidate pathways {{that may}} be important in the regulation of radiation-induced degenerative CNS changes are signal transduction pathways that are regulated by Cdk5. Cdk5 is a kinase that {{plays a key role}} in neural development; its <b>aberrant</b> expression and activation are associated with neurodegenerative processes, including Alzheimer’s disease. This kinase is up-regulated in neural cells following ionizing radiation exposure.|$|E
