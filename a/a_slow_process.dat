5|$|All group 3 {{elements}} have an odd atomic number, {{and therefore}} few stable isotopes. Scandium has one stable isotope, and yttrium itself {{has only one}} stable isotope, 89Y, is also the only isotope that occurs naturally. However, the lanthanide rare earths contain elements of even atomic number and many stable isotopes. Yttrium-89 {{is thought to be}} more abundant than it otherwise would be, {{due in part to the}} s-process, which allows enough time for isotopes created by other processes to decay by electron emission (neutron → proton). Such <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>process</b> tends to favor isotopes with atomic mass numbers (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually stable atomic nuclei with 50, 82, and 126 neutrons, respectively. 89Y has a mass number close to 90 and has 50 neutrons in its nucleus.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century onwards the Normans {{began to build}} new castles in stone and convert {{existing}} timber designs. This was initially <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>process,</b> picking up speed towards {{the second half of}} the century. Traditionally this transition was believed to have been driven by the more crude nature of wooden fortifications, the limited life of timber in wooden castles and its vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as complex as their stone equivalents. Some wooden castles were not converted into stone for many years and instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen.|$|E

Parker first met Gabriel during the film's post-production, as he had been experimenting with his music, incorporating the percussive rhythms from the musician's solo albums into the film. Parker contacted Gabriel's manager, record producer David Geffen, who advised him that producing the soundtrack would be <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>process,</b> as Gabriel was known for working at his own pace.

5|$|Without {{aircraft}} aboard, she {{sailed to}} Alexandria on 23 January escorted by four destroyers, for temporary repairs that lasted until 10 March. Boyd {{was promoted to}} rear admiral on 18 February and relieved Lyster as Rear Admiral Aircraft Carriers. He transferred his flag to Formidable when she arrived at Alexandria on 10 March, just before Illustrious sailed for Port Said to begin her transit of the Suez Canal. The Germans had laid mines in the canal earlier. Clearing the mines and the ships sunk by them was <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>process</b> and Illustrious did not reach Suez Bay until 20 March. The ship then sailed for Durban, South Africa, to have the extent of her underwater damage assessed in the drydock there. She reached Durban on 4 April and remained there for two weeks. The ship ultimately arrived at the Norfolk Navy Yard in the United States on 12 May for permanent repairs.|$|E
5|$|The further {{evolution}} of Callisto after accretion {{was determined by}} the balance of the radioactive heating, cooling through thermal conduction near the surface, and solid state or subsolidus convection in the interior. Details of the subsolidus convection in the ice is the main source of uncertainty in the models of all icy moons. It is known to develop when the temperature is sufficiently close to the melting point, due to the temperature dependence of ice viscosity. Subsolidus convection in icy bodies is <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>process</b> with ice motions of the order of 1centimeter per year, but is, in fact, a very effective cooling mechanism on long timescales. It is thought to proceed in the so-called stagnant lid regime, where a stiff, cold outer layer of Callisto conducts heat without convection, whereas the ice beneath it convects in the subsolidus regime. For Callisto, the outer conductive layer corresponds to the cold and rigid lithosphere with a thickness of about 100km. Its presence would explain the lack of any signs of the endogenic activity on the Callistoan surface. The convection in the interior parts of Callisto may be layered, because under the high pressures found there, water ice exists in different crystalline phases beginning from the ice I on the surface to ice VII in the center. The early onset of subsolidus convection in the Callistoan interior could have prevented large-scale ice melting and any resulting differentiation that would have otherwise formed a large rocky core and icy mantle. Due to the convection process, however, very slow and partial separation and differentiation of rocks and ices inside Callisto has been proceeding on timescales of billions of years and may be continuing to this day.|$|E

40|$|Stochastic {{averaging}} {{problems with}} Gaussian forcing {{have been studied}} thoroughly for many years, but far less {{attention has been paid}} to problems where the stochastic forcing has infinite variance, such as an α-stable noise forcing. It has been shown that simple linear processes driven by correlated additive and multiplicative (CAM) Gaussian noise, which emerge in the context of atmosphere and ocean dynamics, have infinite variance in certain parameter regimes. In this paper, we study a stochastic averaging problem where a linear CAM noise process in a particular parameter regime is used to drive <b>a</b> comparatively <b>slow</b> <b>process.</b> It is shown that the <b>slow</b> <b>process</b> exhibits properties consistent with being forced by a white α-stable noise in the case of large time-scale separation. We identify the conditions required for the fast linear CAM process to have such an influence in driving <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> <b>process,</b> and then derive an (effectively) equivalent fast, infinite-variance process for which an existing stochastic averaging approximation is readily applied. These results are illustrated using a set of representative numerical results. Comment: 31 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
