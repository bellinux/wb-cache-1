5|$|Starting in 1738, {{towns in}} New Jersey began issuing liquor {{licenses}} to tavern keepers. Before federal Prohibition in 1919, despite many state liquor statutes, {{the regulation of}} alcoholic beverages in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, with wide variations among municipalities. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the states were again permitted to regulate alcoholic beverages. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>Beverage</b> Control Law, which established and granted rulemaking powers to the Division of <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>Beverage</b> Control. The law also established a three-tier alcohol distribution system whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers, who may only sell to retailers, who may only sell to customers.|$|E

40|$|Consumption of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> is a world-wide phenomenon. The use of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> in {{different}} parts of the world is influenced by economic, social, religious, and traditional forces, therefore countries differ significantly in the amount and type of alcohol consumed and in the temporal trends of use of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> Italy and the United States are two examples of these differences: Italy is among the world's top producers and consumers of wine, while, in the USA, beer and spirits are more frequently consumed. In addition to differences in the amount and type of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages,</b> Italians and Americans differ significantly in the way the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> are consumed, in particular in relation to the consumption of wine in relation to meals. These differences in the consumption of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> between countries can be used to analyze and better understand the health effects of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> on both individuals and populations...|$|R

5|$|In a 1976 referendum, New Jersey voters {{approved}} casino gambling in Atlantic City. Because {{of concerns about}} organized crime connections to gambling, New Jersey enacted strict regulations that included licensing of all casino employees and contractors, and a separation of powers between the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and the Casino Control Commission (CCC). The Division of Gaming Enforcement {{is part of the}} New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, and is responsible for investigating casino license applications, monitoring casino operations, and enforcing New Jersey's casino laws and regulations as defined in Title 5, Chapter 12 of New Jersey's statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 69I of New Jersey's Administrative Code. The Casino Control Commission is an independent agency in the state Treasury Department with both quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, and is responsible for creating casino regulations, hearing appeals of DGE penalties, and make decisions on casino licensing. In light of such regulation and the uniqueness of casino gambling, New Jersey's twelve casinos are not {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Division of <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>Beverage</b> Control (ABC) or Atlantic City's <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> control board.|$|E

5|$|Bars and {{restaurants}} are considered strictly liable for their patrons' behavior, and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages in illegal activity (e.g. fighting, public urination) after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop liability and social host liability, wherein the server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable {{if that person}} then causes death or injury to a third party in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate liability, the Division of <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>Beverage</b> Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating civil rights laws.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the state, federal {{agencies}} which allow alcohol sales {{do not have}} a system of liquor licenses or <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> control boards, but instead simply award contracts to business per federal procurement laws. New Jersey does not consider municipal ordinances to be criminal offenses, and so open container laws cannot be enforced in federal enclaves under the Assimilative Crimes Act. Public consumption of alcohol is allowed on federal lands, except when in an automobile, or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area. For example, it is legal to consume alcoholic beverages on the beach at Sandy Hook.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alcoholic</b> <b>beverage</b> and {{the process}} of fermentation: The {{earliest}} archaeological evidence of fermentation and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was discovered in neolithic China dating from 7000–6600 BC. Examination and analysis of ancient pottery jars from the neolithic village of Jiahu in Henan province in northern China revealed fermented residue left behind by the alcoholic beverages they once contained. According to {{a study published in the}} Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, chemical analysis of the residue revealed that the fermented drink was made from fruit, rice and honey. Elsewhere in the world, fermented beverages have been found dating from 6000 BC in Georgia, 3150 BC in ancient Egypt, 3000 BC in Babylon, 2000 BC in pre-Hispanic Mexico, and 1500 BC in Sudan.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, a {{group of}} {{citizens}} from Newport asked Combs for help in cracking down on crime in their city. Just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Newport had gained {{a reputation as a}} haven for prostitution, gambling, and illegal alcohol. After receiving an affidavit from the citizens, Combs sent agents from the department of <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>Beverage</b> Control to the city. They cited six bars for violating laws governing liquor sales, and instructed Attorney General John B. Breckinridge to prosecute four local officials for failure to enforce the laws. When allegations of civil rights violations in a related trial surfaced, U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent federal Justice Department officials to Newport, prompting the resignation of the sheriff and a circuit judge.

5|$|Heathenry {{does not}} have a unified {{theology}} and is typically polytheistic, centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe. It adopts cosmological views from these religions, including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The faith's deities and these spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as blóts in which food and libations are offered to them. These are often accompanied by symbel, the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverage.</b> Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an altered state of consciousness and visions, most notably seiðr and galdr, with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities. Although many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves, members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups, usually known as kindreds or hearths, to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings. Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor, personal integrity, and loyalty, while beliefs about an afterlife vary and are rarely emphasized.|$|E
