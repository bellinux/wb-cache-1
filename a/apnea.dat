5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive sleep <b>apnea,</b> a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of <b>apnea</b> (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) {{that is difficult to}} control with medication. The high carbon dioxide can also cause headaches, which tend to be worsening in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep <b>apnea</b> co-exists. CPAP requires the use during sleep of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep <b>apnea</b> and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of <b>apnea)</b> have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{influence}} of 2 ventilation strategies on the occurrence of central <b>apneas.</b> METHODS: This was a prospective, comparative, crossover study with 14 unsedated subjects undergoing {{weaning from mechanical ventilation}} in the medical ICU of Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur, Montréal, Québec, Canada. The subjects were ventilated alternately in neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) modes. Inspiratory flow/time and pressure/time waveforms and diaphragmatic electrical activity were used to detect central <b>apneas.</b> Ventilatory variability and breathing pattern were evaluated in both modes. Breathing patterns just before central <b>apneas,</b> and associations between <b>apneas</b> and sleep patterns (electroencephalogram) were studied. RESULTS: Switching from PSV to NAVA did not change mean minute ventilation, tidal volume, or breathing frequency. However, tidal volume variability, defined as the coefficient of variability (standard error/mean), was significantly greater with NAVA than with PSV (17. 2 8 vs 10. 3 4, P. 045). NAVA induced a greater decrease in central <b>apneas,</b> compared to PSV (to 0 with NAVA vs 10. 5 11 with PSV, P. 005). Central <b>apneas</b> during PSV were detected only during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. CONCLUSIONS: NAVA was associated with increased ventilatory variability, compared to constant-level PSV. With NAVA the absence of over-assistance during sleep coincided with absence of central <b>apneas,</b> suggesting that load capacity and/or neu-romechanical coupling were improved by NAVA and that this improvement decreased or abolished central <b>apneas.</b> Key words: mechanical ventilation; central apnea; ventilation mode; neurally adjusted ventilatory assist; pressure support; sleep patterns.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. Prematurely born {{compared}} with term born infants are {{at increased risk}} of sudden infant death syndrome, particularly if slept prone. The purpose of this work was to test the hypothesis that preterm infants with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia being prepared for neonatal unit discharge would sleep longer and have less arousals and more central <b>apneas</b> in the prone position. METHODS. This was a prospective observational study in a tertiary NICU. Twenty-four infants (14 with bronchopulmonary dysplasia) with a median gestational age of 27 weeks were studied at a median postconceptional age of 37 weeks. Video polysomnographic recordings of 2 -channel electroencephalogram, 2 -channel electro-oculogram, nasal airflow, chest and abdominal wall movements, limb movements, electrocardiogram, and oxygen saturation were made in the supine and prone positions, each position maintained for 3 hours. The duration of sleep, sleep efficiency (total sleep time/total recording time), and number and type of <b>apneas,</b> arousals, and awakenings were recorded. RESULTS. Overall, in the prone position, infants slept longer, had greater sleep efficiency (89. 5 % vs 72. 5 %), and had more central <b>apneas</b> (median: 5. 6 vs 2. 2), but fewer obstructive <b>apneas</b> (0. 5 vs 0. 9). The infants had more awakenings (9. 7 vs 3. 5) and arousals per hour (13. 6 vs 9. 0) when supine. There were similar findings in the bronchopulmonary dysplasia infants. CONCLUSIONS. Very prematurely born infants studied before neonatal unit discharge sleep more efficiently with fewer arousals and more central <b>apneas</b> in the prone position, emphasizing the importance of recommending supine sleeping after neonatal unit discharge for prematurely born infants...|$|R
40|$|Diagnosis of sleep-disordered {{breathing}} {{is based on}} the presence of an abnormal breathing pattern during sleep. In this study, an algorithm was developed for the offline breath-to-breath analysis of the nocturnal respiratory recordings. For that purpose, respiratory signals (nasal airway pressure, thoracic and abdominal movements) were divided into half waves using period amplitude analysis. Individual breaths were characterized by the parameters of the half waves (duration, amplitude, and slope). These values can be used to discriminate between normal and abnormal breaths. This algorithm was applied to six polysomnographic recordings to distinguish abnormal breathing events (<b>apneas</b> and hypopneas). The algorithm was robust for the identification of breaths (sensitivity = 96. 8 %, positive prediction value (PPV) = 99. 5 %). The detection of <b>apneas</b> and hypopneas was compared to the manual scoring of two experienced sleep technicians: sensitivity was, respectively, 89. 2 and 88. 9 %, PPV was 54. 1 and 59. 3 %. The classification of <b>apneas</b> into central, obstructive, or mixed was in concordance with the observers in 68 % of the <b>apneas.</b> Although the algorithm tended to detect more hypopneas than the clinical standard, this study shows that the extraction of breath-to-breath parameters is useful for detection of abnormal respiratory events and provides a basis for further characterization of these events...|$|R

5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Pickwickian syndrome) {{is a condition}} in which severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly enough or deeply enough, resulting in low blood oxygen levels and high blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Many people with this condition also frequently stop breathing altogether for short periods of time during sleep (obstructive sleep <b>apnea),</b> resulting in many partial awakenings during the night, which leads to continual sleepiness during the day. The disease puts strain on the heart, which eventually may lead to the symptoms such as heart failure, leg swelling and various other related symptoms. The most effective treatment is weight loss, but it is often possible to relieve the symptoms by nocturnal ventilation with positive airway pressure (CPAP) or related methods.|$|E
5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep <b>apnea)</b> lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and degree of heart failure (HF) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). A total of 3017 patients (77. 4 % men and 22. 6 % women) were included in the study. Clinical examination and echocardiography for evaluation of HF using NYHA functional classification and sleep polysomnography were performed. The study demonstrated that SDB is more common in CHD patients with higher NYHA functional class. The prevalence of central sleep <b>apneas</b> against obstructive <b>apneas</b> was observed in patients with mild and moderate HF. The number of central <b>apneas</b> was strongly related to the severity of heart failure. More frequent appearance of central sleep <b>apneas</b> is predominantly due to instability of ventilatory control systems during sleep because of impaired cardiac function in HF patients. Sleep architecture was more disturbed in CHD patients with higher NYHA functional class. A gradual increase of stage 1 and wakefulness after sleep onset and a decrease of sleep stages 3 - 4 and REM sleep as well as a diminution of sleep efficiency with worsening of NYHA functional class were observed. We suggest that both SDB and disturbed sleep variables independently significantly correlate with manifestation of HF. </p...|$|R
40|$|Inhibitory neurons {{make up a}} {{significant}} fraction of the neurons within the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), a site critical for mammalian eupneic breathing. The role of glycinergic preBötC neurons in respiratory rhythmogenesis in mice was investigated by optogenetically-targeted excitation or inhibition. Channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) or Archaerhodopsin (Arch) was expressed in glycinergic preBötC neurons of glycine transporter 2 (GlyT 2) -Cre mice. In ChR 2 -transfected mice, brief inspiratory-phase bilateral photostimulation targeting the preBötC prematurely terminated inspiration, whereas expiratory-phase photostimulation delayed {{the onset of the}} next inspiration. Prolonged photostimulation produced <b>apneas</b> lasting as long as the light pulse. Inspiratory-phase photoinhibition in Arch-transfected mice during inspiration increased tidal volume without altering inspiratory duration, whereas expiratory-phase photoinhibition shortened the latency until the next inspiration. During persistent <b>apneas,</b> prolonged photoinhibition restored rhythmic breathing. We conclude that glycinergic preBötC neurons modulate inspiratory pattern and are important for reflex <b>apneas</b> but that the rhythm can persist after significant dampening of their activity...|$|R

5|$|Intubation may be {{necessary}} for a patient with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (<b>apnea),</b> or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis. Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E
5|$|The diving reflex is a {{response}} to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes. It optimises respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, which allows extended periods underwater. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins and muskrats), and also exists in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. The diving reflex is triggered by chilling the face and holding the breath. The cardiovascular system constricts peripheral blood vessels, slows the pulse rate, redirects blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, releases red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, causes heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but <b>apnea,</b> slowed pulse rate, and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals.|$|E
