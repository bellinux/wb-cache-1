40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to present new upper bounds for code {{distance}} and covering radius of designs in arbitrary polynomial metric spaces. These bounds and the necessary and sufficient conditions of their attainability were obtained as the solution of an extremal problem for systems of orthogonal polynomials. For <b>antipodal</b> <b>spaces</b> the behaviour of the bounds in different asymptotical processes is determined and it is proved that this bound is attained for all tight 2 k-design...|$|R

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that <b>space</b> <b>station</b> {{planning}} at NASA began when NASA was created in 1958. However, the initiation of the program for a lunar landing delayed the implementation of plans for a <b>space</b> <b>station.</b> The utility of a <b>space</b> <b>station</b> was finally demonstrated with Skylab, which was launched in 1972. In May 1982, the <b>Space</b> <b>Station</b> Task Force was established to provide focus and direction for <b>space</b> <b>station</b> planning activities. The present paper provides {{a description of the}} planning activities, giving particular attention to the power system. The initial <b>space</b> <b>station</b> will be required to supply 75 kW of continuous electrical power, 60 kW for the customer and 15 kW for <b>space</b> <b>station</b> needs.
