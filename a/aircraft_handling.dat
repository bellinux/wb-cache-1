5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, the ship was fitted with a degaussing coil to protect her against magnetic mines. In 1942, the ship's <b>aircraft</b> <b>handling</b> equipment and aft torpedo tubes were removed. Throughout the war, her radar suite was upgraded; in March 1941, she was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed. The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter radar. Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers.|$|E

Following the war, she was sent on a litany of training exercises and cruises in both the Atlantic and the Pacific, and saw several overhauls to increase her armament, <b>aircraft</b> <b>handling</b> and armor.|$|E

25|$|Responding to {{complaints}} about the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>handling</b> qualities, Piper introduced the PA-34-200T Seneca II. The aircraft was certified on 18 July 1974 and introduced as a 1975 model.|$|R
5|$|Fusō {{was briefly}} fitted with an {{aircraft}} flying-off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1924. During {{the first phase}} of her first modernization, a catapult was fitted on the roof of Turret No. 3 and the ship was equipped to operate three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The initial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. Fusōs ability to operate her aircraft was greatly improved during the second phase of her second modernization in 1940–41 when the <b>aircraft</b> <b>handling</b> equipment was moved to the stern and a new catapult was installed. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns from 1942 on.|$|E
5|$|No.410 Squadron is now (2010) a Royal Canadian Air Force {{aircraft}} squadron {{located at}} Canada's primary CF-18 training base at Cold Lake, Alberta.

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil to protect them against magnetic mines. Leipzig had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo tubes. In 1942, Nürnbergs <b>aircraft</b> <b>handling</b> equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed.

25|$|A {{design feature}} of the Peregrine {{was that it was}} {{produced}} in both right- and left-hand tractor variants. This was done to improve <b>aircraft</b> <b>handling</b> by providing a counter-rotating propeller facility. This was a common feature of German designs, but relatively rare on UK engines. The handing of internal parts to achieve this was a considerable complication that was later abandoned in favour of an idler gear arrangement for the Merlin propeller reduction gear.|$|E
25|$|One year after, on 2 June 2011, the Airport Authority {{announced}} {{and released}} their {{latest version of}} a 20-year blueprint for the airport's development, the Hong Kong International Airport Master Plan 2030.

25|$|The first prototype, the SE.400-01 {{made its}} maiden flight from Marignane on 31 December 1939. Flight testing {{showed that the}} SE-400 {{suffered}} from stability problems, and the aircraft had a new, larger, tail assembly fitted and its nose lengthened. These modifications resolved the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>handling</b> problems, but {{by this time the}} competing Breguet Nautilus had been ordered into production.|$|R
25|$|The prototype, {{named the}} Stipa-Caproni, first flew on October 7, 1932. Remarkably ungainly in appearance, the plane {{nonetheless}} proved Stipa's concept in that its intubed propeller increased its engine's efficiency, and the airfoil {{shape of the}} tube gave it an improved rate of climb compared to conventional aircraft of similar engine power and wing loading. The Stipa-Caproni also had a very low landing speed and was much quieter than conventional aircraft. Its rudder and elevators were mounted in the propeller's slipstream in the opening at {{the trailing edge of}} the tube in order to improve handling, and this configuration gave the <b>aircraft</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics that it made it very stable in flight.|$|E

In August 1925, <b>aircraft</b> <b>handling</b> and take-off tests were conducted aboard Nagato.

500|$|The two Implacables were {{tentatively}} {{scheduled to}} be modernised in 1953–55 with Implacable following Victorious. The draft Staff Requirements were drawn up in July 1951.

25|$|These changes did {{not solve}} the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>handling</b> problems, and the {{sweepback}} of the wings was reduced, which did resolve the handling problems.

50|$|In the mid-1930s, Beech {{undertook}} a major redesign of the aircraft, {{to create the}} Model D17 Staggerwing. The D17 featured a lengthened fuselage that improved the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics by increasing control leverage, and the ailerons were relocated to the upper wings, eliminating interference with the flaps. Braking was improved with a foot-operated brake linked to the rudder pedals.|$|R

500|$|At {{the same}} time as the current work mandate, No.410 Squadron is also {{responsible}} for training and re-certifying about five former CF-18 Hornet pilots annually. These pilots are returning to the CF-18 after a ground or exchange tour. No.410 Squadron also trains newly arrived foreign exchange officers who will be joining one of Canada's two operational fighter squadrons. As backgrounds can differ significantly, each course is tailored to the individual, based on their experience and demonstrated competencies. Areas covered in depth in the Fighter Pilot Course (FPC) include basic and advanced <b>aircraft</b> <b>handling,</b> instrument flight, formation flying, night flying, all-weather interception, air-to-air refuelling, Basic Fighter Manoeuvres (BFM – [...] "dogfighting skills") and air combat. The latter half of each FPC comprises academic air-to-ground weapons delivery and Close Air Support (CAS), as well as advanced Air Interdiction (AI) tactics, the former usually completed during a squadron deployment to the south-western United States in the late spring and early fall, due to the significantly better weather and the sheer number of bombing ranges available.|$|E
500|$|... 12 April 1989: A Concorde of British registration, G-BOAF, on a {{chartered}} {{flight from}} Christchurch, New Zealand, to Sydney, suffered a structural failure in-flight at supersonic speed. As the aircraft was climbing and accelerating through Mach 1.7 a [...] "thud" [...] was heard. The crew {{did not notice}} any handling problems, and they assumed the thud they heard was a minor engine surge. No further difficulty was encountered until descent through 40,000 feet at Mach 1.3, when a vibration was felt throughout the aircraft, lasting two to three minutes. Most of the upper rudder had become separated from the aircraft at this point. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>handling</b> was unaffected, and the aircraft made a safe landing at Sydney. The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) concluded that {{the skin of the}} rudder had been separating from the rudder structure {{over a period of time}} before the accident due to moisture seepage past the rivets in the rudder. Furthermore, production staff had not followed proper procedures during an earlier modification of the rudder, but the procedures were difficult to adhere to. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.|$|E
