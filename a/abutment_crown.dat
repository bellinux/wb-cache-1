PURPOSE The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the long-term performance of customized zirconia implant <b>abutments</b> supporting all-ceramic <b>crowns.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-seven patients receiving 54 single implants were included (25 incisors, 14 canines, 15 premolars in both jaws). Yttria-stabilized zirconia abutments were screwed to the implants with a defined torque. All-ceramic crowns were adhesively cemented onto the abutments. The implants, <b>abutments,</b> and <b>crowns</b> were clinically and radiographically examined after 11 years of use. Modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria were used to assess technical outcomes: fracture of abutment/crown framework/veneering ceramic, loosening of abutment screw/crown, marginal adaptation, anatomical form, occlusal wear, and abutment fit. The biological parameters were pocket probing depth, plaque control record, bleeding on probing, papilla index, and gingival/mucosal recession at implants and neighboring natural teeth. The cumulative success rate of <b>abutments</b> and <b>crowns</b> was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The results of the USPHS criteria were analyzed descriptively.

40|$|Background: This study {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} fabricating implant <b>abutments</b> and <b>crowns</b> from pre-sintered feldspathic porcelain blocks using the chair-side CAD/CAM, CEREC 3 D system. Methods: Thirty-two implant analogues {{were divided into two}} groups. In the control group, prefabricated machined anatomical titanium (Ti) abutments were screw-retained to the analogues. In the test group, machined feldspathic porcelain abutments were cemented on prefabricated machined Ti links and screw-retained to the implant analogues. These feldspathic porcelain abutments were fabricated out of pre-sintered feldspathic porcelain blocks as duplicates of the abutments in the control group using the CAD/CAM, CEREC 3 D system. Thirty-two feldspathic porcelain crowns, also fabricated out of pre-sintered ceramic blocks, were then cemented with resin cement on all the abutments in both groups. All samples were subsequently subjected to fracture strength testing under static load. An unpaired t-test was used to compare fracture load values between the two groups. Results: The test group using feldspathic porcelain <b>abutments</b> and <b>crowns</b> showed statistically significant higher mean fracture strength than the control group with the Ti abutments and feldspathic porcelain crowns.

40|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{is needed}} in several yttria-stabilized zirconia components used in restorative dentistry for osseointegration or adhesion purposes. This {{can be achieved by}} different treatments, which may also modify the microstructure of the surface. Among them, sandblasting and chemical etching are widely used, but their effect on hydrothermal aging of zirconia is not fully understood. In the present work, the zirconia long-term stability of rough surfaces prepared by these techniques is analyzed and a method is proposed for preventing hydrothermal aging while maintaining the original surface appearance and mechanical properties. The method involves pressure infiltration of a Cerium salt solution on the roughened surfaces followed by a thermal treatment. The solution, trapped by surface defects and small pores, is decomposed during thermal treatment into Cerium oxide, which is diffused at high temperature, obtaining Ce codoping in the near-surface region. In addition, the microstructural changes induced in the near-surface by sandblasting or chemical etching are removed by the thermal treatment together with surface defects. No color modification was observed and the final roughness parameters were in the range of existing implants of proved good osseointegration. The aging resistance of Ce co-doped materials was strongly enhanced, showing the absence of aging after artificial degradation, increasing in this way the surface mechanical integrity. The proposed treatment is easily applicable to the current manufacturing procedures of zirconia dental posts, <b>abutments,</b> <b>crowns</b> and dentures, representing a solution to hydrothermal aging in these and other biomedical applications.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the fracture resistance of all-ceramic crowns cemented on titanium and zirconia implant abutments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Customized implant abutments for maxillary right central incisors made of titanium (Ti) and zirconia (Zr) (n= 60, n= 30 per group) were fabricated for an internal connection implant system. All-ceramic crowns were fabricated for their corresponding implant abutments {{using the following}} systems (n= 10 per group) : (1) monolithic computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) lithium disilicate (MLD); (2) pressed lithium disilicate (PLD); (3) yttrium stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (YTZP). The frameworks of both PLD and YTZP systems were manually veneered with a fluorapatite-based ceramic. The crowns were adhesively cemented to their implant abutments and loaded to fracture in a universal testing machine (0. 5 mm/minute). Data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test (α= 0. 05). RESULTS: Both the abutment material (P=. 0001) and the ceramic crown system (P=. 028) significantly affected the results. Interaction terms were not significant (P=. 598). Ti-MLD (558. 5 ± 35 N) showed the highest mean fracture resistance among all abutment-crown combinations (340. 3 ± 62 - 495. 9 ± 53 N) (P<. 05). Both MLD and veneered ceramic systems in combination with Ti abutments (558. 5 ± 35 - 495. 9 ± 53 N) presented significantly higher values than with Zr abutments (392. 9 ± 55 - 340. 3 ± 62 N) (P<. 05). MLD crown system showed significantly higher mean fracture resistance compared to manually veneered ones on both Ti and Zr abutments (P<. 05). While Ti-MLD and Ti-PLD abutment-crown combinations failed only in the <b>crowns</b> without <b>abutment</b> fractures, Zr-YTZP combination failed exclusively in the <b>abutment</b> without <b>crown</b> fracture. Zr-MLD and Zr-PLD failed predominantly in both the <b>abutment</b> and the <b>crown.</b> Ti-YTZP showed only implant neck distortion.

30|$|In {{cases with}} congenitally missing teeth, the {{defect in the}} {{dentition}} occurs very early in life, in contrast to many other implant patients who lost their teeth due to caries or periodontitis at later stages. The early time point has an advantage that the young patients are usually well adapted to the defects. However, prosthetic treatments are often necessary already in childhood. In childhood and adolescence, prosthetic treatments can be complicated, because teeth should not be ground as <b>abutments</b> for <b>crowns</b> due to the large pulp cavity, and dentures may not be splinted if the jaws still grow. It is also questionable whether dental implants can be placed before termination of growth due to the well-known problems of secondary infraocclusion due to the ankylotic healing of osseointegrated implants and due to other biological reasons [3]. Furthermore, children and their young parents and families often have a cost problem, since unlike other implant patient groups, the tooth defects appear in early phases of life when the income is low or needed elsewhere.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To objectively {{determine}} {{the difference in}} colour between the peri-implant soft tissue at titanium and zirconia abutments. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eleven patients, each with two contralaterally inserted osteointegrated dental implants, were included in this study. The implants were restored either with titanium <b>abutments</b> and porcelain-fused-to-metal <b>crowns,</b> or with zirconia <b>abutments</b> and ceramic <b>crowns.</b> Prior and after crown cementation, multi-spectral images of the peri-implant soft tissues and the gingiva of the neighbouring teeth were taken with a colorimeter. The colour parameters L*, a*, b*, c* and the colour differences ΔE were calculated. Descriptive statistics, including non-parametric tests and correlation coefficients, were used for statistical analyses of the data. RESULTS Compared to the gingiva of the neighbouring teeth, the peri-implant soft tissue around titanium and zirconia (test group), showed distinguishable ΔE {{both before and after}} crown cementation. Colour differences around titanium were statistically significant different (P = 0. 01) only at 1 mm prior to crown cementation compared to zirconia. Compared to the gingiva of the neighbouring teeth, statistically significant (P < 0. 01) differences were found for all colour parameter, either before or after crown cementation for both abutments; more significant differences were registered for titanium abutments. Tissue thickness correlated positively with c*-values for titanium at 1 mm and 2 mm from the gingival margin. CONCLUSIONS Within their limits, the present data indicate that: (i) The peri-implant soft tissue around titanium and zirconia showed colour differences when compared to the soft tissue around natural teeth, and (ii) the peri-implant soft tissue around zirconia demonstrated a better colour match to the soft tissue at natural teeth than titanium...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This {{clinical}} report {{describes a}} single-tooth implant restoration {{in a fresh}} extraction socket in the anterior maxilla, with immediate provisionalization and CAD-CAM zirconia final prosthesis. Methods and Materials: Due to a traumatic injury, an esthetically concerned 40 year-old female patient was treated with an atraumatic extraction of a maxillary central incisor, which was immediately substituted with a single implant. Immediate provisionalization was performed using a screw-retained resin crown. Two months after surgery, the patient was fitted with a final all-ceramic single crown cemented on a CAD-CAM customized zirconia abutment. Results: Healing was predictable, with the implant neither showing mobility nor presenting pain. The zirconia crown was undamaged. The patient was pleased with treatment time and esthetic result. Discussion: Implant treatment with immediate provisionalization offers several advantages: optimal esthetics is achievable as bone and soft tissue architecture is maintained; patients are provided with a fixed temporary restoration {{at the time of}} surgery; treatment time is shortened, as second stage surgery is eliminated.

40|$|AbstractConical crown-retained {{dentures}} (CCRD) show {{a higher}} survival rate and greater patient satisfaction than transitional removable partial dentures during long-term follow-up. However, unsustainable denture retention force on supporting abutments after initial delivery and loss retention are frequently seen in long-term follow-up of clinical cases. The main causes are insufficient information concerning denture retention designs and the retention-tolerance of the supporting abutments. Monitoring by dental technicians {{of the quality}} of dental prostheses is critical. This case report describes an optimal method for CCRD construction that determines and distributes an optimal denture retention force on the supporting abutments to allow the patient to easily remove the denture while ensuring that the CCRD remains in place during physiologic activities. Oral rehabilitation with CCRD should consider the condition of the abutment periodontal support, the interarch occlusal relationship, supplemental fatigue of the terminal abutment, and patient's estimated bite force. The effects of friction on the <b>abutment's</b> inner <b>crown</b> were based on an optimal a angle. The dental laboratory used these measurements to fabricate a CCRD using a Koni-Meter to adjust the retention of the inner crown.

To {{evaluate}} via {{finite element}} analysis the effect of different ferrule heights on stress distribution within each part of a maxillary first premolar (MFP) restored with adhesively luted glass fiber-reinforced resin (GFRR) posts and a ceramic crown. Methods. The solid models consisted of MFP, periodontal ligament and the corresponding alveolar bone process. Four models were created representing different degrees of coronal tissue loss (0 mm, 1 mm, 2 mm and 3 mm of ferrule height). First set of computing runs was performed for in vivo FE-model validation purposes. In the second part, a 200 -N force was applied on the buccal cusp directed at 45 ° to the longitudinal axis of the tooth. Principal stresses values and distribution were recorded within root, <b>abutment,</b> posts, <b>crown</b> and related adhesive interfaces. Results. All FE-models showed similar stress distribution within roots, with highest stress present in the chamfer area. In composite abutments higher stress was observed when no ferrule was present compared to ferruled FE-models. Stress distribution within crown and GFRR posts did not differ among the models. Stress values at the adhesive interfaces decreased with increasing ferrule height. Significance.

40|$|Implant-supported fixed restorations {{are widely}} used in {{practice}} {{with the aim of}} prosthetic rehabilitation of edentulous patients; however, in Ukraine, the aforementioned methods are currently not completely lawful due to the absence of departmental standards of time needed for orthopedists to manufacture such types of dentures. In prosthetic dentistry, labor inputs are determined based on the average standard working time for professionals that not always correspond to the actual time expenditures which must be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate units of labor input.   The objective of the research was to determine the units of labor input of orthopediststo manufacture implant-supported fixed restorations. Materials and methods.  The object of the research involved clinical processes of manufacturing implant-supported fixed restorations. The units of labor input were determined based on the average time standards obtained in the result of timing measurements of clinical processes of providing appropriate care. The conversion of the obtained time standards (TS) to the units of labor input (ULI) was performed according to the formula: ULI = Tts / T 1 uli Results and discussion.  Clinical processes of manufacturing 69 single implant-supported restorations by 15 orthopedists were studied. There were manufactured 13 crowns with screw-retained solid <b>abutments,</b> 21 <b>crowns</b> with screw-retained <b>abutments,</b> 17 single <b>abutments,</b> 18 screw-retained <b>crowns</b> with burn-out plastic abutments or abutments with a platform for attaching and pressing.

The von Mises stresses in the cortical bone were mostly greater in the tissue-level implant (MK III) than in the bone-level implant (Active) of the NobelBiocare system. However, von Mises stresses in cancellous bone were mostly greater in the bone-level implant (Active) than in the tissue-level implant (MK III) of the NobelBiocare system. Conclusion: Within {{the limitations of the}} present study, the Straumann system produced greater stresses than the NobelBiocare system in type IV cortical bone, but they were almost equal in type II bone. By contrast, the NobelBiocare system produced greater stresses than the Straumann system in cancellous bone, regardless of the type of loading angle or bone quality...|$|R
40|$|Cements {{used for}} seating fixed {{dentures}} {{are expected to}} have some definite resistance to tearing off and impact loads. It seems that these features may significantly influence the effective adhesion of a crown or bridge. For final seating of dentures both phosphate and glassionomer cements, which are a more recent invention, are used. The aim of this work was to compare two cements from the phosphate group with two cements from the glassionomere group with respect to their tearing off resistance and resistance to impact loads. The experiment was conducted in vitro. In the test for tearing off resistance Osteoplant implant was used as the <b>abutment.</b> The <b>crown</b> was a cast chrome- nickel substructure. The Raustein FM 250 was used for registration of this phenomenon. Six tests for tearing were conducted for each cement. A special device was constructed to test resistance to impact loads. The abutment was made of brass. After coating with a layer of varnish the substructure was contoured as a wax pattern and then cast in Remanium CS alloy. This metal substructure had additional handles for easier manipulation. Six tests were made for each material. When analyzing the results we found significant differences between the values of tearing resistance of the cements from the two groups (the average tearimg resistance for 1. Harv. Phosp. 183. 3 N; 2. Poscal 273. 5 N; 3. Rely X 27. 8 N; 4. GC Fuji I 19 N). Significant differences were also observed when impact load resistance was tested...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} technology with implants based {{has now been}} developed in recent years. Implant with the bridge superstructure method is employed after variety of considerations where {{it is expected to}} meet its function, aesthetics, and comfortability. The alveolar bone existed is one reason for the process of adding bone (bonegraft). This case report proposes to determine the successful insertion of a superstructure anterior implant bridge post autograft. Two female patients were asked to use dental implant anterior with bridge system. The first case, the autograft application is made for a 20 -year-old woman with edentulous teeth 11, 21, 22. One year later it was then inserted in the area of dental implant fixture 11 and 22. After 9 months, the healing abutments and the superstructure were inserted too. 2 weeks after, the abutments of bridge and crowns of teeth 11, 21 and 22 with a pontic in the teeth 21 had been inserted. The second case, a 46 -year-old woman with edentulous 11, 12, 21, 22. They want to change the denture because they did not feel comfortable with the removable denture acrylic. Fixture placement was done a year after autograft. Insertion of healing abutments and the superstructure printing can be done after 6 months. A month later implant <b>abutments</b> and <b>crowns</b> could be inserted. Labial fullness is corrected; an implant-retained in the region of 12 and 21, 12, and 22 used the pontic. Prosthodontic rehabilitation with a fixed denture using the implant bridge after autograft anterior maxilla is an alternative fixed denture placement with satisfactory results, aesthetic correction and comfortably...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{test the}} {{survival}} rates, and {{the technical and}} biological complication rates of customized zirconia and titanium abutments 5  years after crown insertion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients with 40 single implants in maxillary and mandibular canine and posterior regions were included. The implant sites {{were randomly assigned to}} zirconia <b>abutments</b> supporting all-ceramic <b>crowns</b> or titanium <b>abutments</b> supporting metal-ceramic <b>crowns.</b> Clinical examinations were performed at baseline, and at 6, 12, 36 and 60  months of follow-up. The abutments and reconstructions were examined for technical and/or biological complications. Probing pocket depth (PPD), plaque control record (PCR) and Bleeding on Probing (BOP) were assessed at abutments (test) and analogous contralateral teeth (control). Radiographs of the implants revealed the bone level (BL) on mesial (mBL) and distal sides (dBL). Data were statistically analyzed with nonparametric mixed models provided by Brunner and Langer and STATA (P <  0. 05). RESULTS: Eighteen patients with 18 zirconia and 10 titanium abutments were available at a mean follow-up of 5. 6  years (range 4. 5 - 6. 3  years). No abutment fracture or loss of a reconstruction occurred. Hence, the survival rate was 100 % for both. Survival of implants supporting zirconia abutments was 88. 9 % and 90 % for implants supporting titanium abutments. Chipping of the veneering ceramic occurred at three metal-ceramic crowns supported by titanium abutments. No significant differences were found at the zirconia and titanium abutments for PPD (meanPPD(ZrO 2) 3. 3  ±  0. 6  mm, mPPD(T) (i) 3. 6  ±  1. 1  mm), PCR (mPCR(Z) (rO) (2) 0. 1  ±  0. 3, mPCR(T) (i) 0. 3  ±  0. 2) and BOP (mBOP(Z) (rO) (2) 0. 5  ±  0. 3, mBOP(T) (i) 0. 6  ±  0. 3). Moreover, the BL was similar at implants supporting zirconia and titanium abutments (mBL(Z) (rO) (2) 1. 8  ±  0. 5, dBL(Z) (rO) (2) 2. 0  ±  0. 8; mBL(T) (i) 2. 0  ±  0. 8, dBL(T) (i) 1. 9  ±  0. 8). CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistically or clinically relevant differences between the 5 -year survival rates, and the technical and biological complication rates of zirconia and titanium abutments in posterior regions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of different types and design of zirconia frameworks as well as the effect of different veneering ceramics on the fracture strength of crowns. The importance of different abutment materials was also evaluated. Materials and methods: Eighty cores, 40 in a fully-sintered zirconia material and 40 in a pre-sintered zirconia material were made. Twenty cores of each material were made with a core of even thickness shape (ES) and 20 were made with a core with anatomical shape (AS). The cores were divided into subgroups and veneered with one of two different veneering ceramics: a porcelain and a glass-ceramic material. In total eight groups of 10 crowns were made. They were all cemented onto abutments made of resin. One extra group of 10 AS, pre-sintered zirconia cores veneered with glass-ceramic were made and cemented onto titanium <b>abutments.</b> All <b>crowns</b> underwent thermocycling and mechanical pre-load and were finally loaded until fracture. Results: AS crowns withstood significantly higher loads than ES crowns (P-value < 0. 001), and <b>crowns</b> with titanium <b>abutments</b> withstood significantly higher loads than <b>crowns</b> supported by <b>abutments</b> made of inlay pattern resin (P-value < 0. 001). Three types of fracture were noted: minor and major fracture of the veneering ceramic, and complete fracture through core and veneer. ES crowns showed significantly more major fractures of the veneering ceramic than AS crowns. Conclusions: This in vitro study indicates that the design of the core, as well as the abutment support, significantly influences fracture load and fracture mode of yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystals crowns...|$|R
