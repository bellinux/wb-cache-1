A simulated user evaluation is conducted on the TREC VID collection and the results are presented.

30|$|The {{spearhead}} of {{the proposed}} methodology {{is the definition of}} a DSL to implement SDR waveforms running on FPGA uniprocessor platforms. A DSL, as opposed to the general-purpose languages (GPLs), is a computer programming language of limited expressiveness focused on a particular domain [21, 22]. In [21], they are declined into two variants, namely the internal DSL and the external DSL. Internal DSLs are languages that depend on a host language (generally a GPL). Their syntax is derived from the host language syntax and they benefit from the existing GPL compiling frameworks. An external DSL denotes a language with a custom syntax not depending on any GPLs. They are generally developed from scratch and require defining a specific compiling framework. Finally, the advantages of implementing a DSL are the improvement of the development productivity, the fact of facilitating the communication between domain expert through an explicit syntax, and above <b>all,</b> <b>the</b> <b>usage</b> of an alternative computational model.|$|E

Also Search Engines (SEs) store usage information in so-called query logs, which can be used in different ways to improve the SE user experience. In this thesis we focus on improving the performance of a SE, in particular its effectiveness and efficiency, through query log mining. We propose to enhance the performance of SEs by discussing a novel Query Recommender System. We prove that is possible to decrease the length of a user's query session by unloading the SE of part of the queries that the user submits in order to refine his initial search. This approach helps the user find what she/he is searching in a shorter period of time, {{while at the same time}} decreasing the number of queries that the SE must process, and thus decreasing the overall server load. We also discuss how to enhance the SE efficiency by optimizing the use of it...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{an experience of}} dependability assessment of a typical industrial Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The PLC {{is based on a}} two out of three voting policy and it is intended to be used for safety functions. Safety assessment of computer based systems performing safety functions is regulated by standards and guidelines. In all of them there is a common agreement that no single method can be considered sufficient to achieve and assess safety. The paper addresses the PLC assessment by probabilistic methods to determine its dependability attributes related to Safety Integrity Levels as defined by IEC 61508 standard. The assessment has been carried out by independent teams, starting from the same basic assumptions and data. Diverse combinatorial and state space probabilistic modelling techniques, implemented by public tools, have been used. Even if the isolation of teams was not formally granted, the experience has shown different topics worthwhile to be described. First of <b>all,</b> <b>the</b> <b>usage</b> of different modelling techniques has led to diverse models. Moreover models focus on different system details also due the diverse teams skill. Also slight differences in understanding PLC assumptions have been occurred. In spite of all, the numerical results of the diverse models are comparable. The experience has also allowed a comparison of the different modelling techniques as implemented by the considered public tools...|$|E

40|$|Epistemic {{distance}} in Croatian: {{the case of}} the l-participle In modern Croatian the l-participle (which is inflected for gender and number) is used to form the perfect tense, the pluperfect tense, the “second future ” tense, the first and second conditional, and the optative. Croatian grammars (e. g. Barić, E. et al. 1995; Katičić 1991; Silić and Pranjković 2005) describe their formation and use, but they do not provide any explanations of the possible reasons behind them. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a unified account of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>usages</b> of <b>the</b> l-participle in Croatian, which we claim express epistemic distance, i. e. the distance of the process in relation to the speaker and her knowledge about the event (Langacker 1991).
