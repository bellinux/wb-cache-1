40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} {{representation}} and solution of asymmetric decision problems. We describe a new graphical representation called sequential valuation networks, {{which is a}} hybrid of Covaliu <b>and</b> <b>Oliver’s</b> sequential decision diagrams and Shenoy’s asymmetric valuation networks. Sequential valuation networks inherit many of the strengths of sequential decision diagrams and asymmetric valuation networks while overcoming many of their shortcomings. We illustrate our technique by representing and solving {{a modified version of}} Covaliu <b>and</b> <b>Oliver’s</b> Reactor problem. ...|$|R
5|$|In a {{flashback}} set in Hong Kong, Oliver learns how to torture suspects effectively to obtain information. In the present, Oliver and Roy Harper locate {{the home of}} Digger Harkness, the boomerang-wielding murderer, where they find A.R.G.U.S. operatives looking for him as well. Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon arrive in Starling City to help Felicity Smoak investigate Sara Lance's death. Digger attempts to kill Lyla Michaels, Roy, <b>and</b> <b>Oliver,</b> but Barry arrives and stops him. Later, Lyla reveals Digger {{was part of the}} Suicide Squad. When Oliver uses extreme interrogation methods against a Russian mob member in order to locate Digger, Barry questions how emotionally stable Oliver is. Digger locates Oliver's hideout and wounds Lyla before escaping. In order to leave town, Digger plants five bombs around the city. While Oliver captures Digger, Barry uses both of their teams to defuse the bombs simultaneously. Digger is incarcerated on the island with Slade Wilson. Before Barry and his team's departure, he <b>and</b> <b>Oliver</b> decide to have a friendly duel.|$|E

5|$|By some accounts, Smith {{had been}} {{teaching}} a polygamy doctrine {{as early as}} 1831, and there is unconfirmed evidence that Smith was a polygamist by 1835. Although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy, in 1837 there was a rift between Smith <b>and</b> <b>Oliver</b> Cowdery over the issue. Cowdery suspected Smith had engaged {{in a relationship with}} his serving girl, Fanny Alger. Smith never denied a relationship, but insisted it was not adulterous, presumably because he had taken Alger as a plural wife.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, Bath's abbey {{church was}} {{dilapidated}} <b>and</b> <b>Oliver</b> King, Bishop of Bath and Wells, decided to rebuild it {{on a smaller}} scale in 1500.

The abbey church became derelict before being restored as the city's parish church in the Elizabethan era, when the city experienced a revival as a spa. The baths were improved and the city began to attract the aristocracy. A Royal charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590 confirmed city status.|$|E
