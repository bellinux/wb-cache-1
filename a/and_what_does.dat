5|$|The poem is in {{many ways}} deeply Christian, with {{frequent}} references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at {{it in the context of}} the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> not. For example, some critics compare Sir Gawain to the other three poems of the Gawain manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret Gawain similarly. Comparing it to the poem Cleanness (also known as Purity), for example, they see it as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in Gawain's case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In Cleanness the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.|$|E

The Question Mark Inside consisted of digital text projections to the cathedral dome, West Front and inside onto the Whispering Gallery. The text was based on blog contributions {{by the general public}} as well as interviews conducted by the artist and on the artist's own views. The project presented a stream of possible answers to the question: 'What makes life meaningful and purposeful, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> St Paul's mean in that contemporary context?' The Question Mark Inside opened on 8 November 2008 and ran for eight nights.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle also {{includes}} in {{his theory of}} dreams what constitutes a dream <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> not. He claimed that a dream is first established {{by the fact that}} the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, Aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream. The actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses, the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake.|$|E

He felt that the writing was [...] "pretentious" [...] and {{composed}} of [...] "some weird, weird bullshit". VanDerWerff wrote that, although the episode was unsuccessful, there was something so [...] "pure and unadorned at its center that I can't outright hate it". Furthermore, he admired the show and Anderson for [...] "making the attempt". Kevin Silber of Space.com gave the episode a negative review, critical of the script and characterization. [...] He said, [...] "nothing much seems to happen, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> occur is substantially driven by coincidence and arbitrariness". He did not like Azar and disapproved of Scully's philosophical [...] "reverie", calling it [...] "facile, and hard to reconcile with the determined rationalism she's displayed {{over the years in}} the face of events no less strange than those that occur here".|$|E
500|$|Cold deserts, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} temperate deserts, occur at higher latitudes than hot deserts, and the aridity {{is caused by}} the dryness of the air. Some cold deserts are far from the ocean and others are separated by mountain ranges from the sea and in both cases there is insufficient moisture in the air to cause much precipitation. The largest of these deserts are found in Central Asia. Others occur on {{the eastern side of the}} Rocky Mountains, the eastern side of the southern Andes and in southern Australia. Polar deserts are a particular class of cold desert. The air is very cold and carries little moisture so little precipitation occurs <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> fall, usually as snow, is carried along in the often strong wind and may form blizzards, drifts and dunes similar to those caused by dust and sand in other desert regions. In Antarctica, for example, the annual precipitation is about [...] on the central plateau and some ten times that amount on some major peninsulas.|$|E

[...] Buzzfeed ranked the episode as the 4th best Veronica Mars episode, behind [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", [...] "Leave It to Beaver", and [...] "Not Pictured." [...] TV Line ranked the episode 6th on a similar list. Give Me My Remote ranked [...] "Weapons of Class Destruction" [...] as the fifth best episode of Veronica Mars, particularly noting the kiss scene between Logan and Veronica. [...] "Veronica kisses Logan in a scene that was full of so much chemistry that it gave me chills. The episode ends with Veronica figuring out that Ben was setting Norris up, but, honestly, who was really paying attention at that point?

Perry Nemiroff of Cinema Blend speculated that Tron 3 could be the first installment in a new trilogy. On January 13, 2011, Ain't It Cool News reported that the film was close to having its sequel announced as part of Disney's plan for Tron future. On January 21, 2011, Tron-Sector reported an unsourced rumor that a sequel to Tron: Legacy had been green-lit and a teaser trailer would debut on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of Tron and Tron: Legacy. Harry Knowles reported on the teaser, calling it a [...] "DVD Extra" [...] and noting that it had been filmed before Thanksgiving (i.e. before November 2010). On April 8, 2011, director Joseph Kosinski talked about the sequel: [...] "We're working on the story right now. Once we get a script we're all really happy with, we'll take it to the powers that be and see if we can go back to the grid. I think we will pick up with where Tron: Legacy left off with Sam and Quorra in the real world <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> that mean and the possibilities it opens up for the next chapter. It's that relationship between the two of them that's the next step." [...] On March 31, Kosinski said that the film's script was expected to be finished in two weeks and its working title is Tr3n.|$|E

2500|$|The {{audience}} {{disagreed with}} Carruthers. They expressed {{that the show}} made a [...] "ludicrous decision" [...] to keep Babe over Dixie. On February 18, 2007, {{it was reported that}} Cady McClain, Dixie's portrayer, had spoken out about what happened via her blog [...] {{to set the record straight}} and to ease the nerves of fans. Viewers had often voiced that Dixie was killed off because McClain was very out-spoken about matters she disagreed with in regards to the soap opera and executives. In December 2006, McClain learned that Dixie would be one of the Satin Slayer's victims. It was not until several weeks later, however, that the news of McClain's exit leaked to the media. Viewers speculated that her dismissal was due to her outspokenness about the exit of Emmy-winning actress Julia Barr (ex-Brooke English). Seemingly adding credibility to the rumor was a report from Fox News Channel stating that McClain's outspokenness led to ABC executives firing McClain. McClain responded on her blog: [...] "Who is this guy from Fox news <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> he know?" [...] She stated that her blog entries were always approved by ABC executives before they were posted to the Internet. [...] "I was talking about the character of Brooke when I said 'life is not fair,' [...] not Julia getting let go." ...|$|E
