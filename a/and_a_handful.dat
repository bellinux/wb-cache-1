5|$|Cattle breeds such as Hereford or Aberdeen Angus {{date back}} to the 1700s, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of farmers {{continue}} to raise cattle sired by registered pedigree bulls. Bullocks, which live outdoors year-round, grow slowly as they would in their natural habitat, ultimately producing a distinctly tender meat. Around 2,200,000 cattle are slaughtered for beef each year in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Eons ago, Bor, {{father of}} Odin, clashes with the Dark Elf Malekith, who seeks to unleash a weapon {{known as the}} Aether on the nine realms. After conquering Malekith's forces, {{including}} enhanced warriors called the Kursed, on their home world of Svartalfheim, Bor safeguards the Aether within a stone column.

5|$|Today, shetland sheep {{are mainly}} {{kept in the}} Shetland isles <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of other locales. This is because {{of their ability to}} survive on {{infertile}} land that would otherwise be agriculturally useless. Their good-natured temperament is also a major attraction in keeping Shetland sheep. They are most commonly farmed for their prized wool, but they also may be kept for their meat.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance during the game, Virginia Tech running back Ryan Williams was named the game's most valuable player. By {{the end of the}} game, he had set a school record for most rushing yards in a season and conference records for most rushing touchdowns and most total touchdowns. Following the game, Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin resigned to become head coach of the University of Southern California Trojans football team. Several players from each team participated in postseason all-star games <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> were selected to play in the National Football League through the 2010 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Leicester having {{returned}} to England, in February 1587 Elizabeth signed Mary's death warrant, {{with the proviso}} that it be not carried out until she gave her approval. As {{there was no sign of}} her doing so, Burghley, Leicester, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of other privy councillors decided to proceed with Mary's execution in the interest of the state. Leicester went to Bath and Bristol for his health; unlike the other privy councillors involved, he escaped Elizabeth's severe wrath on hearing the news of Mary's death.|$|E

West of the exit, NY391's surroundings become more rural as it enters the town of Hamburg, where it passes by open fields <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of houses.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.|$|E
5|$|Brereton sent Haynes to Dinjan Airfield in the Indian {{state of}} Assam to {{continue}} his supply-line work under the name Assam-Burma-China Ferry Command, or ABC Ferry Command, with the mission of supplying American forces in China. This air organization was formed to carry supplies over the Hump, the air route replacement for the enemy-held Burma Road. At first, Haynes worked with only two C-47 transports, and was accompanied on some missions by just one P-40 Warhawk fighter flown by the outfit's executive of operations, Colonel Robert Lee Scott, Jr., who had shifted to flying a fighter once HALPRO was canceled. When Burma appeared to be falling to the Japanese, Haynes <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of other airmen of the Chinese National Aviation Corporation and the Royal Air Force flew hundreds of evacuation missions from April to mid-June, bringing some 4,500 passengers westward to safety in India. The American ferry aircraft would typically deliver supplies to China then stop in Burma {{on the way back}} to Assam.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Ace's output was {{approaching}} one hundred titles a year, still heavily {{dominated by the}} primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced {{an increase in the}} price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of Frank Herbert's Dune, were priced at 95 cents. With Ballantine Books, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.|$|E
5|$|Holst's {{works were}} played {{frequently}} {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of The Planets in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a significant influence on a number of younger English composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten. Apart from The Planets <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.|$|E
5|$|Hotham and Osborn {{discussed}} {{the situation and}} determined to destroy the wreck to deny it to the French. To this end, three cutters were gathered and a boarding party under Lieutenant Edward Grey sent in to attack Preneuse at 20:00. This party came under fire from the batteries but was able to successfully access the battered French frigate at 21:00, finding that only the officers <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of sailors remained, the others having been {{given the opportunity to}} escape to the shore in boats rather than become prisoners of war. Among the captives was Lhermitte, who was permitted to bring his personal baggage with him before he was brought to the British squadron as a prisoner. Grey then set the wrecked ship alight before returning to Adamant, having executed his orders without losing a single man.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, {{acting on}} these {{feelings}} and perceptions, Stanton joined Mott, Mott's sister Martha Coffin Wright, Jane Hunt <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> {{of other women}} in Seneca Falls. Together they organized the Seneca Falls Convention held in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20. Over 300 people attended. Stanton drafted a Declaration of Sentiments, which she read at the convention. Modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence, Stanton's declaration proclaimed {{that men and women}} are created equal. She proposed, among other things, a then-controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women. The final resolutions, including female suffrage, were passed, in no small measure, because of the support of Frederick Douglass, who attended and informally spoke at the convention.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Division of Biology at Caltech, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (and its precursors) at Cambridge, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of other institutions, the Pasteur Institute became a major center for molecular biology research in the late 1950s. Scientists at Cambridge, led by Max Perutz and John Kendrew, focused on the rapidly developing field of structural biology, combining X-ray crystallography with Molecular modelling and the new computational possibilities of digital computing (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the military funding of science). A number of biochemists led by Frederick Sanger later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of macromolecular structure and function. At the Pasteur Institute, François Jacob and Jacques Monod followed the 1959 PaJaMo experiment {{with a series of}} publications regarding the lac operon that established the concept of gene regulation and identified what {{came to be known as}} messenger RNA. By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of molecular biology—a model for the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction— was largely complete.|$|E
5|$|It {{quickly became}} evident that, {{contrary}} to some rumors, Norton {{had died in}} complete poverty. Five or six dollars in small change had been found on his person, and a search of his room at the boarding house on Commercial Street turned up a single gold sovereign, then worth around $2.50; his collection of walking sticks; his rather battered saber; a variety of headgear (including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap, and another cap suited to a martial band-master); an 1828 French franc; <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of the Imperial bonds he sold to tourists at a fictitious 7% interest. There were fake telegrams purporting to be from Emperor Alexander II of Russia, congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen Victoria, and from the President of France, predicting that such a union would be disastrous to world peace. Also found were his letters to Queen Victoria and 98 shares of stock in a defunct gold mine.|$|E
