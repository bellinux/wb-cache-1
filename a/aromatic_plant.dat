40|$|Some avian species {{incorporate}} <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> {{to their}} nests. The “nest protection hypothesis”, which posits that volatile secondary compounds contained in these plants may have antiparasite properties, {{has not received}} full support. All previous tests of this hypothesis have only considered effects on nest- dwelling ectoparasites, but not on blood-sucking ﬂies. The “drug hypothesis” posits that <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> may stimulate nestling immune system, development, or condition. We tested these hypotheses exper- imentally in wild blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus, a species that adds <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> to their nests. We supplemented <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> to half of a sample of nests, while adding grass to {{the other half of}} nests. We quantiﬁed abundance of two groups of blood-sucking ﬂies (blackﬂies and biting midges) at two differ- ent stages of the reproductive period, and abundance of three nest-dwelling ectoparasites (ﬂeas, mites, and blowﬂies). Experimental supplementation of <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> reduced abundance of ﬂeas only in nests of yearling females and not in nests of older females. Blackﬂies and biting midges were both more numerous in nests of yearling females than in nests of older females. Mass of <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> added by females was negatively related with abundance of ﬂeas in control nests but not in experimental nests supplied with <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants.</b> Mass of plants added by females was also positively related with abun- dance of blackﬂies during the nestling stage. Finally, <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> did not affect nestling growth or immune responses. We conclude that several factors such as female experience and their ability to add plants to the nest interact to explain effects of <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> on different parasitesPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> are {{considered}} sources of antioxidants, antimicrobial and favouring agents. Four <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> (Thymus vulgaris L., Foeniculum vulgare, Pimpinella anisum L. and Trigonellafoenum-graecum L.) were analysed in the study. Yoghurt {{was used to}} produce a low calorie pie. Chemical and rheological parameters, baking performance, staling rate and sensory properties of the pie were investigated. Volatile aroma compounds were anal-ysed with GC and GC/ MS, and antioxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH and β-carotene assays. The incorporation of yoghurt and some <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> in the pie improved protein, fat, fibre, ash, and minerals contents and allowed achieving about 19 % reduction in calories. Sensory evaluation of pie containing the mixture of <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> showed its superior sensory quality.

40|$|Nesting birds use several {{behavioural}} or physiological defence mechanisms against parasites. On Corsica, female blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus incorporate fresh {{fragments of}} {{a limited number of}} <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> in the nest cup, from the end of nest construction until fledging. Some of these plants negatively affect bacterial growth and host location by blood-sucking mosquitoes in laboratory conditions. In natural populations, Corsican blue tit chicks are exposed to the highest levels of blood-sucking ectoparasitic blow flies Protocalliphora spp. reported in Europe. These ectoparasites can have severe negative effects on chick development and survival probabilities, especially when food constraints are elevated. Here we investigated in several natural Corsican blue tit populations the hypothesis that <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> brought to the nest have anti-blow fly effects during the chick-rearing stage. We predicted that: 1) the amount of <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> should be negatively related to blow fly infestation intensity across nests, 2) experimental addition of <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> in nests should reduce blow fly infestation intensity, and 3) nestlings should be in better physical condition in nests where <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> were experimentally added. No significant relation was found between amount of <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> in nests and blow fly infestation intensity. Experimental addition of <b>aromatic</b> <b>plants</b> did not reduce blow fly infestation intensity and did not affect the chick phenotypic parameters we measured. W...|$|R
