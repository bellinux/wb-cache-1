Whedon shot the scene where she finds her mother as one long take, showing her move {{through the house and}} calling the paramedics, about seven times. The rest of the scenes in the act were shot in sequence. At the end, Giles arrives and also attempts to revive Joyce, but Buffy blurts, [...] "We're not supposed to move the body!" [...] Both Gellar and Trachtenberg (Dawn) were raised by single women, and Gellar later spoke about the experience of acting something that was very real and close to her, stating, [...] "you try to separate it <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{and at the same time}} it adds that extra layer". As soon as the scene was finished with Gellar [...] "at a fever pitch", they restarted it where she comes in the door happily, which Whedon regretted for the emotional range Gellar was required to endure.|$|E

5000|$|These {{developments}} led Gerald Celente, {{founder of}} the Trends Research Institute, to identify a trend that he calls [...] "neo-survivalism". He explained this phenomenon in a radio interview with Jim Puplava on December 18, 2009: [...] "When {{you go back to}} the last depressing days when we were in a survival mode, the last one the Y2K of course, before the 1970's, what had happened was you only saw this one element of survivalist, you know, the caricature, the guy with the AK-47 heading to the hills with enough ammunition and pork and beans to ride out the storm. This is a very different one from that: you're seeing average people taking smart moves and moving in intelligent directions to prepare for the worst. (...) So survivalism in every way possible. Growing your own, self-sustaining, doing as much as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> to make it <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> on your own and it can happen in urban area, sub-urban area or the ex-urbans. And it also means becoming more and more tightly committed to your neighbors, your neighborhood, working together and understanding that we're all in this together and that when we help each other out that's going to be the best way forward." [...] This last aspect is highlighted in The Trends Research Journal: [...] "Communal spirit intelligently deployed is the core value of Neo-Survivalism".|$|R
500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To examine doctors’ {{experiences}} of complaints, including which aspects are most stressful. We also investigated how doctors felt complaints processes could be improved. Design and methods: A qualitative study {{based on a}} cross-sectional survey {{of members of the}} British Medical Association (BMA). We asked the following: (1) Try to summarise <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> your experience of the complaints process and how it made you feel. (2) What were the most stressful aspects of the complaint? (3) What would you improve in the complaints system? Participants: We sent the survey to 95 636 doctors, and received 10 930 (11. 4 %) responses. Of these, 6146 had a previous, recent or current complaint and 3417 (31. 3 %) of these respondents answered questions 1 and 2. We randomly selected 1000 answers for analysis, and included 100 using the saturation principle. Of this cohort, 93 responses for question 3 were available. Main results: Doctors frequently reported feeling powerless, emotionally distressed, and experiencing negative feelings towards both those managing complaints and the complainants themselves. Many felt unsupported, fearful of the consequences and that the complaint was unfair. The most stressful aspects were the prolonged duration and unpredictability of procedures, managerial incompetence, poor communication and perceiving that processes are biased in favour of complainants. Many reported practising defensively or considering changing career after a complaint, and few found any positive outcomes from complaints investigations. Physicians suggested procedures should be more transparent, competently managed, time limited, and that there should be an open dialogue with complainants and policies for dealing with vexatious complaints. Some felt more support for doctors was needed. Conclusions: Complaints seriously impact on doctors’ psychological wellbeing, and are associated with defensive practise. This is not beneficial to patient care. To improve procedures, doctors propose they are simplified, time limited and more transparent. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concertina}} model, {{sometimes referred}} to as the concertina rule or [...] "concertina method", is an international trade liberalisation strategy, which consists in removing the highest tariffs first. Amiti (2004, p. 3) traces this [...] "idea back to Meade (1955, Trade and Welfare) who concluded that the welfare gains will be larger if tariffs on those goods with the highest tariffs are reduced first. This result was formalized by a number of authors, including Bertrand and Vanek (1971) and Falvey (1988) for a small, open, perfectly competitive economy." [...] The concertina method consists in a piecemeal approach to trade reforms, however, with a clear quantitative priority setting. The concertina model is also highlighted briefly in Dani Rodrik's book One Economics, Many Recipes and Max Corden's textbook Trade Policy and Economic Welfare. Haussmann, Rodrik and Velasco (HRV)(Growth Diagnostics, 2004) refer to the concertina method as a simple trade and more specifically, tariff reform, second best strategy. The concertina method is a general rule of thumb, which consists in eliminating the highest tariffs first, and so on, until ideally all tariffs are eliminated. [...] "HRV" [...] see 5 possible reform strategies: 1. Wholesale reform ("augmented Washington Consensus": getting prices and institutions right) 2. Do as much and <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> (opportunistic approach, e.g. picking low [...] "hanging fruits", etc.) 3. Sophisticated second-best reform (many trade offs)4. Target the largest distortions ("concertina rule") and 5. Focus on the most binding constraints. Targeting the largest distortions first in the overall economic reform agenda is not very practical as many important distortions (e.g. with respect to institutions) cannot be easily quantified, hence a deeper qualitative analysis is needed. Focussing on the binding constrainst is seen by these [...] "HRV" [...] <b>as</b> the <b>best</b> practical reform agenda. It is superior to the [...] "concertina rule" [...] and also to the so-called [...] "augmented Washington Consensus" [...] which is an impossibly broad and ambitious reform agenda that is insufficiently differentiated according to the needs of different countries. The Concertina policy approach {{can be seen as a}} simple rule of thumb approach for an easy quantifiable problem. Reforming implies planning. However planning has clear limits due to limits to rationality ("bounded rationality" [...] see Simon (1957) and Lindblom (1979)). The HRV approach again is an approach based on rationality. Human interactions often defy a clear rationality or rationality changes with respect to the number of peoples or interest groups involved (see Olson, Mancur's Logic of Collective Action).|$|R
