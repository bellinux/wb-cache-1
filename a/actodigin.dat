40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that cardiac glycosides act through mechanisms distinct from inhibition of the sodium pump but which {{may contribute to}} their cardiac actions. To more fully define differences between agents indicative of mul-tiple sites of action, we studied changes in contractility and action potential (AP) configuration in cat ventricular myocytes produced by six cardiac glycosides (ouabain, ouabagenin, di-hydroouabain, <b>actodigin,</b> digoxin, and resibufogenin). AP short-ening was observed only with ouabain and <b>actodigin.</b> There was extensive inotropic variability between agents, with some giving full inotropic effects before automaticity occurred whereas others produced minimal inotropy before toxicity. AP shortening was not a result of alterations in calcium current or the inward rectifier potassium current, but correlated with a...|$|E
