40|$|Silybum marianum (Milk thistle), {{a member}} of the Asteraceae family, is a tall herb with large prickly whiteveined green leaves and a reddish-purple ﬂower that ends in sharp spines. Certain phytoconstituents were {{revealed}} such as silybin A, silybin B, isosilybin A, isosilybin B, silychristin, silydianin, apigenin 7 -O-β-(2 ″-O-α-rhamnosyl) galacturonide, kaempferol 3 -O-α-rhamnoside- 7 -O-β-galacturonide, apigenin 7 -O-β-glucuronide, apigenin 7 -O-β-glucoside, apigenin 7 -O-β-galactoside, kaempferol- 3 -O-α-rhamnoside, kaempferol, taxifolin and quercetin. The plant is exclusively used as anti-diabetic, hepatoprotective,hypocholesterolaemic, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and as an anti-oxidant. Seeds of the plant are also used as an anti-spasmodic, neuroprotective, anti-viral, immunomodulant, cardioprotective, demulcent and <b>anti-haemorrhagic.</b> The plant is also serves as a galactagogue and used in the treatment of uterine disorders. This review paper focuses mainly on phytochemistry and pharmacological activities of the legendary plant milk thistle...|$|E
40|$|Fibrinogen is a serum {{multi-chain}} protein which, when activated, aggregates to form fibrin, one of {{the main}} components of a blood clot. Fibrinolysis controls blood clot dissolution through the action of the enzyme plasmin, which cleaves fibrin at specific locations. Although the main biochemical factors involved in fibrin formation and lysis have been iden-tified, a clear mechanistic picture of how these processes take place is not available yet. This picture would be instrumental, for example, for the design of improved thrombolytic or <b>anti-haemorrhagic</b> strategies, as well as, materials with improved biocompatibility. Here, we present extensive molecular dynamics simulations of fibrinogen which reveal large bending motions centered at a hinge point in the coiled-coil regions of the molecule. This feature, likely conserved across vertebrates according to our analysis, suggests an explanation for the mechanism of exposure to lysis of the plasmin cleavage sites on fibrinogen coiled-coil region. It also explains the conformational variability of fibrinogen observed during its adsorption on inorganic surfaces and it is supposed {{to play a major role}} in the determination of the hydrodynamic properties of fibrinogen. In addition the simulations suggest how th...|$|E
40|$|Two peptides, textilinins 1 and 2, {{isolated}} from the venom of the Australian common brown snake, Pseudonaja textilis textilis, are effective in preventing blood loss. To further investigate the potential of textilinins as <b>anti-haemorrhagic</b> agents, we cloned cDNAs encoding these proteins. The isolated full-length cDNA (430 bp in size) was shown to code for a 59 amino acid protein, corresponding in size to the native peptide, plus an additional 24 amino acid propeptide. Six such cDNAs were identified, differing in nucleotide sequence in the coding region but with an identical propeptide. All six sequences predicted peptides containing six conserved cysteines common to Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors. When expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and released by cleavage with thrombin, only those peptides corresponding to textilinin 1 and 2 were active in inhibiting plasmin with K-i values {{similar to those of}} their native counterparts and in binding to plasmin less tightly than aprotinin by two orders of magnitude. Similarly, in the mouse tail vein blood loss model only recombinant textilinin 1 and 2 were effective in reducing blood loss. These recombinant textilinins have potential as therapeutic agents for reducing blood loss in humans, obviating the need for reliance on aprotinin, a bovine product with possible risk of transmissible disease, and compromising the fibrinolytic system in a less irreversible manner...|$|E
40|$|Despite <b>anti-haemorrhagic</b> {{therapy with}} proper doses of {{activated}} prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC, Feiba®), patients with acquired haemophilia A (AHA) have a considerable risk of recurrent bleeding complications. Evidence {{in support of}} the benefit-to-risk ratio of prevention strategies with the use of lower doses of aPCC following the end of the initial treatment period is scarce and inconclusive. We report our experience in the management of 18 consecutive patients with AHA admitted to two Haemophilia centres in Italy. We managed the first 11 according to current guidelines (e. g., with conventional aPCC doses until bleeding resolution). Then, we decided to prolong the treatment beyond bleeding resolution with lower doses of the same concentrate (short-term prophylaxis) in the 7 additional patients. In these patients, the treatment was continued {{for as long as the}} titre of FVIII inhibitor was found to decrease by at least 50 % when compared to the baseline one. We observed six relapses of bleeding in patients in whom aPCC was confined to the treatment of the qualifying bleeding episode, and none in patients to whom lower doses were administered until the pre-specified decrease in the titre of FVIII inhibitor was achieved. No patients experienced thrombotic complications during the study period. Prolonging the treatment with lower doses of aPCC beyond the initial phase in patients with AHA in whom the titre of FVIII inhibitor is still high is likely to safely prevent further bleeding complication...|$|E
40|$|Background: Postpartum {{haemorrhage}} (PPH) is the third-most {{common cause}} of maternal death in the United States {{and it is still}} the first prevalent cause of maternal death in developing countries. Active prevention of haemorrhage with an uterotonic or other new drugs leads to a decrease in postpartum vaginal haemorrhage. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare <b>anti-haemorrhagic</b> effect of Tranexamic acid (TXA) and Misoprostol for PPH. Patients and Methods: In a double-blinded randomised control clinical trial, 200 women were included after Caesarean or natural vaginal delivery with abnormal PPH. They were divided into two equal intervention and control groups. Effect of intravenous TXA and Misoprostol for postpartum haemorrhage was examined. Results: The mean age of patients was 26. 7 ± 6. 5 years which ranged from 14 to 43 years. The sonographic gestational age in the group treated with TXA was 37. 7 ± 3. 4 weeks and it was 37. 4 ± 3. 3 weeks for the other group (P = 0. 44). The haemorrhage in the TXA and Misoprostol groups was 1. 2 ± 0. 33 litres and 1. 18 ± 0. 47 litres, respectively (P = 0. 79). The haemoglobin levels after 6 - 12 hours of labour, in TXA group was more than that of the Misoprostol group, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0. 22 and P = 0. 21, respectively). Conclusion: Regarding to the superior results in Misoprostol group in one hand and lack of significant differences between two groups in haemorrhage during labour, post-partum haemoglobin level and discharge haemoglobin level, we can state that Misoprostol has no specific preferences to TXA, but more studies with greater population are needed...|$|E
