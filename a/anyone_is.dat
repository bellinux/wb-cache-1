5|$|Back at her apartment, Scully runs a {{background}} check of Doggett on her computer, learning about his background as a former NYPD detective. She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside {{the window to see}} if <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> out there. She angrily calls Doggett to protest him monitoring her phone conversations, which he seems genuinely surprised about. She notices a mysterious man and runs into the hall to pursue him, but meets her landlord Mr. Coeben who tells her that he had seen Mulder.|$|E
5|$|Tom later {{searches}} Black's office, stealing his gun {{and finding}} Green's name and address. Tom confronts Green at his home, demanding to know where his wife is. The police, who have been watching Green's house, intervene and take Tom home before <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> harmed. Black apologizes for keeping information from Tom, but warns him that his outburst is exactly why he did so. Watts has meanwhile tracked forensic evidence from the abandoned car to a cabin in the woods; blood found there matches both Green and Helen, and a ring is discovered which is identified as Helen's wedding ring.|$|E
5|$|The Minister can declare any fence or barrier {{surrounding}} {{a part of}} a security area to be a perimeter fence. The Commissioner of Police is permitted to take steps to prevent people from crossing the fence or passing articles over, through or under the fence, including defensive measures that involve or may involve danger to life. If the measures are taken in a place other than on, under or within the perimeter fence, the Commissioner must take precautions – including displaying prominent warning signs – to ensure that people do not accidentally enter the area. If <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> injured or dies {{as a result of a}} defensive measure, no compensation is payable unless the Minister certifies that it is just and equitable for such compensation to be paid. It is an offence to cross or attempt to cross, or pass or attempt to pass any article over, though or under a perimeter fence except at an authorized entry point; and to damage, attempt to damage or tamper with any fence or any gate or movable barrier at an entry point.|$|E

[...] Feller appeared in the May 12, 1941, edition of Life, which said: [...] "...he is unquestionably the idol of several generations of Americans, {{ranging in age from}} 7 to 70.

500|$|Coenwulf's kin {{may have}} been {{connected}} to the royal family of the Hwicce, a subkingdom of Mercia around the lower river Severn. It appears that Coenwulf's family were powerful, {{but they were not}} of recent Mercian royal lineage. A letter written by Alcuin to the people of Kent in 797 laments that [...] "scarcely <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> found now of the old stock of kings". Eardwulf of Northumbria had, like Coenwulf, gained his throne in 796, so Alcuin's meaning is not clear, but it may be that he intended it as a slur on Eardwulf or Coenwulf or on both. Alcuin certainly held negative views of Coenwulf, regarding him as a tyrant and criticizing him for putting aside one wife and taking another. Alcuin wrote to a Mercian nobleman to ask him to greet Coenwulf peaceably [...] "if it is possible to do so", implying uncertainty about Coenwulf's policy towards the Carolingians.|$|E
500|$|... "Fantasy" [...] {{exemplified}} how a music sample {{could be}} transformed [...] "into a fully realized pop masterpiece". The song and its remix arguably remains {{as one of}} Carey's most important singles to date. Due to the success and influence of the song, Carey is credited for introducing R and hip hop collaboration into mainstream pop culture, and for popularizing rap as a featuring act through her post-1995 songs. Sasha Frere-Jones, editor of The New Yorker commented in referencing to the song's remix, [...] "It became standard for R/hip-hop stars like Missy Elliott and Beyoncé, to combine melodies with rapped verses. And young white pop stars—including Britney Spears, 'N Sync, and Christina Aguilera—have {{spent much of the}} past ten years making pop music that is unmistakably R" [...] Moreover, Jones concludes that [...] "Her idea of pairing a female songbird with the leading male MCs of hip-hop changed R and, eventually, all of pop.

But they have suffered the side effects of a Romulan cloaking experiment. Ro initial questions whether or not she has died and is now in the afterlife. But together with La Forge they discover a Romulan plot and defeating a similarly cloaked Romulan operative, Ro and La Forge alert the crew and return to normal, warning Picard and averting disaster.|$|E
