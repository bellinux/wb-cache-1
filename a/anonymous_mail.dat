We examined the risk of two major health issues (poor mental and cardiovascular health) associated with current and past exposure to negative behaviour in the workplace. Data from 251 police officers, who completed an <b>anonymous</b> <b>mail</b> survey at two time-points spaced 12 months apart, support the potential role of exposure to negative workplace behaviour in the development of physical disease and psychological illness. Specifically, we saw significant effects associated with past exposure to such behaviour on indicators of poor cardiovascular health, and a significant effect of current exposure on the indicator of mental health problems. Our findings reinforce the need to continue to study links between employee health and both negative workplace behaviour and more severe cases of bullying, particularly the mechanisms involved to strengthen theory in this area, and to protect against employee ill health (specifically cardiovascular outcomes and psychological problems) by preventing negative behaviour at work.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine American and Japanese clergy’s {{perception}} of their role in the prevention of suicide. The research questions are as follows: (a) How do clergy in the United States and Japan perceive suicide? (b) Do they see suicide differently? and (c) How do they envision the role of suicide prevention? The hypotheses are as follows: (a) Christian clergy think that suicide is an unacceptable “sin”; (b) Buddhist clergy are more accepting of suicide than Christian clergy; (c) there are role differences related to suicide prevention in the Japanese and American religious communities; and (d) American and Japanese religious leaders have a different view of their obligations related to suicide prevention. The investigator sent 400 <b>anonymous</b> <b>mail</b> surveys, respectively, to New York and Tokyo. The surveys asked about the clergy’s personal beliefs and the Church’s role in suicide prevention.

The data for this study were drawn from an <b>anonymous</b> <b>mailed</b> survey (n =  648) examining officer attitudes toward the complaint investigation process in one large municipal police department. Structural equation modeling demonstrates that ethnicity does influence officer compliance, but only weakly and indirectly. Latino/a officers are less likely to report trust in police internal affairs than White officers, and thus somewhat less likely report that they are willing to comply with command staff decisions. Other factors, such as morale, perceptions of procedural justice, and rank, prove to be much more powerful predictors of officer compliance than ethnicity. ...|$|R

Between 15 February and 15 April 2002, we sent <b>anonymous</b> <b>mail</b> questionnaires to 660 community pharmacists in the eastern province of Flanders, Belgium. The response rate was 54 % (n = 359). Most of the pharmacists who responded felt that patients {{have the right to}} end their own life (73 %), and that under certain conditions physicians may assist the patient in dying (euthanasia: 84 %; physician-assisted suicide: 61 %). Under the prevailing restrictive legislation, a quarter of the pharmacists were willing to dispense lethal drugs for euthanasia versus 86 % if it were legalized, but only after being well informed by the physician. The respondents-favour guidelines for pharmacists drafted by their own professional organizations (95 %), and enforced by legislation (90 %) to ensure careful end-of-life practice. Over the last two years, 7. 3 % of the responding pharmacists have received a medical prescription for lethal drugs and 6. 4 % have actually dispensed them. So we can conclude that community pharmacists in East Flanders were not adverse to physician-assisted death, but their cooperation in dispensing lethal drugs was conditional on clinical information about the specific case and on protection by laws and professional guideline...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{determine}} the prevalence of burnout in primary education teachers and primary school principals and to explore the relationship of existential fulfillment to self-reported burnout scores. Random samples of 215 teachers and 514 principals participated in a cross-sectional study using an <b>anonymous,</b> <b>mailed</b> survey. Two questionnaires were used in both studies. The Dutch version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory for teachers (Schaufeli & Van Horn, 1995) was used to assess the teachers’ and principals’ burnout level. Second, existential fulfillment was measured by the Längle, Orgler and Kundi (2003) Existence Scale. The results of the present study indicated that teachers’ and principals’ existential fulfillment is related to their burnout level. Lack of existential fulfillment was an impotant burnout determinant. Unfortunately, this concept has been neglected to date. Existential fulfillment may be a significant and usable point of departure for devising psychological interventions aimed at teachers and principals...|$|R

40|$|RESEARCH ARTICLEThe aim of {{the current}} study is to {{determine}} the prevalence of burnout in primary education teachers and explore the relationship of personal fulfillment – the existence scale – to self-reported burnout scores. 215 primary education teachers in the Netherlands participated in a cross-sectional study using an <b>anonymous,</b> <b>mailed</b> survey. Personal fulfillment in one’s existence was measured by the Längle, Orgler and Kundi (2003 b) existence scale that consists of four subscales, i. e. “self-distance”, “self-transcendence”, “freedom” and “responsibility”. Burnout was measured by applying the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Regression analysis shows that the lower the scores on responsibility and self-distance the higher the scores on emotional exhaustion. There is also an inverted relationship between self-transcendence and depersonalization: the lower the scores on self-transcendence the higher the scores on depersonalization. Responsibility and self-transcendence are significantly related to personal accomplishment. Teacher age correlates only with the latter burnout dimension: the younger teachers are the more they have a sense of high personal accomplishment...|$|R

Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study involving {{the entire population of}} Malaysian community pharmacies (nÂ =Â  1419) was undertaken using a self-completed <b>anonymous</b> <b>mail</b> questionnaire. Results A total of 219 responses were received for a response rate of 15. 4 %. Majority of the respondents (93. 6 %) agreed that pharmacists should have generic substitution rights. Almost all pharmacists (96. 8 %) viewed Poison Class C (pharmacist only medicine) as most suitable class of controlled medicines for substitution. About half (51. 6 %) of the pharmacists preferred a policy which allowed substitution on any prescription. The pharmacists prefer to consult the physician when substituting narrow therapeutic index medicines (88. 1 %) and prescription only medicines (51. 3 %). Less than 25. 0 % of the pharmacists routinely keep the medication records and follow-up the patients who received substitution. Monitoring the efficacy (79. 2 %) and patient's satisfaction with the generic medicines (74. 9 %) were the main reasons for following-up the patient if substitution occurs.

Methods: An <b>anonymous</b> <b>mail</b> survey of long-term care facilities was administered to 106 nursing home supervisors at VA Medical Centers with nursing home care units. The response rate was 82 %. Results: Administrators from 106 VA nursing home units reported smoking rates ranging from 5 % to 80 % of long-term care residents, {{with an average of}} 22 %. Half of the nursing homes had indoor smoking areas. Frequent complaints from nonsmokers about passive smoke exposure were reported in 23 % of the nursing homes. The nursing administrators reported that patient safety was their greatest concern. Seventy- eight percent ranked health effects to the smokers themselves a "major concern," while 70 % put health effects to exposed nonsmokers in that category. Smoking in the nursing home was described as a "right" by 59 % of respondents and a ¿privilege¿ by 67 %. Some individuals reported that smoking was both a right and a privilege.

Eight themes emerged from 37 coded concepts, and the median number of themes volunteered per nurse was three. Among the most prevalent themes were patient concerns (53 %), family concerns (33 %), clinical circumstances (42 %), the nurses' personal concerns (38 %), and external or structural issues (68 %). A profound sense of compassion and often conflicting forces were noted within and across themes. The nurses' comments offer a unique perspective on the care of critically ill patients and reveal much about that care that should be improved. In particular, (1) some nurses are frustrated about their limited role in the management of patients at the end of life, given their special understanding of these patients' experiences and wishes; (2) considerable confusion remains about the most appropriate way to care for these patients; and (3) the environment of some critical care settings may be unable to foster the compassion that many patients need. euthanasia life-support critical care nursing...|$|E

Using an <b>anonymous,</b> <b>mailed</b> questionnaire on substance use, we surveyed 500 physicians, 510 pharmacists, and 974 of their students. The physicians and pharmacists were selected randomly from the state society's membership lists, and students selected were from local school lists. Follow-up surveys were sent to nonresponders at two-week intervals. RESULTS. The physicians and medical students did not drink especially heavily and were no more vulnerable to alcoholism than were their counterparts in pharmacy and other professions. Physicians differed from pharmacists in their style of drinking (greater frequency, smaller quantity), but not in total amount of alcohol consumed. Drinking habits among physicians were not associated with medical specialty or type of practice, but were positively related to gender (males drank more than females) and to age (older doctors were more apt to qualify as heavy drinkers than were younger doctors). CONCLUSIONS. Physicians were {{no more likely to}} abuse substances nonmedically than were other professionals.
