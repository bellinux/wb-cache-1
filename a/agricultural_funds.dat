When allocative and income transfer effects are combined, France gains from price harmonization, but the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany lose.

The paper presents a case study research aimed at assessing the feasibility of an integrated model for managing open spaces in order to upgrade their urban, social and environmental performances. The use of a case study method is due to the specific research questions finalized to: -	Provide a model consistent with the requirements of urban upgrading of ancient cities -	Provide a model that it could be replicate to other similar context -	Provide a model that is ecological and sustainable in terms of social and economical efforts Further the case study research is consistent with the aim of designing a specific case study proposal by which it is possible to assess and adjust the model itself.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of agricultural development on the industrializing rural areas in China, and {{the purpose of this study}} is to examine the trend of agricultural development after introduction of Production Responsibility System in Agriculture. For this study, farm surveys by interview method were made at three villages located on the industrializing rural areas in Huangyan County of Zhejiang Province. The three villages selected, i. e. Kangshan village on the less-industrializing rural areas, Fengyangzhong village on the individually industrializing rural areas, and Huayuanli village on collectively industrializing rural areas, are of different type from the standpoint of industrial organization. At each village, 40 representative farmers were purposively selected and interviewed. Findings of this study are summarized as follows. 1. After the Rural Reform in China that begun in 1979, the farmers have become independent managers who are responsible for their management and sensitive to the market informations. In the situation with large profitability gap between agriculture and nonagricultural business, the farmers in industrializing rural areas turn their attention to nonagricultural side business and seldom want to operate their farm seriously. Therefore, the agricultural investment by the farmers are very short. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>funds</b> from every other sources are also very short. 2. Even so, because of the small-size of their farms, the lack of national food market for them, and the insecurity of rural non-agricultural business, the farmers in the industrializing rural areas mainly engaged in non-agricultural business, seldom want to give up operating their farms and hand over their farm lands to other farmers mainly engaged in agriculture. Therefore, though the agricultural labor force decreased rapidly in accordance with the development of non-agricultural business in the rural areas, the farm size have hardly changed. 3. In result, it seems hard for the agricultural production in China to increase to meet the increasing food demand in accordance with the rapid development of Chinese economy. 4. In order to improve this severe situation, at least two tasks must be completed administratively by government. One task is to establish the supporting system of inducing adequate agricultural investment. Another task is to establish the system of promoting the transfer of the use right on farm land from the farmers who do not want to operate their farms to other farmers who want to enlarge the size of their farms. 実態調査に基づく以上の分析は,次のような点を我々に示唆している. つまり,中国の社会経済的及び文化的な諸条件のもとで,農村工業化地域においては,農業の余剰労働力が労働集約的な近代産業の発展によって吸収されさえすれば,残された農業労働力の土地装備率がスムーズに高まり,農家の自主的農業投資によって農業生産力がスムーズに向上し,従って,商品農産物の供給も増えると安易に期待することは困難である. むしろ,農村工業化地域では農家の兼業化が進み,農業労働力の土地装備率は変化せず,農家の営農意欲が低下し,農家による自主的農業投資も不足し,農業生産は停滞するのではないかと考えられる. 農村工業化地域におけるこのような事態を改善するためには,行政的な介入が不可欠であり,少なくとも次の 2 つの課題を解決する必要があろう. つまり,第 1 は農家の自主的農業投資の不足を補い,適正な水準の農業投資を誘導するためのシステムを行政的に確立するという課題であり,第 2 は請負地の経営権の移動を促進し,零細で前近代的な小農経営構造を近代的な農業経営構造へ再編するためのシステムの確立,具体的には,国民的な食料品市場の創出,農村の社会保障制度の確立,耕地利用権の調整に関する制度などを行政的に確立するという課題である...|$|E

40|$|Rural Sustainable Development {{is a very}} {{important}} topic under the European Union policy, and it is currently promoted through the European <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Fund</b> for Rural Development 2014 – 2020. This fund is managed at sub-regional level by the Community-Led Local Development approach that involves Local Action Groups in order to promote the objectives of Rural Sustainable Development within rural municipalities. Each Local Action Group applies the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis in order to identify for its own rural municipalities the strategic elements to which it will allocate the European <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Fund</b> for Rural Development budget. Nevertheless, this analysis has some general shortcomings, including difficulties in managing a large number of Strength and Weakness factors. In addition, the importance of each factor cannot be measured quantitatively, and the same factor may be characterized both as a Strength and a Weakness. Further difficulties may occur in the case of partnerships between different Local Action Groups, such as disagreement about whether a given factor is a Strength or a Weakness, lack of information about the relationships between Strength and a Weakness factors and decision alternatives, as well as impossibility of ranking the decision alternatives. Thus, this research aims to overcome the drawbacks of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis and to support Local Action Group partnerships in the sustainability evaluation of their rural municipalities, and therefore to aid the identification of a common Rural Sustainable Development strategy to allocate the European <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Fund</b> for Rural Development budget. This decision problem was tackled by applying a Multiple Criteria Spatial Decision Support System that integrates a Geographic Information System with the Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding methods “Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution” and “Dominance-based Rough Set Approach”. In order to demonstrate the validity of this methodological approach, this Multiple Criteria Spatial Decision Support System was applied to a study area of thirteen rural municipalities located in Apulia Region (Southern Italy); these municipalities belong to the same landscape unit, but they are managed by five different policy makers that represent the Local Action Groups. The results provided the maps of environmental, economic and social sustainability rankings of rural municipalities as well as their overall sustainability value. Based on these rankings, a specific Rural Sustainable Development strategy was identified for the allocation of the European <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Fund</b> for Rural Development.
