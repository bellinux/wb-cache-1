500|$|The {{controversy}} {{resulted in}} {{pressure on the}} new Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone, who agreed to review the cases of twenty-four stateless people in immigration detention, and ultimately granted bridging visas to nine people including Al-Kateb, allowing them to be released into the community. However, {{the conditions of the}} bridging visas did not permit holders to work, study, obtain social security benefits or receive healthcare from Medicare, and Al-Kateb remained entirely dependent on donations from friends and supporters to survive. Al-Kateb said of his situation, [...] "We [...] just walking in a big detention. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> the time worried that they will send us back to detention again… It's like a death punishment." [...] He was granted a permanent visa in October 2007 by immigration minister Kevin Andrews.|$|E

2500|$|When the American team {{returned}} from London, President Theodore Roosevelt hosted them at his Sagamore Hill home on Long Island, and singled out Murphy for special recognition.

He is an American institution; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> glad to meet Mike." [...] Upon their return, the American team also presented Murphy with a silver loving cup in gratitude for his efforts.|$|E
2500|$|Soon before Hersey's death, then Acting President of Yale Howard Lamar {{decided the}} {{university}} should honor its longserving alumnus. The {{result was the}} annual John Hersey Lecture, {{the first of which}} was delivered March 22, 1993, by historian and Yale graduate David McCullough, who noted Hersey's contributions to Yale but reserved his strongest praise for the former magazine writer's prose. Hersey had [...] "portrayed our time", McCullough observed, [...] "with a breadth and artistry matched by very few.

The village green offers a place to be natural, a place of solitude, while the [...] "city" [...] offers only artifice, haste, {{competition}} and {{the dangers of the}} Cold War. The animal farm, Ray Davies said, [...] "was just me thinking everybody else is mad <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> animals anyway – which is really the idea of the whole album." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Locke {{followed}} by taking issue with Plato's theory of innate learning processes. In place of this theory, he {{introduced a new}} theory of learning based on the term [...] "tabula rasa," [...] which means [...] "blank slate." [...] Locke explained that learning took place primarily through experience, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> born without knowledge. This doctrine is known as [...] "empiricism," [...] the view that knowledge is primarily [...] built on learning and experience.|$|R
500|$|The {{eruption}} {{was heard}} {{hundreds of miles}} away, but {{some of those who}} survived the eruption declared that the landslide and pyroclastic flows were silent as they raced down the mountain. Krau Kilpatrick, an employee of the United States Forest Service, recalled, [...] "There was no sound to it, not a sound. It was like a silent movie <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> in it." [...] The reason for this discrepancy is a [...] "quiet zone", created {{as a result of the}} motion and temperature of air and, to a lesser extent, upon local topography.|$|R
2500|$|After {{returning}} to the U.S. in 1847, Douglass started publishing his first abolitionist newspaper, the North Star, from {{the basement of the}} Memorial AME Zion Church in Rochester, New York. The North Stars motto was [...] "Right is of no Sex – Truth is of no Color – God is the Father of us all, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> brethren." [...] The AME Church and North Star vigorously opposed the mostly white American Colonization Society and its proposal to send blacks back to Africa. This and Douglass's later abolitionist newspapers were mainly funded by English supporters, who gave Douglass five hundred pounds to use as he chose. Douglass also soon split with Garrison, perhaps because the North Star competed with Garrison's National Anti-Slavery Standard and Marius Robinson's Anti-Slavery Bugle.|$|E

The film marks Spencer's first time working in the science fiction genre. Spencer described Bong as [...] "an auteur" [...] and expressed sadness at the studio's proposal to cut the film. On imagery from the history base of references, Bong said, [...] "When 's character is being beaten by the soldier, it's meant to remind people, somewhat, of the Rodney King incident." [...] On the message of the film, Spencer said, [...] "We are all covered in smoke and dirt from years and years of not washing and particles in the air, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> the same color if you look at it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Space {{educator}} Bill Nye {{added his}} support for the planned mission saying, “We don't want to stop what we're doing on Mars because we're closer than ever to answering these questions: Was there life on Mars and stranger still, is there life there now in some extraordinary place that we haven't yet looked at? Mars was once very wet—it had oceans and lakes. Did life start on Mars and get flung into space <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> descendants of Martian microbes? It's not crazy, and it's worth finding out. It's worth the cost of a cup of coffee per taxpayer every 10 years or 13 years to find out.” [...] Nye also endorsed a Mars sample-return role, saying “The amount of information you can get from a sample returned from Mars is believed to be extraordinarily fantastic and world-changing and worthy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1920 {{interview}} with historian James Cowan, Te Kahu-Pukoro, a fighter {{who took part}} in the attack, explained: [...] "The Pai-marire religion <b>was</b> then new, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> completely under its influence and firmly believed in the teaching of Te Ua and his apostles. Hepanaia Kapewhiti was at the head of the war-party. He was our prophet.
