In addition, erosion of the bone around the implant was seen on x-rays. Initially, surgeons believed this was caused by an <b>abnormal</b> <b>reaction</b> to the cement holding the implant in place.

In the early 1980s, surgeons in the United States applied a coating of small beads to the Austin Moore device and implanted it without cement. The beads were constructed so that gaps between beads matched the size of the pores in native bone. Over time, bone cells from the patient would grow into these spaces and fix the stem in position. The stem was modified slightly to fit more tightly into the femoral canal, resulting in the Anatomic Medullary Locking (AML) stem design.

Though classically described in hypocalcemia, this sign may also be encountered in respiratory alkalosis, such as that seen in hyperventilation, which causes decreased serum Ca2+ with a normal calcium level due to a shift of Ca2+ from the blood to albumin which has become more negative in the alkalotic state.|$|E

40|$|Intracranial {{hemorrhage}} (IH) is a {{major problem}} of neonatal intensive care. The incidence of IH is typically asymptomatic and cannot be effectively detected by standard diagnostic methods. The mechanisms underlying IH are unknown but there is evidence that stress-induced disorders in adrenergic regulation of cerebral venous blood flow (CVBF) are among the main reasons. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of CVBF could significantly advance {{understanding of the nature of}} IH in newborns. In this work, we analyze variations of CVBF in newborn rats with an experimental model of stress-induced IH and adrenaline injection. Our analysis is based on the Doppler optical coherence tomography (DOCT) and a proposed adaptive wavelet-based approach that provides sensitive markers of <b>abnormal</b> <b>reactions</b> of the sagittal vein to external factors. The obtained results demonstrate that the incidence of IH in newborn rats is accompanied by a suppression of CVBF with the development of venous insufficiency and areactivity to adrenaline. We introduce a numerical measure θ, quantifying reactions of CVBF and show that the values θ < 1. 23 estimated in the low-frequency (LF) spectral range corresponding to the sympathicus indicate <b>abnormal</b> <b>reactions</b> associated with the development of IH.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} surgical sympathectomy on pain-related behaviours in a well established model of peripheral mononeuropathy produced by loose ligatures around the common sciatic nerve in the rat. Behavioural abnormalities include spontaneous abnormal position of the hindpaw after the nerve constriction, indicative of "spontaneous pain", and changes in responses to mechanical or thermal stimuli applied to this paw. These changes are usually maximal at week 2 after the surgery, stable until weeks 3 - 4, and disappear between weeks 8 and 12. To assess {{the role of the}} sympathetic nervous system in the development and persistence of these abnormalities, four groups of rats were behaviourally tested: (i) rats receiving a complete sham surgery, (ii) rats with a sciatic nerve constriction produced by loose ligatures around the common nerve trunk plus a sham sympathectomy, (iii) rats receiving a lumbar sympathectomy with a sham nerve ligature, and (iv) rats receiving a simultaneous surgical lumbar sympathectomy and a sciatic nerve constriction. The efficacy of the sympathectomy was assessed by the measure of the noradrenaline level in the sciatic nerve. Sympathectomy reduced selectively or even prevented the <b>abnormal</b> <b>reaction</b> to cold temperature and to heat (45 degrees C) in rats with a peripheral mononeuropathy. In contrast, the <b>abnormal</b> <b>reaction</b> to mechanical pressure was not influenced, and the behavioural abnormalities indicating spontaneous pain were still present. Sympathectomy alone resulted in a reduction of the vocalization threshold to pressure on both hindpaws, but also a short-lasting increased tolerance to cold immersion. This study confirms the selective role of the sympathetic nervous system in affecting the development and maintenance of some abnormal pain-related behaviours to thermal stimuli in rats with a moderate, but persistent, constriction of one sciatic nerve...|$|E
