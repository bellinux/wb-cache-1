Although many blind source separation schemes have been proposed to address this problem, few of them are tested by using <b>a</b> real room <b>audio</b> <b>video</b> recording. In this paper, we propose <b>an</b> <b>audio</b> <b>video</b> based independent vector analysis (AVIVA) method, and test it with other independent vector analysis methods by using a real room recording dataset, i. e. the AV 16. 3 corpus. Moreover, we also use a new method based on pitch difference detection for objective evaluation of the separation performance of the algorithms when applied on the real dataset which confirms advantages of using the visual modality with IVA. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
