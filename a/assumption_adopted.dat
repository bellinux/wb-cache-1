The emphasis that Saint Bernardine of Siena (1380-1444) laid on the name of Jesus in his preaching led in 1721 to the institution of a separate Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus. Pope John XXIII's 1960 rubrical and calendrical revision called 1 January simply the Octave of the Nativity. (This 1960 calendar was incorporated into the 1962 Roman Missal, whose continued use is authorized by the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum.) The 1969 revision states: [...] "1 January, the Octave Day of the Nativity of the Lord, is the Solemnity of Mary, the Holy Mother of God, and also the commemoration of the conferral of the Most Holy Name of Jesus." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With {{the growing}} {{interest}} in modular ontology languages to address the need for collaborative development, integration, and use of ontologies on the Web, there is an urgent need for a common framework for comparing modular ontology language proposals {{on the basis of}} criteria such as their semantic soundness and expressive power. We introduce an Abstract Modular Ontology (AMO) language and offer precise definitions of semantic soundness such as localized semantics and exact reasoning, and expressivity requirements for modular ontology languages. We compare Distributed Description Logics (DDL), E-connections, and Package-Based Description Logics (P-DL) with respect to these criteria. Our analysis suggests that by relaxing the strong domain disjointedness <b>assumption</b> <b>adopted</b> in DDL and E-connection, as P-DL demonstrated, it is possible to overcome some known semantic difficulties and expressivity limitations of DDL and E-Connections. ...|$|E
40|$|Modular {{ontology}} languages, such as Distributed Description Logics (DDL), E-connections and Package-based Description Logics (P-DL) offer {{two broad}} classes of approaches to connect multiple ontology modules: {{the use of}} mappings or linkings between ontology modules e. g., DDL and E-connections; {{and the use of}} importing e. g., P-DL. The major difference between the two approaches is on the usage of 2 ̆ 2 foreign terms 2 ̆ 2 at the syntactic level, and on the local model disjointness at the semantic level. We compare the semantics of linking in DDL and E-connections, and importing in P-DL within the Distributed First Order Logics (DFOL) framework. Our investigation shows that the domain disjointness <b>assumption</b> <b>adopted</b> by the linking approach leads to several semantic di�culties.

40|$|Unsteady {{laminar flow}} and heat {{transfer}} {{in a sharp}} 180 bend is studied numerically to investigate a convective heat transfer regime of especial relevance to electronic systems. Due to the high geometrical aspect ratios occurring in the practical application, two-dimensional unsteady simulations are considered. The two-dimensionality <b>assumption</b> <b>adopted</b> is validated by three-dimen-sional test simulations. Unsteady heat transfer simulations are performed for 506 Re 6 1000. Results show that the flow remains steady until Re 600. In this steady regime, the re-attachment length increases gradually with the Reynolds number. For Re> 600, the flow becomes unsteady with large-scale vortices emanating from the sharp edge dominating the flow field. Flow oscillation causes a substantial reduction in the re-attachment length and a dramatic heat transfer enhancement. As the vortices move downstream, the Nusselt number along the wall oscillates significantly. The correlation between the flow structure and the heat transfer {{is found to be}} strong...|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{dependence}} {{is often}} seen as a problem in econometrics rather than economics. This study seeks to find an economic explanation for spatially correlated real estate prices. We posit spatial dependence as a process to discover price information from nearby property transactions. Weaker spatial dependence is expected when price information {{in the immediate vicinity}} is abundant. In the context of apartment buildings, in addition to the more commonly known horizontal dependence, there is also spatial dependence in the vertical dimension within the same building. Based on more than 18, 000 transactions of highly homogeneous apartment units in Hong Kong, we find that liquidity (trading volume) of a building depresses horizontal spatial dependence but raises vertical spatial dependence. This does not only confirm the role of liquidity in the real estate price discovery process, but also questions the validity of constant spatial auto-correlation <b>assumption</b> <b>adopted</b> in many studies. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{discussed}} {{in this study are}} related with the determination of the critical value of stress which, when exceeded, will cause the decohesion of cast iron matrix in accordance with the Ludwik – Scheu criterion and yield condition.

The study proves that from the run of function σef = f(σnom) and using one of the above mentioned criteria one can judge about the mode of fracture and about the value of the stress intensity factor KI of the matrix.

40|$|ABSTRACT (218 WORDS) Statistical {{relationships}} between traffic crash and traffic flows at roadway intersections have been extensively modeled and evaluated in recent years. This paper challenges the underlying <b>assumptions</b> <b>adopted</b> {{in the popular}} models for intersections. First, we challenge {{the assumption that the}} dispersion parameter is a fixed parameter across sites and time periods. Second, we examine mathematical limitations of some functional forms used in these models, particularly their properties at the boundaries. We also demonstrate that, for a given data set, a large number of plausible functional forms with almost the same overall statistical goodness-of-fit (GOF) are possible, and introduce an alternative class of logical formulations that may enable a richer interpretation of the data. A comparison of site estimates from the empirical Bayes and full-Bayes methods is also presented. All discussion and comparison are illustrated with an urban 4 -legged signalized intersection data set collected in Toronto, Canada, for years 1990 to 1995. In discussing functional forms, we emphasize and demonstrate the need for some “goodness-of-logic ” (GOL) measures in addition to the GOF measure. Finally, we advise analysts to be mindful of the underlying <b>assumptions</b> <b>adopted</b> in the popular models, especially the assumption that dispersion parameter is a fixed parameter and limitations of the functional forms used.
