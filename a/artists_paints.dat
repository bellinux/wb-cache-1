50|$|As noted above, the {{industrial}} process for making ochre pigment {{was developed by}} the French scientist Jean-Étienne Astier in the 1780s, using the ochre mines Roussillon in the Vaucluse department of Provence, in France. Thanks to the process invented by Astier and refined by his successors, ochre pigments from Roussillon were exported across Europe and around the world. It was not only used for <b>artists</b> <b>paints</b> and house paints; it also became an important ingredient for the early rubber industry.|$|E
5000|$|Tomb KV17, {{located in}} Egypt's Valley of the Kings and also {{known by the}} names [...] "Belzoni's tomb", [...] "the Tomb of Apis", and [...] "the Tomb of Psammis, son of Nechois", is the tomb of Pharaoh Seti I of the Nineteenth Dynasty. It {{is one of the}} best {{decorated}} tombs in the valley, but now is almost always closed to the public due to damage. It was first discovered by Giovanni Battista Belzoni on 16 October 1817. When he first entered the tomb he found the wall paintings in excellent condition with the paint on the walls still looking fresh and some of the <b>artists</b> <b>paints</b> and brushes still on the floor.|$|E

The resin for the Golden paint was a pn(BA/MMA copolymer while the resin for the Talens paint was a p(EA/MMA copolymer with detectable amounts of a chalk (CaCO 3) extender.|$|E
40|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 1950, photographers Rudy Burckhardt and Hans Namuth {{documented}} Jackson Pollock in his studio as he was creating what have become his iconic Abstract Expressionist paintings. The photographs quickly dominated the critical discourse of the new painting and initiated a crisis in the historiography of Abstract Expressionism. This paper argues that despite being produced to serve an illustrative role for the Art News series ‘An <b>Artists</b> <b>Paints</b> a Picture’, Burckhardt and Namuth’s photographs of Pollock provide a glimpse of the analytic complexity photography offered art criticism...|$|E
30|$|Interestingly, {{our data}} {{has shown that}} the use of white {{pigments}} in the Netherlands is clearly different from the general assumption of the international use which seems to have a geographical bias toward the United States. It has been demonstrated that, instead of an immediate popularization of titanium white, the pigment entered the market rather slowly and initially predominantly in non-oil binders. The rather late rise of titanium white pigments in the Netherlands, starting from the fifties and stabilizing a secure position in the seventies, reduces the risk of photocatalytic binder degradation for Dutch modern art collections. At the time, improved pigments were on the market, thus increasing the odds that they were used in <b>artists</b> <b>paints.</b> Nevertheless, anatase was used by some Dutch manufacturers until the nineties and surface treatments were not always applied and still under development. Therefore, surveying and monitoring modern art collection for the use of potentially photocatalytically active pigments remains of high importance.|$|E

40|$|Copper {{phthalocyanine}} (CuPc) blue, commonly named phthalo blue is {{the most}} important synthetic organic blue pigment in the 20 th and 21 st century <b>artists</b> <b>paints.</b> Phthalo blue, which is adopted by artists since 1936, is a polymorphous pigment. Currently, the alpha, beta and epsilon CuPc polymorphs are used in artists paint formulations. The identification of the CuPc crystal form provides technical and chronological information relevant for studying artworks. Raman Spectroscopy (RS) is a very valuable technique for the detection of phthalo blue in paint layers. However, the spectral interpretation is not straightforward concerning the CuPc polymorph distinction. To overcome the problem we have previously developed a procedure combining RS and chemometrical analysis. The experimental results that we obtained have demonstrated its efficiency for predicting the CuPc crystal form in unknown paint samples. In the present work, this procedure was applied on oil-based and acrylic paints from Sam Francis’ studio and the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) Reference Collection. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{potential}} of confocal microfluorescence spectroscopy is explored for the characterization of selected red lake pigments and paints based on alizarin, purpurin and eosin (weak, medium and strong emitters). The anthraquinone pigments have been used since ancient times by artists, and eosin lakes were used by impressionist painters. Reconstructions of <b>artists</b> <b>paints</b> based on 19 th century recipes are examined. The paints were made using the lake pigments bound {{in a range of}} binding media including gum arabic, collagen, a vinyl emulsion and linseed oil. The acquisition of the spectra is rapid, with high spatial resolution and the data reliable and reproducible. Together with full emission spectra, it was possible to acquire well-resolved excitation spectra for purpurin, alizarin and eosin based colors. The present investigation suggests that micro-emission fluorescence can also be used as a semi-quantitative method for madder lake pigments, enabling the determination of purpurin lake ratio in a mixture of purpurin and alizarin, which is important for provenance studies. The data obtained with microfluorescence emission with those acquired with fiber-optic fluorimetry are compared. The spatial resolution used, 8  [mu]m, is appropriate for the analysis of individual pigments particles or aggregates in a paint film. Micro-emission molecular fluorescence proved to be a promising analytical tool to identify the presence of selected red lake pigments combined with a range of binding media. [URL]...|$|E
