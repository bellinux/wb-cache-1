5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks <b>and</b> <b>turns,</b> and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure.

Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E
