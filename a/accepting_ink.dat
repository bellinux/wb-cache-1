40|$|Several {{studies and}} {{investigations}} {{have been conducted}} to test the new Toray plate. The studies revealed that the new plate eliminated {{many of the problems}} that used to hinder the progress and development of the driographic plate system. The two major problems with this plate were short run lengths and toning in the non-image areas. This study investigates toning problems in negative working Toray plates. Toning is a term that refers to the non-image areas of the driographic plate that are <b>accepting</b> <b>ink.</b> Previous studies have shown that ink tack and flow do not affect toning in any way. However, printing speed, nip pressure, printing density and ink temperature were found to have some effect on toning. To investigate the effect that different percentages of oil in the ink has on toning in the non-image areas of Toray negative working plates, this study uses five ink samples, each containing a different percentage of oil, and measures with a densitometer the density of toning in the non-image areas. The hypothesis tested in this study states that the amount of toning in the non-image areas of negative Toray plates increases as the amount of oil contained in the ink increases. Upon analyzing the data collected, it was found that when using the special driographic ink no scumming occured. However, the hypothesis proved to stand true because it was found that a strong positive relationship exists between the amount of oil contained in the driographic ink and the amount of toning in the non-image areas of negative Toray plates...|$|E

Some programs that <b>accept</b> <b>ink</b> input from the mouse may not be responsive enough for handwriting input on a tablet. Existing solutions on the PC include PDF Annotator and Qiqqa.|$|R
5000|$|Xerox {{printers}} {{are shipped}} with neutral [...] "factory" [...] ink sticks with no region coding. Upon {{the installation of}} the first new ink stick after these factory sticks, the machine will set a region code based on the installed ink stick and will only <b>accept</b> <b>ink</b> sticks for that region from that point forward. [...] "Officially, [...] " [...] only three starter ink sticks per color can be used; then, the printer will no longer accept them and will want region-coded ink sticks to be inserted, but there are workarounds for that problem.|$|R

5000|$|Laser or printer {{labels are}} {{generally}} die cut on 8.5" [...] x 11" [...] (US letter) or A4 sized sheets, {{and come in}} many different shapes, sizes, formats and materials. Laser label material is a nonporous stock made to withstand the intense heat of laser printers and copiers. A drawback of laser labels is that the entire sheet needs to be printed before any labels are used; once labels have been removed the sheet cannot be put through the printer again without damaging the printing mechanism. Inkjet label material is a porous stock made to <b>accept</b> <b>ink</b> and dye from an inkjet printer. One of the more modern inkjet label material stocks is waterproof printable inkjet material commonly used for soap or shower gel containers.|$|R
50|$|High-quality inkjet {{printing}} with dark, crisp lines {{requires that the}} paper have exactly the right absorbency to <b>accept</b> the <b>ink</b> but prevent sideways spread. Many general-purpose office papers of weights around 21 to 27 lb (80-100 g/m²) have been reformulated to work equally well with both inkjet and laser printers. However, this category of paper is only suitable for printing text, because the ink load is light.|$|R
50|$|Eaton's Corrasable Bond is a trademarked {{name for}} a brand of {{erasable}} typing paper. Erasable paper has a glazed or coated surface which is almost invisible, is easily removed by friction, and <b>accepts</b> typewriter <b>ink</b> fairly well. Removing the coating removes the ink on top of it, so mistakes can be easily erased once. After erasure, the correction is typed onto an unprotected paper surface and cannot be easily erased a second time.|$|R
5000|$|Trap is {{a measure}} of the ability of a wet ink film printed on the paper to <b>accept</b> the next <b>ink</b> printed on top of it. Preucil’s formula is used to measure trap.% Trap = {(Density of {{overprint}} - Density of 1st ink)/Density of 2nd ink} x 100 ...|$|R
5000|$|A second {{method of}} {{creating}} imagery on the vitreograph plate is waterless lithography (sometimes called “siligraphy”). The process was originally developed by 3M Company for commercial printing {{in the late}} 1960s; it was purchased and subsequently refined by Toray Industries of Japan. The commercial process {{is a type of}} offset printing that uses photo-sensitized silicone rubber plates. The waterless lithography process employed in fine art printmaking has been credited to Nik Semenoff, who developed it for use on metal plates.Donald Furst demonstrated his adaptation of the silicone method to glass plate printmaking in June, 1995, and the Littleton Studios adopted his process for their work with glass plate lithography. The image is drawn onto a ground glass matrix with water-soluble art materials, over which is applied a film of common caulking silicone thinned with synthetic turpentine. Master printer Mark Mahaffey has found that frosted Mylar {{can be used as a}} printing matrix as well as 3/8” float glass to create a vitreograph using waterless lithography. [...] After the silicone layer cures, the original drawing is gently washed from the plate with water, dried, and inked with a roller. The silicone layer protects the non-printing areas of the image while allowing open areas (those free of silicone) to <b>accept</b> <b>ink.</b> Like intaglio vitreographs, waterless lithographs on glass plates are transferred to paper in an etching press.|$|R
50|$|Washi (wa = Japanese and shi = paper · washi = Japanese paper) is {{traditionally}} a fine handmade thin paper coveted by artists and craftspeople. Washi {{is made with}} renewable long-fibered crops and is very strong even when thin. Some washi does not hold a sharp fold due to the extremely long and thick fibers of the paper. Occasionally you will find strands of the long fibers (often kozo) in washi. Washi is also <b>accepting</b> of <b>ink,</b> {{making it easy to}} print on as it holds very fine detail. Printed washi has a unique and occasionally transparent texture. In origami it is not as commonly used as kami paper.|$|R
50|$|Dye-sublimation {{printers}} {{have some}} drawbacks compared to inkjet printers. Each of the colored panels of the ribbons, and the thermal head itself, must match {{the size of}} the media that is being printed on. Furthermore, only specially coated paper or specific plastics can <b>accept</b> the sublimated <b>ink.</b> This means that dye-sublimation printers cannot match the flexibility of inkjet printers in printing {{on a wide range of}} media.|$|R
25|$|Staples <b>accepts</b> {{all used}} <b>ink</b> and toner {{cartridges}} for recycling. Prior to 2008, the only cartridges {{that could be}} recycled were HP, Kodak, and Dell, and customers were given a three dollar coupon for the store, with a maximum number of coupons that could be given, or redeemed, at any time being 25. Starting in 2008 and continuing to the present, one's ink recycling goes on the customer's Staples Rewards.|$|R
5000|$|Trap on a {{press is}} the ability of a printed <b>ink</b> to <b>accept</b> the next printed ink {{compared}} to how well paper <b>accepts</b> that <b>ink.</b> Registration is when all printed images are lined up over one another.Trapping is a term originally used as a measure of how well one ink printed on top of another. With the advent of Pre-press Software the term was misused to describe the compensation for misregistration between printing units on a multicolor press that was traditionally known as [...] "Chokes and Spreads". This misregistration causes unsightly gaps or white-space on the final printed work. Trapping involves creating overlaps (spreads) or underlaps (chokes) of objects during the print production process to eliminate misregistration on the press.|$|R
5000|$|All Sheaffer pens after 1959 (excluding the PFM) were {{designed}} to <b>accept</b> either <b>ink</b> cartridges or a converter to allow the use of bottled ink. The Targa was a popular high-end model which was introduced in 1976 and came in over 80 different finishes and two sizes (classic and slim). The still very popular Connoisseur was introduced in 1986 as an upgraded version of the low cost No-Nonsense line that paid homage to earlier Sheaffer flat-tops, and included the high end Grande series, and three series of Levenger Connoisseur's that were dual branded and sold by Levenger. Another popular Sheaffer fountain pen was the low-cost [...] "School Pen". Current high-end pens in the range include the Valor and the Legacy series, all of which retain the inlaid nib.|$|R
2500|$|Lithography {{works because}} of the mutual {{repulsion}} of oil and water. The image is drawn {{on the surface of}} the print plate with a fat or oil-based medium (hydrophobic) such as a wax crayon, which may be pigmented to make the drawing visible. A wide range of oil-based media is available, but the durability of the image on the stone depends on the lipid content of the material being used, and its ability to withstand water and acid. After the drawing of the image, an aqueous solution of gum arabic, weakly acidified with nitric acid [...] is applied to the stone. The function of this solution is to create a hydrophilic layer of calcium nitrate salt, , and gum arabic on all non-image surfaces. The gum solution penetrates into the pores of the stone, completely surrounding the original image with a hydrophilic layer that will not <b>accept</b> the printing <b>ink.</b> Using lithographic turpentine, the printer then removes any excess of the greasy drawing material, but a hydrophobic molecular film of it remains tightly bonded to the surface of the stone, rejecting the gum arabic and water, but ready to <b>accept</b> the oily <b>ink.</b>|$|R
50|$|Perhaps the easiest, most {{trouble-free}} {{method of}} refilling ink cartridges {{is through the}} use of a CISS (Continuous Ink Supply System). A CISS consists of a set of cartridges that have tubes connected to them, through which the ink continuously flows from ink reservoirs on the outside of the printer. Instead of refilling the cartridges themselves, the user simply refills the bottles on the outside of the printer. Early CIS systems were composed of OEM cartridges that had been drilled and outfitted with fittings to <b>accept</b> the <b>ink</b> delivery tubes, a set of 'ribbon' tubes, and plastic bottles with holes drilled in the caps for the tubes and the vents. Today's CIS systems are mass-produced in China, often incorporating all ink bottles into one partitioned container. They typically utilize auto-reset chips, which means the cartridges rarely have to be removed from the printer.|$|R
5000|$|Wakefield (1973, p. 37) more {{specifically}} adds, that [...] "by {{the end of}} the 1830s it was in common use, being employed in some very attractive books like John Britton's Drawings of the London and Birmingham Railway, 1839, with illustrations by John Cooke Bourne. It depends for its effect upon the antipathy between grease and water: a greasy image on a surface of smooth limestone is first moistened and then inked; the image repels the water but <b>accepts</b> the <b>ink,</b> while the stone accepts the water and consequently repels the ink. The image can then be printed on paper by passing stone and paper through a scraper press, which gives a picture in black on a white background. By 1837 it was becoming common practice to add the impression of another stone, printed in a straw colour to give a tinted background, and this produced what are known as tinted lithographs. In England they were developed by C.J. Hullmandel, who was the most important lithographer working in England in the earlier part of the century." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} The Emperor's Riddles was {{born out of}} a random Internet search by Nayak after reading the Dan Brown thriller Angels & Demons to find out if there was {{something}} similarly esoteric and mysterious hidden in the history of India. The surfing yielded an obscure but fascinating conspiracy theory involving one of the greatest Emperors of ancient India. Nayak was intrigued by the Emperor's legend and the imperial secret believed to be still alive and functioning and decided to capture this story. The first draft took about six months and was ready in 2011. The manuscript was <b>accepted</b> by Red <b>Ink</b> Literary Agency and subsequently underwent another round of editing. Nayak received publishing offers from Rupa & Co. and Amaryllis and he eventually signed the deal with Amaryllis in 2012. The book was first released at the New Delhi World Book Fair in February 2014.|$|R
