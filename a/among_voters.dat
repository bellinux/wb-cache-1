5|$|Minton did {{not realize}} that Frank was also {{president}} of the University of Wisconsin, and soon suffered retaliation for the way he had treated Frank. Frank went on NBC radio stations around the country and lambasted Minton for his rudeness. He made lengthy arguments accusing Minton of attempting to violate the Bill of Rights. Minton was outraged, but the arguments had an effect <b>among</b> <b>voters</b> in Indiana. In 1938, he sought funding to launch a massive nationwide investigation of media conglomerates for proof of Republican interference in the press. Democratic Senator Edward R. Burke led an effort to defeat the measure and privately accused Minton of damaging the Democrats' cause, which led Minton to leave the Lobby Investigation Committee.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern <b>among</b> <b>voters.</b> He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996, Bill Clinton {{obtained}} a vote share of 54% <b>among</b> women <b>voters,</b> and 43% <b>among</b> men <b>voters.</b> His overall lead over Bob Dole {{was just over}} 8 million votes, but his lead <b>among</b> women <b>voters</b> was 11 million.|$|R
50|$|CNN Exit polling {{showed that}} Bush barely won the state. <b>Among</b> male <b>voters,</b> he won with 52%. <b>Among</b> female <b>voters,</b> it was tied 50-50. Also, 53% {{of the voters}} {{approved}} of Bush's job as president.|$|R
25|$|A 2017 {{study found}} that the opening and closing hours of polling places determines the age {{demographics}} of turnout: turnout <b>among</b> younger <b>voters</b> is higher the longer polling places are open and turnout <b>among</b> older <b>voters</b> decreases the later polling places open.|$|R
5|$|As Liberal leader, Thorpe {{provided}} a clear {{contrast with the}} pedestrian images of Wilson and Edward Heath, the Conservative leader since March 1965. He was considerably younger, and much more telegenic. His first years of leadership were problematic; he found himself {{at odds with the}} Young Liberals, who were advocating policies far {{to the left of the}} Liberal mainstream. Their demands for workers' control in nationalised industries, British withdrawal from NATO, and massive cuts in the defence budget, caused bitter disputes within the party and damaged its public image. At this time the political climate was not conducive to radical policies; the Wilson government's rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to the right <b>among</b> <b>voters.</b> The beneficiaries were the Conservatives, who made spectacular by-election gains at Labour's expense while the Liberals failed to make any real impact. Discontent against Thorpe's leadership was being voiced within a year of his election, culminating in June 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with Young Liberals in an attempt to depose him. Thorpe had just married Caroline Allpass, and was abroad on honeymoon when the plotters struck. The timing of their attempted coup, widely seen in and out of the party as treachery, ensured that on Thorpe's return the party executive backed him by 48 votes to 2.|$|E
5|$|Post {{election}} {{polls showed}} that Humphrey lost the white vote with 38%, nine points behind Nixon, but won the nonwhite vote solidly, 85% to 12%, including 97% of African-Americans. African-Americans favored Humphrey {{because of his}} record on civil rights, and their desire to quickly end the war in Vietnam, where blacks were overrepresented. The racial divide in the election had widened since 1964, and was attributed to civil rights protests and race riots. Humphrey won 45% of the female vote, two points ahead of Nixon, but lost to the Republican among males, 41% to 43%. Voters with only a grade school education supported Humphrey 52% to 33% over Nixon, while Nixon won among both those with no higher education than high school (43% to 42%) and those who graduated from college (54% to 37%). Occupation demographics mirrored these numbers with manual-labor workers supporting Humphrey 50% to 37%, and with white-collar (47% to 41%) and professionals (56% to 34%) favoring Nixon. Humphrey won among young voters (under 30 years old) by 47% to 38%, and also edged Nixon among those between 30 and 49 years, with 44% to 41%. Nixon won <b>among</b> <b>voters</b> over 50 years, 47% to 41%. Catholics backed Humphrey with 59%, twelve points ahead of Nixon, but Protestants favored Nixon, 49% to 35%. Humphrey lost the Independent vote 31% to 44%, with 25% going to Wallace, and won a lower percentage among Democrats (74%) than Nixon won among Republicans (86%). This discrepancy {{was connected to the}} tough Democratic primary election that caused some former McCarthy, Kennedy or McGovern supporters to vote for Nixon or Wallace as a protest.|$|E
25|$|Women {{obtained}} {{the legal right}} to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections in 1949. Women's share <b>among</b> <b>voters</b> increased steadily after 1949, reaching the same levels of participation as men in 1970.|$|E
50|$|In late October, one {{poll found}} that Gore was leading Bush and third parties by 44-42-4 <b>among</b> {{registered}} <b>voters</b> and 46-42-4 <b>among</b> likely <b>voters,</b> but that poll had {{a margin of error}} of four percentage points, making the race too close to call.|$|R

25|$|Bentsen {{considered}} {{running for}} president in the 1992 presidential election, but he, {{along with many other}} Democrats, backed out because of Bush's apparent popularity following the 1991 Gulf War. A poor economy in 1991-92 eroded Bush's standing <b>among</b> <b>voters</b> and he ended up losing the election to Bill Clinton.|$|E
25|$|However, outside Carinthia, Haider's {{charisma}} {{seemed to}} have largely lost its appeal <b>among</b> <b>voters.</b> The FPÖ incurred devastating losses in several regional elections, the 2004 European elections and in elections for the Austrian Chamber of Commerce. In each of those elections, it lost between one half to two thirds of their previous voters.|$|E

50|$|On November 20, {{an online}} NBC News {{poll showed that}} Sanders' {{national}} support continued to grow. A poll that surveyed 5,755 adults nationwide showed Sanders was the preferred candidate of 33% of Democratic and independent voters, still trailing Clinton by 16 points. Sanders continued to show a strong lead <b>among</b> young <b>voters</b> and trailed Clinton by only three points <b>among</b> white <b>voters.</b>|$|R

25|$|According to his {{campaign}} website, Gilmore's main issues that he would address if elected President include preserving the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms, immigration and border re-enforcement, healthcare reform, and restoring America's economy. Gilmore struggled to gain any traction in the 2016 presidential race, and has been little known <b>among</b> <b>voters,</b> being excluded {{from most of the}} debates.|$|E
25|$|Carper's independent, New Democrat {{approach}} {{made him}} popular <b>among</b> <b>voters,</b> but caused grumbling among old line Democrats, particularly union leaders, who complained that {{not enough of}} them were being awarded patronage jobs after the many years of Republican control. In an era of increasingly bitter, partisan politics, Carper's actions and policies placed him at the political center, in keeping with Delaware's consensus style of governing.|$|E
25|$|The Bokros {{package and}} efforts at privatizations were unpopular with voters, as were rising crime rates, {{allegations}} of government corruption, and {{an attempt to}} restart the unpopular program of building a dam on the Danube. This dissatisfaction <b>among</b> <b>voters</b> helped to propel center-right parties into power following national elections in May 1998. Fidesz gained the plurality of parliamentary seats and forged a coalition with the Smallholders and the Democratic Forum.|$|E

Miller earned 40.7% of first round voters, while 10.6% (1,031) of first round voters (largely backers of Republican candidate Kevin Curley) offered no preference between Miller and Kiss.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the first}} time since 1966 that an {{incumbent}} Tennessee congressman had lost a primary. It was also the first time since 1950 that an incumbent congressman lost a primary in Tennessee's 1st congressional district. Davis said he thinks Democratic voters, knowing they had no realistic chance of defeating him in November, contributed to his Republican 1st District primary loss, and he believes he was the winner <b>among</b> <b>voters</b> who identify as Republicans. Tennessee has an open primary system.|$|E

2500|$|The lone {{presidential debate}} was an {{important}} event in the 1980 presidential campaign. [...] This debate was held on October 28, which was {{a week before the}} election.

However, Carter was not eager to participate with any debate. He had repeatedly refused to a debate with Senator Edward M. Kennedy during the primary season, and had given ambivalent signals as to his participation in the fall.|$|R
25|$|According to an Opinium poll in December 2014 on {{the views}} of 17- to 22-year-olds, Farage was the least popular {{political}} leader. Only 3% of young people questioned said that they intended to vote for UKIP, compared with 19% <b>among</b> <b>voters</b> of all ages. The 17% who said they would vote outside the three main parties were {{four times more likely}} to vote for the Green Party than for UKIP. Conversely, a March 2015 Ipsos Mori poll found among 18- to 34-year-olds UKIP was polling nearly as well as the Green Party, somewhat contradicting the idea that Farage lacked appeal for younger voters.|$|E
25|$|The ADQ MNAs and {{supporters}} met in Victoriaville in late September 2007 to detail the party's environmental policy. Former PQ Cabinet Member Jean Garon, former Hydro-Québec CEO André Caillé and environmental activist Steven Guilbeault attended the convention. Tom Pentefountas, a former ADQ {{candidate in the}} district of Nelligan in a 2004 by-election, succeeded Gilles Taillon as President of the party. Pentefountas enjoys little name recognition <b>among</b> <b>voters</b> in general, but {{he is a member of}} the Greek community and lives in Montreal. ADQ supporters hope that his profile might facilitate the party's attempts to connect with these constituencies.|$|E
25|$|After announcing Palin as the {{presumptive}} vice-presidential nominee, the McCain campaign received $7million {{in contributions}} {{in a single}} day, and the Obama campaign garnered more than $8million by the next day. During the campaign, Palin evoked a more strongly divided response than Joe Biden <b>among</b> <b>voters</b> and was viewed both more favorably and unfavorably when compared to her opponent. A plurality of the television audience rated Biden's performance higher at the 2008 vice-presidential debate. Following the presidential election, 69% of Republicans felt Palin had helped John McCain's bid, while 20% felt Palin hurt. In the same poll, 71% of Republicans stated Palin had been the right choice.|$|E
