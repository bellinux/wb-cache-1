5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> (and PAVN air defences) evolved, so did {{the relay}} aircraft. The EC-121Rs and their crews proved too {{vulnerable}} and were partly replaced in 1969 and 1970 by QU-22Bs (modified Beech A-36 Bonanzas) which were to be remotely piloted, and which had undergone primary mission equipment and PME flight tests at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1968. The aircraft suffered from mechanical difficulties, however, and were never flown during an operational mission without a pilot. They were replaced by C-130B models in December 1971.|$|E
5|$|Hyman {{originally}} {{committed to}} play for Princeton during the 2010–11 season. However, he decommitted after Princeton Tigers head coach Guy Gadowsky left the school to start the Division I hockey program at Penn State. Following Gadowsky to Penn State was not an option, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> {{did not have a}} varsity team at the time. In May 2011, Hyman was offered a full athletic scholarship and committed {{to play for}} the University of Michigan for the 2011–12 season.|$|E

Three more B-1A prototypes followed. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> continued the per-unit cost {{continued to rise}} {{in part because of}} high inflation during that period. In 1970, the estimated unit cost was $40 million, and by 1975, this figure had climbed to $70 million.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Army's LHX {{program began}} in the early 1980s, proposing two {{helicopter}} designs with a high percentage of commonality of dynamic components. One was a light utility version ("LHX-U") for assault and tactical movement of troops and supplies, the other was a light scout/attack version ("LHX-SCAT") to complement the growing development of the AH-64 Apache. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> was developed, the light utility version was dropped and focus was placed on the light attack reconnaissance version, which eventually became the RAH-66 Comanche.|$|E

25|$|The behind-the-scenes intrigues of the {{breeding}} program are illuminated in the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999–2001) <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> nears fruition {{in the time}} immediately prior to the novel Dune.

There are three key areas of research; electricity, manufacturing and mobility. The electricity division focuses on reducing electricity consumption and finding alternative sources for production. Buildings, which account for 39% of US electricity consumption as of 2012, are a key area of research <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> aims to create affordable, carbon-neutral homes by 2020. Research also takes place into higher efficiency solar panels, geothermal electricity and heating, lower cost wind generators and the economic and environmental feasibility of potential hydro power plants.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{improvements}} {{were made to}} ENIAC after 1948, including a primitive read-only stored programming mechanism using the Function Tables as program ROM, an idea included in the ENIAC patent and proposed independently by Richard Clippinger of BRL. Clippinger consulted with von Neumann on what instruction set to implement. Clippinger had thought of a 3-address architecture while von Neumann proposed a 1-address architecture because it was simpler to implement. Three digits of one accumulator (6) were used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> counter, another accumulator (15) {{was used as the}} main accumulator, a third accumulator (8) was used as the address pointer for reading data from the function tables, and most of the other accumulators (1–5, 7, 9–14, 17–19) were used for data memory.|$|E
