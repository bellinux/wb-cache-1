5|$|In {{addition}} to taxonomic research, collections can provide information {{relevant to the}} study of variety of other ornithological questions, including comparative anatomy, ecology, behavior, disease, and conservation. Forensic ornithologists use collections to identify species involved in aircraft bird strikes, imported materials containing bird parts, and birds killed through various human activities, legal and illegal. In addition, collections are used by zooarchaeologists to identify bird bones at prehistoric human sites or species of origin for feathers used in human cultural artifacts. Collections also have been heavily used by artists, particularly for the production of plates for ornithological field guides. The close-up observation and opportunity for manipulation provided by preserved study skins makes them, together with field observations and photography, to be an important basis for painters of field guide plates of birds. Most bird species have several unique plumages that distinguish immature from adults, males from females, and breeders from non-breeders. Thus, many different specimens may be required to produce a thorough plate for identification of a given species. <b>Accurate</b> <b>colour</b> measurements using spectrometry are possible from specimens.|$|E

50|$|Toner has {{traditionally}} been made by compounding the ingredients and creating a slab which was broken or pelletized, then turned into a fine powder with a controlled particle size range by air jet milling.

50|$|The {{printing}} {{of both the}} text and the image pages used stochastic lithography {{in order to create}} outstanding quality prints from the original watercolours. Stochastic lithography is an advancement in printing technology that can give a better print quality, cleaner more dynamic and <b>accurate</b> <b>colour</b> images, and reduce running waste. Whereas conventional lithography uses half-tone dots of various sizes and spaces these dots at the same distance from each other, stochastic lithography uses microdots of a common size of various spacing according to tonal value. Stochastic screening uses smaller printing dots to create a higher image detail. Tonal ranges and colour contrasts are also improved because the variation in dot distribution increases ink densities. The images were printed on 245 gsm American Cotton paper for the colour plates and on 175 gsm Somerset Bookwove text paper. The text is set in Fairbank and Bembo book types.|$|E

Compared to the original AMOLED display, the SLCD display has more <b>accurate</b> <b>colour</b> reproduction, far less susceptibility to burn-in, similar peak brightness and very good viewing angles, but a lower contrast ratio. The new SLCD display was claimed to have similar or better power efficiency compared with the original AMOLED display; however, this has proved to not always be the case because with AMOLED pixels' ability to completely turn off, black or dark pixels use very little power. However, in situations when the screen is predominantly bright (such as when viewing many web pages), the AMOLED display uses more power.|$|E

For the Cheadle windows he employed William Wailes of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

TechRadar ranked HTC One X second to the Galaxy S III on their 20 best mobile phones in the world on September 13, 2012.

Evolution is followed in a self-consistent way with the predictions of detailed and new non-grey model atmospheres, time-dependent element diffusion and the history of the white dwarf progenitor. Reliable initial models for low mass He WDs are obtained by applying mass loss rates to a 1 M ⊙ stellar model {{in such a way that}} the stellar radius remains close to the Roche lobe radius. The loss of angular momentun caused by gravitational wave emission and magnetic stellar wind braking are considered.

In particular, group members with early-type morphologies, as identified in Hubble Space Telescope imaging, exhibit a tight red sequence, similar to that seen for more massive clusters. Using optical and near-infrared colours, including data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, we show that approximately 20 – 30 per cent of galaxies on the red sequence may be dust-reddened galaxies with non-negligible star formation and early-spiral morphologies. This is true of both the field and group sample, and shows little dependence on near infrared luminosity.

In this study, a software module, based on mathematical transformations of the CIECAM 02 model, was designed and implemented. Unlike the previous software modules, which were allowing use of only a limited choice of common standardized icc display profiles, the developed module also allows the use of optimized profiles created by the user. This paper presents prediction of the appearance of test images with assigned different display profiles after changing illuminant. The two used optimized profiles, created by software characterization of specific lcd display, have a different display gamma value (1. 8 and 2. 2).   It is observed that, after changing the initial cie D 50 to a higher colour temperature illuminant (D 65),  the colours of  images will be shifted to the blue hues, and, {{in the case of}} illuminant temperature less than D 50 (A and F 11),  to yellow hues. It is also observed that the intensity of colour shifts in the simulated images with associated profiles which have different gamma value will be significantly different, which implies that the icc display profile and display gamma value have the great impact on the prediction of the <b>accurate</b> <b>colour</b> appearance under various viewing conditions. <br /...|$|E

Additionally, all observations originally presented by Fraser and Brown (2012) were reanalyzed through the same updated photometry pipeline. A reanalysis of the optical and NIR colour distribution reveals a bifurcated optical colour distribution and only two identifiable spectral classes, each of which occupies a broad range of colours and have correlated optical and NIR colours, in agreement with our previous findings. We report the detection of significant spectral variations on 5 targets which cannot be attributed to photometry errors, cosmic rays, point spread function or sensitivity variations, or other image artifacts capable of explaining the magnitude of the variation. The spectrally variable objects are found to have a broad range of dynamical classes, absolute magnitudes, exhibit a broad range of apparent magnitude variations, and are found in both compositional classes. The spectrally variable objects with sufficiently <b>accurate</b> <b>colours</b> for spectral classification maintain their membership, belonging to the same class at both epochs. 2005 TV 189 exhibits a sufficiently broad difference in colour at the two epochs that span the full range of colours of the neutral class.
