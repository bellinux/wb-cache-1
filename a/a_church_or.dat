5|$|<b>A</b> <b>church,</b> <b>or</b> group, that {{is unable}} to fully provide for the {{religious}} needs of its members is called a mission. Missions are dependent on a congregation which is administered by a minister. A group of several congregations with their missions form a district. The Church in each nation is divided into multiple districts. In Mexico, several districts form together into five jurisdictions that act as legal entities.|$|E
5|$|Among the key {{indicators}} of Christianisation are cemeteries containing long cists which are generally east-west in orientation. These cemeteries are suspected, or {{known to be}} Christian, because of their proximity to <b>a</b> <b>church,</b> <b>or</b> because of Christian inscriptions found in them. They are found for {{between the end of}} the Roman era in the early fifth century and the twelfth century. They are concentrated strongly in eastern Scotland south of the River Tay, in the modern East and Borders of Scotland. Most scholars agree that the place-name element eccles-, from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period. Most of these in Scotland are located in the south of the country. From the fifth and sixth centuries, inscribed stones indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland. The earliest is the so-called Latinus stone of Whithorn, dating to c. 450. In the east and north, Class II Pictish stones began to show Christian symbolism from the early eighth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{chapter house}} has 40sedilia lining its walls, {{and may have}} {{originally}} provided seating for more when it was the meeting room for the abbey community. In 1714 it was refurbished to become a library, and its floor was raised by about 1m (3ft). Its east end was damaged in the Bristol riots of 1831, requiring considerable restoration, {{and at that time}} or later the library furnishings were removed. In 1832, when the floor was lowered again, a Saxon stone panel depicting the Harrowing of Hell was found underneath. The discovery of the stone provides strong evidence that there was <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>or</b> shrine on the site before Robert Fitzharding founded the Abbey in 1140.|$|E

5|$|William Heaven was {{succeeded by}} his son the Reverend Hudson Grosset Heaven who, thanks to a legacy from Sarah Langworthy (née Heaven), was able to fulfill his life's {{ambition}} of building a stone church on the island. St Helen's was completed in 1896, and stands today as a lasting memorial to the Heaven period. It has been designated by English Heritage a Grade II listed building. He {{is said to have}} been able to afford either <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>or</b> a new harbour. His choice of the church was not however in the best financial interests of the island. The unavailability of the money for re-establishing the family's financial soundness, coupled with disastrous investment and speculation in the early 20th century, caused severe financial hardship.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agree that}} the place-name element eccles-, from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period. In Scotland {{most of these are}} located in the south of the country {{in the area of the}} British successor states that would be known as the Hen Ogledd, or the Old North. From the fifth and sixth centuries, inscribed stones indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland. The earliest is the so-called Latinus stone of Whithorn, dating to around 450. A slightly later stone at Kirkmadrine commemorates sacerdotes, which may be bishops. Among the key indicators of Christianisation are cemeteries containing long cists, which are generally east-west in orientation, like Christian graves. These cemeteries are suspected, or known to be Christian, because of their proximity to <b>a</b> <b>church,</b> <b>or</b> because they have Christian inscriptions. They are found from between the end of the Roman era in the early fifth century and the twelfth century. They are concentrated strongly in eastern Scotland south of the River Tay, in the modern East and Borders of Scotland. Writing in the sixth century, St. Patrick also mentioned Coroticus, who probably ruled from the fort at Dumbarton rock and who had already accepted Christianity. The poem Y Gododdin, set in the early sixth century and probably written in what is now Scotland, indicates that the warriors of Gododdin, probably a kingdom based the site of modern Edinburgh, were Christian, receiving communion and confessing their sins before battle.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept and}} {{punishment}} of Apostasy {{has been extensively}} covered in Islamic literature since the 7th century. A person is considered apostate {{if he or she}} converts from Islam to another religion. A person is an apostate even if he or she believes in most of Islam, but verbally or in writing denies of one or more principles or precepts of Islam. For example, if a Muslim declares that the universe has always existed, he or she is an apostate; similarly, a Muslim who doubts the existence of Allah, enters <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>or</b> temple, makes offerings to and worships an idol or stupa or any image of God, celebrates festivals of non-Muslim religion, helps build <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>or</b> temple, confesses a belief in rebirth or incarnation of God, disrespects Qur'an or Islam's Prophet are all individually sufficient evidence of apostasy.|$|E

25|$|Several cases {{recorded}} {{where the}} King specifically forbade the tenant from alienating <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>or</b> land held in perpetuity by the Crown, and presumably {{the equivalent of}} mortmain. These cases are dated 1164, 1221 and 1227. After 1217, there was a forfeiture of land to the great lord in cases of unauthorized alienation in mortmain. Henry III granted conspicuous favor to the Church and left the proclamations of 1215-1217 largely unenforced. The proscription was reintroduced and made more forcible by Henry III’s son, Edward I in the Statute of Mortmain in 1279.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish missionaries {{were not}} well received. The Keys Indians, as the Spanish called them, denied {{that they had}} {{requested}} missionaries. They did permit a mission to be established because the Spanish had brought gifts for them, but the cacique denied that the King of Spain had dominion over his land, and insisted on tribute for allowing the Spanish to build <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>or</b> bring in settlers. The Indians demanded food, rum and clothing, but refused {{to work for the}} Spanish.

25|$|Webster first {{decided to}} run for the Florida House in 1979 at the age of 30.

25|$|The use {{of other}} items of papal regalia has been discontinued, though {{they have not been}} abolished. The Sedia gestatoria, a {{portable}} throne or armchair carried by twelve footmen (palafrenieri) in red uniforms was accompanied by two attendants bearing the flabella, large ceremonial fans made of white ostrich-feathers. The sedia gestatoria was used for the Pope's solemn entrance into <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>or</b> hall and for his departure on the occasion of liturgical celebrations such as a papal Mass and for papal audiences. The use of the flabella was discontinued by Pope Paul VI, and that of the sedia gestatoria by Pope John Paul II.|$|E
