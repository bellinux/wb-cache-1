I studied {{two groups of}} habituated monkeys of about 10 to 20 individuals each, approximately three-fourths adults, one-eighth juveniles, and one-eighth infants. I studied four aspects of locomotion: mode, forest level utilized, substrate type used, and tail use. Data were collected via focal and scan animal sampling, and were later converted into rates for each age group, sex, and field site. Climbing {{was found to be}} the most prevalent mode of locomotion among all individuals. Infants and juveniles jumped more than adults, and all adults were generally similar in their patterns of locomotion. No individuals descended to the ground, and descend to the understory occurred at only one site. At both sites, they preferred mid-canopy more than crown, and crown more than emergent trees. Generally, all individuals utilized small substrates the most, then medium, and then large. Oblique substrates were utilized the most, followed by horizontal and, then, vertical. At both locations, infants used their tails more during locomotion than did any other age group. Generally, substrate and forest level use were quite similar between age/sex groups and sites, but modes of locomotion and tail use exhibited more variation. Due to the limited amount of time spent in the field, these results may not represent how locomotion varies {{over a longer period of}} time...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Primates are {{predominantly}} distributed across tropical regions, {{many of which}} are threatened by deforestation. Removal of mature trees can harm primate populations by reducing avail-able food resources. Understanding the dietary requirements of primates at local levels can help identify key habitats to conserve, and protect plant species on which primates rely. Little is known about local diets of <b>Alouatta</b> <b>palliata</b> (mantled howler monkey), Ateles geoffroyi (black-handed spider monkey), and Cebus capucinus (white-faced capuchin) in Costa Rica's lowland tropical wet forests. Because diet and activity levels are closely connected, studies examining one provide insight into the other. We used group scan sample methods to record activity and diet, identifying all plant species on which the primates fed. We identified nine families of plants eaten by Ateles geoffroyi, four families eaten by <b>Alouatta</b> <b>palliata,</b> and two families eaten by Cebus capucinus. Activity budgets demonstrated that <b>Alouatta</b> <b>palliata</b> was the least active species and Cebus capucinus the most active. We also found differences in the type of plant parts consumed by the three primate species; <b>Alouatta</b> <b>palliata</b> and Ateles geoffroyi fed mostly on fruit and new leaves, whereas Cebus capucinus fed on fruit and in-sects. The nine families of plants identified in this study are potentially important for all three primate species locally, and warrant conservation...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Platyrrhine (New World) monkeys possess highly polymorphic color vision owing to allelic {{variation of the}} single-locus L/M opsin gene on the X chromosome. Most species consist of female trichromats and female and male dichromats. Howlers (genus Alouatta) are an exception; they {{are considered to be}} routinely trichromatic with L and M opsin genes juxtaposed on the X chromosome, as seen in catarrhine primates (Old World monkeys, apes, and humans). Yet it is not known whether trichromacy is invariable in howlers. We examined L/M opsin variation in wild howler populations in Costa Rica and Nicaragua (<b>Alouatta</b> <b>palliata)</b> and Belize (A. pigra), using fecal DNA. We surveyed exon 5 sequences (containing the diagnostic 277 th and 285 th residues for λmax) for 8 and 18 X chromosomes from <b>Alouatta</b> <b>palliata</b> and A. pigra, respectively. The wavelengths of maximal absorption (λmax) of the reconstituted L and M opsin photopigments were 564 nm and 532 nm, respectively, in both species.

40|$|Specific {{gravity is}} a {{urinalysis}} parameter that measures {{the concentration of}} excreted molecules in urine. Clinically, specific gravity measures the kidney’s ability to dilute or concentrate urine and reflects the concentration of urine during renal filtration. We explored species differences in the specific gravity of various primates’ urine samples, including <b>Alouatta</b> <b>palliata,</b> <b>Alouatta</b> caraya, Callithrix jacchus, Sapajus apella, and Saimiri sciureus. A refractometer {{was used to measure}} the urine samples. The urine samples obtained from the wild howler monkeys, <b>Alouatta</b> <b>palliata,</b> had a higher specific gravity than the other primate species’ samples, which were all obtained from captive animals and did not have differing values. These results held true even when controlling for individual differences between animals. Our results indicate that open access to water while in captivity affects specific gravity more than species differences in renal physiology, however specific gravity is a general parameter and might not detect other possible differences in renal physiology that exist between nonhuman primate species...|$|R

40|$|Primate species often eat {{foods of}} {{different}} physical properties. This may {{have implications for}} tooth structure and wear in those species. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the mechanical defenses of leaves eaten by <b>Alouatta</b> <b>palliata</b> from different social groups at Hacienda La Pacifica in Costa Rica. Leaves were sampled from the home-ranges of groups living in different microhabitats. Specimens were collected during the wet and dry seasons from the same tree, same plant part, and same degree of development as those eaten by the monkeys. The toughness of over 300 leaves was estimated using a scissors test on a Darvell mechanical tester. Toughness values were compared between social groups, seasons, and locations on the leaves using ANOVA. Representative samples of leaves were also sun-dried for subsequent scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analyses in an attempt to locate silica on the leaves. Both forms of mechanical defense (toughness and silica) were found to be at work in the plants at La Pacifica. Fracture toughness varied significantly by location within single leaves, indicating that measures of fracture toughness must be standardized by location on food items. Monkeys made some food choices based on fracture toughness by avoiding the toughest parts of leaves and consuming the least tough portions. Intergroup and seasonal differences in the toughness of foods suggest that subtle differences in resource availability can have a significant impact on diet and feeding in <b>Alouatta</b> <b>palliata.</b> Intergroup differences in the incidence of silica on leaves raise the possibility of matching differences in the rates and patterns of tooth wear...|$|R
