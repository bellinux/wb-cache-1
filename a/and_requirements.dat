5|$|By November, {{proponents of}} the peace coin had {{realized}} that congressional approval was not necessary—as the Morgan dollar had been struck for more than 25 years, it was eligible for replacement {{at the discretion of}} the Secretary of the Treasury under an 1890 act. The Morgan design was then being used for large quantities of silver dollars as the Mint struck replacements for the melted coins under the Pittman Act. Though Congress had not yet convened, Baker contacted Fraser in early November to discuss details of the design competition. According to Burdette, Baker's newfound enthusiasm came from the fact that President Harding was about to formally declare an end to the war with Germany—a declaration needed because the US had not ratified the Treaty of Versailles. In addition, the Washington Conference on disarmament, for which the administration had great hopes, was soon to convene. On November 19, Fraser notified competition participants by personal letter, sending official rules <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> four days later, with submissions due by December 12. Competition participants included Hermon MacNeil, Victor D. Brenner, and Adolph Weinman, all of whom had designed previous U.S. coins.|$|E
5|$|His {{concern with}} public {{education}} was not interrupted by his military campaigns. In 1813 he {{was rewarded with}} 40,000 pesos for his victories at Salta and Tucumán, an amount that would equal almost 80 gold kilograms. Belgrano rejected taking the prize money for himself, considering that a patriot should not seek money or wealth. He gave {{it back to the}} XIII year Assembly, with instructions to build primary schools at Tarija, Jujuy, San Miguel de Tucumán, and Santiago del Estero. He laid out a series of instructions about the methods <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> for the selection of the teachers. However, the schools were not built, and by 1823 Bernardino Rivadavia declared that the money was lost; Juan Ramón Balcarce included it in the debt of the Buenos Aires province a decade later.|$|E

5|$|In July 1942 the Royal Navy {{formed the}} Future Building Committee, chaired by the Deputy First Sea Lord, {{to examine the}} fleet's {{requirements}} {{for the rest of}} the war. Tasked with anticipating the Navy's readiness <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> for January 1944, the committee realised that a major expansion of naval aviation was required, which meant that more aircraft carriers would be needed. Many factors combined to drive up the size of these new carriers, notably the increasing size and speed of aircraft and the desire to increase the numbers of aircraft aboard fleet carriers. Another important consideration was the change in carrier tactics from the earlier doctrine of more attacks with smaller numbers of aircraft to the use of large, single airstrikes.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, Arnold {{asked for}} Kenney to return Wilson {{to work on}} his own staff. Wilson took the long way back, visiting the other war theatres in India, China, the Middle East, Italy and England. Wilson found the Army Air Forces Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Barney Giles anxious for Wilson's return so Giles could pay a visit to the war theatres. Wilson {{therefore}} found himself acting chief of staff. On Giles' return, Wilson became Assistant Chief of Staff, Organization, Commitments <b>and</b> <b>Requirements.</b> In February 1945, Wilson was present at the Battle of Iwo Jima as an official Army Air Forces observer. He was promoted to major general on 17 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|Once it {{was clear}} that U.S. {{territory}} was not in danger of being attacked by enemy air units, Saville's expertise in air defense was not needed. In March 1943, he was made director of tactical development at the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) at Orlando, Florida, where he reorganized the Army Air Forces Board by July 2, 1943. Saville's structure put tactical and strategic development on equal footing, and tied together the efforts of the Chief of Air Staff for Operations, Commitments, <b>and</b> <b>Requirements</b> (OC), the Proving Ground Command and the School of Applied Tactics. Saville charged the AAFSAT with developing air defense doctrines and tactics, and with the testing of air defense equipment and methods.|$|E

5|$|Though Houston is {{the largest}} city in the United States without formal zoning regulations, it has {{developed}} similarly to other Sun Belt cities because the city's land use regulations and legal covenants have played a similar role. Regulations include mandatory lot size for single-family houses <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> that parking be available to tenants and customers. Such restrictions have had mixed results. Though some have blamed the city's low density, urban sprawl, and lack of pedestrian-friendliness on these policies, the city's land use has also been credited with having significant affordable housing, sparing Houston the worst effects of the 2008 real estate crisis.

Some {{companies}} in the telecommunications industry have indeed found it difficult to adjust to the new customer behavior patterns, especially in the matters of customer preference <b>and</b> <b>requirement.</b> Such that a noticeable gap has opened up between the service provider and their customer’s expectations. This research focus on the resulting expectations and perceptions of Service Quality customer in the Celular Telecommunication Industry. It also aims to (1) examine the overall environmental factors that influence customer preference <b>and</b> <b>requirement</b> of pre-paid or post-paid cellular telecommunication services in the industry (2) analyze the effect of the service marketing mix of the cellular telecommunication industry to customer preference <b>and</b> <b>requirement</b> (3) find out customer evaluation on SERVQUAL of cellular telecommunication industry (4) analyze the effect of cellular telecommunication service marketing mix on customer satisfaction and loyalty. The customer loyalty is analyzed as an industry, under the assumption that the customer have known their provider well enough and the research tools used are the same. Therefore a loyalty index for the Cellular Industry can be achieved. The results of this research indicated that the market environment influence the nature of preference <b>and</b> <b>requirement</b> in the pre and postpaid telecommunication services. Meanwhile, the service marketing mix by the telecommunications service providers influence the nature of customer preference <b>and</b> <b>requirement</b> in the case of pre-paid services {{and in the case of}} post-purchase, there is only physical evidence variable that doesn’t show evidence of influence over customer preference <b>and</b> <b>requirement.</b> This reveals a movement in customer preference and furthermore, the cellular telecommunication service marketing mix positively influence levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty achieved will depend on the price, location, process, and personnel offered by the company. Therefore they must always pay attention to the rapid changes in customer priority, preference <b>and</b> <b>requirement</b> in order for them to achieve a high level of customer loyalty. service quality, customer loyalty...|$|R
