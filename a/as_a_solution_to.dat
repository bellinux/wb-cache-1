Gates's solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years; its successor is faster by only one percent.

5|$|Japan's {{population}} {{is expected to}} drop to 95 million by 2050; demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over {{how to cope with}} this problem. Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (帰化) per year. According to the UNHCR, in 2012 Japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement, while the United States took in 76,000.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} largely at {{the urging}} of the Admiralty, who saw it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> detecting the conning towers of partially submerged U-Boats. After a visit by Tizard to GEC's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939, and a follow-up visit by Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead of broadcasting the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a flashlight, pointed in the direction of observation. This would greatly increase the amount of energy falling on a target, and improve detection capability.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern {{what ought to}} be done, insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of {{what ought to be}} done in a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, capable of being presented <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1108, Ranulf {{was dragged}} {{into the middle of}} the ongoing dispute between Archbishop Anselm and the newly {{appointed}} Archbishop of York, Thomas over whether or not Thomas should profess obedience to Anselm. Because Anselm refused to consecrate Thomas without a profession, and Thomas refused to profess, Thomas was unable to consecrate bishops himself. Ranulf wrote to Anselm, asking that he might act as Thomas' surrogate and consecrate Thurgot as Bishop of St Andrew's. In September 1108, Anselm wrote to Ranulf forbidding anyone but Thomas or Anselm himself to consecrate Thurgot or any other bishops. Later, Ranulf tried to bribe King Henry to take Thomas' side. Thurgot had been prior of the cathedral chapter at Durham, but had disagreed with Ranulf, who arranged for him to be elected to St Andrew's <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> the quarrel.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being over}} 60 {{years old and}} having {{been out of the}} Army for 25 years, the crisis of the Union {{compelled}} Greene to seek to rejoin the service. He was essentially apolitical and was not an abolitionist, but he was a firm believer in restoring the Union. He was appointed colonel of the 60th New York Volunteer Infantry on January 18, 1862. The regiment of upstate New Yorkers had been dissatisfied with their colonel and the company commanders had petitioned for his removal. Governor Edwin D. Morgan, although initially reluctant to appoint Greene because of his age, saw his 13 years of regular army experience <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> his political/military problem. During this period, Governor John A. Andrew of Massachusetts was also prepared to offer Greene a regiment, but Greene chose to serve New York. The officers of the 60th were dismayed when the elderly, gray-haired man reported for duty. They had requested that their lieutenant colonel be promoted, which would have raised many of them in rank themselves.|$|E
