5|$|There {{were other}} {{financial}} pressures on Frazee, despite his team's success. Ruth, {{fully aware of}} baseball's popularity and his role in it, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921. He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures. Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> money. Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from {{the purchase of the}} club.|$|E

The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin.

25|$|While Palin was Mayor of Wasilla, {{the town}} paid a {{lobbying}} firm $24,000 to $36,000 {{per year to}} help secure federal earmarks for the town.

According to reporting by ABC News, however, Wasilla only directly received $7.95 million, and the $26.9 million figure refers to the amount the entire Matanuska-Susitna Borough received.|$|E
25|$|On May 1, 1880, Vizcarrondo and Rafael María de Labra {{became the}} founders of the Sociedad Nacional Democrática (National Democratic Society), a {{political}} party whose main goal was to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> autonomy for both Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1886, he was elected as the representative for his party of the district of Ponce, Puerto Rico. In the Spanish Parliament, Vizcarrondo recommended an autonomy modeled after the type that Canada had at that moment. In 1887, he participated in a massive campaign directed against the Spanish appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Romualdo Palacios, which resulted in the governor's replacement.

25|$|At a camp, a British captain asks Mizushima to {{talk down}} {{a group of}} {{soldiers}} who are still fighting on a mountain.

He climbs up to the cave and informs their commander that the war has ended and they should surrender. The commander confers with the other soldiers, and they unanimously decide to fight to the end. Mizushima begs for them to surrender but they do nothing. He decides to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> time from the British, but when he creates a surrender flag, the others take it the wrong way and believe he is surrendering for them.

25|$|The sadhaka {{may also}} meditate on a deity. Offerings to the deity {{are put in}} the corpse's mouth. The {{practitioner}} may perform pranayama and meditate on his guru and the deity in his mind. He can also practice japa (repetition of a mantra or a deity's names or epithets), till the corpse promises him to grant his wish. He may encounter an Akashavani (a voice from the skies) which may try to tempt him with material things. He will experience terrifying visions and sounds as well as temptations; however the practitioner should remain untouched and concentrate on the meditation. On conducting the rite successfully, the sadhaka would be blessed with mantra-siddhi (a supernatural power to use a mantra) or become one with Shiva. Uniting with Shiva is said to lead to detachment, a characteristic of the ascetic god. Shiva is himself equated with shava, the corpse. As the vessel of Shiva, the adept becomes an avadhuta, a mystic who is beyond egoic-consciousness, duality and common worldly concerns. The Tantrasara says that a voice may <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> offerings or bless the practitioner by granting his wishes.|$|E
25|$|On 19 May 1898, Aguinaldo {{decided to}} resume the {{revolution}} {{and returned to the}} Philippines through American aid. Among those who returned with him was Estrella. When the Philippine–American War broke out on 4 February 1899, Estrella {{was one of the first}} generals to see action outside Manila. On 5 February, the Americans positioned themselves in the outskirts of San Roque (now part of Cavite City), which Filipino troops are being commanded by Estrella. Three days later, on 8 February, Second Lieutenant John Glass of the 1st Battalion of the California Heavy Artillery (California National Guard) was sent with an escort to demand Estrella the surrender and the evacuation of the town. Otherwise, artillery and gunboat bombardment would be done against them. By this time, the gunboats Manila and Callao have been positioned just outside the town to assist the offensive. On 9 February, the town mayor approached Commodore George Dewey to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> time to decide the matter. When Dewey refused, the Filipinos raised the white flag of surrender. However, this was only a deception to lure the Americans into attacking the town. When the Americans managed to occupy San Roque, the retreating Filipinos set the town on fire. In order to gain access to the area, the Americans had to flank it from the sea. Meanwhile, skirmishes were undertaken whenever the Americans caught up with the Filipinos. Estrella would continue leading Filipino troops for the rest of the year, even fighting alongside Brigadier General Pío del Pilar in Guadalupe, Makati (then part of Rizal). However, on 8 June 1900, Estrella was caught with Pío del Pilar by the American secret police (which utilized a native contingent headed by Captain Lara) at Guadalupe.|$|E

A study published in Science magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments.

Specifically, blinded committees more often <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> information rather than approving studies.|$|E

[...] Pink Moon sold fewer copies than either of its predecessors, although it received some favourable reviews.

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that [...] " [...] was less a concert than a Las Vegas-style revue of intimidating complexity.
