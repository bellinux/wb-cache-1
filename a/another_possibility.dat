5|$|Persian agents or Palmyrene traitors: the {{possibility}} of a Persian involvement exists but the outcome of the assassination would not have served Shapur without establishing a pro-Persian monarch on the Palmyrene throne. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> would be Palmyrenes dissatisfied with Odaenathus' reign and the changes of their city's governmental system.|$|E
5|$|The {{chronology}} {{and circumstances}} surrounding the conclusion of Lǫgmaðr's reign are uncertain. According to one source, he voluntarily resigned the kingship and journeyed to Jerusalem where he died. This account could be evidence that he died on crusade: one possibility is the First Crusade, perhaps in the entourage of Robert II, Duke of Normandy; <b>another</b> <b>possibility</b> is the so-called Norwegian Crusade, in the entourage of Sigurðr Magnússon, King of Norway. Although one source claims that Lǫgmaðr's trek to the Holy Land was undertaken in remorse for the cruelty he had inflicted upon Haraldr, <b>another</b> <b>possibility</b> {{is that he was}} forced into exile instead. Whatever the case, it is apparent that about a decade after Magnús' death, the Crovan dynasty was restored to the kingship in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> {{is that a}} {{gene for}} aposematism might be {{recessive}} and located on the X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E

5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment, a by-product of secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body hair) had largely been lost. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> is that long head hair {{is a result of}} Fisherian runaway sexual selection, where long lustrous hair is a visible marker for a healthy individual. For some groups or individuals, however, short hair is the selected trait.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> is that she was introduced in the context of her mother's family. Her identity in the Catalogue is unknown, but this hypothesis could allow for Atalanta to appear within the Inachid stemma, following the Danae-Ehoie within the extended family of Belus.|$|E
5|$|New {{morphological}} {{features and}} ultimately new species {{are produced by}} variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when toolkit genes acquire additional functions. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> is the Neo-Lamarckian theory that epigenetic changes are later consolidated at gene level, something {{that may have been}} important early in the history of multicellular life.|$|E

5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear. One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity {{may be the result of}} diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> is that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} {{architecture}} of ancient Sri Lanka, vatadages were {{built for the}} protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground. If the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is the shrine built by Parakramabahu I, the relic of the tooth of the Buddha would have been enshrined within it. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> is that the alms bowl used by the Buddha may have been enshrined here. Both these relics were important objects in ancient Sri Lankan culture, and would have made the Polonnaruwa Vatadage {{one of the most significant}} and venerated buildings in the country.|$|E
5|$|According {{to modern}} genealogies {{the father of}} Artavasdes I, Ariobarzanes I was {{a son of a}} {{previous}} ruling King Mithridates I of Media Atropatene and his wife, an unnamed Armenian Princess from the Artaxiad Dynasty who was a daughter of the Armenian King Tigranes the Great and his wife, Cleopatra of Pontus, which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descendants to the Armenian Kingship in opposition to the lasting ruling monarchs of the Artaxiad Dynasty. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> in linking Artavasdes I to the marriage of Mithridates I and his wife is through his name. The name Artavasdes bears as a typical Armenian royal name and therefore, in all likelihood, Artavasdes I is a descendant of this marriage.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this diploma thesis is Felis versus Felix - symbolical and {{narrative}} content within art and arts education. This thesis is both theoretical and practical study of the topic. Theoretical part is concerned with understanding key words, their meaning, cat itself, its symbolic, history, properties, and connotations connected to it. The author of the thesis maps the occurrence of cat in art and literature, which she supports by specific examples. She further offers using {{the theme of the}} thesis in arts education and introduces already existing art set called "Animal within us".

5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> was {{suggested}} by Brooks: Penda might have lost power {{at some point}} after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians {{for at least some}} of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's fortunes were low at this time. Thus it may be that Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield. argues against the idea that Penda and Eowa were co-rulers, and favours the idea that Eowa was ruling Mercia from c. 635 until 642.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Macedonian War, Nabis had <b>another</b> <b>possibility</b> for expansion. Philip of Macedon {{offered him}} the polis of Argos in {{exchange}} for Sparta defecting from the Roman coalition and joining the Macedonian alliance. Nabis accepted and received control over Argos. However, when the war turned against Macedon, he rejoined the Roman coalition and sent 600 Cretan mercenaries to support the Roman army. Philip was later decisively defeated by the Romans {{at the battle of}} Cynoscephalae, but Sparta remained in control of Argos. After the war, the Roman army did not withdraw from Greece, but instead sent garrisons to various strategic locations across Greece to secure its interests.|$|E

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I present the culture life in Terezin {{concentration}} camp during 2 nd World War. First of all I tried to collect all available sources whose origins and description {{is present in}} the first chapter of my MA thesis. My thesis is further divided into chronological order of chapters. Every year of Terezin concentration camp existence is described in a separate chapter. Culture life in my thesis is divided in individual activities - (for example: lectures, theater, music, art, cabaret, etc.) In these chapters I concentrate also on some distinctive personalities who strongly affected culture life in Terezin concentration camp. In the beginning of each chapter there is a brief historical summary of actual situation. At the close of my thesis I look at <b>another</b> <b>possibilities</b> of researching this theme - psychological and religionical...|$|R
5|$|Herodotus recounts that, {{according}} to the Athenians, as the battle began the Corinthians hoisted their sails and began sailing away from the battle, northwards up the straits. However, {{he also says that}} other Greeks denied this story. If this did in fact occur, one possible interpretation is that these ships had been a decoy sent to reconnoitre the northern exit from the straits, in case the arrival of the encircling Egyptian detachment was imminent (if indeed this also occurred). <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> (not exclusive of the former) is that the departure of the Corinthians triggered the final approach of the Persians, suggesting as it did that the Allied fleet was disintegrating. At any rate, if they indeed ever left, the Corinthians soon returned to the battle.|$|E
5|$|Most TBI {{that results}} from blunt trauma occurs within the chest. The most common {{tracheal}} injury is a tear near the carina or in the membranous wall of the trachea. In blunt chest trauma, TBI occurs within 2.5cm of the carina 40–80% of the time. The injury {{is more common in}} the right main bronchus than the left, possibly because the former is near vertebrae, which may injure it. Also, the aorta and other tissues in the mid chest that surround the left main bronchus may protect it. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> is that people with left main bronchus injuries are more likely to also have other deadly injuries and therefore die before reaching hospital, making them less likely to be included in studies that determine rates of injuries.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus was {{described}} as Roman senator in the undated tomb inscription and Hairan I was mentioned with the same title in the 251 inscription. Scholarly opinions vary on the exact date of Odaenathus' elevation to the position; Gawlikowski and Jean Starcky maintain that the senatorial rank predates the Ras elevation. Udo Hartmann concludes that Odaenathus first became a Ras in the 240s then a senator in 250. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> is that the senatorial rank and lordship occurred simultaneously; Odaenathus was chosen as a Ras following Gordian's death, then after Philip the Arab concluded a peace with the Persians, the emperor ratified Odaenathus' lordship and admitted him to the senate to guarantee Palmyra's continuous subordination.|$|E
25|$|A robotic {{interstellar}} mission carrying some {{number of}} frozen early stage human embryos is <b>another</b> theoretical <b>possibility.</b> This method of space colonization requires, among other things, {{the development of}} an artificial uterus, the prior detection of a habitable terrestrial planet, and advances in the field of fully autonomous mobile robots and educational robots that would replace human parents.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{intriguing}} <b>possibility</b> is that {{a terrorist}} might buy stocks which are likely to appreciate {{in the event of}} a terrorist attack, such as defense industry stocks, or sell short stocks which are likely to depreciate, such as airlines.
