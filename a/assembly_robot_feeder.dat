40|$|Some {{factors that}} {{significantly}} {{contribute to the}} overall assembly efficiency of the placement machines are robot motion control, sequence of placement points and feeder setup. Many techniques {{have been developed to}} improve the sequence of placement points and/or the feeder setup for the PCB assembly process. However, a limited number of works have reported on improving the robot motion control. This paper proposes a revised dynamic pick-andplace point (DPP) specification approach called Chebychev DPP (CDPP). We formulate a problem for a placement machine that is a type of cartesian robot which is able to move in both X and Y directions concurrently. The formulations are constructed based on the triple objectives of minimising <b>robot</b> <b>assembly</b> time, <b>feeder</b> movements and PCB table movements. Experimental results show that our CDPP is superior to Wang's DPP approach in terms of <b>robot</b> <b>assembly</b> time, <b>feeder</b> movements and PCB table movements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} {{the assembly of}} a three dimensional (3 D) structure {{by a team of}} heterogeneous robots capable of online sensing and error correction during the assembly process. The automated assembly problem is posed as a general 3 D tiling problem where the assembly components/tiles consist of various shapes and sizes. For a desired 3 D structure, we first compute the partition of the assembly strategy into Nc sub-components that can be executed in parallel by a team of Nc <b>assembly</b> <b>robots.</b> To enable online error detection and correction during the <b>assembly</b> pro-cess, mobile <b>robots</b> equipped with visual depth sensors are tasked to scan, identify, and track the state of the structure. The objective is to enable online detection of missing assembly components and reassignment of these components to the team of <b>assembly</b> <b>robots.</b> We present the development of the planning, sensing, and con-trol strategies employed and report on the experimental validation of these strategies using our multi-robot testbed. ...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{advantages}} of high speed, high accuracy, high flexibility, and low cost, <b>assembly</b> <b>robots</b> {{are widely used}} in electronics and automotive industries. However, {{it is still a}} significant challenge for large-scale, heavy-weight part <b>assembly</b> using industrial <b>robots.</b> First, the deformation and motion errors of industrial robots caused by big payload cannot meet the accuracy requirement of large structure assembly. To solve this problem, an online kinematics compensation method based on Gaussian Process Regression is developed to predict and compensate the deformation and uncertainties of a large structure <b>assembly</b> <b>robot.</b> Second, before the assembly process, the optimal assembly path has to be planned. To this end, we propose an assembly path planning method based on learning from demonstration.

40|$|SCARA (Selective Compliant <b>Assembly</b> <b>Robot</b> Arm) type robots are {{the most}} common type of <b>assembly</b> <b>robots.</b> These robots have four degrees of freedom (three {{rotational}} and one translational). Typically these robots are used for assembly tasks that take place along a vertical axis. Many times, however, assembly tasks take place along a non-vertical axis. To account for non- vertical axis assembly, parts must be fed in a proper orientation to allow for correct assembly. Parts feeders and specialized end-effectors are typically used to feed parts in their proper orientation. This thesis investigates a novel end-effector that can be used to feed parts for industrial assembly applications. Specifically, the purpose of the novel end-effector is to provide a SCARA robot with an added selectable degree of freedom. This end-effector aims to bridge the gap between complex anthropomorphic grippers and simple binary grippers. The approach is novel in that the end-effector interacts with the environment to produce the added degree of freedom. New path planning algorithms were developed to work in conjunction with the novel end-effector. A prototype end-effector was designed, built, and tested to prove the validity of this new approach...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} a {{distributed}} mobile robot platform to deliver parts around a model construction site. The platform's robots, specialized into delivery <b>robots</b> and <b>assembly</b> <b>robots,</b> use a distributed coverage algorithm {{to determine where}} parts should be delivered. The robots consist of a mobility platform (iRobot iCreate), a manipulation platform (Crustcrawler arm), and an IR communication system to enable recognition and grasping of parts. To control the robot hardware, we implemented software in Java. The delivery robots use IR communication to find parts at a supply station. After communicating over UDP multicast with <b>assembly</b> station <b>robots,</b> the delivery robots deliver parts to the <b>assembly</b> <b>robots</b> based on their coverage control algorithm. To evaluate the algorithm, we constructed a hardware system of 4 robots, connected to a VICON motion capture system for localization. We discuss the results of successful hardware and software testing of {{the system as a}} method of delivering parts around a construction site, and we discuss future plans to use the platform to assemble parts once delivered. by Adrienne Bolger.
