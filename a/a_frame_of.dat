5|$|The Palazzo Zacco {{is one of}} {{the more}} notable Baroque {{buildings}} of the city, its Corinthian columns supporting balconies of amazing wrought iron work, while supports of grotesques mock, shock or amuse the passerby. The palazzo was built in the second half of the 18th century by the Baron Melfi di San Antonio. It was later acquired by the Zacco family, after which it is named. The building has two street façades, each with six wide balconies bearing the coat of arms of the Melfi family, <b>a</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> acanthus leaves from which a puttino leans. The balconies, a feature of the palazzo, are notable for the differing corbels which support them, ranging from putti to musicians and grotesques. The focal points of the principal façade are the three central balconies, divided by columns with Corinthian capitals. Here the balconies are supported by images of musicians with grotesque faces.|$|E

5|$|The tidal {{effect of}} the planets is weak and does not {{significantly}} affect {{the shape of the}} Sun. The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the Coriolis force due to the Sun's rotation. In <b>a</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.|$|E
5|$|Whorf and Sapir both drew {{explicitly}} on Albert Einstein's {{principle of}} general relativity; hence linguistic relativity {{refers to the}} concept of grammatical and semantic categories of a specific language providing <b>a</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference as a medium through which observations are made. Following an original observation by Boas, Sapir demonstrated that speakers of a given language perceive sounds that are acoustically different as the same, if the sound comes from the underlying phoneme and does not contribute to changes in semantic meaning. Furthermore, speakers of languages are attentive to sounds, particularly if the same two sounds come from different phonemes. Such differentiation {{is an example of how}} various observational frames of reference leads to different patterns of attention and perception.|$|E

40|$|Abstract.

On the contrary however it is here proposed that <b>a</b> rotating <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference, rather than creating an inertial centrifugal force, actually masks a hithertofore unrecognized inertial centripetal force. When the books are correctly balanced, it will be demonstrated that centrifugal force is a real force, closely related to kinetic energy, and observable in any <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference...|$|R
