Use of these equations facilitates optimization of the process of wool bleaching, and bleaching conditions leading to the whitest 'wool have been suggested for an allowable chemical degradation (<b>alkali</b> <b>solubilities</b> of 25 % and 30 %).

40|$|We report high-precision {{inductively coupled plasma}} {{mass spectrometric}} (ICP-MS) {{compositional}} data for 39 trace elements {{in a variety of}} dust deposits, trapped sediments and surface samples from New Zealand and Australia. Dusts collected from the surface of alpine glaciers in the Southern Alps, New Zealand, believed to have undergone long-distance atmospheric transport from Australia, are recognizable on account of their overabundances of Pb and Cu with respect to typical upper crustal values. Long-travelled dust from Australia therefore scavenges these and other metals (e. g. Zn, Sb and Cd) from the atmosphere during transport and deposition. Hence, due to anthropogenic pollution, long-travelled Australian dusts can be recognized by elevated metal contents. The rela tive abundance of 25 other elements that are not affected by atmospheric pollution, mineral sorting (Zr and Hf) and weathering/ <b>solubility</b> (<b>alkali</b> and earth alkali elements) reflects the geochemistry of the dust source sediment. As a result, we are able to establish the provenance of dust using ultra-trace-element chemistry at regional scale. Comparison of long-travelled dust chemistry with potential Australian sources shows that fits of variable quality are obtained. We propose that the best fitting potential source chemistry most likely represents the major dust source area. A binary mixing model is used to demonstrate that admixture of small quantities of local dust provides an even better fitting dust chemistry for the long-travelled dusts.

30|$|In {{contrary}} to acid treatment, alkali pretreatment methods are in general performed {{at ambient temperature}} and pressure. The most commonly used alkali reagents are the hydroxyl derivatives of sodium, potassium, calcium, and ammonium salts. Among these hydroxyl derivatives, sodium hydroxide {{was found to be}} most effective (Kumar and Wyman 2009). Alkali reagents degrade the side chains of esters and glycosides leading to structural modification of lignin, cellulose swelling, cellulose decrystallization, and hemicellulose solvation (Cheng et al. 2010; Ibrahim et al. 2011; McIntosh and Vancov 2010; Sills and Gossett 2011). Sun et al. (1995) optimized the concentration, temperature, and duration of pretreatment using sodium hydroxide. The optimized condition was 1.5 % sodium hydroxide at 20  °C for 144  h released 60 % lignin and 80 % hemicellulose. Zhao et al. (2008) showed the effect of sodium hydroxide on different biomass viz. wheat straw, hardwoods, switchgrass, and softwoods containing less than 26 % lignin. However, no effect of dilute NaOH was observed on softwoods with lignin content greater than 26 % (Kumar and Wyman 2009). As compared to untreated cellulose, the sodium hydroxide treated corn stover showed increase in biogas production by 37 % (Zhu et al. 2010). As compared to acid pretreatment, the solubility of cellulose and hemicellulose is very low with the <b>alkali</b> pretreatment. The <b>solubility</b> improves on increasing the internal surface area of cellulose, decreasing the degree of polymerization and crystallinity, and disrupting the lignin structure (Taherzadeh and Karimi 2008). The conditions for mild alkali pretreatment are less harsh as compared to other pretreatment methods especially acid pretreatment method. Mild alkali pretreatment can be successfully carried out at ambient conditions, however, higher temperature are required if the pretreatment is needed to be carried out for longer duration. Further, a neutralizing step is required to remove the inhibitors as well as lignin (Brodeur et al. 2011). The benefit of lime pretreatment is the low cost of lime as compared to other alkaline agents. For example, in 2005, cost of hydrated lime was $ 70 /ton as compared to $ 270 /ton ammonia and $ 320 /ton for 50 wt% NaOH and 45 wt% KOH (Brodeur et al. 2011). Also, it can be easily recovered from hydrolysate by reaction with CO 2. Park et al. (2010 a, b) modified the lime pretreatment method by neutralizing the lime with carbon dioxide before hydrolysis. This eliminated the solid–liquid separation step resulting in 89 % glucose recovery from leafstar rice straw. They also applied this modification to examine simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) by using Saccharomyces cerevisae and Pichia stipitis which found 74 % increase in ethanol yield after 79  h of fermentation at 30  °C. Being an inexpensive pretreatment method, the only drawback of alkali treatment is its high downstream processing cost because the process utilizes a large quantity of water for removing the salts from the biomass and is a cumbersome process to remove them.|$|R

Finding a way {{to solve this problem}} without any influences on other fiber characteristics is still a matter of research. Using nano particles on textile materials is a new approach to produce novel properties. Here, nano titanium dioxide (NTO) particles along with butane tetra carboxylic acid (BTCA) were sonicated in the ultra sound bath and applied as a nano colloid on the wool fabric. BTCA played different roles as wool cross-linker, a polyanionic agent, and stabilizer for nano TiO 2. Various concentrations of NTO and BTCA were applied through impregnation of the fabric in ultrasonic bath followed by curing. The resistance of fabrics against alkali was assessed by solubility in sodium hydroxide and the hydrophilicity monitored by the water drop absorption time and the contact angle before and after UV irradiation. Interestingly, the <b>alkali</b> <b>solubility</b> of the nano TiO 2 treated wool fabrics reduced while the fabric became more hydrophilic.

For functional analysis of these genes, we constructed several mutant strains in A. nidulans: agsA disruption, agsB disruption, and double-disruption strains. We also constructed several CagsB strains in which agsB expression was controlled by the inducible alcA promoter, with or without the agsA-disrupting mutation.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} process for the {{industrial}} scale bleaching of possum fur. Research was undertaken into the bleaching of possum with regard to whiteness of final fur, damage occurring to fur and prevention of matting to fur. A process was supplied consisting of kill, mordant, oxidative bleach, strip and reductive bleach steps. This process produced fur with a loss of around 9. 5 % and <b>alkali</b> <b>solubility</b> of around 70 %. Improvements made to this process gave a loss of around 5 % and <b>alkali</b> <b>solubility</b> of around 50 %. The main alterations made to the process were (i) Changing the reducing agent and pH of the mordant and lengthening this stage. (ii) Altering the temperature, time and pH of the oxidative bleach. (iii) Shortening the strip stage (iv) Altering the reagent system of the reductive bleach The displacement bleaching system used was found to be successful in preventing matting of the fibre provided care is taken in transferring the wet fur for drying. The main difficulty encountered in scaling up the laboratory process was a compression of the fur during oxidative bleaching resulting in a build up of pressure and flow problems through the fur. This {{is due in part to}} the hollow nature of possum fibre which gives it a large degree of buoyancy and the swelling of the fibres during oxidative bleaching. Changes in the surface chemistry of the fibres occurring during oxidative bleaching are also thought to play some part since these problems are not encountered with fibre which has undergone a successful oxidative bleach. These problems were countered by using a shallower bed of fur for bleaching, reducing the flowrate through the fur and reducing the temperature of the oxidative bleach to give a more gradual bleach. These modifications allowed the successful bleaching of a 3. 5 kg batch of fur. A larger scale pilot plant for the bleaching of 15 kg batches was constructed. An attempted run on this plant using the conditions developed in the smaller plant was unsuccessful. It was specified that the lid on the top of the plant be clamped in place however this was not undertaken as a cost and time saving measure. This then came unstuck during bleaching leading to the overflow of the vessel. Further work is required to optimise the lower temperature oxidative bleach.

During the course of decay, the moisture content increased more rapidly in samples decayed by brown rot fungi than in samples decayed by white rot fungi. After an incubation time of seven days when, in many cases, the weight loss was negligible, there was already a substantial loss in strength.

40|$|The {{challenge}} for the civil engineering community {{in the near future}} will be to realize the building of structures in harmony with the concept of sustainable development, through the use of high performance materials which have low environmental impact and can be produced at reasonable cost. Geopolymers are novel binder materials that could provide a route towards this objective. Although research on geopolymer has advanced, most of the previous research conducted on geopolymers has dealt with pastes and concentrated on the material's chemistry and microstructure. There is little information available concerning the engineering and durability properties of geopolymer concrete and none considering the use of natural pozzolans for production of geopolymer concrete. This investigation has studied the potential of using five natural pozzolans from Iran as geopolymer precursors. Most of the raw materials contain zeolites and clay minerals and have a high loss on ignition. Therefore, trials were made where samples were calcined at 700, 800 and 900 °C. The solubility of both the raw and calcined materials in an alkaline solution was used as an indicator for pozzolanic activity. Improvements in pozzolanic properties due to heat treatment and elevated curing temperatures (20, 40, 60, and 80 °C) were studied by using <b>alkali</b> <b>solubility,</b> XRD and compressive strength tests. It has been found that geopolymer binders can be synthesized by activating natural pozzolans and condensing them with sodium silicate in a highly alkaline environment. A new model is presented which allows the prediction of the alkali activated pozzolan strength from information on their crystallinity, chemical compositions and <b>alkali</b> <b>solubility.</b> Two types of Iranian natural pozzolans, namely Taftan which can be activated without calcination and Shahindej which was calcined were selected for further activation to study the effect of the alkaline medium on the strength of the alkali-activated natural pozzolan. The effect of the type, form, and concentration (molarities = 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0 M) of the alkaline hydroxide, the modulus of sodium silicate (Si 02 INa 20 ratio = 2. 1, 2. 4, 3. 1) and different curing conditions on the geopolymerisation of the above two natural pozzolans were studied. The optimum range and contributions for each factor is suggested based on their effect on compressive strength. An optimum paste formulation has been developed for concrete mixing together with the procedure of addition of the raw materials to the reaction mixture and suitable curing methods for producing the geopolymer concrete derived from them. The properties of this geopolymer concrete in both the fresh and hardened states have been investigated in terms of setting time, workability, air content, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, static modulus of elasticity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and drying shrinkage. Studies related to durability such as gas permeability, chloride ion penetration, and sulphate resistance have been undertaken and compared to these for typical OPC concretes. Some problems were encountered in applying the standard concrete durability tests. In this study {{attempts have been made to}} determine the relationships between the different properties of geopolymer concrete with its compressive strength and compared to results for ope concrete, to help to explain the differences between alkali-activated natural pozzolan concrete and ope concrete.

No evidence of the influence of S 5 and intrinsic viscosity was observed at the range of the market pulp properties variation. The Brazilian pulps presented higher initial drainability and required lower PFI revolutions to the same level of refining in comparison to the international pulps. The initial average values of strength indexes: tensile, stretch, burst and tear were higher to the Brazilian pulps. However, this situation was changed at 25 ºSR and other levels of drainability.

Specifically, we used dilute <b>alkali</b> <b>solubility</b> (DAS; higher for brown rot) and lignin:density loss (L:D; higher for white rot) to infer rot type (binary) and fungal nutritional mode (gradient), respectively. We first determined strength of pattern among 29 fungi of known rot type by correlating DAS and L:D with mass loss in birch and pine. Having shown robust relationships for both techniques above a density loss threshold, we then demonstrated and resolved two issues relevant to species consortia and field trials, 1) spatial patchiness creating gravimetric bias (density bias), and 2) brown rot imprints prior or subsequent to white rot replacement (legacy effects). Finally, we field-tested our methods in a New Zealand Pinus radiata plantation in a paired-plot comparison. Overall, results validate these lowcost techniques that measure the collective histories of decomposer dominance in wood. The L:D measure also showed clear potential in classifying 'rot type' along a spectrum rather than as a traditional binary type (brown versus white rot), as it places the nutritional strategies of wood-degrading fungi on a scale (L:D= 0 - 5, in this case). These information-rich measures of consequence can provide insight into their biological causes, strengthening the links between traits, structure, and function during wood decomposition. Andrew W.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Protein {{solubility}} of Pacific whiting muscle with {{isoelectric point}} at pH 5. 5 was significantly affected by pH. The highest breaking force was measured from fish proteins treated at pH 11, while high deformation values were obtained at pH 2 and 11. Texture of gels made using the conventional method were quite inferior to gels made using fish proteins treated at pH 2 or 11, while color of conventional gels was {{significantly better than}} the other treatments. SDS-PAGE revealed that fish proteins were highly denatured during acid or alkali treatment. High cathepsin B-like activity was detected from acid-aided fish proteins. Strong cathepsin L-like activity was found in fish proteins treated at pH 10. 5, which corresponded with the lower breaking force and deformation obtained from those samples. Disulfide bonds contributed to high texture value in fish proteins treated at pH 11. Physicochemical characteristics of sarcoplasmic proteins (SP) from rockfish and their interaction with Alaska pollock surimi (myofibrillar proteins) were investigated. Solubility of SP was significantly suppressed at acidic pH (2 - 4) plus high salt concentration (0. 5 M NaCl). This was also supported by SDS-PAGE results (extensively degraded SP). DSC results revealed SP gave three endothermic transitions. The least amount ofproteins was lost when treated at pH 2 or 3 followed by precipitation at pH 5. 5. SP did not enhance the gelation properties of myofibrillar proteins, but positively contributed to gelation with myofibrillar proteins when compared to sucrose. Myofibrillar proteins were primary components contributing to heat-induced gelation. Salt effect on acid- or alkali-treated surimi gel was investigated. Good gels were obtained without salt using acid- and alkali-treated fish proteins. Their texture properties decreased as NaCl content increased, unlike conventional surimi gels. Consequently, NaCl did not solubilize myofibrillar proteins once the fish proteins were treated by acid or <b>alkali.</b> <b>Solubility</b> was apparently not a key factor for the texture properties of acid- or alkali-treated surimi. Transglutaminase-mediated setting reaction was partially inactivated during acid or alkaline treatment. Acid-treated surimi gel gave the best color properties...|$|E

Competition between distinctive groups of fungi determines {{the pattern of}} wood decomposition in forests, but the outcome of these battles may shift in a changing climate. With more than 70 % of Earth's biotic carbon stored in woody tissues, understanding the processes that unlock this carbon and release the greenhouse gas CO 2 is critical. For my thesis research, I am addressing several key questions about how fungi colonize and dominate wood on the forest floor. Quantitative PCR was developed to measure biomass of specific fungi from a community in Chapter one. This technique was coupled with ergosterol, dilute <b>alkali</b> <b>solubility,</b> pH and carbon component analysis to measure biotic and abiotic dynamic during wood decomposition. With these comprehensive tools, factors that may influence fungal competition and decomposition outcomes were studied in the following chapters. In Chapter two, wood type was shown not to influence the competition between a brown rot fungus and a white rot fungus. It {{is contrary to the}} observations on wood preferences in nature, but reflected different foraging strategies by fungi. This led to the study of Chapter three on priority effect. By increasing the inoculum potential either inside or outside wood substrate, I have shown evidence that a weak competitor fungus can outcompete its more aggressive opponents, thus achieving co-existence. Another two factors, temperature and endophytes, along with priority effect were studied in Chapter four. Endophytes showed a much larger effect in influencing wood decomposition than temperature, mostly through antagonisms against soil fungi. Studies on these factors reveals potential for a more comprehensive model for wood decomposition. Emphasis on the role of microbial components, especially the often neglected endophytic communities, is possible to explain the variability in wood decomposition that can not be explained by abiotic factors, alone...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to 1) develop a relatively quick staining procedure that would detect incipient decay by color differentiation under fluorescence, 2) quantitatively assess the amount of decay present with the use of an image analyzer, and 3) re/ate loss in strength at various decay levels to staining for the presence of decay. The fluorochrome stain acridine orange was used to stain nondecayed and decayed wood sections from end-grain wafers and small beams of Southern yellow pine (Pinus spp.) and Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco]. A. 02 % solution of acridine orange pH 6. 0 was best for Southern yellow pine; a pH 8. 0 was best for Douglas-fir. Staining the sections for two hours and washing them for 24 hours provided the best color differentiation between decayed and non-decayed areas. In wood with little or no weight loss (less than 3 %), the springwood cells appeared bright green under fluorescence with traces of yellow-orange. As weight loss increased, more yellow and orange became evident. The latewood and ray cells fluoresced a yellow-orange most of the time regardless of percent weight loss. The computer image analyzer detected the green and orange as different gray levels, the green registering a lighter shade than the orange. However, due to inherent anatomical features of wood and the dulling of fluorescence when a slide has been exposed to the illumination source {{for an extended period of}} time, this method is not practical. Modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR) and fiber stress at the proportional limit (FSPL) decreased significantly with increased weight loss. MOR was most affected sustaining a strength loss greater than 50 % with a 3 % weight loss in pine. Linear regression analyses of MOE and MOR vs. specific gravity indicated a relationship between these two variables and also a significant difference in the strength property means of the nondecayed and decayed samples. Percent strength loss (MOE and MOR) vs. percent weight loss was also regressed. The coefficient of determination (r²) for these regressions were low, with less than 50 % of the variability being accounted for by percent weight loss. <b>Alkali</b> <b>solubility</b> of pieces from end-matched beams was correlated with percent strength loss but less so than the correlations between strength and weight loss. Radial sections from the broken beams stained the bright green typical of non-decayed wood possibly due to irregularities in the brown rot decay pattern, but more likely because the areas of the beam sampled may not have contained decay. Cross sections near the failure have responded better...|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{development}} of the wood–based panel industry {{has been reported in}} recent literature. Major growth opportunities are expected to continue in particleboard market. The supply for wood which is so far the main raw material for particleboard has become problematic. Particleboard industry is intensifying efforts to find suitable substitutes for wood. In recent years effective utilization of thinning produce, wood and agricultural residues has gained increasing importance. Several attempts were made to mix different types of raw materials for making particleboard. Particleboard production is directly linked to some of the key issues of our times, namely; resources conservation, housing and the environment. This study investigated the effect of some conventional treatments on compatibility of cement and some wood and non-wood lignocellulosic materials. It also examined the effect of blending different proportions of the lignocellulosic materials on the properties of particleboards made using cement (inorganic binder) and Urea formaldehyde (organic binder). The three lignocellulosic materials used were Acacia nilotica sawdust, bagasse and cotton stalks. They are waste materials of widely cultivated species in Sudan. They were collected from EL Suki sawmill, EL Gunied sugar factory and the Fields of EL Kamlin state. Four experiments were carried out. The first was conducted to investigate the effect of six treatments {control (untreated material), control + 3 %CaCl 2, hot water extraction, Hot water extraction + 3 %CaCl 2, 1 %NaOH extraction, and 1 %NaOH extraction + 3 %CaCl 2 } on the hydration characteristics of the three lignocellulosic materials with cement. Two Dewar flasks and a digital thermocouple were used. The maximum hydration temperature, time to reach maximum temperature and rise in temperature above the ambient were determined for each lignocellulosic material. The most suitable treatment common to all materials was the 1 %NaOH+ 3 %CaCl 2. The average maximum hydration temperatures were 63. 87 °C, for bagasse, 67. 87 °C for cotton stalks and 67. 9 °C for sunt sawdust. Bagasse was the least responsive material to the treatments used, followed by cotton stalks and then sunt sawdust. In the second experiment, extractive contents, lignin content, hot water and weak <b>alkali</b> <b>solubility</b> of the three lignocellulosic materials were determined. The results of the above mentioned tests revaled that bagasse attained the highest results of hot water and 1 % NaOH extraction. The results were therefore consistent with the hydration characteristics observed. In the third experiment different mixtures and ratios were used to manufacture laboratory size cement bonded particle boards. Analysis of variance and Duncan Multiple Range Test were used to study the significance of the variations, if any. Reasonable panel properties were obtained from the three lignocellulosic materials either pure or mixed using different cement/wood ratios (3 : 1, 3. 5 : 1 and 4 : 1). In the fourth experiment ten different mixtures of the three lignocellulosic materials (Nine homogenous, One layered) of urea formaldehyde resin bonded particleboards were manufactured under the laboratory conditions. The minimum property requirements of commercial particleboard standards EN 312 : 2003 for MOR,MOE were met or exceeded at 10 % resin content level except for pure cotton stalks boards. Addition of bagasse particles to sunt sawdust or cotton stalks or to their mixtures improved the properties of boards made of their respective blend...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) can be {{depleted}} or regenerated by altering land management practices. Soil tests capable of reporting {{the size of}} dynamic SOM fractions may be useful for indicating the environmental cost of landuse and management practices. Information {{on the effect of}} land management practices on soil organic S content and turnover is scarce. This study evaluated the ability of a sequential chemical fractionation procedure to characterise changes in soil S and C organic fractions on a range of pasture and cropping soils with different management histories. The fractionation involved an initial extraction with ion exchange resins followed by dilute (0. 1 M NaOH) and concentrated (1 M NaOH) alkali. In addition, recently rhizodeposited 14 C (root+exudate derived) produced during a short-term (one week) 14 CO 2 pulse-labelling study of intact soil cores growing ryegrass/clover pastures, was used to trace the fate of root-derived C in both chemical and density fractionation procedures. In pasture and cropped topsoils, the major amounts of soil S and C were either extracted in 0. 1 M NaOH (49 - 69 % S and 38 - 48 % C) or remained in the alkali-insoluble residual fraction (17 - 38 % S and 46 - 53 % C). These two fractions were more sensitive to change caused by different landuse and management practices than the resin and 1 M NaOH fractions. With a large amount of dynamic soil C remaining in the residual fraction it was concluded that increasing strengths of alkali were not capable of sequentially fractionating S and C in SOM into decreasingly labile fractions. The chemical fractionation allocated recent root and root-released 14 C amongst all the fractions. Again, most root 14 C appeared in the 0. 1 M NaOH and residual fractions. Although small in amount, C of higher specific activity (more recently synthesised root C) was preferentially extracted by resin and 1 M NaOH extracts. Density separation was not capable of recovering recent root and root-released 14 C in a single fraction. Root-derived 14 C was distributed between light (mostly fibrous root debris) (42 %) and heavy (organics attached to clay and silt) (45 %) fractions. The dispersing reagent soluble fraction recovered < 13 % of the 14 C. An anaerobic incubation and various acids and oxidising agents were tried, in order to recover a greater proportion of root and root-released 14 C as a single identity. These were not very successful in either extracting or increasing the <b>alkali</b> <b>solubility</b> of the root C fraction. A 30 % H 2 O 2 pretreatment of soil plus roots, or hot 1 M HNO 3 treatment of the residual fraction, were more efficient extractants of the root C fraction and should be investigated further to check their ability to better characterise soil organic S and C fractions with a change in management practices. The 14 CO 2 pulse labelling study of pasture swards showed a greater allocation of recently photo-assimilated 14 C to the topsoil layer with a greater proportion of 14 C recovered in roots than in the soil. An in situ soil solution sampling technique with mini Rhizon Soil Moisture samplersTM effectively monitored the rapid appearance of a 14 CO 2 pulse in soil water at various depths. A comparison of the 14 CO 2 pulse labelling study under light and dark conditions indicated that, in the light lysimeters, 14 CO 2 photo-assimilation/translocation/rhizosphere respiration was the main pathway for CO 2 generation at various soil depths. In the dark lysimeters, 14 CO 2 diffusion was the main mechanism and 14 C assimilation (either photo-assimilation or assimilation by chemolithotrophs in rhizosphere soil) was small. The 14 CO 2 activity in soil water from four soil depths of dark and light soil cores, and a CO 2 diffusion model, were used to identify the 14 CO 2 contribution from rhizosphere respiration in the light lysimeters. A model was developed, but the unknown geometry of the air-filled pore space in the undisturbed soil cores made it impossible to precisely calculate the contribution made by root respiration to soil water 14 CO 2 activity...|$|E
