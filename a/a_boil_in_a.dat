40|$|On a rainy Sunday {{morning in}} a tough Miami {{neighborhood}} in the early 1970 s, seven-year-old Carl Hart was {{at home with his}} parents and five sisters. His mother was enjoying Al Green on the record player when, on an extension phone, she accidentally overheard Hart’s father talking to a lover. After heating maple syrup to <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pot, his mom strode into the bedroom and heaved it at him. Hart’s father chased her outside, wearing only his Fruit of the Loom underwear. Had he not slipped on the wet grass, he may well have killed her. Instead, the incident permanently ended a marriage long fraught with conflict. No drugs were involved in this episode. Indeed, crack cocaine didn’t hit the streets until almost a decade after this occurred.

All the {{flow patterns}} {{occurred in the}} test {{can be divided into}} three dominant regimes, i. e., stratified-wavy flow, intermittent flow and annular flow. Experimental data are plotted in two kinds of flow maps, i. e., Taitel and Dukler flow map and mass flux versus vapor quality flow map. The transitions between various flow regimes and the differences from that in smooth straight tube have also been discussed. Martinelli parameter can be used to indicate the transition from intermittent flow to annular flow. The transition from stratified-wavy flow to annular or intermittent flow is identified in the vapor quality versus mass flux flow map. The flow regime is always in stratified-wavy flow for a mass flux less than 100 kg/m 2 s. The two-phase frictional pressure drop characteristics in the test tube are also experimentally studied. The two-phase frictional multiplier data can be well correlated by Lockhart–Martinelli parameter.

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and mineral}} chemistry {{of gold and}} associated sulphides at Sheba, Fairview, and New Consort gold mines in the Barberton Greenstone Belt (BGB) identify two main types of mineralization. The first type occurs associated with sulphides (mainly pyrite), either as inclusions (10 – 30 μm) or as sub-microscopic gold. The second gold type consists of large gold grains (≥ 100 μm) within the silicates (mostly quartz). LA-ICP-MS studies reveal that some gold and associated sulphide grains contain high values of Cl, Br, Na, and I.

Halides would combine with the copper (II) oxide formed from heating the wire and produce a green gas.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study carried out with R- 134 <b>a</b> during flow <b>boiling</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> horizontal tube of 2. 6 mm ID. The experimental tests included (i) heat fluxes in the range from 10 to 100 kW/m 2, (ii) the refrigerant mass velocities set to the discrete values in the range of 240 – 930 kg/(m 2 s) and (iii) saturation temperature of 12 and 22 °C. The study analyzed the heat transfer, through the local heat transfer coefficient along of flow, and pressure drop, under the variation of these different parameters. It was possible to observe the significant influence of heat flux in the heat transfer coefficient and mass velocity in the pressure drop, besides the effects of saturation temperature. In the low quality region, it was possible to observe a significant influence of heat flux on the heat transfer coefficient. In the high vapor quality region, for high mass velocities, this influence tended to vanish, and the coefficient decreased. The influence of mass velocity in the heat transfer coefficient was detected in most tests for a threshold value of vapor quality, which was higher as the heat flux increased. For higher heat flux the heat transfer coefficient was nearly independent of mass velocity. The frictional pressure drop increased with the increase in vapor quality and mass velocity. Predictive models for heat transfer coefficient in mini channels were evaluated and the calculated coefficient agreed well with measured data within a range 35 % for saturation temperature of 22 °C. These results extend the ranges of heat fluxes and mass velocities beyond values available in literature, and add a substantial contribution to the comprehension of boiling heat transfer phenomena inside mini channels...|$|R
