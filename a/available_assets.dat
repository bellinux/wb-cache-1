5|$|The {{occupation}} of continental Europe and the Scandinavian North Sea coastline now meant tracking U-boats and enemy warships making for the Atlantic was now more difficult with the thin resource pool <b>available.</b> <b>Assets</b> were needed for reconnaissance, air support for Sunderlands {{operating in the}} Atlantic approaches, and anti-invasion patrol. However, any shipping of mainland Europe {{was likely to be}} hostile, which presented plenty of targets. No. 18 Group RAF continued offensive operations further north against German shipping near Norway. Its first success being the 'torching' of a German freighter near Kristiansund on 22 June by a No. 220 Squadron crew. Priority was anti-invasion operations. With the Battle of Britain underway, the Command was ordered to disrupt German preparations for Operation Sea Lion. In this respect, former RAF-Army co-operation squadrons, No. 53 and 59, were handed to Coastal Command in July 1940 for these tasks. No. 254 Squadron was supplemented with No. 21 and 57 Squadron, Bomber Command, in attacking shipping off the Norwegian coast, as result of alerts that suggested a German amphibious assault from there.|$|E

Furthermore the sum of expected utilities of local and foreign investors will be lower than the one achieved without information asymmetries.

In this problem each <b>available</b> <b>asset</b> is judiciously selected in such a way that the total profit is maximized while simultaneously minimizing the total risk.

We use simple arguments to show that this behavior is perhaps less naive than it at first appears. It is well known that the optimal portfolio weights in a mean-variance setting are extremely sensitive to estimation errors, especially those in the expected returns. We show that when we account for estimation error the 1 /n rule has some advantages in terms of robustness and we demonstrate this with numerical experiments...|$|R
40|$|Superannuation fund {{investment}} arrangements {{have become}} increasingly complex {{over the past two}} decades due, inter alia, to the growth in sector specialist investment management and the increase in the number of <b>available</b> <b>asset</b> classes and sector products. At the same time, corporate resources devoted to superannuation issues have reduced due to a greater focus on core business activity and reducing costs. These factors, together with a failure of superannuation funds, on average, to capture the full advantages of sector specialisation, have driven the growth of implemented consulting, i. e., the sensible outsourcing of the specialist aspects of implementing these complex investment arrangements. This paper covers these trends in the superannuation industry and how investment arrangements can be effectively implemented using a manager-of-managers approach. ...|$|R
