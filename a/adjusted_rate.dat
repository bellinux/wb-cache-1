40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the hospitalization rates and outcomes of endocarditis among older adults. BackgroundEndocarditis is the most serious cardiovascular infection and is especially common among older adults. Little is known about recent trends for endocarditis hospitalizations and outcomes. MethodsUsing Medicare inpatient Standard Analytic Files, we identified all fee-for-service beneficiaries age ≥ 65 years with a principal or secondary diagnosis of endocarditis from 1999 to 2010. We used Medicare Denominator Files to report hospitalizations per 100, 000 person-years. Rates of 30 -day and 1 -year mortality were calculated using Vital Status Files. We used mixed-effects models to calculate <b>adjusted</b> <b>rates</b> of hospitalization and mortality and to compare the results before and after 2007, when the American Heart Association revised their recommendations for endocarditis prophylaxis. ResultsOverall, 262, 658 beneficiaries were hospitalized with endocarditis. The <b>adjusted</b> hospitalization <b>rate</b> increased from 1999 to 2005, reaching 83. 5 per 100, 000 person-years in 2005, and declined during 2006 to 2007. After 2007, the decline continued, reaching 70. 6 per 100, 000 person-years in 2010. Adjusted 30 -day and 1 -year mortality rates ranged from 14. 2 % to 16. 5 % and from 32. 6 % to 36. 2 %, respectively. There were no consistent changes in <b>adjusted</b> <b>rates</b> of 30 -day and 1 -year mortality after 2007. Trends in rates of hospitalization and outcomes were consistent across demographic subgroups. <b>Adjusted</b> <b>rates</b> of hospitalization and mortality declined consistently in the subgroup with a principal diagnosis of endocarditis. ConclusionsOur study highlights the high burden of endocarditis among older adults. We did not observe an increase in <b>adjusted</b> <b>rates</b> of hospitalization or mortality associated with endocarditis after publication of the 2007 guidelines...|$|R

50|$|The Seasonally <b>Adjusted</b> Annual <b>Rate</b> (SAAR) is a <b>rate</b> that is <b>adjusted</b> to {{take into}} account {{fluctuations}} of values in the data which might occur due to seasonality.

40|$|Maps are {{frequently}} used to display spatial distributions of parameters of interest, {{such as cancer}} rates or average pollutant concentrations by county. It {{is well known that}} plotting observed rates can have serious drawbacks when sample sizes vary by area, since very high (and low) observed rates are found disproportionately in poorly-sampled areas. Unfortunately, <b>adjusting</b> the observed <b>rates</b> to account for the e ects of small-sample noise can introduce an opposite e ect, in which the highest <b>adjusted</b> <b>rates</b> tend to be found disproportionately in well-sampled areas. In either case, the maps can be di cult to interpret because the display of spatial variation in the underlying parameters of interest is confounded with spatial variation in sample sizes. As a result, spatial patterns occur in <b>adjusted</b> <b>rates</b> even if there is no spatial structure in the underlying parameters of interest, and <b>adjusted</b> <b>rates</b> tend to look too uniform in areas with little data. We introduce two models (normal and Poisson) in which parameters of interest have no spatial patterns, and demonstrate the existence of spatial artefacts in inference from these models. We also discuss spatial models {{and the extent to which}} they are subject to the same artefacts. We present examples from Bayesian modelling, but, as we explain, the artefacts occur generally.

5000|$|For {{convertible}} bonds (CBs) {{the approach of}} Tsiveriotis and Fernandes (1998) is to divide {{the value of the}} bond at each node into an [...] "equity" [...] component, arising from situations where the CB will be converted, and a [...] "debt" [...] component, arising from situations where CB is redeemed. Correspondingly, twin trees are constructed where discounting is at the risk free and credit risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>rate</b> respectively, with the sum being the value of the CB. There are other methods, which similarly combine an equity-type tree with a short-rate tree. [...] An alternate approach, originally published by Goldman Sachs (1994), does not decouple the components, rather, discounting is at a conversion-probability-weighted risk-free and risky interest rate within a single tree.

The prize was established in 2013 by Eve Lewellis Lebowitz in honor of her late husband, Martin R. Lebowitz, to provide a significant, tangible recognition for excellence in philosophical thought. The Symposium program consists of a pair of lectures to be delivered at an annual APA division meeting and a Phi Beta Kappa event.

The rate of rebound was significantly higher in those taking nelfinavir than in those taking efavirenz, both in patients who were naive pre-HAART and those who were NRTI experienced [adjusted rate ratios, 2. 83 (95 % CI, 1. 51 - 5. 31) and 2. 86 (95 %, CI, 1. 65 - 5. 00), respectively]. Among patients who were naive pre-HAART, those on abacavir had no evidence of a raised risk of viral rebound (<b>adjusted</b> <b>rate</b> ratio 1. 17; 95 % CI, 0. 51 - 2. 69), but in those with pre-HAART NRTI experience the rate was markedly raised (<b>adjusted</b> <b>rate</b> ratio, 4. 48; 95 % CI, 2. 51 - 8. 00). A similar picture was seen when comparing those on nevirapine with those on efavirenz, although the elevated rate ratio in pre-HAART experienced patients was of lower magnitude (<b>adjusted</b> <b>rate</b> ratio, 1. 93).
