These officers, known as zhongshi (中使; [...] "central emissaries"), abused their power by forcing the regional officials, who were afraid of them, to give them bribes.

This paper presents a monetary search model where durable assets {{can serve as a}} guarantee to repay consumption loans. In our economy, consumers can obtain loans from banks using their durable capital assets as collateral. In case repayment doesn’t happen the bank can seize the <b>amount</b> <b>committed</b> as collateral. We prove the existence, uniqueness and we characterize steady state monetary equilibria with collateralized bank credit. We show that collateralized credit can be an important channel through which monetary factors can affect real variables, and that the effect of monetary growth on capital accumulation depends critically on the relative risk aversion of agents and the relative scarcity of durable capital goods in the economy. ...|$|E

40|$|Fast-changing {{market demand}} and short {{product life cycle}} have been {{enforcing}} companies in a supply chain to respond to customers ’ needs as quickly as possible. Among many coordination mechanisms upon which the upstream and the downstream companies collaborate for better service, inventory management {{is one of the}} most important concerns. While many firms are still seeking a better inventory management in the competitive market, this paper develops an ordering decision support model to enhance the operations efficiency. A double sourcing model is constructed which considers the scenario of a major vendor and an emergent vendor versus a retailer. Through a two-period dynamic programming formulation and simulations based on design of experiments, we analyzed the effects of factors such as backup ratio, penalty cost, purchasing cost ratio, and demand correlation coefficient on retailer’s ordering policy and expected profit. Results show that the emergent vendor has more contributions to retailers if the backup ratio or penalty cost is larger. The <b>amount</b> <b>committed</b> to the major vendor by retailers decreases when an emergent vendor is available. However, the retailer’s total ordering quantity may increase or decrease, depending on the purchasing cost ratio and the penalty cost. Key Words: sourcing strategy, supply chain management, dynamic programmin...|$|E
40|$|Background: Three major {{international}} agreements signed in 2015 are key milestones for transitioning to more sustainable and resilient societies: the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction; and the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Together, these agreements underscore the critical importance {{of understanding and}} managing the health risks of global changes, to ensure continued population health improvements {{in the face of}} significant social and environmental change over this century. Body: Funding priorities of major health institutions and organizations in the U. S. and Europe do not match research investments with needs to inform implementation of these international agreements. In the U. S., the National Institutes of Health commit 0. 025  % of their annual research budget to climate change and health. The European Union Seventh Framework Programme committed 0. 08  % of the total budget to climate change and health; the <b>amount</b> <b>committed</b> under Horizon 2020 was 0. 04  % of the budget. Two issues apparently contributing to this mismatch are viewing climate change primarily as an environmental problem, and therefore the responsibility of other research streams; and narrowly framing research into managing the health risks of climate variability and change from the perspective of medicine and traditional public health. This reductionist, top-down perspective focuses on proximate, individual level risk factors. While highly successful in reducing disease burdens, this framing is insufficient to protect health and well-being over a century that will be characterized by profound social and environmental changes. Conclusions: International commitments in 2015 underscored the significant challenges societies will face this century from climate change and other global changes. However, the low priority placed on understanding and managing the associated health risks by national and international research institutions and organizations leaves populations poorly prepared to cope with changing health burdens. Risk-centered, systems approaches can facilitate understanding of the complex interactions and dependencies across environmental, social, and human systems. This understanding is needed to formulate effective interventions targeting socio-environmental factors that are as important for determining health burdens as are individual risk factors...|$|E

The program's budget remained quite low until the late 1970s, when Japan came under increasing pressure from other industrial countries to play a larger role. During the 1980s, Japan's foreign aid budget grew quickly, despite the budget constraints imposed by the effort to reduce the fiscal deficit. From 1984 to 1991, the Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget increased at an average annual rate of 22.5%, reaching US$11.1 billion by 1991.

40|$|Checkpointing-and-Communication Library (CCL) is a {{recently}} developed software which implements CPU offloaded, non-blocking checkpointing functionalities {{in support of}} optimistic parallel simulation on myrinet clusters. This is achieved by exploiting data transfer capabilities provided by a programmable DMA engine on board of myrinet network cards. Re-synchronization between CPU and DMA activities must sometimes be employed for several reasons, such as the maintenance of data consistency, thus adding overhead to (otherwise CPU cost-free) non-blocking checkpoint operations. In this paper we present a detailed cost model for non-blocking checkpointing and derive a performance effective re-synchronization semantic which we call minimum cost re-synchronization. With this semantic, an occurrence of re-synchronization either commits an on-going DMA based checkpoint operation (causing suspension of CPU activities) or aborts the operation (with possible increase in the expected rollback cost due to a reduced <b>amount</b> of <b>committed</b> checkpoints) {{on the basis of}} a minimum overhead expectation evaluated through the cost model...|$|R

During the four quarters immediately following Lehman's collapse, firms that lost access to a credit line cut their investment spending significantly while simultaneously hoarding more cash than comparable firms.

50|$|Just {{before the}} expiry of the guarantee, the covered banks faced a huge set of bond {{repayments}} - {{a result of}} most lenders only lending to the covered banks within {{the period of the}} original blanket guarantee - which resulted in a rapid and massive resort to ECB financing.

These proved in the long run to be the two most expensive banks to recapitalise, with Anglo accounting for €34.7 billion and AIB €20.7 billion of the bank bailout total of €62.8 billion (55% and 33% respectively). Much (€46.3 billion, or 74%) of the bank bailout was in fact completed by October 2010, but at the time the extent of any further recapitalisations were not known, and the nationalisations committed the government either to go on to cover whatever was needed or face the failure of the banks despite the <b>amount</b> already <b>committed.</b>|$|R
