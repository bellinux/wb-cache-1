30|$|Xylan {{is a major}} {{component}} of hemicellulose of forest and agricultural materials such as hardwood, grain straw, corn cobs and grasses (Dekker <b>and</b> <b>Richards</b> 1976; Wilkie 1979).

Xylan is generally insoluble in nature; however, a number of microorganisms with the help of some of their enzymes can readily solubilize xylan.
