5|$|Alioramus were bipedal {{like all}} known theropods, and their sharp teeth {{indicate}} that they were carnivores. Known specimens were smaller than other tyrannosaurids like Tarbosaurus bataar and Tyrannosaurus rex, but their adult size is difficult to estimate since both Alioramus species are known only from juvenile or sub-adult remains. The recent discovery of Qianzhousaurus indicates that it belongs to a distinct branch of tyrannosaur. The genus Alioramus {{is characterized by a}} row of five bony crests <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout, a greater number of teeth than any other genus of tyrannosaurid, and a lower skull than other tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} {{begun with}} reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the nasals. In colubrids, the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale. The outer nasal (near the snout) is called the prenasal while the inner nasal (near the eye) is called the postnasal. <b>Along</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of the snout called the rostral scale.|$|E

5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloth {{is evidence that the}} frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us {{to see some of the}} colours as they would have originally appeared.|$|E
5|$|The first castle {{built on}} the site was {{probably}} of an octagonal design, running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge, protected by square and semi-circular mural towers, with a barbican guarding the eastern entrance. It probably resembled White Castle, remodelled by de Burgh in the same period, or Bolingbroke and Beeston Castles, both built in the 1220s. The castle was built of Kentish ragstone and cemented by a mortar containing {{a large proportion of}} seashells, particularly cockleshells from the cockle beds of neighbouring Canvey Island. A valuable tidal watermill had been built by 1249, essential for making bread for the castle; recent archaeological work suggests that it was positioned on a wharf reaching out into the estuary just to the south-east of the castle. Terraced gardens were built along {{the south side of the}} castle overlooking the estuary, probably including vineyards.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{emerge as}} {{branches of the}} left and right subclavian arteries. They travel upward through transverse foramina – spaces in the cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, one on the left and one on the right of the medulla. They give off one of the three cerebellar branches. The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cerebellar tentorium, where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.|$|E

5|$|The main {{veins and}} the crossveins form the wing venation pattern. The venation {{patterns}} {{are different in}} different species. There may be very numerous crossveins or rather few. The Australian Flatwing Damselfly's wings {{are one of the}} few veins patterns. The venation pattern is useful for species identification. Almost all Anisoptera settle with the wings held out sideways or slightly downward, however most Zygoptera settle with the wings held together, dorsal surfaces apposed. The thorax of Zygoptera is so oblique that when held in this way the wings fit neatly <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abdomen. They do not appear to be held straight up as in butterflies or mayflies. In a few zygopteran families the wings are held horizontally at rest, and in one anisopteran genus (e.g. Cordulephya, Corduliidae) the wings are held in the typical damselfly resting position. Adult species possess two pairs of equal or subequal wings. There appear to be only five main vein stems. A nodus is formed where the second main vein (subcosta) meets the leading edge of the wing. In most families a conspicuous pterostigma is carried near the wing tip. Identification as Odonata can be based on the venation. The only likely confusion is with some lacewings (order Neuroptera) which have many crossveins in the wings. Until the early years of the 20th century Odonata were often regarded as being related to lacewings and were given the ordinal name Paraneuroptera, but any resemblance between these two orders is entirely superficial. In Anisoptera the hindwing is broader than the forewing and in both wings a crossvein divides the discoidal cell into a Triangle and Supertriangle.|$|E
