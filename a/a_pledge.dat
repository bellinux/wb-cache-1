McConnell signed the pledge, but Bevin did not. All Republican members of Kentucky's congressional caucus joined McConnell in signing the pledge except 4th District congressman Thomas Massie, a legislator aligned with the Tea Party.|$|E
5|$|Congress further {{weakened}} the acts in 1894 by removing a provision against conspiracy. In 1877, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes {{was elected president}} after a highly contested election, receiving support from three Southern states in exchange for <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> to allow white Democratic governments to rule without federal interference. As president, he refused to enforce federal civil rights protections, allowing states to begin to implement racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws.

5|$|In Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism, Zwingli {{outlined}} his {{disagreements with}} both the Catholic and the Anabaptist positions. He accused the Anabaptists of adding to the word of God and noted {{that there is no}} law forbidding infant baptism. He challenged Catholics by denying that the water of baptism can have the power to wash away sin. Zwingli understood baptism to be <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> or a promise, but he disputed the Anabaptist position that it is <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> to live without sin, noting that such <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> brings back the hypocrisy of legalism. He argued against their view that those that received the Spirit and were able to live without sin were the only persons qualified to partake in baptism. At the same time he asserted that rebaptism had no support in scripture. The Anabaptists raised the objection that Christ did not baptise children, and so Christians, likewise, should not baptise their children. Zwingli responded by noting that kind of argument would imply women should not participate in communion because there were no women at the last supper. Although there was no commandment to baptise children specifically, the need for baptism was clearly stated in scripture. In a separate discussion on original sin, Zwingli denies original guilt. He refers to I Corinthians 7:12–14 which states that the children of one Christian parent are holy and thus they are counted among the sons of God. Infants should be baptised because there is only one church and one baptism, not a partial church and partial baptism.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad {{also sent}} Khalid on an {{expedition}} to Dumatul Jandal, to attack the Christian Prince Ukaydir {{who lived in a}} castle there. This took place in March 631 AD, 9AH,11th month of the Islamic Calendar. In this campaign, Khaled took the Prince hostage and threatened to kill him until the door of the castle was opened. Muhammad then later ransomed him in exchange for 2000 camels, 800 sheep, 400 sets of armour, 400 lances, and <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> to pay Jizyah.|$|E

5|$|Pyrrhus {{attempted}} to goad Antigonus into fighting a pitched battle {{on the plain}} in front of Argos but the Macedonian king was unmoved. The Argives sent ambassadors to both kings, beseeching them to respect the city's neutrality. Antigonus agreed to the Argives' terms and gave his son as a hostage in order to demonstrate his sincerity. While Pyrrhus agreed to retreat from Argos, he failed to give <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> {{and as a result}} was regarded with suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Romney opposed {{same-sex}} marriage and civil unions, although he favored domestic partnership legislation that gives certain legal rights to same-sex couples, such as hospital visitation.

5|$|The Air Force {{changed the}} program to full weapon {{development}} and awarded a contract for an XB-70 prototype and 11 YB-70s in August 1960. In November 1960, the B-70 program received a $265million appropriation from Congress for FY 1961. Nixon, trailing {{in his home state}} of California, also publicly endorsed the B-70, and on 30 October Eisenhower helped the Republican campaign with <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> of an additional $155million for the B-70 development program.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is an attempt to}} answer the {{following}} questions: firstly, is the <b>pledge</b> <b>an</b> available and favourable form o f securing receivables related to agricultural production due from a debtor who is an agricultural producer, and, secondly, is the <b>pledge</b> <b>an</b> effective measure of obtaining the benefit for the creditor. Three types of pledges have been analysed: <b>an</b> ordinary <b>pledge</b> regulated by articles 306 - 335 of the civil code, <b>a</b> registered <b>pledge</b> and <b>a</b> statutory <b>pledge</b> related to the agricultural lease (article 701 civil code). The paper presents different issues related to the pledge, including the <b>pledge</b> being <b>a</b> subject and object o f the transaction, and the recovery o f the benefit secured by the pledge. The paper ends with a conclusion that from the point o f view o f both: the pledgor and the pledgee, <b>a</b> registered <b>pledge</b> is undoubtedly <b>a</b> much more advantageous and desirable form of securing receivables than <b>an</b> ordinary <b>pledge.</b> Consequently, postulates requesting modifications of some existing regulations concerning registered pledge act seem to be fully justifiable...|$|R

5|$|Although the Paris Peace Accords of 1973 were {{supposed}} {{to end the war}} in Vietnam, fighting continued between South Vietnam and North Vietnam and the Viet Cong. Despite <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> of support from U.S. President Richard Nixon, military aid to South Vietnam was sharply reduced. By the end of 1972 the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was the fourth largest air force in the world, with 2,075 aircraft and over 61,000 personnel. However, Republic of Vietnam Air Force operations were severely affected by cutbacks in military aid, flying hours had to be reduced by 51% and bomb loads on fighter aircraft halved from four to two pieces of ordnance.|$|E
5|$|Following further {{speculation}} {{over her}} leadership, on 26 June a rumour emerged that supporters of Kevin Rudd were collecting signatures for a letter demanding an immediate leadership vote. That afternoon, before any letter had been published, Gillard called a leadership spill live on television. She challenged any would-be opponent {{to join her}} in <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> that, while the winner would become leader, the loser would immediately retire from politics. Despite his earlier comments {{that he would not}} return to the leadership under any circumstances, Kevin Rudd announced that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost. In the party-room ballot later that evening, Rudd defeated Gillard by a margin of 57 votes to 45.|$|E
5|$|In early 1947, France, Britain and the United States unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to reach an}} agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets. In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union. Under the plan, which President Harry S. Truman signed on 3 April 1948, the US government gave to Western European countries over $13 billion (equivalent to $189.39 billion in 2016) to rebuild the economy of Europe. Later, the program {{led to the creation of}} the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.|$|E

50|$|Twenty-one {{states do}} not have laws {{compelling}} their electors to vote for <b>a</b> <b>pledged</b> candidate. Twenty-nine states plus the District of Columbia have laws to penalize faithless electors, although these have never been enforced. In lieu of penalizing a faithless elector, some states, such as Michigan and Minnesota, specify the faithless elector's vote is void. Minnesota invoked this law {{for the first time}} in 2016 when <b>an</b> elector <b>pledged</b> to Hillary Clinton attempted to vote for Bernie Sanders instead.|$|R
5|$|Lord Grey's first {{announcement}} as Prime Minister was <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> {{to carry}} out parliamentary reform. On 1 March 1831, Lord John Russell brought forward the Reform Bill in the House of Commons on the government's behalf. The bill disfranchised 60 of the smallest boroughs, and reduced the representation of 47 others. Some seats were completely abolished, while others were redistributed to the London suburbs, to large cities, to the counties, and to Scotland and Ireland. Furthermore, the bill standardised and expanded the borough franchise, increasing {{the size of the}} electorate (according to one estimate) by half a million voters.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{had served}} almost {{three and a}} half years of McKinley's term. On the night of his own {{election}} in 1904, Roosevelt publicly declared he would not run for re-election in 1908, <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> he quickly regretted. But he felt bound by his word. Roosevelt believed Taft was his logical successor, although the War Secretary was initially reluctant to run. Roosevelt used his control of the party machinery to aid his heir apparent. On pain of loss of their jobs, political appointees were required to support Taft or remain silent.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} duel with Chambers, Rowan moved to Frankfort, Kentucky, the state capital. In 1802, {{he was one}} of 32 men who signed <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> to bring James Madison to Transylvania University as superintendent. This action began a long {{relationship}} between Rowan and Transylvania, and the university presented him with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1823. Governor Christopher Greenup appointed Rowan Secretary of State in 1804. He served until 1806, when {{he was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives. He represented Kentucky's Third District (which included Bardstown) during the Tenth Congress from March 4, 1807 to March 3, 1809, even though he did not reside in that district at the time.|$|E
