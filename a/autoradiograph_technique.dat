5000|$|In 1939 Howard married Patrick William Rolleston {{and took}} up a Finney-Howell Research Fellowship at McGill. She was {{demonstrator}} in Genetics at McGill into 1940 and [...] "in {{the course of this}} work she discovered a new murine mutation." [...] In 1940, her first son, Francis, was born, followed by a second son, Patrick, in 1942. After World War II, she moved with her husband and children to England. However, her husband died in 1947 and her colleague Jack Boag would later note that she [...] "had to find work which would allow her freedom to bring up her two young sons." [...] At the same time, Louis Harold Gray was looking for a cytologist to work in his radiobiology team at the UK Medical Research Council's Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at Hammersmith Hospital. By [...] "fortunate chance he was introduced to Dr. Howard and flexible working arrangements were readily agreed." [...] On a preliminary visit to the Radiotherapeutic Research Unit, she met physicist Stephen Pelc who had developed a variant <b>autoradiograph</b> <b>technique</b> and [...] "was much interested in his use of radioactive iodine for the autoradiography of rat thyroid slices." ...|$|E
40|$|We have {{validated}} {{a quantitative}} 'in-situ' hybridization method and computer-assisted image analysis of <b>autoradiographs</b> as a <b>technique</b> for measuring atrial-natriuretic-factor (ANF) mRNA in tissue sections of rat heart by: (i) producing radioactive standards to calibrate the autoradiograms and (ii) assessing: (a) specificity (through RNAase A background subtraction, comparison of ANF mRNA and non-ANF mRNA probe binding to sections, Northern analysis and section-thickness titration curves); (b) sensitivity (by calculating {{the limit of}} detection for ventricular levels of ANF mRNA); (c) precision [inter-assay CV (coefficient of variation) less than 10 %; intra-assay CV 6 - 7 %]; and (d) accuracy. We have found with this technique that deoxycortone and saline treatment of rats elevates ANF mRNA to a larger extent in the ventricles than in the atria and that, in neonatal-rat hearts, ANF mRNA is elevated in all cardiac chambers relative to adult levels...|$|R
40|$|Levels of poly(A) + RNA {{have been}} {{investigated}} at each stage of male meiosis in Lilium (var. Firecracker). Two methods were employed in this work: in one extracts from labelled meiocytes were passed through oligo(dT) columns, while in the other the specific probe [3 H]poly(U) was hybridized in situ with resin-embedded sections of pollen mother cells. The label contained in the eluate from the oligo(dT) columns was measured by liquid scintillation, and the quantity of [3 H]-poly(U) hybridized was determined by statistical analysis of light microscopic <b>autoradiographs.</b> Both <b>techniques</b> revealed a dramatic decline in detectable poly(A) + RNA during prophase. Lowest levels are reached in the pachytene stage, following which a gradual restoration of this species of RNA takes place in both nucleus and cytoplasm. The data presented here provide no clear indication as to whether this fall in RNA levels {{is caused by the}} action of novel enzymes specific to the meiotic prophase, by a cessation of synthesis and the activity of normal turnover processes, or by a combination of the two. Although there is some evidence from the [3 H]poly(U) hybridization study that a small peak of poly(A) + RNA synthesis may take place in leptotene, both methods indicate that there is a very low of poly(A) + RNA synthesis throughout prophase. The presence of poly(A) + RNA was not detected in either the accessory nucleoli or the cytoplasmic nucleoloids that characterize the nucleus and cytoplasm of these cells. These events are considered in terms of the juncture at which they occur in the plant life-cycle...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that under the {{influence}} of progesterone the concentrations of radioiodide in the uterus and oviduct of the rat are main-tained at levels higher than that in the plasma. In the present experiments the uterus and oviducts from rats killed 2 h after the injection of Na 125 I were <b>autoradiographed</b> by a <b>technique</b> which permits the localization of diffusible radioactive material. In intact non-pregnant rats and ovari-ectomized rats not injected with progesterone, uniformly low grain densities were observed over sections of oviduct and uterus {{with the exception of the}} epithelium and lumen of the oviduct where some increase in grain density was observed. In intact and ovariectomized rats treated with progesterone and in rats killed on Day 3 or 4 of pregnancy, grain densities over the epi-thelium and lumen of the oviduct were very high but the fimbria of the oviduct were consistently unlabelled. The stroma underlying the oviduct epithelium was also labelled. In the uteri of these animals the principal site of concentration of radioiodide was the luminal epithelium, but for technical reasons it was not possible to exclude the stroma immediately adjacent to the luminal epithelium as a less active site of concentration of iodide. No other site in the uterus concentrated radioiodide. The luminal epithelium occupies less than 3 % of the volume of the uterus in ovariectomized rats: if this tissue is taken as the sole site of iodide concentration in the uterus, the levels reached in these cells must be at least a hundred times that of the plasma when the overall uterus: plasma concentration ratio for radioiodide is 4 or more...|$|R
