5|$|The female Bohemian waxwing is {{very similar}} to the male, but has a {{narrower}} yellow terminal band to the tail, a less defined lower edge to the black throat and slightly less distinctive wing markings. Juveniles are duller than adults, with whiter underparts, only a few red wing tips, no black on the throat and a smaller black face mask. Compared to the nominate subspecies, eastern B. g. centralasiae is paler, greyer and has little reddish-brown behind the bill. The American subspecies B. g. pallidiceps has more colouring on the cheeks <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> at postmortem, but the levels were {{consistent}} with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The makeup for the Trill host {{featured}} a separate nose <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> pieces, as the {{intention was to}} retain the general look of a human. Air bladders were placed inside a fake abdomen to create the shot in which the symbiont appeared to move under the host's skin. A second fake abdomen was created for the surgery scene in which the symbiont is moved into Riker, which worked by having a crew member lie under the surgery table, pulling the symbiont into the opening using a concealed string. The design of the symbiont {{was based on a}} caterpillar with an octopus for a head, which {{featured a}} further air bladder in order to give the appearance that it was pulsating and painted in fluorescent paint to glow when a black light was shone on it during that scene.|$|E

25|$|Modern humans {{commonly}} have a steep, even vertical forehead whereas {{their predecessors}} had foreheads that sloped strongly backwards.

25|$|Rosacea is a {{long-term}} skin condition that typically affects the face. It results in redness, pimples, swelling, and small and superficial dilated blood vessels. Often the nose, cheeks, <b>and</b> <b>forehead,</b> and chin are most involved. A red enlarged nose may occur in severe disease, a condition known as rhinophyma.|$|E
25|$|These mites {{are found}} in human hair follicles, {{normally}} found in greater numbers around the cheeks, nose, eyebrows, eyelashes, <b>and</b> <b>forehead.</b> They could {{also be found in}} other parts of the body such as arms, chest, and ears. It is a species of tiny mites that have been thought to contribute to hair loss (though this hypothesis is under debate) and lives in pores and hair follicles.|$|E

25|$|A 1985 {{study by}} McLeod and Sitaram in humans {{reported}} that bufotenine administered intranasally at {{a dose of}} 1–16mg had no effect, other than intense local irritation. When given intravenously at low doses (2–4mg), bufotenine oxalate caused anxiety but no other effects; however, a dose of 8mg resulted in profound emotional and perceptual changes, involving extreme anxiety, a sense of imminent death, and visual disturbance associated with color reversal and distortion, and intense flushing of the cheeks <b>and</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
25|$|Severe GH {{deficiency}} {{in early childhood}} also results in slower muscular development, so that gross motor milestones such as standing, walking, and jumping may be delayed. Body composition (i.e., the relative amounts of bone, muscle, and fat) is affected in many children with severe deficiency, so that mild to moderate chubbiness is common (though GH deficiency alone rarely causes severe obesity). Some severely GH-deficient children have recognizable, cherubic facial features characterized by maxillary hypoplasia <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> prominence (said to resemble a kewpie doll).|$|E
25|$|The {{fourth quarter}} saw Tampa Bay's hope fizzle. Two touchdowns by the Chargers, and a Garcia {{interception}} saw the Buccaneers trailing 34–24 with time running out. With less than 7 minutes to go, Garcia found himself scrambling again, {{this time for}} a 7-yard first down run. Quentin Jammer slammed into Garcia's helmet, and Garcia began to bleed visibly from him nose <b>and</b> <b>forehead.</b> Driving across midfield with just over 3 minutes to go, Garcia was intercepted by Antoine Cason, who returned the ball 59 yards for the game-icing touchdown.|$|E

25|$|The European jackal is {{the largest}} of the golden jackals, with animals of both sexes {{measuring}} 120–125cm (47–49in) in total length and 10–13kg (20–29lb) in body weight. One adult male in North-Eastern Italy is recorded to have reached 14.9kg (33lb). The fur is coarse, and is generally brightly coloured with blackish tones on the back. The thighs, upper legs, ears <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> are bright reddish chestnut. Jackals in Northern Dalmatia have broader than average skulls, which is thought to result from human induced isolation from other populations, thus resulting in a new morphotype.|$|E
25|$|The alcephine bovids (wildebeests, hartebeests, hirola, bontebok, blesbok, {{and several}} similar species) have preorbital glands which secrete complex {{mixtures}} of chemical compounds. The preorbital glands of the bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus pygarus) are larger in males than in females. Their secretions contain at least forty different chemical compounds, and are deposited on grass and twigs at {{the borders of}} their territory. They then appear to transfer the secretions from the grass to their horns <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> by waving the {{head from side to}} side across the stalk bearing the secretion. Marking of plant stalks with preorbital gland secretions is seen in both sexes. In contrast to the duikers and raphicerids, the klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) is a semi-gregarious species, while the hirola (Beatragus hunteri) is fully gregarious. Nevertheless, these animals display territorial scent marking of grasses with secretions from their preorbital glands.|$|E
25|$|The general {{tone of the}} fur is reddish, {{with the}} {{brightest}} hues occurring in winter. In the winter coat, the back is clothed in a saturated rusty-red to reddish colour with brownish highlights {{along the top of}} the head, neck and shoulders. The throat, chest, flanks, and belly and the upper parts of the limbs are less brightly coloured, and are more yellowish in tone. The lower parts of the limbs are whitish, with dark brownish bands on the anterior sides of the forelimbs. The muzzle <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> are greyish-reddish. The tail is very luxuriant and fluffy, and is mainly of a reddish-ocherous colour, with a dark brown tip. The summer coat is shorter, coarser, and darker. The dorsal and lateral guard hairs in adults measure 20–30mm in length. Dholes in the Moscow Zoo moult once a year from March to May.|$|E

25|$|The ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular {{branches}} {{leave the}} skull through three separate foramina: the superior orbital fissure, the foramen rotundum and the foramen ovale, respectively. The ophthalmic nerve (V1) carries sensory {{information from the}} scalp <b>and</b> <b>forehead,</b> the upper eyelid, the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye, the nose (including {{the tip of the}} nose, except alae nasi), the nasal mucosa, the frontal sinuses and parts of the meninges (the dura and blood vessels). The maxillary nerve (V2) carries sensory information from the lower eyelid and cheek, the nares and upper lip, the upper teeth and gums, the nasal mucosa, the palate and roof of the pharynx, the maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve (V3) carries sensory information from the lower lip, the lower teeth and gums, the chin and jaw (except the angle of the jaw, which is supplied by C2-C3), parts of the external ear and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve carries touch-position and pain-temperature sensations from the mouth. Although it does not carry taste sensation (the chorda tympani is responsible for taste), one of its branches—the lingual nerve—carries sensation from the tongue.|$|E
500|$|Make-up {{supervisor}} Michael Westmore {{aimed to}} create a look for the Son'a that was not exaggerated. He consulted several sculptors; Dean Jones, {{who was on the}} production staff for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, created the look. The prosthetics for Ru'afo consisted of overlapping layers that were stretched over Abraham's head. Westmore said Abraham's prosthetics was [...] "like a rubber band, F. Murray Abraham could turn his head and the skin would look translucent. It was so thin, and the layers were pulling on each other." [...] The two other aliens on the Son'a vessels also had specific prosthetic make-up designs created. The Tarlac's look was based reptilian skin, while the Ellora required only nose <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> prosthetics.|$|E
500|$|Several stelae {{have been}} found that were erected by Ha' K'in Xook, {{including}} Stelae 13, 18, and 23. Stela 13 {{would appear to be}} the earliest, showing the oldest dedicatory date assigned to Ha'K'in Xook, and it [...] "captures the essence of the period-ending celebration." [...] This [...] tall stela retains stylistic elements of other niche stelae, but also shows a different form. It depicts the king scattering incense, similar to iconography found on Piedras Negras Stelae 2 and 32. Clancy has argued that the stela contains iconography pertaining to three motifs: divination, [...] "the quest", and accession. Divination is shown via the act of Ha' K'in Xook scattering the incense. This motif had been introduced earlier in the iconography of Piedras Negras by K'inich Yo'nal Ahk II. The stela also features Ha' K'in Xook wearing a unique headdress; it is depicted as being composed of three knots <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> scrolls, a projecting Water Lily Jaguar, and a flexible rectangular emblem made from a jaguar pelt and a thick net. It has been postulated that this headdress was inspired by the headdress worn by an enthroned figure from the underworld featured on Stela 5. Clancy argues that this headdress is a representation of [...] "the royal theme of quest", due to its iconographic similarity to other stelae at Piedras Negras. In addition, Stela 13 remains Ha' K'in Xook's only extant image.|$|E
