25|$|During {{the days}} of his most {{prolific}} abuse, Hamilton met a businessman named Michael Chadwick who made an attempt to steer him in the right direction. It was through this relationship that he ended up meeting his wife, Katie, who was Chadwick's daughter. His return to baseball was helped along by former minor league outfielder and manager Roy Silver, who owned a baseball academy in Florida. After hearing about Hamilton's desire to return to baseball, Silver offered {{the use of his}} facility if Hamilton agreed to work there. Hamilton first started working at Silver's Academy in January 2006. His duties included cleaning the bathrooms and raking the infield. He spent his nights sleeping on an <b>air</b> <b>mattress</b> in one of the facilities offices. After several months there, Hamilton attempted to play with an independent minor league team, but MLB stepped in and disallowed it.|$|E
500|$|Other escapees relied more on {{physical}} strength and endurance. An escapee in 1987 used meat hooks to scale the fences, while in 1971 a doctor swam [...] across the Baltic Sea from Rostock {{almost to the}} Danish island of Lolland, before he {{was picked up by}} a West German yacht. Another escapee used an <b>air</b> <b>mattress</b> to escape across the Baltic in 1987.|$|E
500|$|In 1901, the U.S. Geological Survey sent Abraham Lincoln Fellows and William Torrence {{into the}} canyon {{to look for a}} site to build a [...] {{diversion}} tunnel bringing water to the Uncompahgre Valley, which was suffering from water shortages due to an influx of settlers into the area. Torrence, a Montrose native and an expert mountaineer, had taken part in a failed expedition the previous year, and his experience proved valuable on his second excursion. He opted to bring a single rubber <b>air</b> <b>mattress</b> instead of the heavy wooden boats that had doomed his previous journey {{into the canyon}}. They entered the canyon on August 12 equipped with [...] "only hunting knives, two silk lifeline ropes, and rubber bags to encase their instruments." [...] After a harrowing 10 days braving rock falls, waterfalls, and 76 river crossings, they emerged from the canyon with a suitable tunnel site.|$|E
50|$|The {{three main}} {{categories}} {{for use of}} <b>air</b> <b>mattresses</b> are camping, temporary home use (guests) and full-time permanent use (in the bedroom). Some <b>air</b> <b>mattresses</b> are specifically designed to perform both functions (camping and guest use) while others are specifically designed for one purpose alone (permanent use in the home or RV). Other <b>air</b> <b>mattresses</b> are designed in shapes with wheel well cutouts specifically intended for use in vehicles such as pickup trucks or SUVs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>mattresses</b> {{can also}} {{improve the quality}} of life (and {{potentially}} provide some measure of relief) for people who suffer with back pain. Having the ability to adjust the firmness of a mattress to accommodate different body shapes, sizes, and weights, can be a factor in the healing process. <b>Air</b> <b>mattresses</b> are sometimes used to protect bedridden people from pressure sores, which can create life-threatening ulcers. Additionally, <b>air</b> <b>mattresses</b> manufactured without the use of materials that may release VOCs or other toxic compounds from the manufacturing process (which can exacerbate allergies in children or other sensitive individuals) are available.|$|R
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>mattresses</b> {{for camping}} are {{available}} which {{are filled with}} foam which itself provides little support, but expands when the air valve is opened allowing air to enter, so the mattress (nearly) inflates by itself. This is especially useful for campers who carry their equipment as, unlike with normal <b>air</b> <b>mattresses,</b> no pump is needed for inflating. Available brands include Aerobed, Coleman, Therm-a-Rest and others.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{after moving}} to San Francisco in October 2007, {{roommates}} and former schoolmates Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia could not afford the rent for their loft apartment. Chesky and Gebbia {{came up with the}} idea of putting an <b>air</b> <b>mattress</b> in their living room and turning it into a bed and breakfast. The goal at first was just [...] "to make a few bucks". In February 2008, Nathan Blecharczyk, Chesky's former roommate, joined as the Chief Technology Officer and the third co-founder of the new venture, called AirBed & Breakfast. This is also where the name [...] "Airbnb" [...] originates from. They put together a website which offered short-term living quarters, breakfast, and a unique business networking opportunity for those who were unable to book a hotel in the saturated market. The site Airbedandbreakfast.com officially launched on August 11, 2008. The founders had their first customers in town in the summer of 2008, during the Industrial Design Conference held by Industrial Designers Society of America, where travelers had a hard time finding lodging in the city.|$|E
50|$|The NeoAir® {{insulated}} <b>air</b> <b>mattress</b> {{was released}} in 2009.

50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>mattresses</b> use one or {{more air}} {{chambers}} instead of springs to provide support. Quality and price can range from inexpensive ones used occasionally for camping, to high-end luxury beds. <b>Air</b> <b>mattresses</b> designed for typical bedroom use cost {{about the same as}} inner-spring mattresses with comparable features. Air bladder construction varies from a simple polyethylene bag to internally baffled, multiple chambers of latex (vulcanized rubber) or vinyl with bonded cotton exteriors. Mattresses may have a layer of foam above the air chambers for added cushioning, and may be enclosed in a cover. Some such beds are termed soft-sided air beds.|$|R
5000|$|Larger, more {{elaborate}} <b>air</b> <b>mattresses</b> ("air beds" [...] in the US, all <b>air</b> <b>mattresses</b> {{are known as}} this elsewhere) have come {{on the market in}} recent years that are intended for guest use or as permanent beds in the bedroom. Bed sizes for temporary air beds range from twin to king size, but few guest bed manufacturers offer king size as most guest air beds are sold outside the United States where king-size mattresses are not standard. Most permanent air beds use easy-to-find conventional sheets and bedding. California King (or Western King) sheets and bedding may be more difficult to find as this size was originally conceived for the waterbed industry.|$|R

5000|$|The term <b>air</b> <b>mattress</b> {{may also}} {{refer to a}} certain {{inflatable}} swimming pool or beach toy, which has an air-sac [...] "pillow" [...] and several (usually four or five) tubes running its length. Also called a [...] "lilo" [...] (UK, AUS), [...] "pool air mat", [...] "air mat", [...] "pool lounge", or [...] "float(ing) mat(tress)", {{it is used to}} recline on the water surface. The Li-Lo trademark for a rubberised material products was registered in UK on 19 Apr 1944 and in the USA on 25 Sep 1947 by P. B. Cow and Co Ltd. An inflatable <b>air</b> <b>mattress</b> for recreational use was advertised as one of the Li-Lo brand of products at the British Industries Fair in London 1949. Although it bears some resemblance to an <b>air</b> <b>mattress,</b> it is typically not built as strongly and may not reliably stay inflated all night long, making it impractical for use as a bed.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{support from}} the Mayor’s office and from some HEW staff working in the {{building}} made life easier inside.

5000|$|Like Thompson, the {{palaeontologist}} Adolf Seilacher emphasised fabricational {{constraints on}} form.

50|$|Highlights of the {{attraction}} include {{a room where}} the walls appear to shrink, a shaky drawbridge, a car charging at the tourists, and a room where two black <b>air</b> <b>mattresses</b> inflate on the tourists and {{they are forced to}} crawl on the ground and push the mattresses out of the way in order to survive claustrophobia.|$|R
50|$|The {{rectangular}} parachute designs tend to {{look like}} square, inflatable <b>air</b> <b>mattresses</b> with open front ends. They are generally safer to operate, because they are less prone to dive rapidly with relatively small control inputs, they are usually flown with lower wing loadings per square foot of area, and they glide more slowly. They typically have a lower glide ratio.|$|R

50|$|In {{the event}} of the bed {{occupant}} suddenly requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, some hospital beds offer a CPR function {{in the form of}} a button or lever which when activated deflates and flattens the bed's <b>air</b> <b>mattress</b> creating a flat hard surface necessary for effective CPR administration.|$|E

50|$|The Woopy {{fuselage}} is {{made from}} aluminum tubing, with a conventional tail, a seated pilot position and weight shift controls.

5000|$|Those {{who need}} housing during the party are often offered a {{separate}} [...] "sleeping room", usually an isolated empty room {{with some sort}} of carpet or mats, where the attendees are able to sleep, separated from the noise. Most sceners prefer bringing sleeping bags for this, as well as <b>air</b> <b>mattresses</b> or sleeping pads. Parties that do not offer a sleeping room generally allow sceners to sleep under the tables.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, {{four more}} campsites were added and Jim Cuthbert {{was awarded a}} Daily Telegraph travel award for most {{innovative}} holiday idea. Further improvements to the Canvas campsites followed, with a site being added in Italy in 1968 and electric lights being introduced in 1969. By the 1970s, route maps had been added to travel packs, fully sprung beds replaced <b>air</b> <b>mattresses</b> and crockery was introduced. In the 1970s, another British camping holiday company - Eurocamp - was established, providing competition for Canvas.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{types of}} {{trailers}} prevail within the motorcycle camping trailers category: clamshell and platform camper trailers. Fabric material {{is attached to}} the top and bottom halves of the clamshell trailer. The tent is created when the trailer is opened. Once a platform camping trailer is opened, however, the tent is pitched on it. These platform style camping trailers are larger than clamshell camping trailers and can fit full-sized to king-sized <b>air</b> <b>mattresses.</b> Most often, clamshells can only accommodate a single occupant.|$|R
