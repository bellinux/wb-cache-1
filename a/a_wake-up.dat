The strategies include attention to sleep hygiene, stimulus control, behavioral interventions, sleep-restriction therapy, paradoxical intention, patient education and relaxation therapy.

As the Provisional Government took hold of military matters, Pântea became President of the Ninth Army's Soviet, and also helped organize the Bessarabian soldiers into a single political body. Similar actions were being taken by other nationally minded Bessarabian officers. Some—Catelli, Anton Crihan, Constantin Osoianu, Ion Păscăluță, Andrei Scobioală—were active on Bessarabia's borders, while others addressed Bessarabian units in places such as Novorossiya (Elefterie Sinicliu) or Crimea (Grigore Turcuman).|$|E

Götze played just 14 minutes in the 0–1 win against the United States, half of the Round of 16 win against Algeria and seven minutes in their quarter-final 0–1 win over France.

At the time, three prominent Han Chinese officials, Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang, had all begun industrial programs in the country's southern regions. In supporting these programmes, Cixi also decreed the opening of the Tongwen Guan in 1862, a school for foreign languages in Beijing.

40|$|We {{present a}} high {{performance}} low-power digital base-band architecture, specially designed for an energy optimized duty-cycled wake-up receiver scheme. Based on <b>a</b> careful <b>wake-up</b> beacon design, <b>a</b> structured <b>wake-up</b> beacon detection technique {{leads to an}} architecture that compensates for the implementation loss of <b>a</b> low-power <b>wake-up</b> receiver front-end at low energy and area costs. Design parameters are selected by energy optimization and the architecture is easily scalable to support various network sizes. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, the digital base-band consumes 0 : 9 μW (VDD = 0 : 37 V) in sub-threshold operation at 250 kbps, with appropriate 97 % wake-up beacon detection and 0 : 04 % false alarm probabilities. The circuit is fully functional at a minimum VDD of 0 : 23 V at fmax = 5 kHz and 0 : 018 μW power consumption. Based on these results we show that our digital base-band {{can be used as}} a companion to compensate for front-end implementation losses resulting from the limited wake-up receiver power budget at a negligible cost. This implies an improvement of the practical sensitivity of the wake-up receiver, compared to what is traditionally reported...|$|R
