5|$|In eastern Serbia it was {{believed}} that <b>ale</b> who interact with people can metamorphose into humans or animals, after which their true selves can be seen only by so-called šestaci– men with six fingers on both hands and six toes on both feet– though human-looking <b>ale</b> cause houses to shake when they enter. By a belief recorded in the Homolje region, <b>ale</b> that charge to the Moon also display shapeshifting abilities: they repeatedly shift from their basic shape of two-headed snakes to six-fingered men who hold iron pitchforks, black young bulls, big boars, or black wolves, and back.|$|E
5|$|On {{the seventh}} day after the person had died, people celebrated the sjaund (the word both for the funeral <b>ale</b> and the feast, since it {{involved}} a ritual drinking).

If the deceased were a widow or the master of the homestead, the rightful heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority.|$|E

5|$|People {{in eastern}} and {{southern}} Serbia believed that <b>ale,</b> in their voracity, attacked the Sun and the Moon. They gradually ate {{more and more of}} those celestial bodies, thereby causing an eclipse. During an eclipse, the Sun turned red because it was covered with its own blood {{as a result of the}} ale’s bites; when it shone brightly again, that meant it had defeated the <b>ale.</b> The spots on the Moon were seen as scars from the ale’s bites. While <b>ale</b> devoured the Sun or the Moon, many elderly people became depressed and even wept in fear. If <b>ale</b> succeeded in devouring the Sun, the world would end. To prevent that, men shot their guns toward the eclipse or rang bells, and women cast spells incessantly. There was a notion in the Homolje region that, if <b>ale</b> succeeded in devouring the Moon, the Sun would die from sorrow, and darkness would overwhelm the world.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ale</b> {{have several}} adversaries, {{including}} dragons, zmajeviti (dragon-like) men, eagles, St. Elijah, and St. Sava. The principal {{enemy of the}} ala is the dragon; {{he is able to}} defeat her and eliminate her harmful effects. Dragons are thus seen as guardians of the fields and harvest, and as protectors against bad weather. When an ala threatens by bringing hail clouds, a dragon comes out to fight with her and drive her away. His main weapon is lightning; thunder represents a fight between <b>ale</b> and dragons (during which <b>ale</b> hide in tall trees). An instance of a more abundant crop at a particular point is explained in the Pčinja region {{as a result of a}} dragon having struck an ala with lightning just over that place, making her drop the looted grains she had been carrying in her huge ears. If an ala finds a dragon in a hollow tree, however, she can destroy him by burning the tree.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ale</b> were {{believed}} {{to be able to make}} men insane; in eastern Serbia there is a special term for such a man: alosan. When people encountered an ala on a road or field, they could get dangerous diseases from her. <b>Ale</b> are also responsible for dogs’ rabies, although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; a dog that finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E

5|$|An ala or hala (plural: <b>ale</b> or hali) is {{a female}} mythological {{creature}} {{recorded in the}} folklore of Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Serbs. <b>Ale</b> are considered demons of bad weather whose main purpose is to lead hail-producing thunderclouds {{in the direction of}} fields, vineyards, or orchards to destroy the crops, or loot and take them away. Extremely voracious, <b>ale</b> particularly like to eat children, though their gluttony is not limited to Earth. It is believed they sometimes try devouring the Sun or the Moon, causing eclipses, and that it would mean {{the end of the world}} should they succeed. When people encounter an ala, their mental or physical health, or even life, are in peril; however, her favor can be gained by approaching her with respect and trust. Being in a good relationship with an ala is very beneficial, because she makes her favorites rich and saves their lives in times of trouble.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} breweries, {{occasional}} special brews were commissioned upon commemorative dates and retirement of long-serving employees. In 1991 a special bottled beer was produced when Sheffield Wednesday reached the finals of the Football League Cup. Two thousand bottles of Stones Centenary <b>Ale</b> were produced in 1995, celebrating 100 years of rugby league. This {{was followed by}} the 1996 cask conditioned Stones Super League Bitter (4.8 per cent ABV) celebrating Stones' sponsorship of the League, and the 1998 bottled Stones Commemorative <b>Ale</b> which marked the scheduled closure of the brewery. In summer 2007, Everards brewed a one-off cask conditioned Stones Pure Gold (4.1 per cent ABV) golden <b>ale,</b> and in 2011 four cask conditioned sports themed Stones branded ales were made available throughout {{the first half of the}} year, brewed at William Worthington's Brewery in Burton upon Trent.|$|E

5|$|Beer colour is {{determined}} by the malt. The most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. Pale lager and pale <b>ale</b> are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke.

5|$|In October 2011, Heineken {{sold the}} McEwan's beer brands to Wells & Young's for around £20 million, and {{production}} of McEwan's Best Scotch and canned and bottled brands moved to Bedford. The new owners vowed to reintroduce McEwan's as a cask <b>ale</b> brand and launch an expanded premium bottled range. Together with the Younger's brands McEwan's generates £80 million of sales annually in the UK, and McEwan's is now the largest Wells & Young's brand. It is the highest-selling <b>ale</b> brand in Scotland where it has a 20 per cent market share. Like most largely pasteurised <b>ale</b> brands in the UK {{it has been in}} a state of managed decline. The beers are sold predominantly in Scotland and the north of England; a small amount is exported to Italy. 2012 saw the launch of McEwan's Export in bottles, and a new seasonal cask-conditioned golden <b>ale</b> called McEwan's Gold. In 2013, export sales to Canada were resumed, having been discontinued under Heineken. In April 2013 McEwan's Red was launched, aimed at younger drinkers and with the intention of expanding the brand into England. McEwan's beers began to be sold in France in April 2013. The bottled beers McEwan's Amber and Signature were launched in July 2013.|$|E

5|$|Like <b>ale,</b> aloviti men led hail-producing and {{thunderstorm}} clouds: {{when the}} skies darkened, {{such a man}} would fall into a trance, and his spirit would fly out of his body toward the clouds as if his spirit were an ala herself. There was, however, a significant difference– he never led the clouds over the fields of his own village; the damage was done to the neighboring villages. In this respect, aloviti men are equivalent to zduhaći. Besides leading clouds away, an aloviti man could also fight against <b>ale</b> to protect his village. Children, too, could be aloviti, and they fought <b>ale</b> using plough beams. In these fights they were helped by the Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian), {{and for this reason}} people would not hurt these snakes.|$|E
