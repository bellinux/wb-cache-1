40|$|AbstractRailway {{wheelsets}} {{consist of}} three main components; the wheel, <b>axle</b> and <b>axle</b> <b>bearing.</b> Faults can develop {{on any of}} the aforementioned components, but the most common are related to wheel and <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> damages. The continuous increase in train operating speeds means that failure of an <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> can lead to very serious derailments, potentially causing human casualties, severe disruption in the operation of the network, damage to the tracks, unnecessary costs, and loss of confidence in rail transport by the general public. The rail industry has focused on the improvement of maintenance and online condition monitoring of rolling stock to reduce the probability of failure as much as possible. This paper discusses the results of onboard acoustic emission measurements carried out on freight wagons with artificially damaged <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> in Long Marston, UK. Acoustic emission signal envelope analysis has been applied as a means of effective tool to detect and evaluate the damage in the bearings considered in this study.

40|$|As train {{loads and}} travel speeds have {{increased}} over time, railway <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> have become critical elements which require more efficient non-destructive inspection and fault diagnostics methods. This paper presents a novel and adaptive procedure based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and Hilbert marginal spectrum for multi-fault diagnostics of <b>axle</b> <b>bearings.</b> EEMD overcomes the limitations that often hypothesize about data and computational efforts that restrict {{the application of}} signal processing techniques. The outputs of this adaptive approach are the intrinsic mode functions that are treated with the Hilbert transform {{in order to obtain}} the Hilbert instantaneous frequency spectrum and marginal spectrum. Anyhow, not all the IMFs obtained by the decomposition should be considered into Hilbert marginal spectrum. The IMFs’ confidence index arithmetic proposed in this paper is fully autonomous, overcoming the major limit of selection by user with experience, and allows the development of on-line tools. The effectiveness of the improvement is proven by the successful diagnosis of an <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> with a single fault or multiple composite faults, e. g., outer ring fault, cage fault and pin roller fault...|$|R

These were particularly common in the 19th century, when <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> were lubricated by grease.

40|$|This work {{presents}} initial {{results from}} {{a new approach to}} condition monitoring of rail <b>axle</b> <b>bearings,</b> in particular some early-stage failures. Background: premature failure of rail <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> causes a significant increase in train operating costs and can impact on train safety. Rail <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> have an anticipated service life; however, some bearings do not achieve this. A new approach to degradation diagnostics is now in use on Southeastern / Bombardier trains and provides real-time vibration condition monitoring. Each independent wireless sensor unit bolts to a wheel bearing housing. The units are self-powered by vibration harvesting. This emerging methodology has been made possible by the decreasing power budget of sensor and wireless technologies. Methods: in this initial study, real ex-situ examples of failures of bearings have been examined. The damaged regions of the bearings are examined using a suite of non-destructive techniques including optical and scanning electron microscopy, computed tomography (CT) and surface profilometry as well as traditional metallographic sectioning methods. Discussion: a new on-board condition monitoring system has made possible the examination of the onset of in-service bearing degradation, allowing identification well in advance of catastrophic destruction of the evidence. Initial results indicate that the vibration sensors are correctly identifying failing bearings. CT damage maps are allowing targeted metallographic sectioning of the samples. Correlation between vibration data and the bearing damage parameters will improve diagnostic accuracy and ultimately improve train safety<br/...|$|R

The railway is, however, a complex and closely coupled system, making it difficult {{in the early stages}} of development, to be clear what the system-wide impact of innovation will be. The research covered in this paper stems from the idea that computer-based models of existing systems can help overcome this problem, by providing a baseline framework against which the impact of innovation can be identified. The paper describes development of a repeatable modelling methodology, which elicits objective system data from Railway Group Standards and integrates it using CORE®, a powerful system modelling tool, to create system models.

The origin of the power for this technology is found in the concept of energy harvesting, which resources thermal deviation occurring when a train runs. For this, we measured the temperature generated on the <b>axle</b> box <b>bearing</b> from the train’s running environment by using a high-speed train, analyzed the thermal deviation and calculated the estimated energy harvesting power for the sensor network of the railroad system. The thermal deviation occurred in the <b>axle</b> box <b>bearing</b> when a train runs; the deviation was approximately 12. 97 ∼ 14. 68 ℃. We calculated in the assumption of the basic thermo element of the <b>axle</b> box <b>bearing</b> area, which is the area of the temperature sensor attached on the <b>axle</b> box <b>bearing.</b> Theoretically, the energy harvesting power of 63. 8 mW can be obtained and thus by using the energy harvesting power {{it will be possible to}} operate the wireless sensor network for railroad monitoring...|$|R
40|$|The wear of railway <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> is an {{important}} phenomenon. Rail companies must keep their rolling stock in a serviceable condition as excessively worn bearings can contribute to safety issues such as vibrations, excessive clearances and possibly even derailments. At present, maintenance scheduling is typically performed at predetermined time intervals. Predicting the wear and degradation of the bearings, would enable operators and bearing manufacturers to 1) optimise the design and maintenance of the bearings, and 2) quantitatively determine {{the best time to}} replace the bearings. This paper presents a model developed for predicting the wear in radially loaded spherical roller railway <b>axle</b> <b>bearings.</b> It uses a slice method to calculate the roller load, traction and creep distribution along the roller for the contact mechanics, and predicts wear using a frictional power model. The model is first validated with the wear in a thrust bearing in the literature and then used to predict wear in the radial bearing. The wear contribution from each roller in the loading zone due to the radial loading is calculated and combined for an overall wear profile. ...|$|R
