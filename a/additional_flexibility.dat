5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows <b>additional</b> <b>flexibility</b> in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E

25|$|Three {{distinct}} loyalty {{products are}} offered, tailored towards business and frequent flyers. These are Flexi Fare, easyJet Plus {{and a new}} frequent traveller loyalty programme called Flight Club. Flexi Fare {{is a type of}} ticket that is usually more expensive than the regular fare and comparable to a business ticket with other airlines. This ticket offers <b>additional</b> <b>flexibility,</b> including unlimited free date changes within a set period, free route changes, complimentary checked baggage (1x20kg), an increased carry-on baggage allowance, and a £5 on board refreshment voucher. easyJet Plus is an annual subscription product targeted at frequent flyers, both business and leisure. This service offers free allocated seating (including extra legroom), priority check-in, fast track security, speedy boarding and extra cabin baggage. The airline's loyalty programme is called Flight Club. To qualify for this a person must have flown at least twenty times or spent over £1500 on ten flights within 12 months. Benefits include fee-free flight changes, free name changes, and a dedicated contact centre team.|$|E

These flexibilities represent the policies and practices that an agency {{has the authority to}} implement in managing its workforce. Congressional requesters asked GAO to provide information on agency and union officials' views about the most effective human capital <b>flexibilities,</b> <b>additional</b> <b>flexibilities</b> needed, and whether <b>additional</b> <b>flexibilities</b> could be implemented while also protecting employees' rights. GAO was also asked to identify key practices for effective use of flexibilities. GAO interviewed the human resources directors of the federal government's 24 largest departments and agencies, and representatives of 4 national organizations representing federal employees and managers. GAO further focused its efforts on 7 federal agencies [...] Department of Air Force, General Services Administration, Internal Revenue Service, International Trade Administration, U. S.

The effects of the mortgage or mechanic's lien, however, cannot be discharged in most cases if the lien affixed prior to filing.

2500|$|Another {{alternative}} {{replaces the}} half bridge MMC submodule described above, {{with a full}} bridge submodule containing four IGBTs in an H bridge arrangement, instead of two. [...] The full-bridge variant of MMC allows the submodule capacitor to be inserted into the circuit in either polarity. [...] This confers <b>additional</b> <b>flexibility</b> in controlling the converter and allows the converter to block the fault current which arises from a short-circuit between {{the positive and negative}} DC terminals (something which is impossible with any of the preceding types of VSC). [...] Furthermore it allows the DC voltage to be of either polarity (like a LCC HVDC scheme), giving rise to the possibility of hybrid LCC and VSC HVDC systems. However, the full-bridge arrangement requires twice as many IGBTs and has higher power losses than the equivalent half-bridge arrangement.|$|E

40|$|<b>Additional</b> <b>flexibilities</b> on {{the demand}} side can be {{obtained}} by using price signals to change the consumption behavior of household electricity customers. The present contribution proposes a new theoretically motivated demand response model type called virtual storage. First, the basic model structure of several virtual storage models is introduced. All of these models are based on a system of difference equations that describe load reductions/increases in response to price signals. The virtual storage models differ thereafter in how past or prognosis-based future price information is considered. After a description of a proposed model validation strategy, the model behavior of several virtual storage models is compared with some of the common demand response model types and with re-al customer responses to a price signal. Thus, a model comparison is performed {{on the basis of a}} real smart meter data set (Olympic Peninsula Project) ...|$|R
