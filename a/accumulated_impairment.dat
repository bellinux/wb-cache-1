40|$|The {{analysis}} of saccades offers {{an opportunity to}} study {{a number of different}} cognitive processes, such as visuospatial attention, working memory, and volitional conflict. A study of saccades in patients with visuospatial hemineglect, who performed a visual search task, showed repeated fixations on targets previously discovered, yet they often failed to retain the information that a particular target had previously been discovered. High-resolution structural brain scanning showed that this abnormality was due either to a lesion in the right intraparietal sulcus or the right inferior frontal lobe. Detailed {{analysis of}} the scanpaths suggested that the former location was associated with an <b>accumulating</b> <b>impairment</b> in remapping target locations across saccades or impaired memory of previously inspected target locations, whereas the latter location was more consistent with a failure to inhibit responses to rightward locations. When combined with a spatial bias to the right, such deficits might explain why many neglect patients often reexamine rightward targets, at the expense of items to their left. The functions of the supplementary eye field (SEF), in the medial frontal lobe, in relation to saccade generation are controversial. A series of studies in a patient with a focal lesion of the right SEF has indicated an important role for the SEF in the rapid self-control of saccadic eye movements and in set-switching (i. e., implementing control in situations of response conflict when ongoing saccadic plans have to be changed rapidly), rather than monitoring errors. In a recent fMRI study of normal subjects, it was shown that the SEF is involved in implementing the resolution of any volitional conflict, whereas other presupplementary motor areas are involved in the generation of volitional plans and processing volitional conflict.

40|$|Abstract — The {{capacity}} growth {{driven by}} increasing traffic {{and the introduction}} of new devices and technologies has resulted in new functionalities in optical networks. The property of transparency enables compatibility between different system generations and the coexistence of multiple bit-rates without raising the global network cost. In a transparent network, the signals travel through many links and nodes without the need for opto-electronic regeneration, <b>accumulating</b> physical <b>impairments.</b> Therefore, standard point-to-point test-bed set-ups are no longer adequate to emulate signals propagating in transparent optical networks. New test-beds integrating the different heterogeneity cases due to the use of transparent cross-connects becomes necessary. In this paper, we present various test-bed realizations accounting for the following network heterogeneities: fiber link heterogeneity and neighbor changes while a signal propagates in the fiber. To be able to emulate such network heterogeneity, we present a double-loop set-up. Such a set-up is then used to assess the propagation results obtained by simulation and validate the quality of transmission (QoT) estimators...|$|R

Here, its effects on the physiology and biochemistry of the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida have been investigated and comparisons made with {{its effect on the}} life-span of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to provide insight into its mode of action and its selective toxicity. Results: Fluensulfone exerts acute effects (≤ 1 h; ≥ 100 μM) on stylet thrusting and motility of hatched second stage G. pallida juveniles (J 2 s). Chronic exposure to lower concentrations of fluensulfone (≥ 3 days; ≤ 30 μM), reveals a slowly developing metabolic insult in which G. pallida J 2 s sequentially exhibit a reduction in motility, loss of a metabolic marker for cell viability, high lipid content and tissue degeneration prior to death.

In order to further improve the spectral efficiency and compensate for the differential delays among the light-trees, we incorporate the rateless network coding (R-NC) in the multicast system. We first formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model to solve the problem for static network planning. Then, we propose three time-efficient heuristics that leverage the set-cover problem and utilize layered auxiliary graphs. The simulation results indicate that in both the ILP and heuristics, the MC-RMSA with R-NC can achieve better performance on the maximum index of used FS' than that without. After that, we evaluate the heuristics in dynamic network provisioning. The results show that the MC-RMSA with R-NC can effectively improve the performance of all-optical multicast in EONs to reduce the blocking probability...|$|R

Although pathogenesis of the disease is not known, a growing body of evidence shows that inflammation together with oxidative stress may contribute to development of DD. Since reactive oxygen species produced during stress may damage DNA, we wanted to evaluate the extent of DNA damage and efficiency of DNA repair in patients with depression. Material and Methods: We measured and compared the extent of endogenous DNA damage – single- and double-strand breaks, alkali-labile sites, and oxidative damage of the pyrimidines and purines – in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from rDD patients (n= 40) and healthy controls (n= 46) using comet assay. We also measured DNA damage evoked by hydrogen peroxide and monitored changes in DNA damage during repair incubation. Results: We found an increased number DNA breaks, alkali-labile sites, and oxidative modification of DNA bases in the patients compared to the controls. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide evoked the same increased damage in both groups. Examination of the repair kinetics of both groups revealed that the lesions were more efficiently repaired in the controls than in the patients. Conclusions: For the first time we showed that patients with depression, compared with non-depresses individuals, had more DNA breaks, alkali-labile sites, and oxidative DNA damage, and that those lesions may be <b>accumulated</b> by <b>impairments</b> of the DNA repair systems.

Majority {{of the technical}} contributions either assume ideal hardware or inappropriately model hardware impairments which often induce misleading results especially for high data-rate communication systems. We propose statistical mathematical modeling of various hardware impairment (HWI) to characterize their deteriorating effects on the information signal. In addition, we model the aggregate HWI as improper Gaussian signaling (IGS), to fully characterize their asymmetric properties and the self-interfering signal attribute under I/Q imbalance. The proposed model encourages to adopt asymmetric transmission scheme, as opposed to traditional symmetric signaling. First, we present statistical baseband equivalent mathematical models for general MIMO system and two special scenarios of receive and transmit diversity systems under HWI. Then, we express their achievable rate under PGS and IGS transmit schemes. Moreover, we tune the IGS statistical characteristics to maximize the achievable rate. We also present optimal beam-forming/pre-coding and receive combiner vector for multiple-input single-output (MISO) and single-input multiple output (SIMO) systems, which lead to SDNR maximization.

To investigate further the relevance of proper Yra 1 stoichiometry in the cell, we overexpressed Yra 1 by transforming yeast cells with YRA 1 intron-less constructs and analyzed its effect on gene expression and genome integrity. We found that YRA 1 overexpression induces DNA damage and leads to a transcription-associated hyperrecombination phenotype that is mediated by RNA:DNA hybrids. In addition, it confers a genome-wide replication retardation as seen by reduced BrdU incorporation and accumulation of the Rrm 3 helicase.

Aiming at reducing the costs and energy consumption, transparent networks allow the data to be kept optical end to end and thus removing {{the majority of the}} expensive optical–electrical–optical (OEO) devices. Nonethe-less, physical <b>impairments</b> <b>accumulate</b> on the signal along optical transparent paths, therefore limiting the system reach and the overall network performance. Furthermore, failures propagate in a transparent network environment and they cannot be easily localized and isolated. So then, transparent networks need to deal with a number of challenges impacting both planning and operation phases. Such challenges require the use of cross-layer approaches, which involve dynamic interactions between the physical layer and the network layer to enable the compensation for mismatching of requirements and resources. In this paper, we aim to provide an overview of such challenges, reporting comparative analysis with a selec-tion of existing solutions and to cast a glance at the open issues for future research...|$|R

In all-optical WDM networks, where no electrical 3 R regeneration is performed at intermediate nodes, transmission <b>impairments</b> <b>accumulate</b> and may result in high BER values at the receiverpsilas side. Hybrid WDM networks use sparse regeneration to overcome transmission impairments. Such networks achieve performance measures close to those obtained by fully opaque networks at a much lesser cost. In previous work, we addressed the problem of hybrid WDM network design by proposing a tool for routing, wavelength assignment and regenerator placement so that the physical constraints are taken into account. A standard First-Fit scheme is performed for the wavelength assignment problem. In recent work, we proposed a QoT-aware wavelength assignment strategy that considerably improves the performance achieved by our tool. In this paper, we propose a new wavelength assignment strategy called Best-BER-Fit.

However, in order to compute lightpaths, IA-RWAs typically rely on analytical models, which cannot be guaranteed to be fully accurate, and hence acceptance of lightpaths with poor QoT or rejection of lightpaths with acceptable QoT may ensue. We present a novel IA-RWA algorithm that not only considers the impact of physical impairments on RWA decisions, but also, for the first time, accounts for inaccuracy of the QoT estimators. The performance of our algorithm is compared with algorithms selected from the recent literature. All algorithms are evaluated through simulations in a realistic scenario. Our proposed novel algorithm outperforms the selected algorithms in terms of blocking rate and also the amount of required resources for achieving a very low (i. e., 5 £ 10 ¡ 6) blocking rate under similar assumptions. In addition we show that accounting for QoT estimation inaccuracy changes the performance of the proposed IA-RWA substantially, and hence that the QoT estimator inaccuracy is an important design parameter in transparent optical networking.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} few years there has been an {{explosion}} in the amount of traffic carried by the Internet which made a huge increase in demand for bandwidth in core optical networks and we have witnessed the extensive deployment of wavelength- division multiplexed (WDM) networks. These systems are configured to allow multiple channels at different wavelengths to share the same optical fiber, increasing the effective transmission rate on that fiber. Optical network architectures can be characterized as opaque or all- optical (transparent) or as a compromise between opaque and transparent networks. Transparent (or all-optical) network architecture was proposed to reduce the associated cost of opaque networks [1]. In transparent WDM networks, data is transmitted from its source to its destination in optical form. Switching/routing operations are being performed in the optical domain without undergoing any optical-to-electrical conversion. According to the state of the technology, various factors degrade the quality of an analog optical signal along its route. As the signal propagates in a transparent way, these <b>impairments</b> <b>accumulate</b> along the path, and limit the system reach and overall network performance. These physical layer constraints may be classified into linear and nonlinear impairments. In a transparent optical network, beside <b>impairments</b> that <b>accumulate</b> along the path there is an impact of failures which also propagates through the network and therefore cannot be easily localized and isolated.

However, {{the majority of}} studies in this area have only been able to demonstrate an association, rather than a causal link, between emotion recognition deficits and CD. To move closer towards understanding the causal pathways linking emotion recognition problems with CD, we studied emotion recognition in the unaffected first-degree relatives of CD probands, {{as well as those}} with a diagnosis of CD. METHOD: Using a family-based design, we investigated facial emotion recognition in probands with CD (n = 43), their unaffected relatives (n = 21), and healthy controls (n = 38). We used the Emotion Hexagon task, an alternative forced-choice task using morphed facial expressions depicting the six primary emotions, to assess facial emotion recognition accuracy. RESULTS: Relative to controls, the CD group showed impaired recognition of anger, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise (all p < 0. 005). Similar to probands with CD, unaffected relatives showed deficits in anger and happiness recognition relative to controls (all p < 0. 008), with a trend toward a deficit in fear recognition. There {{were no significant differences in}} performance between the CD probands and the unaffected relatives following correction for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that facial emotion recognition deficits are present in adolescents who are at increased familial risk for developing antisocial behaviour, as well as those who have already developed CD. Consequently, impaired emotion recognition appears to be a viable familial risk marker or candidate endophenotype for CD...|$|R

However, this evolution also brings problems such as the large power imbalance arising with the transmission of several wavelengths that imposes a severe degradation to the optical signal. Recent research work shows how to adapt all-optical (transparent) WDM networks to cope with transmission impairments induced by long-haul optical components on long spans. Since no electrical 3 R regeneration is performed at intermediate nodes in a transparent network, transmission <b>impairments</b> <b>accumulate</b> along the signal route and may result in high BER values at the receiver's side.

Up to now, we did not consider any in-line gain equalization scheme, i. e. dynamic gain equalizers are only deployed at the network nodes. In this paper, we investigate the impact of deploying in-line dynamic gain equalizers {{in terms of the number}} of required regenerators to meet QoT and in terms of cost tradeoff. We also propose a novel wavelength assignment strategy that takes into account the quality of transmission. Simulations show that using an adequate QoT-aware wavelength assignment strategy may compensate for the absence of in-line equalization. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} version can {{be found}} at: [URL] [Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive ritualistic behaviours) leading to functional <b>impairment.</b> <b>Accumulating</b> evidence links these conditions with underlying dysregulation of fronto-striatal circuitry and monoamine systems. These abnormalities represent key targets for existing and novel treatment interventions. However, the brain bases of these conditions and treatment mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. Animal models simulating the behavioural and clinical manifestations of the disorder show great potential for augmenting our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of OCD. This paper provides an overview of what is known about OCD from several perspectives. We begin by describing the clinical features of OCD and the criteria used to assess the validity of animal models of symptomatology; namely, face validity (phenomenological similarity between inducing conditions and specific symptoms of the human phenomenon), predictive validity (similarity in response to treatment) and construct validity (similarity in underlying physiological or psychological mechanisms). We then survey animal models of OC spectrum conditions within this framework, focusing on (i) ethological models; (ii) genetic and pharmacological models; and (iii) neurobehavioural models. We also discuss their advantages and shortcomings in relation to their capacity to identify potentially efficacious new compounds. It is of interest that there has been rather little evidence of 'false alarms' for therapeutic drug effects in OCD models which actually fail in the clinic. While it is more difficult to model obsessive cognition than compulsive behaviour in experimental animals, it is feasible to infer cognitive inflexibility in certain animal paradigms. Finally, key future neurobiological and treatment research areas are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Many {{patients}} with chronic HCV infection have elevated or fluctuating levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and most, {{if not all of}} them, have histologic evidence of chronic hepatitis with more or less active inflammation and fibrosis in the liver. The presence of elevated ALT and also the entity of the ALT abnormality have been considered important in the decision to take a liver biopsy and/or to initiate antiviral therapy in hepatitis C, based on the demonstration that there is an evident, although not absolute, correlation between ALT levels and liver disease activity and progression [1], [2], [3] and [4]. On the other hand, chronic HCV infection may also present with normal or minimally elevated ALT in the presence of continuing HCV replication (HCV-RNA positive {{patients with}} normal ALT). This subgroup of HCV patients is consistent, representing in most published series around 20 – 40 % of chronically infected patients [5], [6], [7] and [8]. There has been and there is still a continuing debate about the best way to describe and diagnose the condition of ‘chronic HCV infection with normal ALT’ [9] and [10]. Many patients maintain persistently normal ALT levels over a long-term follow-up but a significant subgroup shows biochemical reactivation over time [11], [12] and [13]. Another point of debate centres on the type of underlying liver damage that might be present in these cases despite ALT normality and on the necessity for taking a liver biopsy to identify those cases that might have progressive liver disease and an indication for immediate therapy. Many studies have indeed provided evidence that although the majority of the HCV patients with normal ALT have minimal liver damage, a subgroup may have active and progressive liver disease that is difficult to predict {{on the basis of the}} clinical or biochemical parameters only [9] and [13]. Accordingly, recent guidelines and management recommendations indicate that viremic patients with normal ALT should not be considered to be ‘healthy carriers’ [14], [15] and [16]. Also the definition, largely used in the past, of ‘asymptomatic HCV carriers’ seems inappropriate, as evidence is <b>accumulating</b> that <b>impairment</b> of quality of life in chronic HCV infection is largely independent of ALT serum levels [17] and [18]. On the basis of these concepts, the indication for antiviral therapy in this category of HCV patients has received increasing consideration and credit in recent years, and has been further reinforced by the most recent results of a large International clinical trial indicating that pegylated interferon plus Ribavirin combination therapy is effective and safe in these patients [19]. This review will focus on the new emerging concepts about HCV patients with normal ALT as to definition and diagnosis, natural history and optimised management. Recent data on the efficacy and safety of antiviral therapy in this group will also be reviewed...|$|R
