40|$|The law of The National Land {{embrace the}} horizontale scheiding. The horizontale scheiding declare that {{buildings}} <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> {{are not part}} of the land, it results that ownership of land will not automatically include ownership of the buildings <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> above. <b>And</b> it also means that a legal act against a land will not involve a legal act against the buildings <b>and</b> <b>plants.</b> The existence of the horizontale scheiding could be used to deceives any parties. Then the criteria of horizontale scheiding towards land and/or building’s tenure is necessary to be ascertained before giving legal protection to the parties since both of The Law of the National Land and Burgerlijk Wetboek haven’t give a clear explanation about it. Control of land and buildings in the Burgerlijk Wetbook (BW) adheres to the principle of attachment or which is also referred to as the principle of natrekking / accessie principle. In this principle, the buildings <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> that exist on the ground constitute a unity, more details, buildings <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> are part of the land concerned.

Ferugliotherium is thought to have been a small animal, with a body mass of about 70g (2.5oz), and may have eaten insects <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> material.
