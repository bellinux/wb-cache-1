5|$|Mulder uses a {{government}} source {{to find a}} secret T3 line in Fairfax County, Virginia, one that the AI uses to access the Internet. He <b>also</b> <b>finds</b> the trailer that {{is connected to the}} T3 line. Meanwhile, Esther forces Scully to drive to David's house. However, they find that the house has been destroyed. Esther admits that she and David had been planning to transfer their consciousness into cyberspace to enter the AI. Gelman, however, thought the idea was too dangerous.

5|$|Noble gases {{have very}} low boiling and melting points, {{which makes them}} useful as {{cryogenic}} refrigerants. In particular, liquid helium, which boils at , is used for superconducting magnets, such as those needed in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Liquid neon, although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium, <b>also</b> <b>finds</b> use in cryogenics because it has over 40times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Susanne admits her {{deception}} but {{claims that}} she was scapegoated for trying to leave {{her job at the}} weapons facility. There, she had been working on ergotamine, an aerosolized gas that causes paranoia and anxiety. Susanne claims that the government plans to test the gas on civilians in Baltimore. After deciphering the file, the Lone Gunmen find {{that she was}} telling the truth, learning the location of the gas. Susanne <b>also</b> <b>finds</b> evidence that she had a tracking device put in a tooth, which she pulls out.|$|E
5|$|The case baffles Colton, as {{the only}} common {{elements}} in the murders are the lack of entry points and the apparent removal of the victims' livers with bare hands. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks over the case and notes their similarity to earlier murder sprees that occurred in 1933 and 1963. At the crime scene, Mulder notices an elongated fingerprint on the air vent, which he <b>also</b> <b>finds</b> {{to be similar to}} some documented in the X-Files. He concludes that because five murders occurred during the earlier sprees, the investigators should expect two more.|$|E

Verlyn Klinkenborg's book, Timothy; or, Notes of an Abject Reptile (2006) is based wholly on that reptile, as is Sylvia Townsend Warner's The Portrait of a Tortoise (1946). The tortoise <b>also</b> <b>finds</b> its way into science, as its species, Testudo whitei (Bennett 1836), long thought to be a synonym of Testudo graeca, has been rediscovered in Algeria.|$|E
5|$|A {{preoccupation with}} his own {{mortality}} permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based {{on a number of}} poems on the theme of death). This piece <b>also</b> <b>finds</b> Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony used throughout. Shostakovich dedicated this score to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony.|$|E

Mayweather offers to make a few repairs and upgrades to systems on the ship, but Paul tells him to stop, making him feel uneasy and out of place. Soon afterwards, the ship suddenly comes under attack, and a homing device is placed on the hull. Mayweather then recommends a boost in the ship's fighting capability, but Paul insists that the safest course is to flee to the nearest port and yield the cargo as needed.|$|E

Billy LaBonge is later questioned by Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson); {{he tells the}} agents that he thought Maleeni was a ripoff. During the autopsy, Scully finds that, although Maleeni's head was cleanly cut off, {{he died of a}} heart attack. She <b>also</b> <b>finds</b> that he was dead for at least a month and refrigerated, even though the carnival manager spoke to him mere moments leading up to his head falling off.|$|E

Doggett is stunned, and the agents realize that Smith is still in the compound.|$|E

Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder <b>also</b> <b>finds</b> pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E
