A proposed solution for AspectJ uses a layered approach which builds upon the existing Java Virtual Machine to add support for join point management and callbacks to a Dynamic Aspect-Oriented Programming Engine. An alternative implementation uses a weaving engine that uses breakpoints to halt execution at the pointcut, select an appropriate method, embed it into the <b>application,</b> <b>and</b> continue. The use of breakpoints in this manner {{has been shown to}} reduce performance due to {{a very large number of}} context switches.|$|E

Unstandardized negative binomial regressions are employed with multiple alternative model specifications and diagnostic tests.

The effect size of firearm violent crime on concealed carry <b>applications</b> <b>and</b> permits is minimal. There is a demonstrable link between firearm violence <b>and</b> concealed carry <b>applications</b> <b>and</b> permits issued, net all covariates.
