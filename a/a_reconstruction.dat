40|$|Summary: This article {{describes}} <b>an</b> anterolateral <b>reconstruction</b> procedure that, {{when used in}} combination with an intra-articular anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, restores rotary and anterior knee stability. We believe that failing to recognize lateral instabilities and to perform <b>an</b> extra-articular <b>reconstruction</b> is <b>an</b> under-recognized cause of failure of ACL reconstruction. We also describe the indications, medical histories, and physical examination tests used to determine when <b>an</b> anterolateral <b>reconstruction</b> is needed. One should suspect a compromise of the lateral structures when presented with <b>a</b> failed ACL <b>reconstruction</b> in which the tunnels, the graft, and the rehabilitation all {{seem to have been}} done properly, or when a prior lateral procedure has been attempted and failed. In our experience, if <b>a</b> second ACL <b>reconstruction</b> is undertaken without the benefit of <b>a</b> lateral <b>reconstruction,</b> it may fail as well. Key Words: Lateral reconstruction—Lateral instability—ACL reconstruction. Over the past decade, operative procedures fortreating anterior translation instabilities have im-proved substantially. Testing has shown that the ante-rior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the primary restraint to anterior tibial translation 1 and, as a result, the single...|$|R
5|$|Efforts began {{shortly after}} the {{explosion}} to clear debris, repair buildings, and establish temporary housing for survivors left homeless by the explosion.

5|$|Johnson was {{initially}} left to devise <b>a</b> <b>Reconstruction</b> policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was {{not due to}} meet again until December 1865. Radical Republicans told the President that the Southern states were economically {{in a state of}} chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Other Japanese characteristics, {{including}} the further use of traditional pentatonic scales, continued to crop up elsewhere {{in his early}} works. In the opening bars of Litany, for Michael Vyner (first movement), <b>a</b> <b>reconstruction</b> from memory by Takemitsu of Lento in Due Movimenti (1950; the original score was lost), pentatonicism is clearly visible in the upper voice, which opens the work on an unaccompanied anacrusis. The pitches of the opening melody combine to form the constituent notes of the ascending form of the Japanese in scale.|$|E

30|$|This was scientifically {{tested in}} {{part two of}} the in vitro robotic {{assessment}} with special attention to <b>a</b> combined <b>reconstruction</b> of the ALL and ACL [65]. In this study, the ALL reconstruction was able to further reduce the knee laxity when tested in conjunction with <b>an</b> ACL <b>reconstruction.</b> <b>A</b> primary finding was that during a simulated pivot-shift test, {{a significant reduction in}} internal rotation at 30 °, 45 ° and 60 ° of knee flexion was noted for the ACL reconstruction in conjunction with <b>an</b> ALL <b>reconstruction.</b> This was statistically significant when compared to the ACL reconstruction with deficient ALL testing state. Favourable isometry is seen at the proximal and posterior to epicondyle femoral position, with the ALL being tight in extension and in internal rotation at 20 ° and lax at flexion at 120 ° and internal rotation at 90 ° [41]. These characteristics are of clinical importance, enabling optimisation of the femoral location in <b>an</b> ALL <b>reconstruction.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Round Church {{includes}} three sections: the wide atrium (or courtyard), the narthex and the cella (also naos or, {{due to its}} shape, rotunda), each serving as a premise to the other. The sections were not necessarily built at the same time, and it is generally accepted that <b>a</b> <b>reconstruction</b> of the church was carried out some time after its completion. Mavrodinov and archaeologist Karel Škorpil believe the narthex and cella comprised the first building period, while the atrium was added very shortly after that and by the same architect.|$|E
5|$|The first heraldic {{symbol that}} can be {{associated}} with what would become the Portuguese nation was on the shield used by Henry of Burgundy, Count of Portugal since 1095, during his battles with the Moors.

5|$|When Congress reconvened in July, {{it passed}} <b>a</b> <b>Reconstruction</b> Act against Johnson's position, {{waited for his}} veto, {{overruled}} it, and went home. In addition to clarifying {{the powers of the}} generals, the legislation also deprived the President of control over the Army in the South.
