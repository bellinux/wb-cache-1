5|$|Slalom was {{developed}} by British video game company Rare by Tim and Chris Stamper. Rare had been looking to develop games for consoles {{in the wake of}} rampant computer game piracy in the United Kingdom. They chose the NES for its nascent popularity, though the console had no Western developers, and asked Nintendo for a license. When Nintendo declined, they reverse engineered the console and made a demo, Slalom to show the company. Nintendo was <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> their effort, and made Rare its first Western developer, beginning a long and close collaboration between Rare and Nintendo of America founder and president Minoru Arakawa.|$|E
5|$|Houston pioneered American car {{culture in}} the early 1900s thanks to the ready {{availability}} of inexpensive gasoline. By the 1920s traffic congestion had become so serious that the city became {{the first in the}} nation to install interconnected traffic lights. Visitors to the city were often <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> the lack of pedestrian access to shopping venues and the importance of the automobile within the city. Though mass transit had been successful in Houston's earlier years, later efforts aimed at promoting mass transit and urban planning were largely defeated in Houston because of opposition by the public, which favored public investment in roads over mass transit. Urban concepts pioneered in Houston, like establishing shopping centers outside the city's core and encouraging suburban sprawl, became major trends adopted in many cities, both within the state and around the country.|$|E
25|$|His {{attitude}} was as decided against the Priscillianists. Bishop Turibius of Astorga, <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> {{the spread of}} the sect in Spain, had addressed the other Spanish bishops on the subject, sending a copy of his letter to Leo, who took the opportunity to write an extended treatise (21 July 447) against the sect, examining its false teaching in detail and calling for a Spanish general council to investigate whether it had any adherents in the episcopate.|$|E
50|$|The play ran for an {{unprecedented}} 140 {{performances in the}} Boston Museums' 1844-45 season, sometimes running three times a day. This was <b>astonishing</b> <b>at</b> the time. The success of the play led {{to the beginning of}} the Temperance Movement's success.|$|R
5000|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Dave Morrison from Select magazine {{said that}} Last Rights was [...] "pretty much {{par for the}} course". He called the album [...] "genuinely <b>astonishing</b> <b>at</b> times", but concluded that it was [...] "unfocused" [...] and [...] "often collapsed under its own weight".|$|R
60|$|Miss Ross was <b>astonished</b> both <b>at</b> his {{assurance}} and at Ellice's singular {{interest and}} apparent acquiescence.|$|R
25|$|Henry {{returns to}} Mansfield parsonage, {{intending}} to entertain himself by making Fanny {{fall in love}} with him. He does not succeed but falls in love with Fanny himself. To further his suit, he uses his family connections to help Fanny's brother William gain promotion as a naval lieutenant, to her great joy and gratitude. When Henry proposes marriage, Fanny however, rejects him out of hand. Sir Thomas is <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> her refusal. He reproaches her, accusing her of ingratitude, and encourages Henry to persevere.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Battuta often {{experienced}} {{culture shock}} in regions he visited where the local customs of recently converted peoples {{did not fit}} in with his orthodox Muslim background. Among the Turks and Mongols, he was <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> the freedom and respect enjoyed by women and remarked that on seeing a Turkish couple in a bazaar one might assume {{that the man was}} the woman's servant when he was in fact her husband. He also felt that dress customs in the Maldives, and some sub-Saharan regions in Africa were too revealing.|$|E
25|$|Kovari's {{previous}} roommate, John Pape, {{reported being}} very suspicious {{that there was}} more to his friend's death than the Police were letting on. He searched on the internet for other unexplained deaths in the Barking area, and found information about the unexplained death of Port's first victim, Anthony Walgate, furthering his suspicions that Kovari's death was not accidental. He was <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> the similarities of the cases, especially the locations in which the bodies were found, however Dagenham Police did not link the two cases nor did they issue any warnings to the LGBT community.|$|E
60|$|Had {{a bombshell}} {{exploded}} at Ralph's feet {{he would have}} been no more <b>astonished</b> than <b>at</b> this declaration.|$|R

6000|$|Perhaps {{it is such}} as those, {{who have}} succoured human beings they knew not why, simply from a divine instinct, from the voice of Christ within their hearts, which they felt they must obey, though they knew not whose voice it was. Perhaps, I say, it is such as those, that Christ will <b>astonish</b> <b>at</b> the last day by the words, [...] "Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom {{prepared}} for you from {{the foundation of the}} world." ...|$|R
25|$|Bryant {{requested}} that opposing teams {{on the road}} not hold any on-court ceremonies in his honor or present him any gifts in public. Prior to announcing his retirement, he had been steadfast about not wanting the fuss of a staged farewell tour, preferring to hear boos instead of cheers. Still, he was honored around the league with video tributes, and fans greeted him with ovations, even at arenas that historically jeered him like TD Garden in Boston and Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento. Previously, Bryant was respected but not beloved, and he was <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> the cheers he was now receiving.|$|E
25|$|A betrothal feast is in progress, for Gyges {{has become}} King of Lydia and is to wed Nisia. Courtiers and nobles are present. The priests enter {{to conduct the}} {{marriage}} ceremony. They bring a sacrificial table. Gyges, crowned, leads his bride towards the table, places a hand over the holy flame and takes a vow. Nisia does the same, but the flame expires {{and there is a}} clap of thunder. The people are <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> this portent and the priests withdraw from the table. Gyges, enraptured with Nisia, ignores the warning, takes the Queen towards the gardens and commands the festival to begin.|$|E
25|$|The stadium {{hosted the}} 1941, 1951 and 1971 MLB All-Star Games. All three games {{featured}} home runs. Ted Williams won the 1941 game with an upper deck shot. The ball was also carrying {{well in the}} 1951 and 1971 games. Of the many homers in those games, the most often replayed is Reggie Jackson's drive to right field that hit so {{high up in the}} light tower that the TV camera lost sight of it, until it dropped to the field below. Jackson dropped his bat and watched it sail, seemingly <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> his own power display.|$|E

25|$|Charles Wheatstone {{was born}} in Barnwood, Gloucester. His father was a music-seller in the town, who moved to 128 Pall Mall, London, four years later, {{becoming}} a teacher of the flute. Charles, the second son, went to a village school, near Gloucester, and afterwards to several institutions in London. One of them was in Kennington, and kept by a Mrs. Castlemaine, who was <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> his rapid progress. From another he ran away, but was captured at Windsor, {{not far from the}} theatre of his practical telegraph. As a boy he was very shy and sensitive, liking well to retire into an attic, without any other company than his own thoughts.|$|E
25|$|Previously being a Nazi paratrooper Trautmann {{admitted}} {{during and}} prior {{the war he}} saw the British and Jews as enemies, however {{it was when he}} taken as a prisoner of war in England that he quickly reappraised his view of both. He was <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> his treatment as a POW, after being invited for Christmas dinner, an unthinkable luxury in an brainwashing, dictatorial Nazi Germany. Trautmann soon warmed to England that he decided to settle in the country upon repatriation in Lancashire and even changed his name from the hard to pronounce Bernhard to a more English Bert. Having taken an interest in sport, he soon played for St Helens Town and humbled when Manchester City signed him in 1949.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of tuberculosis grew progressively during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, displacing leprosy, peaking between the 18th and 19th century as field workers {{moved to the}} cities looking for work. When he released his study in 1808, William Woolcombe was <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> the prevalence of tuberculosis in 18th-century England. Of the 1,571 deaths in the English city of Bristol between 1790 and 1796, 683 were due to tuberculosis. Remote towns, initially isolated from the disease, slowly succumbed. The consumption deaths {{in the village of}} Holycross in Shropshire between 1750 and 1759 were one in six (1:6); ten years later, 1:3. In the metropolis of London, 1:7 died from consumption {{at the dawn of the}} 18th century, by 1750 that proportion grew to 1:5.25 and surged to 1:4.2 by around the start of the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution coupled with poverty and squalor created the optimal environment for the propagation of the disease.|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{had enough}} of this--at least, I've had enough," [...] said Fenwick, <b>astonishing</b> himself <b>at</b> his own boldness. [...] "Dick, Dora is in the cabin--no, she's coming up." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} {{detailed}} information in PanzerBlitz was <b>astonishing</b> <b>at</b> {{the time it}} was published. The game included technical information on the weight, speed, gun size, and crew complement of every major tank used on the Russian front. Additionally the battles - which were tactical fights - featured the detailed organizations of fairly small units, all the way from mortar teams to the trucks and wagons needed to give the units strategic flexibility. Much of this information had never been published before, outside of Army field manuals and partially classified intelligence reports.|$|R

500|$|Maxwell died in Cambridge of {{abdominal}} cancer on 5 November 1879 {{at the age}} of 48. His {{mother had}} died at the same age of the same type of cancer. The minister who regularly visited him in his last weeks was <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> his lucidity and the immense power and scope of his memory, but comments more particularly, ...|$|E
500|$|As a teenager, Presley's musical {{interests}} were wide-ranging, {{and he was}} deeply informed about African American musical idioms as well as white ones (see [...] "Teenage life in Memphis"). Though he never had any formal training, he was blessed with a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable {{by the time he}} made his first professional recordings in 1954 at the age of 19. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> his encyclopedic understanding of the blues. At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, [...] "I know practically every religious song that's ever been written." ...|$|E
500|$|Milan were {{similarly}} <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> {{the manner in}} which they had lost the final. Manager Carlo Ancelotti said, [...] "We had six minutes of madness in which we threw away the position we had reached until then". The result compounded Milan's failure to win Serie A a week before the match. Milan's vice-president, Adriano Galliani, played down the loss, asserting: [...] "Even if we come second in the league, and second in the Champions League, this is not a disastrous season for us". Captain Paolo Maldini was less optimistic, stating that the reverse was a [...] "huge disappointment", but he added that Milan would accept the defeat and [...] "go out with their heads high".|$|E
5000|$|Eternity Road: Reflections of Lowlife 85-95 is a {{compilation}} album released in 2006 by LTM, {{as part of}} their re-release of Lowlife's entire back catalogue. It served as an introduction to the band and spanned their entire career. Allmusic gave the album [...] "4.5" [...] stars (out of 5) and noted, [...] "Eternity Road taken as a whole is so shockingly good that it's practically <b>astonishing</b> <b>at</b> how the group never gained greater attention or cachet during its lifetime -- in retrospect they easily deserve mention alongside groups like The Sound and most especially The Chameleons." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Duesenberg {{brothers}} {{introduced the}} first successful straight-eight racing engine in 1920, when their 3 L engine placed third, fourth, and sixth at the Indianapolis 500. The following year one of their cars won the French Grand Prix, while two others placed fourth and sixth in the race. Based on work the company had done on 16-cylinder aircraft engines during World War I, the overhead camshaft, three-valve-per-cylinder engine produced [...] at 4,250 rpm, and was capable of revving to an <b>astonishing</b> (<b>at</b> the time) 5,000 rpm. No Grand Prix engine before the war had peaked at more than 3,000 rpm.|$|R
6000|$|The {{prisoner}} winced perceptibly. [...] "Well," [...] he said hoarsely, glancing {{towards the}} hayfork, rifle, and pistol, which still lay at Muller's feet, [...] "if you're <b>astonished,</b> look <b>at</b> the blamed Dutchman's armoury." ...|$|R
500|$|Hambleton parachuted {{into the}} middle of more than 30,000 troops pouring across the border into South Vietnam. When Hambleton's URC-64 rescue radio beeped, Jankowski responded, and was {{surprised}} to learn that Hambleton was above him descending in his parachute. Jankowski followed Hambleton down. Hambleton was concealed by a low fog bank as he landed in a dry rice paddy, unseen by the NVA troops. As Jankowski observed Hambleton land, his aircraft came under heavy antiaircraft fire. He was <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> the huge number of NVA troops, equipment, and heavy weapons in the area. Hambleton found refuge in a group of bushes {{in the middle of the}} rice paddy. NVA troops were less than [...] away. Jankowski fixed Hambleton's location [...] north of the Cam Lo Bridge and just north of TL-88, a major east-west secondary road.|$|E
500|$|Chen Shirong, China editor on the BBC World Service, remarked at the {{improvement}} in media management by Xinhua: [...] "To be more credible, it released video footage {{a few hours after}} the event, not two weeks." [...] Peter Foster of the Daily Telegraph observed that [...] "long-standing China commentators have been <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> the speed at which Beijing has moved to seize the news agenda on this event," [...] and attributed it to his belief that [...] "China doesn't have a great deal to hide". A University of California, Berkeley academic agreed that the Chinese authorities had become more sophisticated. The New York Times and AFP recognised the Chinese learnt lessons from political protests around the world, such as the so-called colour revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine, and the 2009 Iranian election protests, and concluded that Chinese experts had studied how modern electronic communications [...] "helped protesters organize and reach the outside world, and for ways that governments sought to counter them." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1862, Darwin welcomed {{favourable}} {{reviews in}} the press and wrote to Hooker; [...] "Well my orchis-book is a success (but I do not know whether it sells) after cursing my folly in writing it". He told his publisher, [...] "The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies", and to Asa Gray he said, [...] "I am fairly <b>astonished</b> <b>at</b> the success of my book with botanists." [...] Darwin's geologist friend Charles Lyell gave it enthusiastic praise: [...] "next to the Origin, as the most valuable of all Darwin's works." [...] However, the book attracted little attention from the general public, and in September Darwin told his cousin Fox, [...] "Hardly any one not a botanist, except yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it." [...] The book baffled a general public more interested in controversy over gorillas and cavemen. There were some reviews in gardening magazines, but few natural philosophers or zoologists noticed the book, and hardly any learned appraisals appeared.|$|E
