5|$|Complementing his {{interest}} in the foundations of general relativity and, more generally, of physics, Ehlers researched the history of physics. Up until his death, he collaborated in a project on the history of quantum theory at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928. Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in the philosophical foundations <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> of physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as the basic status of scientific knowledge in physics.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy {{of science}} is a {{sub-field}} of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> of science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and truth.|$|E

The topics addressed are object lifetime <b>and</b> its <b>implications</b> for storage management, dynamic typing <b>and</b> its <b>implications</b> for object representation, aliasing <b>and</b> its <b>implications</b> for interference between operations, parameter passing <b>and</b> its <b>implications</b> for communication, <b>and</b> sharing <b>and</b> its <b>implications</b> for contention.
