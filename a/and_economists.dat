5|$|Thatcher's {{economic}} policy {{was influenced by}} monetarist thinking <b>and</b> <b>economists</b> such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. Together with Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe, she lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes. She increased interest rates to slow {{the growth of the}} money supply and thereby lower inflation, introduced cash limits on public spending, and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing. Cuts to higher education resulted in her becoming the first Oxford-educated post-war Prime Minister without an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, after a 738–319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.|$|E
5|$|The {{decisions}} reached {{during this}} period vary, however, mostly due to the differing judicial philosophies of the time. While A.V. Dicey maintained that the prevalent philosophy was one of laissez faire thanks {{to the influence of}} philosophers <b>and</b> <b>economists</b> such as Adam Smith, Michael W. Flinn asserted that: Another common error... has been the assumption that the classical economists were the only effective influence on social and economic policy in the early and mid-nineteenth century. This is a curiously perverse view, since it ignores powerful voices like those of Bentham, Chadwick, the social novelists, many by no means inarticulate members of the medical profession, the humanitarians, the Christian Socialists and most sections of the many working class movements. There was in short, nothing approaching a consensus of opinion concerning laissez-faire and state intervention, even in the very narrow social sector represented by governments, Parliament, and the press. In practice the ears of ministers were assaulted by a confused babble of voices rather than bewitched by the soft whisper of a single plea for inaction.|$|E

25|$|A {{popular and}} {{representative}} topic {{in this area}} is cognitive bias, or irrational thought. Psychologists (<b>and</b> <b>economists)</b> have classified and described a sizeable catalogue of biases which recur frequently in human thought. The availability heuristic, for example, is the tendency to overestimate the importance of something which happens to come readily to mind.|$|E
25|$|Mukherjee {{implemented}} many tax reforms. He scrapped the Fringe Benefits Tax and the Commodities Transaction Tax. He {{implemented the}} Goods and Services Tax during his tenure. These reforms were well received by major corporate executives <b>and</b> <b>economists.</b> The introduction of retrospective taxation by Mukherjee, however, has been criticised by some economists.|$|E

25|$|There is {{debate between}} {{politicians}} <b>and</b> <b>economists</b> {{over the role}} of tax policy in mitigating or exacerbating wealth inequality. Economists such as Paul Krugman, Peter Orszag, and Emmanuel Saez have argued that tax policy in the post World War II era has indeed increased income inequality by enabling the wealthiest Americans far greater access to capital than lower-income ones.|$|E
25|$|Although income {{thresholds}} {{cannot be}} determined since social classes lack distinct boundaries {{and tend to}} overlap, sociologists <b>and</b> <b>economists</b> have put forward certain income figures they find indicative of middle class households. Sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies a husband making roughly $57,000 and a wife making roughly $40,000 with a household income of roughly $97,000 as a typical middle-class family.|$|E
25|$|Carnegie Mellon is {{also home}} to the Carnegie School of {{management}} and economics. This intellectual school grew out of the Tepper School of Business in the 1950s and 1960s and focused on the intersection of behavioralism and management.

25|$|Modern sociologists <b>and</b> <b>economists</b> such as Juliet Schor and Robert H. Frank {{have studied}} {{the extent to which}} {{economic}} activity is fueled by the ability of consumption to represent social status. Schor, in The Overspent American, argues that the increasing inequality during the 1980s and 1990s strongly accounts for increasing aspirations of income, increased consumption, decreased savings, and increased debt.|$|E

25|$|According {{to social}} {{exchange}} theory, relationships {{are based on}} rational choice and cost-benefit analysis. If one partner's costs begin to outweigh his or her benefits, that person may leave the relationship, especially if there are good alternatives available. This theory {{is similar to the}} minimax principle proposed by mathematicians <b>and</b> <b>economists</b> (despite the fact that human relationships are not zero-sum games). With time, long term relationships tend to become communal rather than simply based on exchange.|$|E
25|$|Various {{other early}} social historians <b>and</b> <b>economists</b> have gained {{recognition}} as classical sociologists, including Robert Michels (1876–1936), Alexis de Tocqueville (1805–1859), Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923) and Thorstein Veblen (1857–1926). The classical sociological texts broadly differ from political philosophy {{in the attempt}} to remain scientific, systematic, structural, or dialectical, rather than purely moral, normative or subjective. The new class relations associated with the development of Capitalism are also key, further distinguishing sociological texts from the political philosophy of the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras.|$|E
25|$|One {{empirical}} study supports performance-based pricing {{by analyzing}} the block-level price elasticity of parking demand in the SFpark context. The study suggests that block-level elasticities vary so widely that urban planners <b>and</b> <b>economists</b> cannot accurately predict the response in parking demand to a given change in price. The public policy implication is that planners should utilize observed occupancy rates in order to adjust prices so that target occupancy rates are achieved. Effective implementation will require further experimentation with and assessment of the tâtonnement process.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that some transgenic plants may some day be developed which would allow for maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil-fuel-derived inputs than conventional crops. The possibility of success of these programs is questioned by ecologists <b>and</b> <b>economists</b> concerned with unsustainable GMO practices such as terminator seeds. While there has been some research on sustainability using GMO crops, at least one prominent multi-year attempt by Monsanto Company has been unsuccessful, though during the same period traditional breeding techniques yielded a more sustainable variety of the same crop.|$|E
25|$|On 12 October 2010, The Refectory of the Leeds University Union {{hosted a}} live {{edition of the}} Channel 4 News, with students, {{academics}} <b>and</b> <b>economists</b> expressing their reaction to the Browne Review, an independent review of Higher Education funding and student finance conducted by John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley. University of Leeds Vice-Chancellor and Russell Group chairman Michael Arthur participated, giving an academic perspective alongside current vice-chancellor of Kingston University and former Pro Vice-Chancellor and Professor of Education at the University of Leeds, Sir Peter Scott. Midway through the broadcast {{a small group of}} protesters against the potential rise of student debt entered the building before being restrained and evacuated.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate comparative exchange rates with modern currency because the range of products produced by economies of centuries gone by were different from today, which makes purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations very difficult; however, some historians <b>and</b> <b>economists</b> have estimated that in the 5th century BC a drachma had a rough value of 25 U.S. dollars (in the year 1990 – equivalent to 46.50 USD in 2015), whereas classical historians regularly {{say that in the}} heyday of ancient Greece (the fifth and fourth centuries) the daily wage for a skilled worker or a hoplite was one drachma, and for a heliast (juror) half a drachma since 425BC.|$|E
