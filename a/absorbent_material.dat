5|$|An {{additional}} 4.6 billion tonnes {{of uranium}} {{are estimated to}} be in sea water (Japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible). There have been experiments to extract uranium from sea water, but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water. In 2012, ORNL researchers announced the successful development of a new <b>absorbent</b> <b>material</b> dubbed HiCap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.|$|E

40|$|In this research, super <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials</b> were {{incorporated}} into the internal layer of the firefighters&# 039; protective clothing {{with the aim of}} increasing absorption of sweat to improve the thermo-physiological comfort properties. The performance properties were evaluated following the standard test methods (ISO 6942 : 2002 and ISO 9151 : 1995 (E)) and the thermo-physiological comfort-related properties were evaluated by measuring the transport properties such as air permeability, water sorption and evaporation, thermal resistance and water vapour resistance of the fabric assemblies with super <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials.</b> The results indicated {{that it is possible to}} improve the comfort properties of the protective clothing by the incorporation of super <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials</b> into the internal layer. The use of super <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials</b> is likely to help in the absorption of sweat in higher amount and keeping the skin and internal microclimate dry, which in turn improves the comfort level.

25|$|A tampon is {{a mass of}} <b>absorbent</b> <b>material</b> into a body cavity or {{wound to}} absorb bodily fluid.

500|$|Waffle-iron {{filters are}} used in {{industrial}} microwave processes. [...] The many industrial applications of microwave energy include drying of food products and industrial films, heating, such as in polyurethane foam production, melting, rendering, sterilising, and vulcanisation. [...] In high-volume production the process is continuous necessitating openings to the microwave chamber where the product can be fed in and exit. [...] Steps {{need to be taken}} to prevent unsafe levels of microwave radiation escaping from these apertures which are often large to accommodate the product. [...] It is usual to line the product feed ducts with microwave <b>absorbent</b> <b>material</b> for this purpose. [...] However, the absorbed microwaves have a heating effect and this can be severe enough to damage the <b>absorbent</b> <b>material.</b> [...] Waffle-iron filters are a useful alternative because the product can be passed between the filter's teeth. [...] An ideal filter will reflect all the unwanted radiation rather than absorbing it so will not suffer from overheating. [...] This {{is an example of a}} filter being used in a choke application. [...] In some processes both techniques are used simultaneously. [...] The waffle-iron is placed nearest the microwave chamber to first reduce the energy to a level which will not cause the absorbent lining to overheat. [...] The absorbent lining then removes the small residue.Metaxas and Meredith, pp.301–303 ...|$|E

500|$|From a {{sanitary}} perspective, the pail {{system of}} waste removal was imperfect. [...] Excreta and other general waste were often left above ground for hours, sometimes even {{days at a}} time.

500|$|In the nineties, a {{reactive}} armour package, named BRENUS or Brennus, {{was developed}} for the AMX-30B2, but was issued only to two tank regiments, which in peacetime were combined into the 1er/ 2e Chasseurs, {{that were part of}} France's rapid reaction force; the other two regiments using the AMX-30, the 2e/5e Dragons, only had their tanks adapted for a possible relatively quick upgrade, in case of an emergency. The BRENUS system used 112 GIAT BS (Brique de Surblindage) G2 explosive reactive boxes with a total weight of , offering a protection equivalent to [...] of steel at 60°. Recently, the AMX-30 has also been used as a testbed for several stealth technologies, including air cooling of hull surfaces and the use of visual camouflage.

500|$|Absorption filters {{dissipate}} {{the energy}} in unwanted frequencies internally as heat. [...] This {{is in contrast}} to a conventional filter design where the unwanted frequencies are reflected back from the input port of the filter. [...] Such filters are used where it is undesirable for power to be sent back towards the source. [...] This is the case with high power transmitters where returning power can be high enough to damage the transmitter. [...] An absorption filter may be used to remove transmitter spurious emissions such as harmonics or spurious sidebands. [...] A design that has been in use for some time has slots cut in the walls of the feed waveguide at regular intervals. [...] This design is known as a leaky-wave filter. [...] Each slot is connected to a smaller gauge waveguide which is too small to support propagation of frequencies in the wanted band. [...] Thus those frequencies are unaffected by the filter. [...] Higher frequencies in the unwanted band, however, readily propagate along the side guides which are terminated with a matched load where the power is absorbed. [...] These loads are usually a wedge shaped piece of microwave <b>absorbent</b> <b>material.</b> [...] Another, more compact, design of absorption filter uses resonators with a lossy dielectric.|$|E

500|$|Some pails were {{supplied}} with deodorants such as iron sulphate. [...] Manchester Corporation attempted {{to remove the}} smell of putrefaction by attaching cinder-sifters to their closets so that fine ash could be poured {{on top of the}} excrement. [...] The Goux system, invented in the 1860s by Pierre Nicholas Goux, a landowner near Paris, and widely used in France, overcame some of the more common problems associated with pail closets by lining the pail with an <b>absorbent</b> <b>material.</b> [...] The Rochdale Corporation experimented with Goux's design for several months but settled instead on a system which used smaller pails. [...] Goux's system did, however, find a home in Halifax, where it was used in more than 3,000closets after 1870. [...] The wooden pails used in Halifax were oval in cross-section (about 24 by 19inches) and 16inches deep. [...] Each was lined at the sides and bottom with a mixture of refuse, such as straw, grass, street sweepings, wool, hair, and even seaweed. [...] This lining, which was formed by a special mould and to which sulphate of lime was added, was designed to help remove the smell of urine, slow putrefaction and keep the excreta dry. [...] Pails were collected between 7am and 5:30pm. [...] Members of the public occasionally complained about the smell, which usually occurred when a pail was left to overflow, such as in winter 1875 when severe weather conditions prevented the horse-pulled collection wagons from reaching the closets.|$|E

40|$|On April 20 th, 2010 the Deepwater Horizon {{drilling}} rig in the Gulf of Mexico malfunctioned {{leading to a}} 4. 9 million barrel oil spill. The released oil affected marine life, coastal ecosystems, and the economic framework of the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf spill spurred research on <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials</b> and engineering outreach. Crude oil can be removed by adsorbent or <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials</b> or through bioremediation. Sheep wool and other <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials</b> were used for surface clean-up experiments and evaluated using absorbency ratio metrics. Educational modules were developed to bring engineering applications to K- 12 outreach programs. Additionally, mushroom mycelia act as a filter for contaminants in ecosystems and can bioremediate hydrocarbon compounds. Oyster mushroom mycelium were cultivated and used to test bioremediation of crude oil in a controlled environment. Absorbency ratios ranged between 3. 97 to 14. 7 mL oil per gram material. Educational modules reached 800 students and 20 middle school teachers between June and September 2010. Many outreach programs continue to use the material that was developed. Bioremediation experiments did not yield conclusive results, but small mushroom growth was seen in Petri dish trials grown with deionized water. Future work includes analysis of crude oil concentration after mycelium degradation, effect of introduction of mushroom mycelium into gulf region, and sheep wool material analysis...|$|R
