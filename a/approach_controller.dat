25|$|The <b>approach</b> <b>controller</b> {{vectored}} Flight 809 into Runway 30L at St. Louis. Although {{the flight}} crew knew thunderstorms were {{in the vicinity of}} the airport, the controllers lack of urgency seemed to lead {{the flight crew}} to believe they could land ahead of the storms.|$|E
25|$|The flight {{controller}} and <b>approach</b> <b>controller</b> were experienced professionals {{with at least}} 10 years of service. The ground controller on duty, who was 23 years old, was new. He supposedly had not had enough sleep {{in the days before}} the accident, having had to care for his two young children.|$|E
25|$|The {{main runway}} uses a Category III Instrument Landing System (ILS). The {{northern}} runway {{does not have}} an ILS; when it is in use, arriving aircraft use a combination of distance measuring equipment and assistance from the <b>approach</b> <b>controller</b> (using surveillance radar) or (where equipped, and subject to operator approval) an RNAV (GNSS) approach (also available for the main runway). On both runways, a continuous descent approach is used to minimise the environmental effects of incoming aircraft, particularly at night.|$|E

25|$|The Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) Boeing 747-168B, {{registration}} HZ-AIH, {{was flying}} {{the first leg}} of a scheduled international Delhi–Dhahran–Jeddah passenger service as Flight SVA763 with 312 occupants on board; the Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76TD, registration UN-76435, was on a charter service from Chimkent to Delhi as KZA1907. SVA763 departed Delhi at 18:32 local time. KZA1907 was, at the same time, descending to land at Delhi. Both flights were controlled by <b>approach</b> <b>controller</b> VK Dutta. The crew of SVA763 consisted of Captain Khalid Al Shubaily, First Officer Nazir Khan, and Flight Engineer Edris. On KZA1907, Gennadi Cherepanov served as the pilot and Egor Repp served as the radio operator.|$|E
25|$|A State {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by a}} chain of mistakes owing to the negligence of air traffic controllers, as well as disobedience of basic airport maintenance and safety regulations. The ground controller was found directly responsible, as he fell asleep on the job and thus did not respond to emergency queries; he also allowed the service trucks to move onto the runway and did not mark the runway as occupied. At a hearing, he could not recollect his actions during the time in question, but did not deny the charges. He was sentenced to 15 years and committed suicide in prison. In addition, the flight operations manager was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the <b>approach</b> <b>controller</b> to 13 years, and the head of airport maintenance to 12 years. All three appealed their sentences, to no avail. Future inspections at numerous other Soviet airports also found similar types and numbers of violations of safety regulations, resulting in the firing of several high-level officials thereafter.|$|E

50|$|The {{location}} of the crash was close to built-up areas of Bratislava and very popular with hikers.

40|$|Traditionally, when <b>approaching</b> <b>controller</b> {{design with}} the Youla-Ku cera {{parametrization}} of all stabilizing controllers, the denominator of the rational parameter is fixed {{to a given}} stable polynomial, and optimization is carried out over the numerator polynomial. In this work, we revisit this design technique, allowing to optimize simultaneously over the numerator and denominator polynomials. Stability of the denominator polynomial, as well as fixed-order controller design with H# performance are ensured via {{the notion of a}} central polynomial and LMI conditions for polynomial positivity...|$|R

2500|$|Around 5:36 am, Flight 3352 {{requested}} {{permission to}} {{land from the}} <b>approach</b> <b>controller.</b> The request was sent twice; the pilots noticed vague contours on the runway and wanted to double check for obstacles. The controller verified the runway status, which remained apparently unoccupied, then contacted the ground controller and received no response, and subsequently contacted the flight controller on internal radio and received an inaudible reply that sounded like [...] "..ree" [...] (original, [...] ) and was taken as [...] "free" [...] ( [...] ; communications were being taped and were analyzed later). The <b>approach</b> <b>controller</b> cleared the landing, though unable to see the runway, {{and in spite of}} regulations that required him to keep the flight in the air and double check the runway's status. Both the ground controller and secondary controller {{should have been able to}} see the runway, but the former was asleep, and the latter was absent due to staff shortages.|$|E

In an additional human-in-the loop experiment 4 D-CARMA supports the controllers to integrate unequipped aircraft into a stream of 4 D equipped ones performing a user-preferred CDA approach. ...|$|R
25|$|No pilot error or {{aircraft}} deficiency was found. Flight {{mass and}} centering were within norms. Owing to poor visibility, the crew could not detect the obstructions on the runway. While {{they did have}} some reasonable doubts {{as to whether or}} not the runway was occupied, these were allayed by the <b>approach</b> <b>controller's</b> reassurances. The crew had only a few seconds to avoid the collision on the ground; they took evasive action, but could not possibly save the aircraft. They were thus absolved of any blame.|$|R

We built a prototype that was evaluated against a comparable mouse interaction concept. In our preliminary study, five test persons were asked to guide air traffic in a realistic scenario with both the multi-touch and mouse mock-up. Usability and workload were assessed. The results revealed higher usability scores for the multi-touch mock-up, whereas the workload evaluation showed no clear trend for either interaction concept...|$|R

50|$|In {{conjunction}} with the slated {{construction of a new}} ATC tower at PBIA, the Federal Aviation Administration intended to transfer all of PBIA's air traffic controllers whose assigned sector is between 5 and 40 mi from the airport to a remote facility at Miami International Airport. Ground traffic <b>controllers,</b> and <b>approach</b> <b>controllers</b> whose sector is within 5 mi of the runway would have remained at PBIA. The FAA cited the move as a cost-cutting measure, but critics say that it creates a risk to South Florida air traffic if the Miami facility is damaged in a hurricane, or terrorist attack. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association opposed the move. The remote facility at Miami International Airport houses air traffic controllers for Miami and Fort Lauderdale international airports.|$|R
50|$|The {{implementation}} of the SDN control plane can follow a centralized, hierarchical, or decentralized design. Initial SDN control plane proposals focused on a centralized solution, where a single control entity has a global view of the network. While this simplifies the {{implementation of}} the control logic, it has scalability limitations as the size and dynamics of the network increase. To overcome these limitations, several approaches have been proposed in the literature that fall into two categories, hierarchical and fully distributed approaches. In hierarchical solutions, distributed controllers operate on a partitioned network view, while decisions that require network-wide knowledge are taken by a logically centralized root <b>controller.</b> In distributed <b>approaches,</b> <b>controllers</b> operate on their local view or they may exchange synchronization messages to enhance their knowledge. Distributed solutions are more suitable for supporting adaptive SDN applications.|$|R

At 21:26, after the decision had already been made, the crew asked the controller about the latest observed weather.
