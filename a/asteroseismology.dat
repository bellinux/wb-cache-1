5|$|Theta Tucanae {{is a white}} A-type star around 423 light-years {{distant from}} Earth, which is {{actually}} a close binary system. The main star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable—a class of short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars {{that have been used}} as standard candles and as subjects to study <b>asteroseismology.</b> It is around double the Sun's mass, having siphoned off one whole solar mass from its companion, now a hydrogen-depleted dwarf star of around only 0.2 solar masses. The system shines with a combined light that varies between magnitudes 6.06 to 6.15 every 70 to 80 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The ESO 3.6-metre {{telescope}} began {{operations in}} 1977. It has been upgraded, including {{the installation of}} a new secondary mirror. The conventionally designed horseshoe-mount telescope was primarily used for infrared spectroscopy; it now hosts the HARPS spectrograph, used in search of extra-solar planets and for <b>asteroseismology.</b> The telescope was designed for very high long-term radial velocity accuracy (on the order of 1m/s).|$|E
25|$|The Euler Telescope is a 1.2-metre {{telescope}} {{built and}} operated by the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland. It is used to conduct high-precision radial velocity measurements primarily used {{in the search for}} large extrasolar planets in the southern celestial hemisphere. Its first discovery was a planet orbiting Gliese 86. Other observing programmes focus on variable stars, <b>asteroseismology,</b> gamma-ray bursts, monitoring active galactic nuclei (AGN) and gravitational lenses.|$|E
500|$|Around [...] {{away and}} around 10times as {{luminous}} as the Sun, 21Leonis Minoris is a rapidly rotating white main-sequence star, spinning on its axis {{in less than}} 12hours and very likely flattened in shape. Of average apparent magnitude 4.5 and spectral type A7V, it is a Delta Scuti variable. These are short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars which {{have been used as}} standard candles and as subjects to study <b>asteroseismology.</b>|$|E
500|$|Traditionally {{known as}} Pherkad, Gamma Ursae Minoris has an {{apparent}} magnitude that varies between 3.04 and 3.09 roughly every 3.4hours. It and Kochab have been termed the [...] "guardians {{of the pole}} star". A white bright giant of spectral type A3II-III, with around 4.8times the Sun's mass, 1,050times its luminosity and 15times its radius, it is 487±8 light-years distant from Earth. Pherkad belongs to a class of stars known as Delta Scuti variables—short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars {{that have been used}} as standard candles and as subjects to study <b>asteroseismology.</b> Also possibly a member of this class is Zeta Ursae Minoris, a white star of spectral type A3V, which has begun cooling, expanding and brightening. It is likely to have been a B3 main-sequence star and is now slightly variable. At magnitude 4.95 the dimmest of the seven stars of the Little Dipper is Eta Ursae Minoris. A yellow-white main-sequence star of spectral type F5V, it is 97 light-years distant. It is double the Sun's diameter, 1.4times as massive, and shines with 7.4times its luminosity. Nearby Zeta lies 5.00-magnitude Theta Ursae Minoris. Located 860 ± 80light-years distant, it is an orange giant of spectral type K5III that has expanded and cooled off the main sequence, and has an estimated diameter around 4.8times that of the Sun.|$|E

2500|$|... 18 Scorpii is a main {{sequence}} star of spectral and luminosity type G2Va, with the luminosity class of 'V' indicating it is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in its core region. Sousa et al. (2008) found its metallicity {{to be about}} 1.1 {{times that of the}} Sun, which means the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium is 10% greater. The radius of this star, as measured using interferometry by Bazot et al. (2011), is 101% the radius of the Sun. When combined with the results of <b>asteroseismology</b> measurements, this allows the mass of the star to be estimated as 102% of the Sun's mass. This star is radiating 106% of the Sun's luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 5,433K. It is this heat that gives the star the yellow-hued glow of a G-type star.|$|E
2500|$|Age {{determination}} of this star shows some variation {{based on the}} method used. Statistically, for stars hosting a debris disk, the luminosity of this star suggests an age of about 20–150 million years. Comparison with stars having similar motion through space gives an age in the range 30–160 million years. Given the star's position on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of luminosity versus temperature, it has an estimated age {{in the range of}} 30–1,128 million years. λ Boötis stars like this are generally young, {{with a mean age of}} a billion years. More accurately, <b>asteroseismology</b> also suggests an age of approximately a billion years. [...] However, this is disputed because it would make the planets become brown dwarfs to fit into the cooling models. [...] Brown dwarfs would not be stable in such a configuration. [...] The best accepted value for an age of HR 8799 is 30 million years, consistent with being a member of the Columba Association co-moving group of stars.|$|E
2500|$|Helioseismology is {{the process}} of {{inferring}} the internal structure and kinematics of the Sun from the propagation of seismic waves, particularly acoustic waves (p waves) and surface gravity waves (f waves). It was developed by analogy to geoseismology (originally called simply seismology), and subsequently there emerged <b>asteroseismology,</b> in which seismic waves are analysed to constrain the internal structures of other stars. Because the Sun is fluid, to a first approximation it cannot support shear waves (s-waves), unlike the seismic waves on Earth. An exception is the magneto-acoustic waves which appear to be important only in the atmosphere. The helioseismic waves are generated by the turbulence in the convection zone immediately beneath the Sun's surface. Certain frequencies are amplified by constructive interference, leading to resonance. In other words, the turbulence [...] "rings" [...] the sun like a bell. The resonant waves are reflected near the photosphere, the visible surface of the sun, where they can be observed. The oscillations are detectable in almost any time series of solar images, but are best observed by measuring the Doppler shift of atmospheric absorption lines. Details of the propagation of the seismic waves through the Sun, inferred from the resonant frequencies, reveal the Sun's inner structure, allowing astrophysicists to develop an extremely detailed representation of the hydrostatic stratification and the internal angular velocity. That has permitted the evaluation of the quadrupole moment, , and higher-order moments [...] of the Sun's external gravitational potential. It is a more accurate and more robust procedure than trying to infer it from the oblateness of the visible disc. Together with measurements of the orbits of Mercury and of spacecraft, the result is consistent with General Relativity.|$|E
5000|$|The TESS {{team also}} plans to use a 30-minute {{observation}} cadence for full-frame images, which has been noted for imposing a hard Nyquist limit that can be problematic for <b>asteroseismology</b> of stars.

50|$|<b>Asteroseismology</b> is {{the study}} of {{oscillations}} in stars. Because a star's different oscillation modes are sensitive to different parts of the star, they inform astronomers about the internal structure of the star, which is otherwise not directly possible from overall properties like brightness and surface temperature. <b>Asteroseismology</b> is closely related to helioseismology, the study of stellar oscillations specifically in the Sun. Though both are based on the same underlying physics, more and qualitatively different information is available for the Sun because its surface can be resolved.|$|E
