Two or three km north of Kazanlak the rivers Eninska and Kranska are connected by a drain carrying off the water directed towards the town.

50|$|Its usually quoted {{source is}} a {{combination}} of several streams, which rise on slopes of hills (Przejmowa Góra - 213.4m, Jastrzębia Góra - 230.8m, Słupowa Góra - 247.9 m, Lisia Góra - 259.5 m) southward of an old forest, Puszcza Romincka located southeast of Gołdap. The river proper rises from a lake called Jezioro Czarne and flows in a south and south-eastern direction through a series of nine postglacial lakes: Rospuda Filipowska, Kamienne, Długie, Garbas, Głębokie, Sumowo, Okrągłe, Bolesty, and The Rospuda Augustowska into which it finally empties. The Rospuda flows through typical young glacial landforms: postglacial channel lakes, eskers (long, narrow, winding ridges composed of stratified sand and gravel), and flat outwash plains. This landscape results from Scandinavian ice sheet activity during the Baltic glaciation: the postglacial channel in which the Rospuda flows was dug by a stream flowing underneath the ice sheet; eskers were composed of material accumulated by flowing water, and the outwash is a vast <b>alluvial</b> <b>cone</b> of sand and gravel deposited by a subglacial meltwater stream. In {{the upper reaches of the}} river, in the stretches between lakes, the Rospuda has a narrow winding channel of a rocky bed with rapids, for which it slightly resembles a mountain stream. The Rospuda flows through forests and meadows, within a narrow steep-sided valley with numerous bends, gorges, and felled trees. Narrow postglacial channel lakes flow for miles: Rospuda Filipowska and Bolesty, the longest two, are 3.6 mi long and only 0.25 - 0.5 mi wide. Their banks are high and forested or covered in meadows and cut across with ravines. These interesting landforms are attributable to erosion, the outcome of flowing rainwaters. In the lower reaches of the river, where it enters Augustów Primeval Forest, the Rospuda changes into a typically lowland river. It meanders through reeds within a boggy riparian valley, passing Święte Miejsce and Młyńsko, sacred sites in the region. The channel of the river gets wider forming a basin of peat bog, i.e. the Rospuda Valley (Pol. Dolina Rospudy).|$|E

5000|$|The {{middle of}} the Eisbach valley was already being {{exploited}} in the Old Stone Age by ice age hunters and gatherers. This is evinced by stone tools from the Middle Stone Age that were discovered in Asselheim. Other finds from Asselheim date to the Late Stone Age and the Mesolithic. But the permanent presence of man in the Eisbach valley began with the population explosion of the New Stone Age. Neolithic settlements were established at the Wormser Adlerberg, in Weinsheim, Horchheim, Wiesoppenheim, Albsheim an der Eis and Asselheim. The Wormser Adlerberg is a small eminence, piled up by the Eisbach, where the high ground which is secure from flooding, reaches {{right up to the}} banks of the Rhine. Other similarly favourable sites in Worms itself are the Domberg and the Rheingewann, an <b>alluvial</b> <b>cone</b> {{at the mouth of the}} Pfrimm. These bridgeheads offered good crossing sites over the river. The valleys of the Pfrimm and the Eis form natural corridors through the hills and were therefore important east-west routes from the Rhine through the Kaiserslautern Basin to Gaul even in prehistoric times. Its location as a natural communications hub was the reason Worms was founded. [...] "Of all the streams that empty into the Rhine north and south of Worms, only the Pfrimm and the Eis were of any great importance, because they formed the only riverside high ground suitable for settlements in the Rhine Plain." [...] Although long-distance trade experienced an important upsurge during the Bronze Age, there have been almost no Bronze Age finds in the upper Eis valley. In the Iron Age the upper Eis valley was also settled. Certainly by Roman times, if not before, iron ore was being mined in the area of Ramsen and iron smelting in Eisenberg. In Eisenberg, a Roman vicus grew up with the character of a small industrial town. The important trunk road through the Eisbach valley was fortified in Roman times, but was only classified as a secondary Roman road. In Eisenberg there was a beneficarius station, which underscored the importance of the route. The road along the Pfrimm was however always more important that the one through the Eisbach valley. In Roman times there were numerous Roman estates in the valleys of the Eis and the Pfrimm, which followed one another in quick succession. Roman rule came to an end in the second half of the 5th century. Frankish settlement of the Eisbach valley began in the late 5th century. Almost all the present-day Eisbach villages go back to Frankish settlements that were founded between the end of the 5th century and the 8th century. The road from Metz to Worms via Kaiserslautern through the Eisbach valley played a central role in the settlement. This road increased further in importance during the Merovingian era because it linked Metz, the capital of the eastern part of the empire, Austrasia, with the Upper Rhine region. During the Saxon Wars, Charlemagne used Worms as an assembly area for his troops, because there, near the Palatinate, was sufficient room and plentiful supplies for large armies.|$|E

The Western Cordillera of the Andes Mountains rises abruptly east of the city and reaches altitudes of 6, 100 m (20, 000 ft) only 130 km (80 mi) from the Pacific Ocean. The Andes in Central Peru are relatively young mountains with the oldest exposed rock being pyroclastics of the upper Jurassic Puente Piedra Group. These are overlain by lower Cretaceous shales and quartzites of the Morro-Solar Group, followed by 1, 000 m of limestone of the Pamplona and Atocongo formations of lower to middle Cretaceous age. In middle and upper Cretaceous time, volcanism resumed and 1, 500 m of andesites and pyroclastics were deposited to form the Casma Group which forms the bedrock at the highest stratigraphic level. The unconformably overlying <b>alluvial</b> <b>cones</b> and beach sediments formed during the rapid rise of the Andes have been dissected by rejuvenated down-cutting to as much as 20 m (62 ft) at Lima. The geology of the Lima region reflects the subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate and consequent uplift and volcanic activity. The structural geology of the bedrock underlying the Quaternary sediments in the city of Lima is dominated by the northwest-trending Lima anticline and associated synclines and reverse faults. This anticline is asymmetrical with dips of 5 to 20 degrees on the west and 35 degrees on the east.

Río Dulce <b>alluvial</b> <b>cone</b> in Santiago del Estero Province (NW Argentina) was selected as an area to investigate the complex hydrological and geochemical conditions that control the distribution and mobilization of As in groundwater from these shallow alluvial aquifers. Average total As (Astot) concentration was 743 µg/L, with significant spatial variability. Arsenic domains with concentrations of up to 14, 969 µg/L were also identified in some parts of the study area. In most water samples, As(V) was the dominant species. Average concentrations of Al, Mn, and Fe were 360 µg/L, 574 µg/L, and 459 µg/L, respectively. Extraction of sediments and interlayered volcanic ash with 7 M HNO 3 indicated AsNO 3 concentrations ranging between 2. 5 - 7. 1 mg/kg and indicated significant positive correlations with MnNO 3, AlNO 3, and FeNO 3. Oxalate extractions revealed significant fractions of As (Asox) in the sediments (0. 4 - 1. 4 mg/kg) and a dominance of oxalate extractable Al- and Mn. Speciation calculations indicated that Fe and Al oxide and hydroxides have the potential to precipitate in the groundwater, suggesting that they may be significant arsenic adsorbents. Mobility of As seems to depend on high pH values locally, related to the dissolution of carbonates driven by cation exchange, and dissolution of silicates. Hierarchical cluster analysi...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Many alpine torrents convey {{regularly}} debris {{flows of}} high destructive hazard. After several granular events observed in Bruchji’s torrent near the Blatten {{village in the}} Swiss Alps, {{it was decided to}} manage the risk of similar debris flows by designing and constructing a control structure inside the torrent bed. Associated with a breach in the right bank side of the torrent, this control structure should divert part of the moderate and high debris flow events toward the original <b>alluvial</b> <b>cone.</b> Two different configurations of the control structure were tested and optimized through a series of physical tests. The basic concept of this structure is to create a local lateral contraction of the torrent section topped by a horizontal rack or by a deflector beam. A physical model at the scale of 1 : 20 was built and granular debris flows were simulated by four successive discrete pulses. The behavior of the structure was tested inside the linear part and inside the bend of the channel reach. The geometry and dimensions of the control structure were also optimized to divert laterally a maximum volume of debris flow materials. This paper describes the physical model experiments, presents and discusses the main test results, and proposes an optimized geometry of the control structure. The most efficient configuration consists of a unilateral contract of the channel flow section inside a channel bend and to install a deflector beam...|$|E

In {{the study of the}} detailed problems of this area many of the observations made suggest general relationships involving the White Mountains as a whole. The White Mountains consist of a tilted horst block, raised along marginal faults which separate the range from the relatively depressed graben blocks on either side; Owens Valley on the west, Fish Lake Valley on the east. The range trends northwest-southeast, having an average elevation of 11, 000 feet. The area is characterised by extremely rugged topography. The physiographic features include steep, straight, marginal scarps, jagged ridges, precipitous V-shaped valleys, a relatively flat crest area, glacial cirques and moraine covered U-shaped valleys, and giant <b>alluvial</b> <b>cones</b> complicated by faulting and stream rejuvination. Both sedimentary and igneous rocks occur in the area. The sediments include old pre-Cambrian rocks and young quaternary material. The older sediments have been folded, faulted, intruded, and, for the most part, highly metamorphosed. They include conglomerates, quartzites, phyllites, argillites, limestones, dolomites, and schists. The younger sediments consist of coarse, unconsolidated glacial till and stream gravels. The moraines are all above 8, 500 feet. The alluvium flanks both sides of the range in the form of <b>alluvial</b> <b>cones.</b> Igneous rocks form a major portion of the area. The intrusives {{are a part of the}} Inyo batholith of middle or late Mesozoic. Three principal intrusive types occur in the area; two granites and a quartz-diorite. The intrusives have altered both the attitude and composition of the sediments into which they have risen. The extrusives in the area are all basalt and include pre-Cambrian, Tertiary, and Quaternary flows. The structure of the area is complex. Folding and faulting have played major roles. Examples of both regional and of local drag folding were found. Faulting is evidenced by very numerous faults of widely different extent and displacement. The geologic history of the White Mountains as derived from the area mapped, is essentially that typical of mountains of the Basin and range province. ...|$|R

The surveyed area is situated at the margin of the sedimentary basin of the Osaka Group. The fluvial sediments were formed by the Paleo-Seta river which ran through the mountainous ranges from the Kobiwako sedimentary basin, northeast of the surveyed area (Iida, 1980). These sediments are stratigraphically divided into Aodani clay and gravel, Myojogahara sand, Joyo gravel I, Hase clay, and lower, middle and upper part of Joyo gravel n members in ascending order. Six sedimentary facies are distinguished in the sequence of the surveyed area. They are talus deposits (Facies 1), <b>alluvial</b> <b>cone</b> gravels (Facies 2), intramountainous swamp silts (Facies 3), braided river sands and gravels with meandering channel-fill sediments (Facies 4), sheet flood gravels and sands of the typical braided river systems on the midfan (Facies 5), and backmarsh silts and inverse-graded fine-grained sands (Facies 6). Among them, Facies 1, 2 and 3, which are the Aodani clay and gravel member, are considered to represent intramountainous small sedimentary basins. Facies 4, 5 and 6 represent large-scale alluvial fan systems formed by the Paleo-Seta river. As a result, three cycles of major coarsening upward sequence up to 50 to 80 meters thick, composed of Facies 4 and 5 in ascending order, are recognized in the sediments of the surveyed area.

The fauna assemblage, apart from these two taxa, is characterized by the presence of Ursus sp., Elephas sp., Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis, Bos primigenius e cf.

The seismic sections have been complemented by H/V measurements of the seismic noise utilizing a seismological network installed for sites amplification analysis with a reference station and by an accurate study of the geomorphology of the area. Analyses of the morphogenetic processes contribute to the description of the evolution of the plain and of the depocentres, with depressions and structural highs or divides which strongly influenced the rivers action and the arrival of the <b>alluvial</b> <b>cones...</b>|$|R
40|$|The author {{attempts}} at formulating a synthetic description of geological and geomorphological {{effects of the}} Wartanian ice-sheet deglaciation {{in the eastern part}} of the Łódź region, taking their spatial variability into consideration. Characteristic features of Wartanian Glaciation sediments occur in this area, and their lithofacial diversity and spatial distribution needed interpretation. The deposits document the complex processes of deglaciation, which developed here across an unusually broad area in the scale of the Polish Lowland. The best developed deglaciation sediments occur {{in the eastern part of}} the Łódż Heights, between the Mroga and Rawka rivers, as structural components of different types of kames and glaciofluvial covers. In locations where glacial till is elevated they include mainly sediments of braided rivers and <b>alluvial</b> <b>cones,</b> whereas in areas of wide depressions of till and, thus, of the ice-sheet bedrock — glaciolimnic sediments prevail. The highest and most diverse western part of the Łódź Heights is characterised by the occurrence of thin and discontinuous deglaciation sediments, because this area was shaped mainly during the ice-sheet transgression. During deglaciation, ablation waters left mainly traces of erosion, whereas the glaciofluvial accumulation series are not well developed. In the Rawa Interfluve, deglaciation sediments accumulated predominantly at the early deglaciation stage in sparesely distributed broad basins of kame sedimentation. In the Piotrków Plain, deglaciation deposits are thin; ice-sheet disintegration proceeded without major blockages of ablation waters, resulting in a less diverse interfluvial landscape...|$|R
40|$|The Mapocho basin (Central de Chile) {{is divided}} into two morphotectonic styles by the Mapocho fracture. ln the {{northern}} section, of the Santiago depression an intense monoclinal warping anda deep alveolar excavation evidence important uplift of the western border. ln the southern section, the asymetry is stronger than the former one and inverse, giving a fault angle depression. This fracturation of the depression's bottom has affected both the conditions of sedimentation and the drainage patterns, causing antecedence phenomena and antagonistic effects between tectodynamics and external morphogenesis.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Large subaerial distributary fluvial systems are cone-shaped, alluvial deposits that are ubiquitous features on Earth. These non-marine, non-lacustrine deposits have superficial similarities to small alluvial fans but are at a scale that is orders of magnitude larger. A variety of terms have been used to identify these features, including <b>alluvial</b> <b>cone,</b> inland delta, wet alluvial fan, humid alluvial fan, alluvial fan, subaerial fan, terminal fan, and megafan. The first systematic examination of these features was presented by Wilkinson et al. (1997). This thesis attempts to provide a more detailed characterization and classification of these features. Fourteen systems in South America, Africa, and Asia were examined using Shuttle photography and AVHRR imagery. This study included: (1) maps of each system and their global distribution, (2) morphometric analyses, (3) classifications by climate, geology, and hydrology, and (4) a comparison to other fluvial systems. These systems have areas 8, 881 to 239, 583 km?, radii 130 to 806 km, and slopes 0. 00006 to 0. 00079. Active and former river channel patterns on these features suggest that they formed by the action of a single river avulsing across the feature. The area of these features is unrelated to the area of the upstream drainage basin, but is related {{to the size of the}} downstream basin. This sample of systems occurs in a variety of climates and in two different geologic settings - foreland basins and half graben. The rivers on all systems are orientated transverse to the trend of the adjacent mountain range or fault. A variety of channel patterns are found on these systems. Considering the definitions of alluvial fans, rivers, and deltas, these systems are best classified as a specific variety of alluvial fan. A new alluvial fan classification scheme more inclusive than that proposed by Stanistreet and McCarthy (1993) is needed. The adoption of a common term to describe these systems - such as megafan - would help to eliminate some of the definitional ambiguities between them and other alluvial fans. Knowledge of these features will enhance our ability to interpret analogous features in the rock record, including important petroleum and water aquifers (e. g., the Ogallala Formation) ...|$|E
40|$|Tozeur is {{the most}} {{important}} tourist town of south-western Tunisia, situated in between the two salt lakes Chott El Djerid to the south and Chott El Gharsa to the north. This area is known for its luxuriant oasis {{in the middle of the}} desert (Tozeur, Gafsa, Nefta etc.), the mountain chains to the north close to the border with Algeria with its villages and waterfalls (Tameghza, Chebìka, Midès), the mountain chain east of Tozeur (Jbel Morra etc.) with its arid canyons, and the wide salt plains (Chotts). Tourists usually visit the region rapidly without staying overnight, overlooking and ignoring the great geomorphologic and geological interesting places and landscapes. Therefore, in the framework of a Research Project performed by the Department of Geology of the University of Cagliari in collabora- tion with the Institut des Régions Arides at Medenine and with the "Faculté de Sciences Humaines et sociales" of Tunis and financed by the Sardinian Regional Government (R. L. 11 Aprile 1996, n° 19), our multidisciplinary Research Team has studied twenty-one geo- sites and geological landscapes in the region of Tozeur, with the purpose of constituting a network of geosites in these arid and semi- arid areas. Field work combined with remote sensing techniques have enabled to start preparing thematic maps of these geosites which, together with their description (genesis, evolution, state of conservation, proposals of valorisation, etc.) will be useful for obtaining financial aid for their protection and valorisation. The definition of morphostructural units landform analysis at a large/medium scale was performed by TeleGIS Laboratory, involved in these studies on southern Tunisia from 1997 in collaboration with the Institute des Régions Arides, applying remote sensing techniques on multi-spectral satellite images. During this project the interpretation keys for the image classification were created in the different steps of field observations and digital image processing. The radiometric and geometric responses were used for the discrimination of spectral units (lithological sequences) and textural units defined by photo- interpretation techniques (structural and landscape units like anticlines, fault-controlled valleys or forms like chevron, etc.). Many of the studied geomorphosites are represented by canyons (Gorges de Ben Nebhana, Sidi Bou Helal, Thelja, En Negueb, Chaabet Es Sfa, Ben Hamed, Midès, etc.) and waterfalls (Grande Cascade and Cascade de l'Oasis at Tameghza, Cascade de Chebìka and its geological-structural features). Others are related to aeolian and meteoric processes (Barchan dunes of El Ghadayer, morpho-sculpture of Ong El Jmel, Yardangs of El Ghadayer, Nebkha fields of Chamsa). The remaining geosites are an ancient lacu- strine coastline testified by a lumachelle with Cardium in the Jehim oasis near Tozeur, the anticline of Brikis close to Tameghza, and an ancient phosphate mine at Chouabin (Jbel Chouabin close to Redeyef), a representative part of Chott el Djerid, the Delta of Oued Mellah and the <b>alluvial</b> <b>cone</b> of Oued Foum el Khanga and the ancient oasis (Corbeille) of Nefta. These sites and landscapes of geological and geomorphological interest represent the entire geological history of the Tozeur and the Chotts region fairly well. This history starts from Early Cretaceous, and the various sites narrate the sedimentary and tectonic events, the palaeo-environmental and palaeo-climate episodes, the birth, development and extinction of animal and plant species, the geo- morphological processes and depositional events, explaining the present morphology, climate and landscape in a most interesting scientific and educational way. The linking of all these places of geological and geomorphologic interest in networks of Geosites along a thematic issue (the "Living Desert" network with Nebkha and Barchan dunes, Yardangs and Aeolian sculptures, the "Rocks and Water" network with waterfalls, mountains and canyons, the "Earth’s Memory" network across the canyons of Jbel Morra-Sidi Bou Helal passing through more than 100 million years of Earth's geological history, the “Phosphate Route” network with active and abandoned phosphate mines and their environmental impact and the “Changing Environment and Climate” network with salt pans, fossil shorelines and abandoned oasis) give an interesting opportunity of telling the history of the Earth, promoting geology and geomorphology to the local people and to the visitors. In fact, geological heritage can and should become a cultural and economical resource for the local people, and therefore these inhabitants should be taught understanding their natural and cultural environment, enabling them to use these elements in the framework of a touristic and sustainable development of their region...|$|E
40|$|The Fujairah 1 : 50 000 {{geological}} {{map sheet}} covers {{a segment of}} the Hajar Mountains extending from the Gulf of Oman around the city of Fujairah in the east, to the desert plains of the Rub’ Al Khali in the west. The solid geology predominantly comprises rocks of the Oman-UAE ophiolite complex, with a small area in the centre-north underlain by medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks (Bani Hamid Group). The ophiolitic rocks comprise an earlier magmatic suite of mantle harzburgite and dunite, overlain by a classic spreading-ridge crustal section of layered gabbro, through “high-level” gabbro (mainly isotropic to varitextured gabbro), to a Sheeted Dyke Complex and topmost pillow basalt. These were intruded by a later magmatic suite comprising some dunite, a predominantly ultramafic “Mixed Unit” (including peridotites and pyroxenites), voluminous wehrlite bodies, and a suite of younger gabbroic rocks and associated minor intrusions (various mafic dykes, tonalites and bodies of magmatic breccia). The metamorphic rocks occur as thin tectonic slices within a major north-west-trending fault zone. They fall within the P 4 unit of the Bani Hamid Group of rocks and comprise quartz schists and quartzites, with minor amphibolites and calc-silicate rocks, metamorphosed under amphibolite facies conditions. The solid geology is partially covered by Miocene-Pliocene and Quaternary deposits. These are most extensive in the west, where the Hajar Mountains descend onto the desert plains and comprise palaeo-alluvial fan sands and gravels deposited on variably silicified serpentinite and mantle peridotites. These have been incised by Quaternary fluvial systems and are patchily overlain by Recent alluvial fan deposits. Elsewhere, the Quaternary deposits consist of alluvium and dissected river terraces, with scree and <b>alluvial</b> <b>cones</b> developed on the mountain slopes. Coastal zone deposits of the eastern seaboard include raised beaches and sabkhas, locally overlain by broad, low-angled alluvial fans issuing from the main wadis. ...|$|R
40|$|In the Mediterranean {{area and}} {{especially}} in Italy the Roman Age corresponds to a period of heavy and evident human impact on the environment, which in many places coincides with a general geomorphological stability. In the period following {{the collapse of the}} Roman Empire (namely the 5 th- 8 th centuries AD), strong alluvial processes occurred in Northern Italy, triggering a fast and strong sedimentary phase that led many large Alpine rivers to avulse. Major changes are clearly documented in the alluvial systems of Adige, Brenta, Piave, Livenza, Tagliamento and Isonzo rivers; the major episodes are represented by the so-called “Rotta della Cucca” (Adige R.) and the floods which buried Concordia Sagittaria (Tagliamento R.). An important phase of reactivation also affected several of the <b>alluvial</b> <b>cones</b> in the valleys of Trentino and Alto Adige, as well the cones fed by the Apennine streams which prograde towards the Po Plain (e. g. near Modena). In the same period an important alluvial deposition is recorded also {{in other areas of the}} Italian peninsula (e. g. Florence and Rome). Since early studies, many Authors considered this Early Medieval period both for its archaeological and geomorphic importance, trying to sort out the natural from the humaninduced component. Several papers stressed the importance of the coincidence between an important natural event/events and the lack of territorial management, particularly when compared to the strong anthropogenic control occurred in the centuries before. New geomorphologic and stratigraphic evidence from NE Italy support the assessment of the magnitude of the natural component (mainly driven by climate) of the alluvial processes occurred in the early Middle Ages; moreover, the chronological information allow to constrain the main alluvial phase between the second half of the 6 th and the first part of the 7 th century thus, confirming the importance of so-called “Diluvium” described by the Lombard historian Paolo Diacono and dated 589 AD...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} geomorphological and geo-environmental studies conducted in the Graveglia Valley, where Bracco-Val Graveglia Unit and Mt. Gottero Unit formations outcrops appear. The Bracco-Val Graveglia Unit consists of serpentinites and peridotites, gabbros, ophiolitic breccias, basalts, cherts, limestones and clayey shales. The Mt. Gottero Unit {{is made up of}} clayey-arenaceous schists, slates, shales with marly-clayey layers, sandstones and clayey shales. The geomorphological layout is conditioned by the geological and structural characteristics of the valley. The principal tectonic trends, which consist of two orthogonal systems, one trending N-S to NW-SE and the other NE-SW, have determined the drainage pattern and are responsible for the formation of some deep-seated gravitational slope deformation. Investigations carried out on the gravitational processes affecting the slopes have led to the mapping of landslides involving monolithological deposits and mixed lithologies, both deposited by rockfalls and sliding. For the most part, these deposits are present in {{the upper part of the}} valley. Along Graveglia Valley, which is marked by frequent meanders, terraced alluvial deposits prevail from the outlet to as far as Frisolino. The upper part is instead characterized by rock erosion. Level surface areas attributable to fluvial terraces (sometimes with ancient alluvial deposits) are present at higher altitudes on the slopes, while <b>alluvial</b> <b>cones</b> are observable at the confluence of the tributaries flowing into Graveglia stream. As concerns underground water, numerous springs exist throughout the entire basin. They constitute an important water resource. Karstic modelling has developed in the extensive outcrops of limestones present in the upper valley. Microforms of corrosion and dolines represent some of the epigenic forms, among which the Pian di Oneto landform of tectonic-karstic origin is the most imposing of all. As for hypogenic forms, there are about thirty caves, both active and fossil. Landforms attributable to anthropic activity are numerous and mainly distributed in areas with rocks of oceanic sequence. The most important ones are present in mining sites worked for manganese, iron and copper sulfides. Numerous stone quarries are found one after another in the limestones between Frisolino and Arzeno. The blocks extracted in these quarries are used for breakwaters and the crushed rock is used for construction purposes. In the past, quarries had also been opened in the serpentinites and in the basalts. Lastly, environmental and geotourism points of interest have been indicated on a geomorphological map presented here. These points are related to the geomineral aspects of the areas, as represented above all by the Mining Museum of Gambatesa, as well as to geological-geomorphological aspects, such as the quarry fronts, the gorges and meanders, the agricultural terraces and dry stone structures...|$|R
