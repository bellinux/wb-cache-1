5000|$|Brake {{system is}} air-assisted-hydraulic six wheel drum brakes with a {{driveline}} parking brake, although gladhands {{exist on the}} rear of the vehicle for connection to trailers with full air service and emergency brakes. Braking performance of the truck is similar to other power drum brake vehicles of this size. Each drum was designed with maximum efficiency in mind, and individual drums can dissipate up to [...] of braking heat. Due to this brake system and GVWR under 26001 lb, the big deuce can be driven without a commercial driver's license in most states. Even California does NOT require a CDL to operate an M35 on public roads because even though it has three axles and an <b>air-assisted</b> <b>braking</b> system, the maximum gross weight is still under 26000 lb, making it eligible for class C on-road driving; and because the primary braking system is hydraulic, not air.|$|E
5000|$|The MarkII {{was similar}} to the MarkI, but the small 'bikini" [...] fairing became a larger half-fairing {{incorporating}} indicators. The fairing had been tested in Moto Guzzi's wind tunnel (which had been used to test race bike fairings in the 1950s). The new fairing had a rectangular headlight, rather than the earlier round item. Cylinder bores were coated with Moto Guzzi's patented [...] "Nikasil". Front suspension became <b>air-assisted.</b> The <b>brake</b> calipers on the front wheel, previously mounted on the front, were now mounted behind the forks. A new dualseat could now carry a pillion. Further changes included a revised instrument cluster derived from the 1000cc SP. Brakes were linked, with the handlebar lever operating the front right caliper and the footbrake operating both the front left and rear caliper.|$|R
