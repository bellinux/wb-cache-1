The study focuses on determining {{the influence of the}} <b>angle</b> (<b>tilt)</b> between the axis of rotation and gravity on the convection process. To this end the following two essential parameters are varied: (i) the magnitude of the surface heat flux, and (ii) the <b>angle</b> (<b>tilt)</b> between the axis of rotation and gravity. The range of the parameters investigated is a subset of typical open-ocean deep convection events. It is demonstrated that when gravity and rotation vector are tilted with respect to each other (i) the Taylor-Proudman-Poincaré theorem leaves an imprint in the convective structures, (ii) a horizontal mean circulation is established, and (iii) the second-order moments involving horizontal velocity components are considerably increased. Tilted rotation thus leaves a substantial imprint in the dynamics of ocean convection...|$|E

Bundles of the twins which contain odd numbers of twins will in optical images appear as a seemingly single first twin boundary. First-order coherent twin boundaries are not electrically active, except at locations where they contain intrinsic (grain boundary) dislocations.
