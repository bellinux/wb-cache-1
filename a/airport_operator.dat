5|$|On 19 June 2008, the {{municipal}} council voted to not give further subsidies to the airport. Upgrades for NOK8 million {{were needed to}} meed safety standard. The <b>airport</b> <b>operator</b> had debt of NOK12 million, and no realizeable assets. Vildanden was under certain conditions willing to pay some of the capital needed to perform the upgrades. The municipal council changed their opinion and voted—with a single decisive vote—to keep the airport running in July. The financial risk would {{be taken over by}} {{the municipal}}-owned Kontorbygg, who operate a range of offices and commercial buildings in Skien. The proposal was supported by the right-winged parties, and opposed by the socialist parties, as well as the chair of Kontorbygg. As a response, the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries reported the municipality to ESA, and demanded that NOK20 million in illegal subsidies be repaid by Vildanden and the <b>airport</b> <b>operator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft is a German {{construction}} {{company based in}} Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Hochtief is Germany's largest {{construction company}} and operates globally, ranking {{as one of the}} largest general construction companies in the United States through its Turner subsidiary, and in Australia through a 53.43% shareholding in CIMIC Group. In 2010 it employed more than 70,000 employees across five corporate divisions. One of these, Hochtief Concessions, is a major <b>airport</b> <b>operator.</b> The others are involved with construction project planning, finance, construction and operation. Work done in 2010 was €23.23 billion, with more than 80% coming from operations outside Germany.|$|E
5|$|Air traffic {{services}} for all UK airspace {{is provided by}} National Air Traffic Services (NATS), which also provides air traffic control at 15 airports. The largest <b>airport</b> <b>operator</b> is BAA Limited, owner of six UK airports including London Heathrow airport. In some cases airport ownership {{is in the hands}} of local government authorities rather than private businesses, and the largest UK owned operator, Manchester Airports Group, operator of Manchester Airport, Bournemouth Airport, East Midlands Airport, and Humberside Airport, is owned by a consortium of 10 Manchester area local authorities. Whilst the number of airports in the UK runs into hundreds, many are smaller aerodromes dealing with general aviation rather than air transport. In terms of the latter, statistics are collected from 59 main airports, and the largest concentration of services is located in the London and South East of England areas.|$|E

5|$|By October 2007, Vildanden was {{in severe}} {{financial}} distress. An agreement {{was made with}} the municipal council, where the latter gave a credit loan to the airline. The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down. NOK2.3 million, equal to the airlines debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned <b>airport</b> <b>operator,</b> and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, {{and the other half}} made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden had to raise new capital equal to at least half the companies accounts payable, which was NOK8 million. The case raised local debate about whether it was the municipality's job to subsidize the airport and the airline. The Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries announced that they would consider reporting the subsidies to the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) for violation of the European Community competition law.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the British <b>airport</b> <b>operator</b> TBI {{announced}} it was in negotiations to purchase an airport close to Oslo, and Dagens Næringsliv speculated {{that it could be}} Notodden. The municipality confirmed that they were in negotiations to establish a limited company to operate the airport, which would be jointly owned by Air Team and the municipality. In 2000, Bergen Air Transport started flying between Notodden and Bergen, using a Cessna 421B. It transported 1,000 passengers in 2000, and 1,500 the following year. During the summer of 2002, the company also attempted to fly from Notodden to Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, but was forced to give up due to lack of passengers. In 1995, the airport saw 770 arriving and departing passengers. It increased to 2,467 the following year but fell to 986 in 1998 before increasing to 3,682 in 1999. The patronage has since varied significantly from year to year, but has stayed in the range between 1,500 and 3,500 passengers per year.|$|E
5|$|Biman {{is notable}} for {{disruptions}} to its flight schedule and poor customer service. In 2007, Biman faced strong criticism from major international airports including London Heathrow Airport and Dubai International Airport for {{its failure to}} maintain flight schedules. Heathrow <b>Airport</b> <b>operator</b> BAA wrote to Biman providing evidence which showed Biman had not achieved the minimum 80% usage of its allocated landing slots at Heathrow, as required by EU and International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations, {{during the summer of}} 2007. Biman should, therefore, not expect slot allocations at Heathrow for the summer of 2008 and should look to Stansted or Gatwick airports if it wished to continue serving London. Following discussions with BAA, however, Biman obtained landing slots for the summer of 2008 on condition that it achieved 80% usage. Delays continued unabated and in September 2008, Biman's Dhaka–London direct flight utilising a DC-10 aircraft was diverted and landed at Gatwick when it did not have sufficient fuel to remain in a holding pattern over Heathrow following arrival over three hours after the scheduled time. In a 10 September 2008 article published in The Times, Biman was labelled the worst performer for punctuality at Heathrow, with flights delayed on average by three hours. In 2008, the United Nations advised its staff not to fly with Biman, citing both safety and security concerns and Biman's unreliable flight schedules. It was made clear that UN staff who flew with Biman did so at their own risk, and would be ineligible to make claims on insurance. Biman's then newly appointed managing director said he was unaware of the UN directive, but admitted that Biman did face problems in managing its flight schedules. He expected the situation to improve with the procurement of aircraft in the coming months.|$|E

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since GAO reported on this issue in December 2012, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has developed application guidance for <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> applying to the Screening Partnership Program (SPP). In December 2012, GAO reported that TSA had not provided guidance to <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> on its application and approval process, which had been revised to reflect requirements in the Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. Further, <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> GAO interviewed at the time generally stated that they faced difficulties completing the revised application, {{such as how to}} obtain cost information. Therefore, GAO recommended that TSA develop application guidance, and TSA concurred. To address GAO's recommendation, TSA updated its SPP website in December 2012 by providing general application guidance and a description of the criteria and process the agency uses to assess airports' SPP applications. The guidance provides examples of information that airports could consider providing to TSA to help assess their suitability for the program and also outlines how the agency will analyze cost information. The new guidance addresses the intent of GAO's recommendation and should help improve transparency of the SPP application process as well as help <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> determine whether their airports are good candidates for the SPP. ...|$|R

25|$|On 21 February 2007 it was {{reported}} that thirteen Adam Air employees, as well as an employee of <b>airport</b> <b>operator</b> PT Angkasa Pura, working at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport had been arrested for fraudulent data manipulation. The scheme involved manipulating passenger data to show passengers as 'leaving the country'. This meant that they were automatically charged a duty of 30,000 Rupiah each, when in reality they owed none. The money was then split between fourteen staff members. A computer from the check-in desk, as well as passenger tickets and lists, were seized.|$|E
25|$|During an eight-month review {{period from}} August 2008 through April 2009, the {{choppers}} made 258 flights, 228 {{of which were}} security patrols of Port Authority-operated airports, bridges, tunnels, and other properties. Not a single unusual incident was spotted during these patrols, according to a Wall Street Journal report. One flight was made {{in response to the}} US Airways 1549 “Miracle on the Hudson” incident, but the New York City Police Department waved off the PAPD’s assistance. Other flights were made to take aerial photos of facilities. The review also discovered that the Port Authority was the only <b>airport</b> <b>operator</b> in the U.S. to use patrol helicopters.|$|E
25|$|In May 2004, the <b>airport</b> <b>operator</b> PlaneStation bought 30% of {{the shares}} in airline EUjet, and in January 2005 it {{completed}} its takeover by acquiring the remaining 70% {{of the shares}}. On 26 July 2005, the airline went into administration and all EUjet flights ended, along with all non-freight operations at the airport, owing to financial difficulties with the airline and airport owner, PlaneStation. Their business plan was ambitious and when the bank lenders foreclosed many passengers were left stranded abroad. London Manston Airport plc went into liquidation. Operations then temporarily ceased, and Manston's aerodrome traffic zone and radar services were suspended, until after a new buyer could be found.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} {{was found to be}} pilot error. The aircraft had not been in a stable approach, landed at too high a speed, and touched down too far along the runway to have sufficient distance available in which to stop. The location where the aircraft ended up meant that the post-crash fire was exacerbated. Only one of the three fire engines had a key to the gate, which delayed their arrival at the crash site. Subsequent to this accident, the <b>airport</b> <b>operator</b> has ensured that all fire engines are provided with keys to all gates they need access to. All four on board the aircraft survived the accident, but were killed by the post-crash fire.|$|E
