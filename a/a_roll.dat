5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} moving at 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0.6kg·m2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates <b>a</b> <b>roll</b> moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the center of mass, generates <b>a</b> <b>roll</b> moment of 30N·m.|$|E
5|$|Mario Party 4 {{features}} eight playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, Princess Daisy and Waluigi {{from the}} Mario series, {{who can be}} directed as characters on six themed game boards in the game. The objective {{of the game is}} to earn as many stars as possible, which are obtained by purchase from a single predefined space on the game board. Each character's movement is determined by <b>a</b> <b>roll</b> of a die, with <b>a</b> <b>roll</b> from each player forming a single turn. Each turn in Mario Party 4 is followed by a minigame in which characters compete for coins they can use to purchase items and stars.|$|E

5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is <b>a</b> <b>roll</b> moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is <b>a</b> <b>roll</b> moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E

5|$|After {{some time}} away from TV, Ziggler {{returned}} on the August 22 edition of SmackDown Live to declare that he would undergo a gimmick change on the following week's edition. He later started mocking, week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only cared about elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after mocking The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event Ziggler, who had promised a never seen before entrance but ended up being an entrance with no music, lights and titantron, was defeated by Roode after <b>a</b> <b>Roll</b> Up; right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a Zig Zag. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown Live, Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by <b>a</b> <b>roll</b> up, similar to how Roode defeated him. On 31st October's edition of Smackdown, Ziggler failed to earn a spot in Team Smackdown for Survivor Series 5 on 5 elimination match vs Raw after being defeated by Roode in a 2 out of 3 falls match and thus ending their feud.|$|E
