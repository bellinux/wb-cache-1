40|$|The {{synthesis}} of peptides {{which have the}} natriuretic and vasodilator properties of the <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> factor {{has made it possible}} to study the physiological role of this recently discovered hormonal system. In addition to renal effects, <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides</b> exert vascular, hemodynamic and endocrine actions which may participate in the regulation of plasma and interstitial volume as well as arterial blood pressure. Its acute hypotensive effect, which was observed in normal volunteers and in patients with cardiac failure or hypertension, is not entirely explained by its direct vasodilator effect. The complexity of its role is demonstrated by its inhibiting action on the synthesis and/or the activity of other vasoactive hormones. The observed increase in hematocrit suggests that vascular permeability may be enhanced; the resulting consequences, e. g. on blood viscosity, still need to be elucidated. When infusing <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides,</b> there exists a clear delay between the moment steady-state plasma levels are achieved and peak effect occurs. This renders the interpretation of the results very difficult. At this moment, the physiological role of <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides</b> as well as their potential future use as therapeutic agents cannot yet be fully appreciated...|$|R

30|$|<b>Natriuretic</b> <b>peptides</b> such as <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides</b> (ANP) {{and brain}} <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides</b> (BNP) are peptide hormones that promote {{natriuresis}} {{to protect the}} heart from excess mechanical stress or volume overload. BNP {{has been linked to}} cardiomyocyte damage after injury [6]. In pressure–volume overload conditions leading to ventricular stretch, expression of BNP is increased and released from the cardiomyocytes of the ventricles. Elevations in BNP and NT-proBNP have been associated with early [4, 6, 11, 30, 33] and late detection [5, 6, 25, 31] of ACIC and {{can be used as a}} surrogate for acute myocardial stress.|$|R
25|$|In heart, Epac1 is {{expressed}} predominantly, and {{is involved in}} the development of hypertrophic events by chronic cAMP stimulation through β-adrenergic receptors. In contrast, chronic stimulation of Epac2 may be a cause of cardiac arrhythmia through CaMKII-dependent diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release in mice.

40|$|Abnormalities of cytosolic calcium {{handling}} and myocyte energetics appear {{to play an}} important role in mediating contractile dysfunction in heart failure. Systolic and diastolic dysfunction in the failing heart are related to abnormalities of the excitation-contraction mechanism as well as myofilament calcium sensitivity. These abnormalities can be viewed as a compensatory mechanism as the myocytes by down regulating its function and metabolic activity preserve energy consumption and allow better maintenance of basal cellular homeostasis. The end point of myocyte dysfunction, however, is a reduced contraction, which, in turn, might cause a reduced cardiac output and a threatening of arterial pressure. This causes a second level of adaptation, which implies a neuroendocrine response of the whole organism. Consequently, the syndrome of congestive heart failure is characterized not only by impaired ventricular function, but also by an increase in some endogenous substances leading to vasoconstriction and water and salt retention. Although activation of the systems that release these substances is presumed to be compensatory, the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as well as the endothelins may contribute to the pathogenesis of the syndrome. Opposite to the effects of these systems are those evoked by the release of <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides.</b> The peptides exert a potent direct vasodilatation and natriuresis. In addition, <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides</b> inhibit the release of norepinephrine from nerve terminals and suppress the formation of renin. However, the natriuretic and vasodilator effects of these peptides in patients with congestive heart failure are outweighed by the sodium retention and vasoconstriction caused by sympathetic stimulation and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The reasons for this are not entirely known. The atrial stretch receptors that are responsible for the release of the atrial peptides become impaired, and it has been suggested that patient with heart failure may adapt to the physiologic effects of <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides.</b> The possibility that congestive heart failure is in part a humoral disease is reviewed here and consequently pharmacologic treatment aimed at reducing the effects of the neuroendocrine response as to be advantageous for patients with heart failure...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> (ANP) is a {{polypeptide}} hormone [...] which reduces an expanded extracellular fluid (ECF) volume by increasing renal sodium excretion.

2500|$|As Epac2 is {{involved}} in many physiological functions in various cells, defects in the Epac2/Rap1 signaling mechanism could {{contribute to the development}} of various pathological states. [...] Studies of Epac2 knockout mice indicate that Epac-mediated signaling is required for potentiation of insulin secretion by incretins (gut hormones released from enteroendocrine cells following meal ingestion) such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, suggesting that Epac2 is a promising target for treatment of diabetes. In fact, incretin-based diabetes therapies are currently used in clinical practice worldwide; development of Epac2-selective agonists might well lead to the discovery of further novel anti-diabetic drugs. An analog of GLP-1 has been shown to exert a blood pressure-lowering effect by stimulation of <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> (ANP) secretion through Epac2. In heart, chronic stimulation of β-adrenergic receptor is known to progress to arrhythmia through an Epac2-dependent mechanism. In brain, up-regulation of Epac1 and down-regulation of Epac2 mRNA are observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting roles of Epacs in the disease. An Epac2 rare coding variant is found in patients with autism and could be responsible for the dendritic morphological abnormalities.|$|E
50|$|Natriuresis is {{the process}} of sodium {{excretion}} in the urine through the action of the kidneys. It is promoted by ventricular and <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides</b> as well as calcitonin, and inhibited by chemicals such as aldosterone. Natriuresis lowers the concentration of sodium in the blood and also tends to lower blood volume because osmotic forces drag water out of the body's blood circulation and into the urine along with the sodium. Many diuretic drugs take advantage of this mechanism to treat medical conditions like hypernatremia and hypertension, which involve excess blood volume.|$|R

40|$|Effect of atriopeptin II on {{contrast}} medium-induced changes in renal blood flow. Volume expansion {{has been shown}} to attenuate the vasoconstrictive efifects of contrast medium. Since endogenous circulating levels of <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides</b> are elevated during volume expansion and since <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides</b> have been shown to blunt or block the vasoconstrictive effects of various pharmacologic agents, we examined the effect of atriopeptin II infusion {{on contrast}} medium-induced alterations in renal blood flow. Transient changes in renal blood flow were measured with an electromagnetic flow probe following bolus injections of the contrast medium, sodium meglumine diatrizoate (Re-novist II, 2 ml/ 4 sec), into the renal arteries of dogs. Under control conditions (that is, saline vehicle), the bolus of contrast medium caused an initial 15 to 21 % increase in renal blood flow at 14 to 21 seconds, followed by a subsequent 5 to 13 % decrease in renal blood flow at 43 to 59 seconds after injection. Infusion of atriopeptin II (0. 05 pg/kg/min) into the renal artery did not alter arterial blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, or baseline renal blood flow, but did produce increases in urine flow rate and clearance of sodium. The infusion of atriopeptin II attenuated the contrast medium-induced reduction in RBF, but the infusion of a threshold dose of bradykinin (1 ng/kg/min) had no effect. These results suggest that low doses of atriopeptin II can selectively attenuate the vasoconstrictive effects of contrast medium on renal blood flow without influencing systemic hemodynamics...|$|R

40|$|Although sodium {{retention}} and volume expansion occur during GH administration, {{blood pressure is}} decreased or unchanged. The aim was to study the effect of short- and long-term GH replacement in adults on sodium balance, renal hemodynamics, and blood pressure. Ten adults with severe GH deficiency were included into a 7 -d, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial followed by 12 months of open GH replacement. All measurements were performed under metabolic ward conditions. Extracellular water (ECW) was determined using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis. Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were assessed using renal paraminohippurate and Cr(51) EDTA clearances, respectively. Renal tubular sodium reabsorption was assessed using lithium clearance. Plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, aldosterone, <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides</b> and brain <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptides</b> (BNP) and 24 -h urinary norepinephrine excretion were measured. Seven days of GH treatment decreased urinary sodium excretion. Lithium clearance as a marker of proximal renal tubular sodium reabsorption was unaffected by GH treatment. ECW was increased after both short- and long-term treatment. This increase was inversely correlated to the decrease in diastolic blood pressure (r = - 0. 70, P = 0. 02) between baseline and 12 months. Short-term treatment increased PRA and decreased BNP. The increase in PRA correlated {{with an increase in}} 24 -h urinary norepinephrine excretion (r = 0. 77, P < 0. 01). Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow did not change during treatment.
