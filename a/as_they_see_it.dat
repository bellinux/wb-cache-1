The pain of this family is made worse by their depth of self-understanding and self-analysis, combined with a brutal honesty, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> {{and an ability to}} boldly express themselves. The story deals with the mother’s addiction to morphine, the family’s addiction to whiskey, the father’s miserliness, the older brother’s licentiousness, and younger brother’s illness.|$|E

The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers. Behind the second row is the number 8. This formation is known as the 3–4–1 formation. The two packs of forwards engage with each other so that the heads of the front-rowers are interlocked with those of their opponents. Front-rowers always aim for the gap to the left (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it)</b> of their opponent. The two locks in the second row bind directly behind the front row with their heads between a prop and the hooker. The flankers bind either side of the locks, and the number 8 binds behind and between the two locks.|$|E

However, it {{also must be}} lit at home, and even the one who recited the blessings in the synagogue must recite the blessings again at home. For this reason, some congregations, particularly in certain Hasidic communities, have a custom to throw things, such as towels, at whoever lights the menorah in synagogue, {{to show that he}} must light again at home. But when a Rebbe lights in the synagogue before eating a meal there with the congregation, no towels are thrown. Some people disagree with the custom of throwing towels, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as disrespectful to the synagogue, but it was the practice among many Hasidic masters. The Menorah is also lit in the daytime in synagogue during the Shacharith prayers, but no blessings are recited, and towels are not thrown.|$|E

She said: [...] "Voldemort's fear is death, ignominious death. I mean, he regards death itself as ignominious. He thinks that it's a shameful human weakness, as you know.

Parents’ actions are influenced by how they construct anorexia, such <b>as</b> whether <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an eating issue, an illness, a psychological problem, a choice, or a mystery.
