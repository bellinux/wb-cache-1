5|$|We were {{supposed}} to be with her in the studio for a couple of days. She kindly invited us to stay a little longer. We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E
5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> see these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E
5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E

25|$|Adaptations include François Truffaut's 1966 film {{adaptation}} of the novel and a 1982 BBC Radio dramatization. Bradbury published a stage play version in 1979 and helped develop a 1984 interactive fiction computer game titled Fahrenheit 451, {{and a collection of}} his short stories, <b>A</b> <b>Pleasure</b> <b>to</b> Burn.|$|E
25|$|Tong Chi-Yat, Tong Chi Foon, Tong Chi Yan – The {{remaining}} of Gai’s {{children are}} 26, 21, and 17 years old respectively. Yat is an ambitious figure who strives {{to run a}} happy family with his controversial chain-smoking model wife, Cheuk Man-Lai (Tavia Yeung). Although Yat is ambitious, he listens {{to his mother and}} similar to her in the way he is also straightforward. He is a figure that forgives and forgets. Foon is Kam’s only son and he is a growing filmmaker who has just graduated. Foon is an innocent figure who suffers greatly from Kam’s sudden outbursts which lead to her getting into trouble with family. He is character trying to find his place in a family without his mother. Yan is a youthful and playful figure who is always <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> be around. She is a flirty figure at the beginning but slowly matures during the series. She loves her family members but can be very moody when she discovers that some of them are traitors.|$|E
25|$|To {{those who}} worked with him at Bazaar, the {{pinnacle}} of Brodovitch's career as a designer was the unfailing elegance of his pages. This elegance, combined with an element of innovation was the ideal mix for a fashion magazine. The quality that guaranteed his success was his devotion to the new, unending surprise and vitality. Frances MacFadden, Bazaars managing editor for much of Brodovitch's tenure, explained his working method:It was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> watch him work. He was so swift and sure. In emergencies, like the time the Clipper bearing the report of the Paris Collections was held up in Bermuda, his speed was dazzling. A quick splash or two on the cutting board, a minute's juggling of the photostats, a slather of art gum, and the sixteen pages were complete. His layouts, of course, were the despair of copywriters whose cherished tone poems on girdles or minks had to be sacrificed to his sacred white space. Just before we went to press, all the layouts were laid out in sequence on Carmel Snow's floor, and there, under his eye, re-arranged until the rhythm of the magazine suited him.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, at {{the inaugural}} Speed on Tweed {{historic}} meeting at Murwillumbah, Brabham, then 76, commented: [...] "It's {{been a wonderful}} car {{over the years and}} it's been very well looked after and it's <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> come and drive it. Coming to Murwillumbah was a really good excuse {{to get back in the}} car and drive it again and I'm afraid that's something I'll never ever get tired of." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{think most}} of the time when my records come out, people are so much distracted by so much fanfare and {{controversy}} that nobody pays attention to the music. [...] I can't tell you how painful the idea of singing 'Like a Virgin' or 'Material Girl' (1984) is to me now. I didn't write either of those songs, and wasn't digging very deep then. I also feel more connected emotionally to the music I'm writing now, so it's more of <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> do it." ...|$|E
500|$|At first, Henson's Muppets {{appeared}} {{separately from}} the realistic segments on the Street, but after a poor test-screening in Philadelphia, the show was revamped to integrate the two, placing much greater emphasis on Henson's work. Though Henson would often downplay his role in Sesame Street’s success, Cooney frequently praised Jim's work and, in 1990, the Public Broadcasting Service called him [...] "the spark that ignited our fledgling broadcast service." [...] The success of Sesame Street also allowed Henson to stop producing commercials. He later remembered that [...] "it was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> {{get out of that}} world".|$|E

500|$|Writing in The Washington Post, Harold Kneeland {{noted that}} Thunderball was [...] "Not top Fleming, but still {{well ahead of}} the pack", whilst Charles Poore, writing in The New York Times {{considered}} the Bond novels to be [...] "post-Dostoevskian ventures in crime and punishment". Thunderball he found to be [...] "a mystery story, a thriller, a chiller and <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> read." [...] Poore identified aspects of the author's technique {{to be part of}} the success, saying [...] "the suspense and the surprises that animate the novel arise from the conceits with which Mr. Fleming decorates his tapestry of thieving and deceiving".|$|E
500|$|Karthi's third film in 2010 was Suseenthiran's thriller Naan Mahaan Alla, {{in which}} he played a middle class youth from Chennai whose life is {{disrupted}} when his father is killed. It received good reviews, was very popular, and Karthi's performances was praised by critics. Sreedhar Pillai wrote for Sify: [...] " [...] nails the character to perfection"...He is one good reason to see the film." [...] Bhama Devi Ravi of Times of India wrote: [...] "...what <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> see Karthi deliver his best performance to date...". Rediff wrote that [...] "Karthi has simply had a ball..." [...] and [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since you saw an actor who can be as convincing in sadness and rage, as in happiness." [...] Naan Mahaan Alla was dubbed into Telugu and released as Naa Peru Shiva in 2011; it was very successful and earned Karthi some Telugu film offers.|$|E
500|$|Richardson's film {{roles of}} the early 1970s ranged from the Crypt Keeper in Tales from the Crypt (1972) to the Caterpillar in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1972) and Dr Rank in Ibsen's A Doll's House (1973). The last of these was {{released}} {{at the same time}} as an American film of the same play, starring Jane Fonda; the timing detracted from the impact of both versions, but Richardson's performance won good reviews. In The Observer, George Melly wrote, [...] "As for Sir Ralph as Dr Rank, he grows from the ageing elegant cynic of his first appearance (it's even <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> watch him remove his top hat) to become the heroic dying stoic of his final exit without in any way forcing the pace." [...] In 1973 Richardson received a BAFTA nomination for his performance of George IV in Lady Caroline Lamb, in which Olivier appeared as Wellington.|$|E

500|$|Variety {{declared}} that the film [...] "Shows the young star [...] as a better than fair actor". The New York Times also gave a favorable review: [...] "Mr. Curtiz and his players have got it snugly draped around Mr. Presley's shoulders. And there it stays, until a limp melodramatic home stretch, even with eight or so of those twitching, gyrating musical interludes. ... These also perfectly typify the Bourbon Street honky-tonks that Mr. Curtiz and his fine photographer, Russ Harlan, have beguilingly drenched with atmosphere. Matching, or balancing, the tunes are at least seven characterizations that supply the real backbone and {{tell the story of}} the picture. ... for Mr. Presley, in his third screen attempt, it's <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> find him up to a little more than Bourbon Street shoutin' and wigglin'. Acting is his assignment in this shrewdly upholstered showcase, and he does it, so help us over a picket fence." ...|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth David was the doyenne of English cookery writers. She {{influenced}} the generations who came after her, whether they, too, were intending to be culinary experts or merely taking a well-thumbed Elizabeth David Penguin {{from the kitchen}} shelf for the next day's dinner party. [...] "Elizabeth David says..." [...] was the regular way of resolving how much spice—and which spices—should be added to a stew and how much garlic should {{be put in a}} dressing. At its best, her prose was as precise as her instructions, unlike that of some of her predecessors who sometimes wrapped up advice on what to do in the kitchen with impenetrable sentences. She was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> read, a stylist of true distinction. Perhaps only in Britain would she have been classified as a [...] "food writer", too often rather a damning phrase. Elizabeth David combined a scholar's feeling for history with the traveller-aesthete's gift of conveying a sense of place.|$|E
500|$|Barrymore's {{first film}} for MGM was the 1932 mystery Arsène Lupin, {{in which he}} co-starred with his brother Lionel. [...] In The New York Times, Hall called Barrymore's {{performance}} [...] "admirable" [...] and wrote that [...] "it is <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> see [...] again in something in a lighter vein." [...] The same year, Barrymore starred as jewel thief Baron Felix von Geigern together with Greta Garbo in the 1932 film Grand Hotel, in which Lionel also appeared. Critical opinion of Barrymore's acting was divided; John Gilbert's biographer Eve Golden refers to Barrymore as seeming [...] "more like... affectionate father than her lover", while George Blaisdell of International Photographer praised the dialogue and wrote that a viewer would be [...] "deeply impressed with the rarity in screen drama on which he is looking." [...] Grand Hotel won the Academy Award for Best Picture {{and was one of}} the highest-grossing films of the year. It was later added to the National Film Registry.|$|E

500|$|Computer and Video Games {{reviewer}} {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} 7 out of 10 {{in each of the}} magazine's scoring criteria — graphics, sound, value and playability. The reviewer stated that the game's premise is unoriginal, but that the game is enjoyable and makes [...] "...full use of the Amstrad's colour graphics..." [...] The reviewer also stated [...] "...the smooth movement of objects and characters makes this game <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> watch and play." [...] The game was reviewed again in Amtix! by Massimo Valducci, several months later when Obsidian was re-released on the budget label Americana. Valducci stated it had been one of his favourite titles when it was originally released, giving the game a rating of 70% and stating [...] "Everyone should have this game in their software collection." [...] He praised the game for adding a twist to the maze theme by disallowing the player from fighting back against threats. He added [...] "...a lot of thought and planning is needed to make your way around the various sections, deactivating the security systems as you go." ...|$|E
500|$|Connie Passalacqua of the Herald Journal {{compared}} Victoria's {{scheme to}} reunite {{her parents in}} 1991 to {{the plot of the}} 1961 film The Parent Trap. She wrote, [...] "hat makes Victoria a true terror teen? We venture that it may be the supernatural soap aging by which she aged from 5 to 15 last fall." [...] Fort Worth Star-Telegram criticized Victoria's early romances, saying: [...] "he's divorced, rich and hates sex. And now she wants her husband back. As soap operas go, Victoria Newman's plight...is standard daytime fare. But Victoria has one characteristic that many of her counterparts don't—she is only 17." [...] A syndicated article that appeared in The Fort Oglethorpe Press described Ryan McNeil's attempts to seduce Victoria as [...] "a path that's fraught with peril and which forces the good-natured actor to search hard for inspiration". SoapNet said it was [...] "no surprise" [...] Victoria has a history of [...] "messy relationships" [...] given her parents' history. Lilana Novakovich of the Toronto Star said that Heather Tom made Victoria become [...] "one of her favorite characters" [...] on the soap upon her debut in 1991. The Austin American-Statesman said that Tom was [...] "always <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> watch".|$|E
500|$|Cambridge, {{according}} to The Field were [...] "as nearly fit to row as possible ... their rowing was really <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> behold". [...] They were coached by Rev. W. Maule (who had rowed for Cambridge at the Henley Royal Regatta in 1847) and D. F. Steavenson (who had rowed in the Boat Race in the 1864 and 1865 races). [...] Walter Bradford Woodgate, who had rowed for Oxford in the 1862 and 1863 races, and George Morrison, former Oxford University Boat Club president who had rowed three times between the 1859 and 1861 race, coached the Dark Blue crew. [...] Although Cambridge arrived at Putney {{in very good}} form, it was considered to their disadvantage because, {{according to}} Drinkwater, [...] "no crew can be kept {{at the top of}} its form {{for more than a few}} days". [...] During practice runs, Oxford demonstrated they could outpace Cambridge, but with Frank Willan suffering from a boil, Oxford's stroke was instructed to keep the rating low for the race. [...] The race was umpired by Joseph William Chitty who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 (in the March and December races) and the 1852 race, while the starter was Edward Searle.|$|E
