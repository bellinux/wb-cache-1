40|$|SUMMARY Heterocyclic amines (HAs) are in {{cooked meat}} dishes at ng/g levels. They are <b>animal</b> <b>carcinogens</b> that form adducts in human tissues, {{and have been}} {{associated}} with increased risk of cancer. Cooking method, time, temperature, heat transfer, and chemical composition of food influence HA production during domestic, restaurant and industrial cooking. IQ, MeIQx, 4 - 8 -DiMeIQx, PhiP Harman and Norharman are the most abundant HAs in cooked meat. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified IQ as probably carcinogenic for humans (Group 2 A) and MeIQx, PhiP and other polar HAs as possibly carcinogenic for humans (Group 2 B). Avoiding over-cooking of meat seems to be an important way to decrease the content of HAs. Addition of waterholding ingredients, such as common salt, potato starch or carbohydrates, may also affect the formation of HAs. Frying in oil containing antioxidants may provide a way to reduce the amounts of HA formed. Such recommendations may assure food safety and decrease the human intake of HAs...|$|R

Here, we briefly review the results which led to the identification of the biological consequences of persistent DNA O(6) meG. We consider the possible consequences for a human cell of chronic exposure to low levels of a methylating agent.

40|$|Objective Heterocyclic amines (HAA) are <b>animal</b> <b>carcinogens</b> {{that are}} present in meat cooked at high {{temperature}} and in tobacco smoke. These compounds require activation by cytochrome P 450 1 A 2 (CYP 1 A 2) and N-acetyltransferase- 2 (NAT 2) before they can damage DNA. This study tested the hypotheses that well-done meat and cigarette smoking {{increase the risk of}} adenoma, the precursor to most colorectal cancers, especially in individuals with rapid CYP 1 A 2 and rapid NAT 2 activities. Design An endoscopy-based caseecontrol study of adenoma was conducted among Caucasians, Japanese and native Hawaiians to test this hypothesis. The overall diet and consumption of well-done meat cooked by various high-temperature methods were assessed by interview in 1016 patients with a first adenoma and 1355 controls with a normal endoscopy. A caffeine test was used to assess CYP 1 A 2 and NAT 2 activities in 635 cases and 845 controls. Logistic regression was used to account for matching factors and potential confounders. Results Smoking was associated with an increased risk of adenoma. Weak non-significant elevated OR were observed for the main effects of HAA intakes or NAT 2 activity. However, the combined effects of HAA intakes and NAT 2 activity were statistically significant.

Yet, while a wealth of information exists concerning the mechanism of action of physical, chemical, and viral carcinogens, virtually nothing is known relative to the mechanism of action of this economically important class of carcinogenic compounds known as mineral fibers and particulates. While the length and diameter of various forms of asbestos have been associated with both cellular toxicity in vitro and tumor occurrence in vivo, nothing is known about whether or not these same physical properties are responsible for the purported synergistic interaction between cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure relative to the induction of bronchogenic carcinoma. Thus, while the risk of bronchogenic carcinoma for nonsmokers exposed to asbestos appears to be only slightly greater than that for unexposed nonsmoking populations, the risk of occurrence of this same tumor in asbestos workers who also smoke is approximately 100 -fold greater than in nonsmoking asbestos workers. The risk of bronchogenic carcinoma is increased approximately 8 -fold in asbestos workers who smoke over nonexposed smokers. Since it is clear that cigarette smoke contains over 150 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, some of which are known <b>animal</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> and since other laboratories have reported that metals associated with asbestos redirect the metabolism of these agents, it was of interest to us to investigate the effects of mineral fibers on the metabolism and biochemistry of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEndogenous {{formation}} of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), which are known <b>animal</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> {{could contribute to}} human carcinogenesis but definitive evidence is still lacking. To investigate the relevance of NOCs in human colorectal cancer (CRC) development, we analyzed whole genome gene expression modifications in human colon biopsies in relation to fecal NOC exposure. We had a particular interest in patients suffering from intestinal inflammation as this may stimulate endogenous NOC formation, and consequently predispose to CRC risk. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome patients without inflammation, serving as controls, were therefore recruited. Fecal NOC were demonstrated {{in the majority of}} subjects. By associating gene expression levels of all subjects to fecal NOC levels, we identified a NOC exposure-associated transcriptomic response that suggests that physiological NOC concentrations may potentially induce genotoxic responses and chromatin modifications in human colon tissue, both of which are linked to carcinogenicity. In a network analysis, chromatin modifications were linked to 11 significantly modulated histone genes, pointing towards a possible epigenetic mechanism that may be relevant in comprehending NOC-induced carcinogenesis. In addition, pro-inflammatory transcriptomic modifications were identified in visually non-inflamed regions of the IBD colon. However, fecal NOC levels were slightly but not significantly increased in IBD patients, suggesting that inflammation did not strongly stimulate NOC formation. We conclude that NOC exposure is associated with gene expression modifications in the human colon that may suggest a potential role of these compounds in CRC development...|$|R
