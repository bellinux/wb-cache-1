5|$|By 917, Simeon was {{preparing}} for yet <b>another</b> <b>war</b> against Byzantium. He attempted to conclude an anti-Byzantine union with the Pechenegs, but his envoys could not match the financial resources of the Byzantines, who succeeded in outbidding them.

5|$|Chadwick did {{not believe}} that there was any {{likelihood}} of <b>another</b> <b>war</b> with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend <b>another</b> <b>war</b> in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E

Nabis offered to withdraw the rest of his garrison from Argos and to hand over to the Romans any deserters and prisoners. Flamininus called <b>another</b> <b>war</b> council.

5|$|After the war, the Navy's accomplishments {{paid off}} {{in the form of}} better funding, and it {{embarked}} on the construction of many new ships. However, the expense of the larger ships was prohibitive, and many of them stayed in shipyards half-completed, in readiness for <b>another</b> <b>war,</b> until the Age of Sail had almost completely passed. The main force of the Navy continued to be large sailing frigates with a number of smaller sloops during the three decades of peace. By the 1840s, the Navy began to adopt steam power and shell guns, but they lagged behind the French and British in adopting the new technologies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>war</b> with Russia {{followed}} in 1632 and was concluded without much {{change in the}} status quo. King Władysław IV then proceeded to recover the lands lost to Sweden. At {{the conclusion of the}} hostilities, Sweden evacuated the cities and ports of Royal Prussia but kept most of Livonia. Courland, which had remained with the Commonwealth, assumed the servicing of Lithuania's Baltic trade. After Frederick William's last Prussian homage before the Polish king in 1641, the Commonwealth's position in regard to Prussia and its Hohenzollern rulers kept getting weaker.|$|E
5|$|As Belgium had {{suffered}} so much damage in World War I, {{there was little}} appetite within the country to involve itself in any potential European conflict. In October 1936, King Leopold III announced that Belgium would remain neutral {{in the event of}} <b>another</b> <b>war</b> in Europe as part of what he termed an Independent Policy (Politique d'Indépendance). To this end, the Belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances: leaving the Locarno Treaty, repudiating a defence pact with France signed in 1920 and receiving a guarantee of neutrality from Nazi Germany in 1937.|$|E

5|$|Denmark was {{an ally of}} the Habsburg Holy Roman Empire, and it {{was evident}} that Sweden {{was on the verge of}} yet <b>another</b> <b>war</b> with that country.

The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman's first government in May 1948, helped articulate European public opinion and gave the Community idea positive support.|$|E
