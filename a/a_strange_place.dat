5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel, {{but the idea of}} Bart and Lisa {{attending}} a military academy had previously been pitched, and had been floating around since 1991. The idea had not yet been used as an episode plot, because the writers had not felt comfortable with taking Bart and Lisa to <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>place</b> early in the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine moving to <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>place</b> where {{she does not}} know the local {{language}} is replicated in Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). The heroine has a dilemma; because {{she does not know}} the language in Delhi she can barely socialise with local people, and she is at loggerheads with the only person with whom she can relate. According to Rangan, the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is the first instance in Tamil cinema where a man invites a woman for a cup of coffee. He compared it to Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam said that he was inspired by the Doors and the Beatles and, although it was not uncommon to invite a woman for a cup of coffee, it was not reflected in the Tamil cinema of the time.|$|E
25|$|Mental {{confusion}} is extremely common following a hip fracture. It usually clears completely, but the disorienting experience of pain, immobility, loss of independence, moving to <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>place,</b> surgery, and drugs combine to cause delirium or accentuate pre-existing dementia.|$|E

"He's in <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>place</b> {{and wants}} to be accepted—which is a {{situation}} that I have found myself in many times when travelling {{from city to city}} all over the world. He's most comfortable with children, and I have a great love for kids. He gives love and wants love in return, which is me. And he has that super power which lets him lift off and fly whenever he wants to get away from things on Earth, and I can identify with that. He and I are alike in many ways" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by R. W. Goodwin, an {{executive}} producer and director for the show. This was the second instance where {{a member of the}} production crew wrote an episode, the first being Mat Beck's [...] "Wetwired". [...] Goodwin was inspired to write the episode after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, a series of essays by Oliver Sacks, in particular The Landscape of Dreams featuring a man who could recall every detail of his childhood. Goodwin {{came up with the idea}} of having Fox Mulder waking up in <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>place</b> with no idea how he got there. After receiving approval from series creator Chris Carter, Goodwin spent approximately six weeks writing the episode.|$|E
500|$|... "LoveGame" [...] saw the {{beginning}} of the Subway section, with Gaga wearing a translucent nun's habit, and a skeletal hand. The song was performed {{with the aid of a}} gilded subway car and a [...] "disco stick" [...] while her next number [...] "Boys Boys Boys" [...] featured muscly male dancers cavorting in spandex shorts. After a costume change, Gaga burst into [...] "Money Honey" [...] with an extended keytar solo after emerging from beneath the stage as the New York scenery disappeared around her. As she walked towards the Glitter way, Gaga recalls when she was in jail and her friend Beyoncé bailed her out, thus performing the song [...] "Telephone". A piano is then brought in and Gaga goes into the song [...] "Brown Eyes", after which she performs [...] "Speechless". This segment also saw the performance of [...] "You and I" [...] in some of the shows; the song was later added to Gaga's second studio album, Born This Way. During this song, she tells the audience about her life as a teen in New York, and how she became who she is today. Gaga and her friends then continue down the Glitter Way, and soon they run into an angel, who plays a tune that summons a twister, taking them closer to the Monster Ball, but landing them in <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>place</b> that they did not know. Gaga sings [...] "So Happy I Could Die", decked in a white dress, that moves on its own accord.|$|E

2500|$|Alebrijes (...) are {{brightly colored}} Mexican folk art sculptures of fantastical creatures. The first alebrijes, along {{with use of}} the term, {{originated}} with Pedro Linares. [...] In the 1930s, Linares fell very ill {{and while he was}} in bed, unconscious, Linares dreamt of <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>place</b> resembling a forest. There, he saw trees, animals, rocks, clouds that suddenly turned into something strange, some kind of animals, but, unknown animals. He saw a donkey with butterfly wings, a rooster with bull horns, a lion with an eagle head, and all of them were shouting one word, [...] "Alebrijes". [...] Upon recovery, he began recreating the creatures he saw in cardboard and papier-mâché and called them Alebrijes.|$|E
2500|$|Santa Claus Lane {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by music critics. An AllMusic editor gave the album {{three out of}} five stars. Jaan Uhelszki, in an editorial review for Amazon.com, gave Santa Claus Lane a negative review. She wrote the album, consisting mostly of Christmas covers, [...] "add little to the holiday music canon". She also felt that it only [...] "perks up" [...] on songs that feature guest musicians. Kelefa Sanneh considered for The New York Times {{it to be a}} [...] "concept album" [...] and it was [...] "loosely inspired by Saint Nicholas, the fourth-century bishop of Myra." [...] Christopher Thelen gave a more positive review to the album. While writing for the Daily Vault, Thelen gave a B- grade and wrote it [...] "does show there is a voice behind the pretty young face, even if this is <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>place</b> to start one's recording career." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then {{they led}} him to <b>a</b> <b>strange,</b> dark <b>place,</b> lit up with torches; where troops of Spirits flew busily to and fro, among damp rocks, and through dark {{galleries}} that led far down into the earth. [...] "What do they here?" [...] asked Thistle.|$|R

60|$|The city of Bergen is {{a famous}} and <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> old <b>place.</b> In ancient {{days it was}} a stronghold of the Vikings--those notorious sea-warriors who were little better than pirates, and who issued from among the dark {{mountains}} of Norway in their great uncouth galleys and swept across the seas, landing on the coasts everywhere, to the terror of surrounding nations.|$|R

60|$|Now {{that we were}} {{standing}} in the street, after being thus ignominiouly escorted thither, my little friend was plainly reduced to the 'piccolo giro,' or little circuit of the town, he had formerly proposed. But my suggestion that we should visit the Palazzo Te (of which I had heard a great deal, as <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> wild <b>place)</b> imparted new life to him, and away we went.|$|R
50|$|As Quinten {{grows up}} he {{is haunted by}} dreams of <b>a</b> <b>strange,</b> otherworldly <b>place</b> that has no outside but only an inside. This inside is filled with strange bridges, cranes and architecture. This fuels his {{interest}} in architecture and causes him to obsessively make drawings of this place. He also takes care of an old cemetery lot {{in the garden of}} the castle, where a racing horse is buried. He seems <b>a</b> rather <b>strange</b> child.|$|R

25|$|I {{see people}} who write {{characters}} who are loonies and make them convincing and believable, and I envy them tremendously. I don’t really understand them. It’s funny, because I’ve created my own monster. In the ‘Great War’ and ‘American Empire’ books, I’m writing {{the person who is}} the functional equivalent of Adolf Hitler. I’m inside his head — and that’s <b>a</b> very <b>strange</b> <b>place</b> for somebody who thinks of himself as a fairly rational fellow to be. That’s alarming.|$|R
50|$|After this beginning, {{the story}} follows James-Michael's life {{as he is}} fostered to two young women in the Hell's Kitchen {{neighborhood}} of New York City. The series explores the problems he encounters in <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> new <b>place,</b> and his trials and friendships in a New York City public school. Issues of racism and bullying are addressed, although the stories' focus is on how the reserved and detached James-Michael relates to the world around him.|$|R
40|$|Long Day's {{journey into}} Night may seem <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> {{starting}} <b>place</b> for <b>a</b> feminist analysis of modernism and post-modernism. Yet {{even the most}} conservative criticism reads this play as an enactment and embodiment of loss, specifically loss of the mother. That loss is rarely seen {{in the context of}} a more general "loss", a cultural loss of legitimacy and authenticity, endemic in and enabling modernism, articulated as "disinheritance" by an Other "coded as feminine. ...|$|R
