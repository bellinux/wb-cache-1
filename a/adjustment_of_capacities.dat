Specific attention is given to recent developments to incorporate multiple decision makers, multiple capacity types, hedging, and risk aversion. Capacity {{is a measure of}} processing abilities and limitations and is represented as a vector of stocks of various processing resources, while investment is the change <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> and includes expansion and contraction. After discussing general issues in capacity investment problems, the paper reviews models <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> investment under uncertainty in three settings: The first reviews optimal capacity investment by single and multiple risk-neutral decision makers in a stationary environment where capacity remains constant.

40|$|We {{argue that}} a {{fundamental}} difference between Post-Keynesian approaches to economic growth lies in their treatment of investment. Kaleckian-Robinsonian models postulate an investment function dependent on the accelerator and profitability. Some of these models rely {{on the importance of}} profitability, captured by the profit share, {{to make the case for}} profit-led growth. For their part, Kaldorian models place the emphasis on the accelerator. More important, investment is a derived demand; that is, it is ruled by the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> to exogenous demand, which, in turn, determines the normal level <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> utilization. In our view, the Kaldorian approach is better equipped to deal with some of the issues relating income distribution to accumulation with effective demand in the long run. We develop a Kaldorian open-economy model to examine the conditions under which an increase in real wages can produce profit or wage-led growth, showing that the limit to a wage-led expansion is a binding external constraint. The role and limitations of wages as a determinant of growth are further examined through spectral techniques and cycle analysis for a subset of developed economies. The evidence indicates that real wages are positively related to growth, investment, and capacity utilization. It also highlights the role of finance in sustaining expansions, suggesting that debt-led growth should not be identified with profit-led growth...|$|R

Most of the related studies focus on a few individual technical issues, in particular on modularity or configurability of individual RMTs. Other important concerns such as cost and processing accuracy have not been adequately addressed. As a result, many highly reconfigurable manufacturing systems turn out to be unprofitable.

40|$|The ongoing {{discussion}} about the future implementation of high-speed rail (HSR) in the Northeast Corridor (NEC) is full of questions on the feasibility of HSR {{and the ability of}} Amtrak to implement it. Indeed, the introduction of the Acela Express in the past decade was not free from operating problems, but even with trains running below their full potential, the Amtrak NEC had substantial market growth. Thus, it is not clear if a true HSR service is feasible in the NEC, and if the current prospects are potentially effective. To evaluate the performance of the NEC and its main services in FY 2002 - 2012, and make inferences about HSR in the NEC for the next 30 years, we use productivity analysis. We employ a non-parametric single factor productivity (SFP) Törnqvist trans-log index approach with several metrics. We set ridership, revenue, revenue passenger-miles (RPM), and available seat-miles (ASM) as outputs, and operating costs as input. In this way, we provided guidelines and a robust structure of analysis that can be useful for subsequent passenger rail productivity studies. We find that the NEC experienced highly volatile, but considerable productivity growth in FY 2002 - 2012 (in the range of ~ 1 - 3 % per year). Amtrak increased its ability to fill up and economically exploit the available capacity, but did not perform equally well on the supply side. Service changes, technical problems with train sets, targeted capital investments, and economic recession and recovery were the main drivers of productivity change. The Acela Express and Northeast Regional were very sensitive to external events, had large economies of scale, and implemented slow <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> via rolling stock and infrastructure improvements, which varied depending on the service. The characteristics of the NEC reveal a potential for a successful introduction of HSR, but although Amtrak's Vision for HSR in the NEC is realistic (in terms of productivity), it is risky and perhaps the time scale is not ambitious enough. We recommend revising the current projections, incorporate additional planning approaches, accelerate key stages of the Vision and include the FAA in the planning process. by Andrés Felipe Archila Téllez.

40|$|In this paper, dynamic {{capacity}} management {{refers to}} the process of dynamically changing the <b>capacity</b> allocation (reservation) <b>of</b> a pseudo-wire established between two network end points. This process is based on certain criteria including instantaneous traffic load for the pseudo-wire, network utilization, time of day, or day <b>of</b> week. Frequent <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>capacity</b> yields a scalability issue {{in the form of a}} significant amount of message processing in the network elements involved in the capacity update process. On the other hand, if the capacity is adjusted once and for the worst possible traffic conditions, a significant amount of bandwidth may be wasted depending on the actual traffic load. There is then a need for dynamic capacity management that takes into account the tradeoff between scalability and bandwidth efficiency. This problem is motivated by voice over packet networks in which end-to-end reservation requests are initiated by PSTN voice calls and these reservations are aggregated into one signal reservation in the core packet network for scalability. In this paper, we introduce a Markov decision framework for an optimal reservation aggregation scheme for voice over packet networks. Moreover, for problems with large sizes, we provide a suboptimal scheme using reinforcement learning. We show a significant improvement in bandwidth efficiency in voice over packet networks using aggregate reservations. © 2003 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Short-term {{effects of}} {{elevated}} CO 2 {{during the early}} life phase of plants may have long lasting consequences for growth and biomass in later periods. We exposed hydroponically grown wheat seedlings to 5 d pulses of elevated CO 2 while leaf expansion growth as well as shoot and root gas exchange were measured simultaneously and continuously. Shoot photosynthesis, night-time shoot respiration and below-ground respiration (largely by roots) roughly doubled when atmospheric CO 2 concentration was doubled. An interruption of CO 2 enrichment caused CO 2 assimilation and respiration to return to control levels. However, while the response of photosynthesis was immediate, that of respiration showed a hysteresis of about 3 d. Since shoot biomass increased at elevated CO 2 (with no change in allocation pattern) equal fluxes per shoot or root system after a return to control CO 2 concentrations indicate substantial downward <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>capacity</b> for CO 2 fixation and release in high-CO 2 grown plants.

30|$|The <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> limited <b>capacities</b> {{in annual}} periods to depict {{alternative}} facility configurations realistically requires the selection among a discrete set of alternatives (Amrani et al. 2011). In literature, {{the latter are}} usually modeled by capacity levels. Amiri (2006) introduces capacity levels available to potential warehouses and plants and resolves substantial drawbacks of previous strategic approaches. These capacity levels affect the maximum production or throughput at the facilities and the fixed costs for operating within the entire planning horizon, which is not subdivided into time periods. The same applies to the fuzzy multi-objective model that has been developed by Selim and Ozkarahan (2008) for the SC distribution network design problem. Within their two-echelon SC network design problem in a deterministic single-period multi-commodity context, Sadjady and Davoudpour (2012) model alternative capacity levels for warehouses and plants, and additionally provide an algorithm for their determination. Babazadeh et al. (2013) apply the selection <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> levels to locations of three different stages (plants, warehouses, cross-docks) of their supply chain network. Correia et al. (2013) model a finite set <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> levels for product families that is available at each potential location. According to their multi-period formulation, the resulting capacity alternatives within the time periods are related to technology selection. Keyvanshokooh et al. (2013) include capacity levels in a model applicable to integrated forward/reverse logistics network design, as they assign them to production/recovery centers, distribution centers and collection centers. Within the multi-objective stochastic model for a forward/reverse logistic network design by Ramezani et al. (2013), the opening of plants, distribution centers, collection centers, hybrid processing facilities and disposal centers is connected to alternative capacity levels. Azad and Davoudpour (2013) use capacity levels for the distribution centers within their stochastic distribution network designing problem to route the vehicles to serve the customers more flexibly. Furthermore, {{they found out that}} capacity utilization increases to a higher level in this way. A set <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> levels for distribution centers is modeled by Ashtab et al. (2014) within their non-linear optimization model for multi-capacitated three-level supply chain design. Tofighi et al. (2016) consider capacity levels for central warehouses to select the facilities’ storage capacity and establishing costs while optimizing a two-echelon humanitarian logistics network design problem by a two-stage scenario-based possibilistic-stochastic programming approach.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} react to the {{continuous}} and unpredictable changes in product demand, in product variety, and in process technologies, reconfigurable manufacturing systems allow quick <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> production <b>capacity</b> and functionality by rearranging or changing their modular components. In this kind of system, operation management issues, such as exception handling policies, become more complex since correct reconfiguration strategies have to be selected. This paper explores the potential of the reconfigurability feature to be a basis for the development of new strategies to handle out-of-the-ordinary events in the production process; in particular, maintaining production flow when machine breakdowns occur. Decisions regarding how to deal with exceptions to the production process are complex and depend on the manufacturing system configuration and on many performance and economic variables. The authors propose agent-based manufacturing control for exception handling because of its ability to be very agile, as well as being reactive and efficient. Manufacturing agents, while working to pursue their specific goals, achieve the global target of the system. Complex decisions can be made due to the synergy arising from the agents' internal reasoning and the negotiation process among these agents. The adopted negotiation mechanism is based on the contract-net protocol, while different strategies have been designed for the internal reasoning. The authors demonstrate that, under certain conditions, an agent's internal strategies based on fuzzy reasoning improve the global performance of the system. The proposed control model has been tested on a discrete event simulation test-bed...|$|R

The data suggests that the timing, focus, and geographical distribution of reforms reflect the interplay between economic shocks and existing institutions. The 2008 crisis was followed by increased policy activity in most policy domains in {{a large number of}} EU countries, initially to cushion the impact of the crisis on employment and incomes, subsequently to improve the <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> labour markets. Regression analysis indicates that reform activism is stronger in countries with lower GDP per capita and long-standing EU membership, under critical economic and labour market conditions, and where political costs are low. The direction of reforms is affected by economic and labour market conditions, available fiscal space, and by initial policy settings.|$|R
