On 25 October 2009 her story was featured on CNN's television program Another Day: Cheating Death. Hosted by Sanjay Gupta, the program features stories {{from people who have}} survived severe conditions against all odds. Bågenholm hoped the program would give the people watching it more knowledge of hypothermia. The story is also included in Gupta's companion book, Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that <b>Are</b> <b>Saving</b> Lives Against All Odds. On 30 October 2009, Bågenholm and Gilbert appeared together on the popular Norwegian NRK talk show Skavlan, hosted by Fredrik Skavlan.|$|E

500|$|In The Boston Globe, H.W. Brands called Ellis [...] "the reigning {{master of}} the episodic {{approach}} to history"; he complimented the book's style but disagreed with Ellis' conclusion that blurred sovereignty {{was one of the}} Constitution's greatest strengths. Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post wrote that he felt Ellis' portrait of the Founders was largely accurate, but that in his reading of the slavery issue, he was [...] "a trifle guilty of the 'presentism' -- seeing the past through the prism of the present -- that he elsewhere deplores". Reviewing for The Christian Science Monitor, Randy Dotinga wrote that the book's close examination of [...] "dry and tedious" [...] political debates [...] "makes for rough sledding at times", and criticized Ellis' dismissal of academic historians. However, he concluded that [...] "Ellis's sharp writing style and appreciation for irony <b>are</b> <b>saving</b> graces".|$|E
500|$|Hayek {{created the}} Austrian {{business}} cycle theory, which synthesizes Menger's capital theory and Mises's {{theory of money}} and credit. The theory proposes a model of inter-temporal investment in which production plans precede the manufacture of the finished product. The producers revise production plans to adapt to changes in consumer preferences. Producers respond to [...] "derived demand," [...] which is estimated demand for the future, instead of current demand. If consumers reduce their spending, producers believe that consumers <b>are</b> <b>saving</b> for additional spending later, so that production remains constant. Combined with a market of loanable funds (which relates savings and investment through the interest rate), this theory of capital production leads to {{a model of the}} macroeconomy where markets reflect inter-temporal preferences. Hayek's model suggests that an economic bubble begins when cheap credit initiates a boom where resources are misallocated, so that early stages of production receive more resources than they should and overproduction begins; the later stages of capital are not funded for maintenance to prevent depreciation. Overproduction in the early stages cannot be processed by poorly maintained later stage capital. The boom becomes a bust when a lack of finished goods leads to [...] "forced saving" [...] since fewer finished goods can be produced for sale.|$|E

2500|$|Others {{dispute the}} {{importance}} of consumption over income, pointing out that if middle and lower income are consuming more than they earn {{it is because they}} <b>are</b> <b>saving</b> less or going deeper into debt. A [...] "growing body of work" [...] suggests that income inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debt, as high earners bid up the price of real estate and middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle. Between 1983 and 2007, the top 5 percent saw their debt fall from 80 cents for every dollar of income to 65 cents, while the bottom 95 percent saw their debt rise from 60 cents for every dollar of income to $1.40. Economist Krugman has found a strong correlation between inequality and household debt in the United States over the last hundred years.|$|E
2500|$|The Wii Vitality Sensor was a {{cancelled}} peripheral; a fingertip {{pulse oximeter}} sensor that connected through the Wii Remote. According to Nintendo, the device [...] "will initially sense the user's pulse {{and a number}} of other signals being transmitted by their bodies, and will then provide information to the users about the body’s inner world." [...] The Wii Vitality Sensor was announced by President and CEO Satoru Iwata at Nintendo's E3 2009 media briefing on June 2, 2009. No specific applications were revealed for the device, but when presenting the device Iwata suggested that video games may soon be used for relaxation. According to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime, more details concerning the Wii Vitality Sensor were to be showcased during E3 2010, although no mention of the device occurred. Reggie told GameTrailers, [...] "(E3) was not the kind of environment for a game based on relaxation", mentioning they <b>are</b> <b>saving</b> news on the device for another time and place. At E3 2010, Ubisoft introduced their own pulse oximeter sensor, [...] "Innergy". However, at E3 2011, Nintendo announced more about the Wii Vitality Sensor.
