40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to examine {{the extent to which}} brief abrupt-onset visual stimuli involuntarily capture spatial attention. A fundumantal limitation on the conscious control of spatial <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated. Data obtained reveal conditions under which the control of spatial <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> completely involuntary: <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> captured by an irrelevant event despite subjects' intentions to ignore the event. The paradigm used provided strong incentives to ignore the distracting abrupt onset, but these were insufficient to prevent capture. Results suggest that voluntary control of <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> limited to focusing attention in advance on locations, objects, or properties of interest. Under appropriate conditions, spatial <b>attention</b> can <b>be</b> involantarily drawn to abrupt-onset events despite the intention of subjects' to ignore them...|$|R

5|$|Adolf Hitler {{was furious}} that the British {{had been able}} to sail a {{flotilla}} of ships up the Loire unhindered. His immediate reaction was to dismiss Generaloberst Carl Hilpert, chief-of-staff to the Commander in Chief West.

By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} focus <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> a central feature of human cognition. <b>Attention</b> <b>is</b> multifaceted, {{sometimes}} driven by internal goals and sometimes by external stimu-lation. The time course of attention also varies from pe-riods {{of time that}} are quite short (a few milliseconds) to longer periods (a few seconds or minutes). Goal-driven <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> referred to as top-down or endogenous at-tention, whereas stimulus-driven <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> referred to as bottom-up or exogenous attention, driven by external events in the environment (e. g., Posner & Cohen, 1984). Allocating attention over short time periods {{can be referred to}} as phasic orienting (Posner, 1980), whereas maintain-ing attention over longer time periods is referred to as sus-tained attention, or vigilance (Parasuraman, 1986). The interactions among these varieties of attention come int...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{concepts}} {{are defined by}} metaphors. These metaphors determine what <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> and what count as adequate explanations of the phenomenon. The authors analyze these metaphors within 3 types of attention theories: (a) “cause ” theories, in which <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> presumed to modulate information processing (e. g., attention as a spotlight; attention as a limited resource); (b) “effect ” theories, in which <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> {{considered to be a}} by-product of information processing (e. g., the competition metaphor); and (c) hybrid theories that combine cause and effect aspects (e. g., biasedcompetition models). The present analysis reveals the crucial role of metaphors in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and the efforts of scientists to find a resolution to the classic problem of cause versus effect interpretations. Everyone knows what <b>attention</b> <b>is.</b> (William James, 1890 / 1950, p. 261) No one knows what <b>attention</b> <b>is,</b> and [...] . there may even not be an “it ” there to be known about (although of course there might be).

5000|$|<b>Attention</b> <b>is</b> {{commonly}} {{understood as}} the ability to select some things while ignoring others. <b>Attention</b> <b>is</b> controllable, selective, and limited. It is the progression by which external stimuli form internal representations that gain conscious awareness. <b>Attention</b> <b>is</b> part of nearly every waking moment for humans, as it is the focusing of one's thoughts. Selective attention utilizes cognitive processes to focus on relevant targets on input, thoughts or actions while neglecting irrelevant sources of input. This is the basis for how we attend to specific stimuli. Voluntary attention, otherwise known as top-down <b>attention,</b> <b>is</b> the aspect over which we have control, enabling us to act in a goal-directed manner. [...] In contrast, reflexive <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> driven by exogenous stimuli redirecting our current focus of attention to a new stimulus, thus it is a bottom-up influence. These two divisions of <b>attention</b> <b>are</b> continuously competing to be the momentary foci of attention. Selection models of attention theorize how specific stimuli gain our awareness. Early selection models emphasize physical features of stimuli are attended to, while late selection models argue that semantic features are what determine our current focus of attention. These selection models are utilized by researchers to propose when stimulus information is attended to.|$|R

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> placed on the weather {{forecast}} and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Between 1710 and 1713 {{a further}} {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> paid to the lunettes.|$|E
