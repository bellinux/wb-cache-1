5|$|Always a loner, {{he spent}} hours playing with toy trains, preferring {{to cross the}} street rather than speak to anyone. He {{attended}} Whitehall Infant School, then Whitehall Junior School, feeling nervous <b>and</b> <b>shy</b> to the point of feeling faint during morning assembly and having to leave before he passed out. The family doctor suggested a referral to a child psychologist, but his father would have none of it.|$|E
5|$|From his Oxford years onward, Auden's friends uniformly {{described}} him as funny, extravagant, sympathetic, generous, and, partly by his own choice, lonely. In groups he was often dogmatic and overbearing in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident <b>and</b> <b>shy</b> except when certain of his welcome. He was punctual in his habits, and obsessive about meeting deadlines, while choosing to live amidst physical disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} an heir {{produced}} changes in PedroII's character. Previously isolated <b>and</b> <b>shy,</b> {{he became more}} outgoing and confident as monarch. His strained relationship with his wife, {{the product of a}} disappointing arranged marriage, also improved, and with children came shared domestic interests that developed into an affectionate friendship.|$|E

5|$|Charlotte was a {{favourite}} of her paternal grandparents, {{whom she}} frequently saw. King Wilhelm and Queen Augusta spoiled their granddaughter and encouraged her {{rebellion against the}} Crown Prince and Princess, and Charlotte and her brother frequently took their side in disputes with her parents. This rebellion was encouraged by the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who held political disagreements with the liberal Crown Prince and Princess. Charlotte also enjoyed {{a close relationship with}} her eldest brother, though they grew apart after his marriage in 1881 to Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein ("Dona"), a princess described by Charlotte as plain, slow-witted, <b>and</b> <b>shy.</b> Charlotte's relationship with Wilhelm would remain troubled as a result.|$|E
5|$|Following graduation, Mercury {{joined a}} series of bands and sold {{second-hand}} clothes in the Kensington Market in London with girlfriend Mary Austin. He also held a job at Heathrow Airport. Friends from the time remember him as a quiet <b>and</b> <b>shy</b> young man who showed {{a great deal of}} interest in music. In 1969 he joined the Liverpool-based band Ibex, later renamed Wreckage. He lived briefly in a flat above the Liverpool pub, The Dovedale Towers. When this band failed to take off, he joined a second band called Sour Milk Sea. However, by early 1970 this group had broken up as well.|$|E
5|$|George Smith's sister Anne {{married and}} had a son named James Christian McGill (1880–1972). McGill was {{orphaned}} {{at a young age}} when his parents died in the mid-1880s during an unspecified epidemic and was subsequently raised, along with his infant sister Eleanor, by Mrs. Smith and George Smith. Smith was a notoriously reticent <b>and</b> <b>shy</b> individual that only granted one interview during his lifetime, in which he relayed only information pertaining to racing matters. Consequently, much of the published biographical information on Pittsburgh Phil's early life, his rise to fame and the reasoning behind his methods on the track comes from interviews with his nephew, James McGill, who was a close confidant in the ten years preceding George Smith's death.|$|E

5|$|However, Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul {{basketball}} coach Ray Meyer, who saw {{potential in the}} bright and intelligent, but also clumsy <b>and</b> <b>shy,</b> freshman. Put into perspective, Meyer's thoughts were revolutionary, {{because at the time}} it was believed that tall players were too awkward to ever play basketball well. In the following months, Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident, aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it. Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively, and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand. This routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill. In addition, Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag, take dancing lessons, and jump rope to make him a complete athlete.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick {{attended}} William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. One of {{his classmates}} was Edith Gormezano, later known as the singer Eydie Gorme. Though he joined the school's photographic club, which permitted him to photograph the school's events in their magazine, he was a mediocre student, with a meager 67 grade average. Introverted <b>and</b> <b>shy,</b> Kubrick had a low attendance record, and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. He graduated in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated hope of higher education. Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of contemporary American schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating critical thinking and student interest. His father was disappointed in his son's failure to achieve excellence in school, of which he felt Stanley was fully capable. Jack also encouraged Stanley to read from the former's library at home, {{while at the same}} time permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Lennon {{had been}} a shock for Harry, as Lennon often dressed like a Teddy boy, and was a {{disruptive}} influence at the college. Despite his misgivings about Lennon, Harry introduced him to Sutcliffe, who was a small, softly-spoken <b>and</b> <b>shy</b> student, who had painted a portrait of Harry. The three often spent time together at the Ye Cracke pub in Rice Street, or {{on the top floor}} of the Jacaranda club (run by Williams, who later managed the Beatles). Harry met his then 16-year-old future wife-to-be, Virginia Sowry, at the club. Harry, Lennon, Sutcliffe and Rod Murray saw the poet Royston Ellis at Liverpool University in June 1960. Having been disappointed with Ellis' performance, Harry proposed the idea that they should call the assembled quartet of friends the Dissenters, and make Liverpool famous: Sutcliffe and Murray with their paintings, Harry's writing and Lennon's music.|$|E
50|$|I Love Trouble is a 1994 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{starring}} Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte. It was written and {{produced by the}} husband-and-wife team of Nancy Meyers <b>and</b> Charles <b>Shyer,</b> <b>and</b> directed by <b>Shyer.</b>|$|R

He {{described himself as a}} quiet <b>and</b> <b>shy</b> child who did not overcome his shyness until he became involved with his high school drama department. His friends recall him as being very funny.|$|E

When still 15, Miss Darcy almost eloped with Mr. Wickham, but was saved by her brother, who she idolises. Thanks to years of tutorage under masters, she is {{accomplished}} at the piano, singing, playing the harp, and drawing, and modern languages, and is therefore described as Caroline Bingley's idea of an 'accomplished woman'.|$|E
25|$|A quiet <b>and</b> <b>shy</b> boy in his youth, Khan grew up {{with his}} four sisters in {{relatively}} affluent (upper middle-class) circumstances and received a privileged education. He was educated at Aitchison College in Lahore and the Royal Grammar School Worcester in England, where he excelled at cricket. In 1972 he enrolled in Keble College, Oxford where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating with honours in 1975. On 16 May 1995, Khan married Jemima Goldsmith, in a two-minute ceremony conducted in Urdu in Paris. A month later, on 21 June, they were married again in a civil ceremony at the Richmond registry office in England. Jemima converted to Islam. The couple have two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.|$|E
25|$|Fire: The fire {{signs are}} Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. A native with mainly fire signs will be energetic, {{enthusiastic}} and optimistic, with {{a need to}} be {{in the center of the}} action making things happen. They can be egotistical, headstrong and sometimes arrogant, but also can be generous, warm-hearted, and spontaneously kind. Fire subjects are independent and prefer to have control over their own lives, but they can also be sometimes autocratic. A subject lacking fire signs will be fearful or over-cautious, pessimistic <b>and</b> <b>shy,</b> and will lack enthusiasm, confidence and faith in the future. Planets in the 1st, 5th and 9th houses and an emphasis on cardinal signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

25|$|Tracht {{found a home}} at WAPE in Jacksonville, Florida, in August 1975 {{and became}} the {{dominant}} radio personality not just in northeast Florida, but in the Southeastern United States While in Jacksonville, his true identity was kept confidential because the public was disappointed that the booming, macho voice belonged to a young guy who was skinny <b>and</b> <b>shy.</b> The station turned Tracht's request for privacy into a marketing ploy. Curtains were hung {{in the window of}} the broadcast booth, a TV interview showed only his lips, and Tracht wore a gorilla costume at personal appearances. Tracht was named as the top radio personality in the United States for 1977 and 1980. In 1979, he signed a five-year contract worth $1 million.|$|E
25|$|In {{some regions}} in India where human {{disturbance}} is minor, the gaur is very timid <b>and</b> <b>shy</b> despite their great size and power. When alarmed, gaur {{crash into the}} jungle at a surprising speed. However, in Southeast Asia and South India, where {{they are used to}} the presence of humans, gaur are said by locals to be very bold and aggressive. They are frequently known to go into fields and graze alongside domestic cattle, sometimes killing them in fights. Gaur bulls may charge without provocation, especially during summer, when the intense heat and parasitic insects make them more short-tempered than usual. To warn other members of its herd of approaching danger, the gaur lets out a high whistle for help.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band's live performances: Well, {{it must be}} hard {{sometimes}} for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters {{and at the same}} time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. I actually think much of the stuff he sings about doesn't go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, smiling and firing up the audience. We're not an energetic power metal band. I think the withdrawn <b>and</b> <b>shy</b> aura actually does more justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don't really fall into the doom and gloom category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{dismounted}} reluctantly. What {{would he}} say about the riding-habit that she wore? She felt very curious to learn, <b>and</b> <b>shyer</b> than ever before, and altogether different. The skirt made her more of a girl, it seemed.|$|R
