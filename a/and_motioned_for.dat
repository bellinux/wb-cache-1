60|$|The old hunter {{had kept}} a keen {{eye on the}} {{movements}} of his three visitors, from the beginning, and had maintained his position, just without {{the threshold of the}} cabin, with a determined manner, that showed he was not to be easily driven from his post.

[...] Gelsomina sprang forward, and knelt {{at the feet}} of her sovereign. Father Anselmo never uttered a clearer or more fervent benediction than that which fell from the lips of the Prince of Venice. He raised the daughter of the prison-keeper, <b>and</b> <b>motioned</b> <b>for</b> both his visitors to withdraw. Gelsomina willingly complied, for her heart was already in the cell of Jacopo, in the eagerness to communicate her success; but the Carmelite lingered to cast a look behind, like one better acquainted with the effects of worldly policy, when connected with the interests of those who pervert governments to the advantage of the privileged. As he passed through the door, however, he felt his hopes revive, for he saw the aged prince, unable any longer to suppress his feelings, hastening towards his still silent companion, with both hands extended, eyes moistening with tears, and a look that betrayed the emotions of one anxious to find relief in human sympathies.|$|E
60|$|Judith had scarce {{attended}} to this rude attempt of Hurry's at consolation, although she necessarily understood its general drift, {{and had a}} tolerably accurate notion of its manner. She was weeping at the recollection of her mother's early tenderness, and painful images of long forgotten lessons and neglected precepts were crowding her mind. The words of Hurry, however, recalled her to the present time, and abrupt and unseasonable as was their import, they did not produce those signs of distaste that {{one might have expected}} from the girl's character. On the contrary, she appeared to be struck with some sudden idea, gazed intently for a moment at the young man, dried her eyes, and led the way {{to the other end of}} the scow, signifying her wish for him to follow. Here she took a seat <b>and</b> <b>motioned</b> <b>for</b> March to place himself at her side. The decision and earnestness with which all this was done a little intimidated her companion, and Judith found it necessary to open the subject herself.|$|E

The contempt charge came in a federal hearing when Gremillion challenged a judge's ruling that affidavit testimony, instead of witness testimony, be allowed. Gremillion asserted {{he had not been}} made aware of the affidavits in question, as is required, <b>and</b> <b>motioned</b> <b>for</b> a postponement.

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by an actual incident, according to Wright. She told Billboard magazine that in mid-2003, she was driving in Nashville when a motorist in a minivan behind her noticed the Marine Corps sticker on the artist's bumper. Wright's brother is a Marine who sent her the sticker before he shipped off to Iraq. Wright said that the woman began honking, swerving and flicking her lights. [...] "I look in the rear view, and she's flipping me the bird, hard, I thought I cut her off, because I'm a really bad driver." [...] She {{went on to say}} that when the woman finally pulled up next to her <b>and</b> <b>motioned</b> <b>for</b> her to roll down her window she screamed [...] "Your war is wrong. You're a baby killer." [...] She went home and immediately wrote the song.|$|E

At that time, I was a correspondent for the newspaper [...] "Izvestiya." [...] It was his tenth concert on that tour. The concert hall was sold out, but I decided to try to go anyway. Fortunately, Rashid's manager saw me <b>and</b> <b>motioned</b> <b>for</b> me to follow him backstage. There I found Rashid pacing the floor. The manager cautioned me, [...] "He's getting ready to go on stagebetter not disturb him right now." [...] I stood silently as if frozen.Suddenly, Rashid looked up, recognized me and came and hugged me. [...] "Where have you been for so long?" [...] he asked. [...] "If you only knew how much I miss Baku and my daughter. Thank God, I'll be flying back tomorrow. So good of you to come. After the concert, let's have dinner together." [...] I remember that the Turkish audience that night knew all of Rashid's repertoire by heart and sang along with him.|$|E
