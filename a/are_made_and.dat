Several changes <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>and</b> limits are increased including allowing 1.5A on charging downstream ports for unconfigured devices, allowing High Speed communication while having a current up to 1.5A, and allowing a maximum current of 5A. Also, support is removed for charging port detection via resistive mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Bronze vessels <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>and</b> placed {{one above}} {{the other at}} {{different}} levels; they are filled with pure water. Each has at the bottom a small opening {{in the form of}} a 'jade dragon's neck'. The water dripping (from above) enters two inflow receivers (alternately), the left one being for the night and the right one for the day. On the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands, thus giving the time.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>and</b> left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E

25|$|Beta-hexosaminidase {{is a vital}} hydrolytic enzyme, {{found in}} the lysosomes, that breaks down lipids.

25|$|Due {{to limited}} disclosure, {{studying}} the returns to private equity is relatively difficult. Unlike mutual funds, {{private equity funds}} need not disclose performance data. And, as they invest in private companies, {{it is difficult to}} examine the underlying investments. It is challenging to compare private equity performance to public equity performance, in particular because private equity fund investments are drawn and returned over time as investments <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>and</b> subsequently realized.|$|E
