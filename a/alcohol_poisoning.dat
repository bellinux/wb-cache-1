5|$|Stage 1 (30 {{minutes to}} 12 hours) {{consists}} of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to <b>alcohol</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Poisoned individuals {{may appear to}} be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizuring, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal <b>alcohol</b> <b>poisoning.</b> As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E

40|$|A {{non-invasive}} method for analyzing the blood-brain barrier includes obtaining a Raman spectrum of a selected {{portion of the}} eye and monitoring the Raman spectrum to ascertain a change to {{the dynamics of the}} blood brain barrier. Also, {{non-invasive method}}s for determining the brain or blood level of an analyte of interest, such as glucose, drugs, <b>alcohol,</b> <b>poisons,</b> and the like, comprises: generating an excitation laser beam (e. g., at a wavelength of 600 to 900 nanometers); focusing the excitation laser beam into the anterior chamber of an eye of the subject so that aqueous humor, vitreous humor, or one or more conjunctiva vessels in the eye is illuminated; detecting (preferably confocally detecting) a Raman spectrum from the illuminated portion of the eye; and then determining the blood level or brain level (intracranial or cerebral spinal fluid level) of an analyte of interest for the subject from the Raman spectrum. In certain embodiments, the detecting step may be followed by the step of subtracting a confounding fluorescence spectrum from the Raman spectrum to produce a difference spectrum; and determining the blood level and/or brain level of the analyte of interest for the subject from that difference spectrum, preferably using linear or nonlinear multivariate analysis such as partial least squares analysis. Apparatus for carrying out the foregoing methods are also disclosed...|$|R
40|$|Background:Poisoning with {{ethylene}} glycol (EG) {{can be fatal}} even if appropriate treatments are delivered. EG poisoning usually causes central nervous system depression, cardiovascular dysfunction, metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure (ARF). Case Report:A 33 -year-old man was referred to the emergency department with reduced consciousness and dyspnea of four-hour duration due to unknown reason. The patient had no history of diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease or asthma. He was tachycardic, tachypneic and hypertensive. Laboratory investigations revealed hyperglycemia, high serum creatinine, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, leukocytosis and high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). He was initially managed as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Alternative diagnoses of toxic <b>alcohols</b> <b>poisoning</b> was considered as there was no improvement. EG ingestion was confirmed when the relatives found an empty bottle of automotive brake oil, a poly glycol-based product, in the patient’s room. Although he was treated with ethanol and hemodialysis, renal failure worsened and finally he succumbed to death due to severe sepsis on the seventh day of EG ingestion. Discussion: This case illustrates the difficulties posed by high toxicity as well as unraveled and delayed diagnosis of EG poisoning. High anion gap and high osmolal gap are characteristics of EG poisoning. Transient pancreatitis caused by EG and insulin resistance due to ARF are the possible explanations for hyperglycemia secondary to EG poisoning. Conclusion:EG poisoning may manifest with hyperglycemia and HAGMA resembling DKA. It {{is important for the}} clinician to have high degree of suspicion for EG poisoning in case of HAGMA and ARF refractory to common treatments...|$|R

25|$|Birthday {{celebrations}} {{are often}} associated with large increases in alcohol consumption. Binge drinking can increase an individual's risk of death through <b>alcohol</b> <b>poisoning,</b> accidents and drunk driving, {{as well as by}} exacerbating existing conditions and increasing suicide risk.

25|$|The {{concentration}} of alcohol in blood is measured via {{blood alcohol content}} (BAC). The amount and circumstances of consumption play a large part in determining the extent of intoxication; for example, eating a heavy meal before alcohol consumption causes alcohol to absorb more slowly. The amount of alcohol consumed largely determines the extent of hangovers, although hydration also plays a role. After excessive drinking, stupor and unconsciousness can occur. Extreme levels of consumption can lead to <b>alcohol</b> <b>poisoning</b> and death (a concentration in the blood stream of 0.40% will kill half of those affected). Alcohol may also cause death indirectly, by asphyxiation from vomit.|$|E

50|$|Later, a {{small amount}} of Croton oil was added to the neutral grain spirits which powered U.S. torpedoes. Drinking alcohol with the oil {{additive}} caused painful cramps, internal bleeding and a violent emptying of the bowels. It was intended as a replacement for methanol which had caused blindness in some sailors. To avoid the Croton oil, sailors devised crude stills to slowly separate the <b>alcohol</b> from the <b>poison,</b> as <b>alcohol</b> evaporated at a lower temperature than Croton oil. The stills were sometimes called 'Gilly' stills, and the resulting potable alcohol was known as 'gilly'.|$|R
40|$|This paper describes, for {{the first}} time, trends in alcohol-related deaths and deaths among people who were alcohol {{dependent}} in Ireland, as recorded by the National Drug-Related Deaths Index (NDRDI) for the years 2004 − 2008. The main findings of the analysis are: The NDRDI recorded 672 poisoning deaths in which alcohol was implicated in the five-year period. This total comprised almost equal numbers of alcohol-only poisonings and alcohol polysubstance (alcohol plus other substance/s) poisonings. The annual number fluctuated over the period, being highest in 2007 (170 deaths) and lowest in 2006 (111 deaths). Alcohol was the substance most frequently implicated in all fatal poisonings in Ireland in the five-year period. The majority of all poisoning deaths were male. The median age {{of those who died}} of alcohol-only poisoning was 48 years, while the median age of those who died of <b>alcohol</b> polysubstance <b>poisoning</b> was 41 years.

25|$|Ukraine {{currently}} faces {{a number}} of major public health issues and is considered to be in a demographic crisis because of its high death rate and low birth rate (the current Ukrainian birth rate is 11 births/1,000 population, and the death rate is 16.3 deaths/1,000 population). A factor contributing to the high death rate is a high mortality rate among working-age males from preventable causes such as <b>alcohol</b> <b>poisoning</b> and smoking. In 2008, the country's population was one of the fastest declining in the world at −5% growth. The UN warned that Ukraine's population could fall by as much as 10 million by 2050 if trends did not improve. In addition, obesity, systemic high blood pressure and the HIV endemic are all major challenges facing the Ukrainian healthcare system.|$|E
25|$|Adolescents who misuse alcohol {{can benefit}} from {{interventions}} aimed at risk reduction. For more severe cases an intervention involving parents, guardians, and/or a psychotherapist is recommended. An effective strategy of intervention for adolescents whose binge drinking leads to admission to hospital, e.g. for <b>alcohol</b> <b>poisoning</b> or injury, is manualised brief interventions at the hospital in one to four counseling sessions each lasting 30 to 60 minutes conducted by trained staff. Evaluation of personal pattern of drinking and associated risks and an emphasis on personal responsibility in a non-condescending manner is recommended during the intervention; discussing and informing/educating the adolescent of possible negative short and long-term consequences of drinking is recommended. The setting of goals and rules to achieve those goals is also recommended during intervention with problem binge drinking adolescents.|$|E
