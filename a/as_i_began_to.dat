500|$|.....<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> research, even I, {{as someone}} who had been paying {{attention}} {{to some of these}} sorts of things {{for a long time and}} was open to alternative explanations, even I was fairly astonished when I put it together, basically by going county by county and finding the criminal arrest records and the jail records in county after county after county from this period of time and seeing that if there had been crime waves, there had to have been records of crimes and people being arrested for crimes. And in reality, it's just not there."There's no evidence that that ever happened. In fact, it's the opposite. The crime waves that occurred by and large were the aftermath of the war and whites coming back from fighting in the Civil War and settling scores with people and all sorts of renegade activity that didn't involve black people at all, but they were blamed for it, and that was then used as a kind of ruse for why these incredibly brutal new legal measures then began to be put in place." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} in 1915 when I was {{deeply involved in}} cubist sculpture but was still in many ways not certain of what I was doing, I had {{a visit from the}} writer Jules Romains, and he asked me what I was trying to do. I answered, [...] "I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal." [...] And he answered in a slightly mocking way, [...] "What do you know about crystals?" [...] At first I was upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.|$|E
2500|$|My {{encounter}} with many Evangelical Christians who write about other religions has, to some extent, helped shape my life's work. However, {{over the years}} I have been mostly disappointed with the Christian writing in this area. Instead of attempting to understand the teachings of a group, too frequently writers only compared quotes from the group's literature with biblical passages, both often out of context. Then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> visit the groups, I often encountered the anger at the church many members had because of Christian writers who had written supposedly authoritative books but who had distorted members' positions and had condemned them for believing things they had never taught ... I have always thought the church deserved better, and many years ago I committed myself to providing it with the information it needed both to live at peace with its new neighbors and to carry on its missional life {{with a high level}} of integrity.|$|E
6000|$|He {{fastened}} the tow-rope to {{the rear}} axle of his car, {{to the front of}} hers. [...] "Now will you be ready to put on all your power <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> pull?" [...] he said casually, rather respectfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, miss, {{but it is}} not {{the season}} now, and only one of us waits on through the winter, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> find the water then too cold for my old limbs, I have given it up these last two winters, and come here and stop with Jane and her husband." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have since}} {{spent a couple}} of days betwixt Mount Sharon and this place, and betwixt reading, writing to thee this momentous history, forming plans for seeing the lovely Lilias, and--partly, I think, for the sake of contradiction--angling a little in spite of Joshua'a scruples--though I am rather liking the {{amusement}} better <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> have some success in it.|$|R
60|$|I {{glanced at}} the paper with open pleasure, but the other checked me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wherefore didst thou hasten {{away just}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> speak, Hilda?" [...] he said, {{somewhat}} reproachfully, {{as he sat}} down beside her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't talk!" [...] he cried, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>To</b> mutter some excuse. [...] "Who {{can have}} {{patience}} {{with a man}} That's got no more discretion than An idiotic goose? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Bignall," [...] he said, again {{wearing that}} grace of manner which became him so well, [...] "it is {{my duty to}} follow your motions in this interview. I will now return to my ship; and if, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> suspect we are in these seas on a similar errand, we can concert at our leisure a system of co-operation, which, {{properly}} matured by your experience, may serve {{to bring about the}} common end we have in view." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Completed, Mr. Fraser!" [...] said Angela, open-eyed. [...] "Do {{you mean}} to say that I am to stop now just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> learn?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because Mr. Stillwell was {{not acting}} rightly about my late father's estate, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> suspect him {{he wished to}} get me out of the way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think Lowell will trouble me much again," [...] I replied, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> dress. [...] "If he does I'll do what I can {{to defend}} myself." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought this}} {{better and better}} still, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> pull on my hose, recalling the man's impudent mendicancy at Prestongrange's, I {{determined}} to pursue {{what seemed to be}} my victory.|$|E
60|$|We sat him between us, {{not knowing}} how to give him welcome enough; and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> listen to his old {{familiar}} voice, I could have fancied he was still pursuing his long journey in search of his darling niece.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think nothin'," [...] said she. [...] "Just <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> {{look at them}} wrigglin' in the wind, and I am beginnin' {{to wonder}} what it is I think about them, I go slam bang to sleep, and when I wake up and try to think again what it is I think, off I go again. But I like it. If I don't {{know what it is}} I think, I ought to know that I don't know it. That's what I call bein' really and truly a hermick." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{answered}} him that <b>I</b> was, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> spoke <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> divest myself {{of the clothes}} I wore. [...] "Pack my suit of pearl grey in the valise, with what changes of linen I possess; then call Master Coupri that I may settle with him. It may be some time before we return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard the}} thing just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> undress," [...] Granet explained. [...] "I rushed downstairs and found Collins {{out in the}} garden. ... Where the devil is Collins, by-the-bye?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your town," [...] I said, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{make ready}} to depart (which {{is the time for}} smooth generalities), [...] "seems to be a quiet, sedate place. A home town, I should say, where few things out of the {{ordinary}} ever happen." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> regain {{strength}} and the doctors pronounced me fit to leave the sick-room, she began to display signs of uneasiness, and often looked at me in a singular kind of way, as though there were something which she would say to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I met him on {{the road}} with Lady Hester Perrault, and I told them. I walked back to Spinney Lawn with them. But," [...] <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> thank her, and her voice went lower still, [...] "but--oh, Ursula, Lady Hester knew it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I shall {{keep my eyes}} on all points," [...] said he, [...] "as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> feel {{a spirit}} of fight rising up within me. If I thought I could keep them off until Rynders gets here, I almost wish they would then come. I would like to kill a lot of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{cultivate}} an ear {{for music}} in that cat nohow," [...] said Captain Jim. [...] "He won't stay {{long enough to}} learn to like it. When we got the organ up at the Glen church old Elder Richards bounced up from his seat the minute the organist <b>began</b> <b>to</b> play and scuttled {{down the aisle and}} out of the church at the rate of no-man's-business. It reminded me so strong of the First Mate tearing loose <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> fiddle that <b>I</b> come nearer to laughing out loud in church than I ever did before or since." ...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Humanism and the Arts", Nott {{said that}} [...] "humanists {{of our time}} are {{not as strong as}} they should be on the meaning and value of art and the artist." [...] She also {{admitted}} that [...] "as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> write about Humanism or speak from a Humanist platform I find myself in full retreat towards square nought. If someone does not ask me what or who is a humanist - I find I am asking myself - or the audience." [...] Returning to the theme of Is Rationalism Sterile, Nott observes: ...|$|R
60|$|My {{book on the}} 'Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals' was {{published}} in the autumn of 1872. I had intended to give only a chapter on the subject in the 'Descent of Man,' but as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> put my notes together, I saw that it would require a separate treatise.|$|E
60|$|Thus Mr. Casaubon {{was in one}} of his busiest epochs, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> say {{a little}} while ago, Dorothea joined him early in the library where he had breakfasted alone. Celia at this time was on a second visit to Lowick, {{probably}} the last before her marriage, and was in the drawing-room expecting Sir James.|$|E
60|$|As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> read these, however, there grew on me {{some sense}} of a {{disturbing}} influence. Once or twice I looked {{to see if the}} Nurse had moved, for there was a feeling as though some one were near me. Nurse Kennedy sat in her place, as steady and alert as ever; and I came back to my book again.|$|E
6000|$|At last, just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> feel <b>as</b> though <b>I</b> {{were being}} mesmerised, a move was made. Without the {{slightest}} warning, {{a man from}} the other side of the circle called out in a loud voice-- ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stood there}} <b>as</b> though fascinated. <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> feel impatient, but I dared not show {{any signs of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tried hard}} {{all night to}} think of a way of making our {{interview}} of the next evening safe from discovery, and tried in vain. Even as early <b>as</b> this, <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> feel <b>as</b> if Midwinter's letter had, in some unaccountable manner, stupefied me.|$|R
60|$|He was {{concealed}} by {{this time}} behind another tree trunk; but {{he must have been}} watching me closely, for as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me. Then he hesitated, drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication.|$|E
60|$|With this to help me, I passed rapidly {{over what}} {{remained}} {{to me of}} my journey, and sometimes walking, sometimes running, impatiently drew near to the stockade. Yet, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> thread the grove that lies before it, I was not so thoughtless but that I slacked my pace and went a trifle warily. It {{would have been a}} poor end of my adventures to get shot down by my own party in mistake.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I dinna ken whether I dare trust Robin's fiddle to ye,' said Willie, bluntly. His wife {{gave him}} a twitch. 'Hout awa, Maggie,' he said in {{contempt}} of the hint; 'though the gentleman may hae gien ye siller, he may have nae bowhand for a' that, and I'll no trust Robin's fiddle wi' an ignoramus. But that's no sae muckle amiss,' he added, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> touch the instrument; 'I am thinking ye have some skill o' the craft.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, you,' said Honora, {{sitting up}} again, {{and looking up}} into his sincere, serene face; 'I cannot doubt that even this is well for you, but it is all selfishness--just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> feel what you are to me.' ...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} an {{experiment}} in mixing personal and professional trajectories and tells a few dislocated stories about my experience of moving from Sydney to Newcastle to teach creative writing. Sometimes I'm writing as a first home buyer, at other points as an early career academic, still thinking through areas {{that might lead to}} future research (ideally with a local focus). In particular, my involvement with Newcastle's This Is Not Art (TINA) festival has inspired me to explore ways to better integrate the extra-literary into tertiary creative writing pedagogy. These are preliminary thoughts, however, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> sift through my recent transitions, confronting in the process many complex ambivalences and possible new alliances...|$|R
60|$|BROADBENT [complacently]. She's rather full of it, {{as you may}} imagine. Poor Nora! Well, Mr Keegan, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said, <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> see my way here. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> see my way.|$|R
