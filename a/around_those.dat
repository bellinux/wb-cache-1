25|$|Most {{southern}} yellowjackets are parasitic, in {{that they}} benefit {{at the expense of}} another species, as seen in their nest formation, as they build their nests <b>around</b> <b>those</b> of another species. Only about 15% of the nests are independently founded. Evidence shows V. squamosa as a social parasite of V. vidua (ground hornet) and V. maculifrons (eastern yellowjacket. As this species depends on other species for part of its nest, the location of its nests is often contingent on the location of the host’s nests.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Egypt, {{especially}} during the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods, dwarfs and pygmies were seen as people with celestial gifts. They were treated with considerable respect and could enjoy high social positions. During the 1st Dynasty (c. 31502900 BC), dwarfs served and worked directly for the king and royal household, and a number have been found buried in subsidiary tombs <b>around</b> <b>those</b> of the kings. In fact, the rather high proportion of dwarfs in the royal cemeteries of the 1st Dynasty suggests some may have been brought into Egypt from elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The {{geometry}} of the Crystal Palace was {{a classic example of}} the concept of form following manufacturer's limitations- the shape and size of the whole building was directly based around the size of the panes of glass made by the supplier, Chance Brothers of Smethwick. These were the largest available at the time, measuring 10 inches wide by 49 inches long. Because the entire building was scaled <b>around</b> <b>those</b> dimensions, it meant that nearly the whole outer surface could be glazed using millions of identical panes, thereby drastically reducing both their production cost and the time needed to install them.|$|E

25|$|Indeed, the Roman {{historian}} Tacitus {{mentions that}} Agricola, while governor of Roman Britain (AD 78 - 84), considered conquering Ireland, believing {{it could be}} held with one legion plus auxiliaries and entertained an exiled Irish prince, thinking to use him as a pretext for a possible invasion of Ireland. This Roman author tells us that <b>around</b> <b>those</b> years Agricola had with him an Irish chieftain (may be Tuathal Techtmar) who later returned to conquer Ireland with an army. Excavations at sites linked to the tale of Tuathal have produced Roman material of the late 1st or early 2nd centuries. It would be consistent for Tuathal to have been that Irish chieftain.|$|E

25|$|Dwarfs {{were treated}} with {{considerable}} respect in Ancient Egyptian society, notably during the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods. Their natural nanism {{was seen as a}} celestial gift, and discrimination and social exclusion seem to have been unknown to the Egyptians. In most cases in which dwarfs were brought into a new family, they seem to have been accepted at once as full-fledged members. They were assigned special, exclusive duties, which were normally performed by the highest-ranked officials, such as priests and treasurers. Even in many royal households, next to the king, dwarfs were allowed to serve and work. The unusually high ranks and social positions that dwarfs enjoyed explain, for example, their important presence in subsidiary tombs <b>around</b> <b>those</b> of the 1st Dynasty pharaohs. These subsidiary tombs were reserved for the direct and most loyal servants of the ruler. To be allowed to be buried so close to the king shows how respected dwarfs were at that time.|$|E

25|$|The Vance-Owen {{plan was}} {{presented}} in January 1993. It was planned to create 10 cantons on {{the territory of the}} whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This plan increased conflict between Croats and Bosniaks. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) launched four offensives and conquered a large area which was under control of HVO; almost the whole Central Bosnia (except Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovača, Kiseljak, Kreševo and Žepče and the wider areas <b>around</b> <b>those</b> towns and Usora, part of Municipality of Travnik, Zavidovići and part of Municipality of Vareš) and part of Herzegovina, Konjic, Jablanica and eastern and northern parts of Mostar. A number of crimes against civilians were committed on both sides. Hostility between Croats and Bosniaks ended with mediation by the United States and the signing of the Washington Agreement on 18 March 1994. The cooperation between Croats and Bosniaks was renewed, and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a Bosniak and Croat controlled area was established. There was also a proposal to create a confederation of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republic of Croatia.|$|E

Protesters held portraits of former presidents Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat. However, protesters did not get to the presidential palace. In Alexandria, over a million protesters turned out, making it the biggest-ever protest there.

Kouno sought not only to make the game accessible to younger players, but also to a wider, international audience. While his team experimented with different control schemes for the game, they recognized that the simple tilting controls would be easily learned by {{children as well as}} those outside Japan. This approach also led to the use of a new [...] "language" [...] for the music, instead of relying on Japanese works which would not be understood by the international audience. However, despite the simple controls, Kouno noted they included deep gameplay <b>around</b> <b>those</b> that would require players to master to gain all the collectibles in the game.|$|E
500|$|In the 12th and 13th centuries Kačićs possessed {{lands in}} the Zadar hinterland, in the wider area of Tinj, Nadin, Kačina Gorica, Kokićani and Kamenjani.

500|$|As a young girl, James ran barrels on {{her horse}} Bardo. They competed at amateur rodeos {{for about two}} years when Bardo {{shattered}} a bone in his leg and had to be euthanized. James considered Bardo her best friend and found it difficult to replace him. Eventually, she set her sights on Gils Bay Boy, an American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) registered gelding her father purchased as a four-year-old for $1,100 to sort feedlot cattle. At first, James encountered behavior issues with the horse but with dedication and proper training she overcame those issues, and made him the horse she needed for barrel racing competition. He became notable as Scamper, a nickname that originated from her father's comment when watching them run barrels: [...] "He sure wants to scamper <b>around</b> <b>those</b> barrels." ...|$|E
