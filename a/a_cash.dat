40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to gain a better {{understanding}} of households with <b>a</b> negative <b>cash</b> flow. The Household Budget Survey conducted in 2000, 2005, and 2010 by the Bureau of Statistics in South Korea were used for this study. The households used in this study were divided into four groups according to their income levels; they were categorized the lowest, low, middle, and high income groups. This study made several findings regarding households with <b>a</b> negative/positive <b>cash</b> flow. Firstly, the demographic and economic characteristics were different between those who have <b>a</b> negative <b>cash</b> flow and those with <b>a</b> positive <b>cash</b> flow. <b>A</b> female household head, a household head age 65 and older, a household head with a lower educational attainment, an unemployed household head, and the presence of a child/children in schools were related with the household deficit. Secondly, the households with <b>a</b> positive <b>cash</b> flow had <b>a</b> higher income level compared to the households with <b>a</b> negative <b>cash</b> flow, while the households with <b>a</b> negative <b>cash</b> flow had <b>a</b> much higher consumption level compared to the households with <b>a</b> positive <b>cash</b> flow. Thirdly, the household deficit to total income ratio of the lowest income group was higher when compared to any other income group. Lastly, the multivariate statistics showed that households including a child/children in schools are more likely to be a household with <b>a</b> negative <b>cash</b> flow. Especially, the expenditures on education and transportation were related with the likelihood of a household deficit. ▲주제어(Key Words) : 적자가계(household with <b>a</b> negative <b>cash</b> flow), 가계지출(household expenditure), 가계소득(househol...|$|R

As only the winner would receive <b>a</b> <b>cash</b> prize, invited artists refused to participate and no entry from the public proved suitable. Leech instructed Barber to prepare new designs for the dime, quarter, and half dollar, and after the chief engraver made changes to secure Leech's endorsement, they were approved by President Benjamin Harrison in November 1891. Striking of the new coins began the following January.|$|E
5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{game where}} the player {{controls}} Conker the Squirrel {{through a series}} of three-dimensional levels.

These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always <b>a</b> <b>cash</b> reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.|$|E
