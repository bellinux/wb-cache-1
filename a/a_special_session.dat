5|$|Although {{calls for}} <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the {{legislature}} {{had been made in}} February and March, Governor Stanley was not initially receptive to the idea at the beginning of April. In mid-April, Virginia Lieutenant Governor Gi Stevens urged Stanley to call <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the General Assembly to reconsider the Gray Commission proposals. In May, at least one state delegate urged the General Assembly to call itself into special session.|$|E
5|$|Many voters {{decried the}} bill as a self-serving attempt by Goebel to {{increase}} his political power, and the election board remained a controversial issue until its abolition in <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the legislature in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp's uncle Jereboam {{assembled}} a legal team for his nephew that included former U.S. Senator John Pope.

5|$|Governor Evan Bayh called <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the General Assembly in 1992 {{because no}} budget {{had been passed}} in the regular session. During the special session, the General Assembly passed the budget and also legalized the {{operation}} of riverboat casinos in the state, overriding the governor's veto to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|In the 1944 {{legislative}} session, {{the rival}} parties fought to a stalemate over the budget. The primary issue was deciding who would control the state's sizable budget surplusthe legislature or the governor. In {{an effort to}} unify the two sides, Willis backed off his call for a repeal of the income tax; another legislator proposed the repeal anyway, but it was defeated. Two months {{after the end of}} the session, Willis called <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> to reconcile the educational items in the budget. Once in session, legislators approved a full budget. The vote to accept the budget was deemed invalid, however, because approving a full budget was not part of Willis's initial call for <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session.</b> In response, Willis called a second special session, and the Assembly passed a full budget on June 16, 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{has the authority}} to call on the General Assembly to convene <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> if legislators are unable to complete necessary work within time allotted by the regular sessions. Special sessions of the General Assembly were rarely called in the state's early history, but have become more commonplace in modern times.|$|E

5|$|This {{pay raise}} {{proposal}} was submitted as {{an amendment to}} the government's general appropriations bill. Had Grant vetoed the bill, the government would not have any money to operate for the following fiscal year, which would have necessitated <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of Congress. However, Grant missed an opportunity to make a statement by threatening a veto.|$|E
5|$|A June 1965 {{ruling by}} the Kentucky Court of Appeals that {{property}} must be assessed at its full value prompted calls for <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> from Kentucky taxpayers. Breathitt obliged, calling the session in July. He proposed a reduction in property tax rates to offset {{the increase in the}} assessed value of property, and also advocated small increased in other tax rates to benefit public schools. The plan passed despite opposition from Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> {{for the sole purpose of}} considering a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and passed a bill by the end of the special session.|$|E

5|$|Although the Texas Legislature {{typically}} meets {{once every}} two years, a fire destroyed the state capitol building in November 1881, and Ross was called to serve in <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> in April 1882. The session agreed {{to build a new}} capitol building. Near the end of the special session, the Senate passed a reapportionment bill, which reduced Ross's four-year term to only two years. He declined to run again.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Taft's presidency, {{protectionism}} {{through the use of}} tariffs was a fundamental position of the Republican Party. The Dingley Tariff had been enacted to protect American industry from foreign competition. The 1908 party platform had supported unspecified revisions to the Dingley Act, and Taft interpreted this to mean reductions. Taft called <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of Congress to convene on March 15, 1909 to deal with the tariff question.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the legislature. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to allegations that Michigan's militia fired upon Ohioans, Lucas called <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of Ohio's legislature on June 8, 1835 to pass several more controversial acts, including {{the establishment of}} Toledo as the county seat of Lucas County, {{the establishment of a}} Court of Common Pleas in the city, a law to prevent the forcible abduction of Ohio citizens from the area, and a budget of $300,000 to implement the legislation. Michigan's territorial legislature responded with a budget appropriation of $315,000.00 to fund its militia.|$|E
5|$|One of the governor's most {{important}} political powers {{is the ability}} to call <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the General Assembly. During a two-year period, the assembly can meet on its own for no more than 91 days, and this often prevents them from passing all the legislation they intend to. This can give the governor considerable influence in the body which will often compromise on issues with him or her in exchange for a special legislative session.|$|E
5|$|The state {{legislature}} {{is made up}} of two bodies, the Senate, which has 35 members, and the House of Representatives, with 70 members. South Dakota is divided into 35 legislative districts, with voters electing two representatives and one senator per district. The legislature meets for an annual session which begins on the second Tuesday in January and lasts for 30 days; it also meets if <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> is called by the governor.|$|E

5|$|A {{proposal}} {{was made to}} call <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> to repeal the law, and Bradley {{was in favor of}} the action, but a poll of the legislators showed that too many of them were noncommittal to justify the call. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats – W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the {{legislature}} in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so {{in such a way}} as to make the representation more proportional to population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.|$|E
5|$|At <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of {{government}} held on 30 August 1944 in Pavelić's villa, guarded by armed men, Lorković and Vokić {{were accused of}} conspiracy against the Poglavnik and Croatia's German ally. Vice President of the Government, Džafer Kulenović, and many others defended them but to no avail. Lorković was kept under house arrest until he was tried before the Poglavnik's Bodyguard Division (PTS) where {{it was decided that}} he would be stripped of his rank and expelled from the PTS. After the trial, he was transferred to Koprivnica and later in Lepoglava, alongside Vokić, Farolfi, Ljudevit Tomašić and others, although Košturić later escaped. Lorković was executed at the end of April 1945.|$|E
