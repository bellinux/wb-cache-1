5|$|About 298 {{million years}} ago Permian forests started to cover the continent, and there were tundras as late as 15 {{million years ago}}, but the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow {{extensive}} vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor soil quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The flora of the continent largely consists of bryophytes. There are about 100 species of mosses and 25 species of liverworts, but only three species of flowering plants, {{all of which are}} found in the Antarctic Peninsula: Deschampsia antarctica (Antarctic hair grass), Colobanthus quitensis (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native Poa annua (<b>annual</b> <b>bluegrass).</b> Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.|$|E

50|$|It is {{a common}} weed of cultivation, known in the Americas as <b>annual</b> <b>bluegrass.</b> It occurs as a common {{constituent}} of lawns, where it is also often treated as a weed, and grows on waste ground.

50|$|Biological {{control has}} a few options {{although}} studies are still being done to find an effective approach.

50|$|Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) and <b>annual</b> <b>bluegrasses</b> (Poa annua) are {{the makeup}} of most putting greens, {{as well as the}} {{preferred}} hosts of this pathogen. Specifically, Toronto (C-15), Seaside, and Nemisilla are the cultivars of creeping bentgrass most commonly affected. The bacteria enter the plant host and interfere with water and nutrient flow, causing the plant to look drought stressed and to take on a blueish-purple color. Additionally, symptoms of bacterial wilt of turf grass include yellow leaf spots, tan or brown spots, water soaked lesions, elongated yellow leaves and shriveling of aforementioned blue or dark green leaves.Since putting greens are not a pure stand of turf, some grass blades may be resistant to the bacterium and thus remain unharmed while the surrounding turf dies, rendering the putting surface inconsistent and unsightly, especially at high-end golf courses.|$|R
