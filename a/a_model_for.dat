5|$|Here {{we can see}} how {{important}} the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry as <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, {{the length of the}} cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.|$|E

5|$|In 1883, Rodin {{agreed to}} {{supervise}} {{a course for}} sculptor Alfred Boucher in his absence, where he met the 18-year-old Camille Claudel.

5|$|One {{of these}} aspects which fascinated Balzac was {{the life of}} crime. In the winter of 1828–29, a French grifter-turned-policeman named Eugène François Vidocq {{published}} a pair of sensationalized memoirs recounting his criminal exploits.

5|$|Dietrich Wildung {{proposed}} that the bust in Berlin was <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> official portraits and {{was used by the}} master sculptor for teaching his pupils how to carve the internal structure of the eye, and thus the left iris was not added. Gardner's Art Through the Ages and Silverman presents a similar view that the bust was deliberately kept unfinished. Hawass suggested that Thutmose had created the left eye, but it was later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Eveline was an {{inspiration}} for many of Balzac's characters. She {{can be seen as}} the model for La Fosseue, Mme Claes, Modesta Mignon, Ursule Mirouet, Adelina Houlot, and especially Eugenie Grandet and Mme de Mortsauf. There is less agreement among scholars on whether she was also the inspiration for more negative characters such as Fedora and lady Dudley, as Balzac seems to have used her mostly as <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> more positive personas. His works also mention numerous characters named Eve or Eveline, and have several dedications to her.|$|E
