5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E

25|$|Financial {{capital is}} mostly earned through remittances. Remittances are the {{transnational}} exchange of funds earned by migrants working abroad. In recent years, {{they have become}} an important global economic resource. In the 1990s, the estimated value of remittances doubled to over $105 billion each year. The United Nations estimates that the annual figure is around $232 billion, but the unofficial flow is unknown; {{it is possible that}} more than half of the remittances earned go unrecorded each year. Remittances vary in the channels used to transfer money, the amount transferred, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which the money is invested, saved, and consumed.

25|$|Post-Irradiation Examination (PIE) is {{the study}} of used nuclear {{materials}} such as nuclear fuel. It has several purposes.

One site where PIE is done is the ITU which is the EU centre for the study of highly radioactive materials.|$|E

25|$|Little {{physical}} evidence existed beyond eyewitness descriptions and forensic reports.

Furthermore, each victim had been found with an item of clothing tied around her neck, and each woman had been menstruating {{at the time of}} her death.

25|$|Having {{spent time}} amongst the artists of Paris in the 1920s, McKay was intimately {{acquainted with the}} {{dynamics}} between painters and models <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which modernist painters presented African subjects and African culture. In her article, “Caribbean Models for Modernism in the Work of Claude McKay and Jean Rhys,” Leah Rosenberg writes, “The fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and avant-garde primitivism”. The inclination to stereotype and caricatures the African physical form created, however inadvertently, a form of hegemony reminiscent to McKay of the colonialism {{he grew up with}} in Jamaica. “Sexuality and black culture,” Rosenberg explains, “held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from Picasso to Gertrude Stein”. In need of money, McKay posed nude for the Cubist painter Andre Lhote. Through his experience, McKay saw first-hand how the larger social hegemony between European white supremacy and people of Afro-Caribbean descent could play itself out between the artist and its subject. McKay critically recalled the experience in various ways in many of his most notable works. In doing so, he shined a critical light on a cornerstone of modernism and once again pushed back against a system in which he found himself.|$|E
25|$|Hirsi Ali {{admitted}} that she had lied about her full name, date of birth, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which {{she had come to}} the Netherlands, but persisted in saying she was trying to flee a forced marriage. She noted that her first book, The Son Factory (2002), provided her real name and date of birth. She had also stated these in a September 2002 interview published in the political magazine HP/De Tijd. and in an interview in the VARA gids (2002). Hirsi Ali asserted in her 2006 autobiography (2007 in English) that she made full disclosure of the matter to VVD officials when invited to run for parliament in 2002. It is not known on what grounds she received political asylum. On the issue of her name, she applied under her grandfather's surname in her asylum application, to which she was entitled; she later said it was to escape retaliation by her clan. In the later parliamentary investigation of Hirsi Ali's immigration, the Dutch law governing names was reviewed. An applicant may legally use a surname derived from any generation {{as far back as the}} grandparent. Therefore, Hirsi Ali's application, though against clan custom of names, was legal under Dutch law. The question of her age was of minor concern. Media speculation arose in 2006 that she could lose her Dutch citizenship because of these issues, rendering her ineligible for parliament. At first, Minister Rita Verdonk said she would not look into the matter. She later decided to investigate Hirsi Ali's naturalisation process. The investigation found that Hirsi Ali had not legitimately received Dutch citizenship, because she had lied about her name and date of birth. However, later inquiries established that she was entitled to use the name Ali because it was her grandfather's name. Rita Verdonk moved to annul Hirsi Ali's citizenship, an action later overridden at the urging of Parliament.|$|E
