25|$|We {{know little}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> language's {{emergence}} in our species. Unlike writing, speech leaves no material trace, making it archaeologically invisible. Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins {{have resorted to}} the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. While such studies may tell us whether pre-modern Homo species had speech capacities, we still don't know whether they actually spoke. While no one doubts that they communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve {{plays an important}} role in controlling movements of the tongue. In 1998, one research team used the size of the hypoglossal canal in the base of fossil skulls in an attempt to estimate the relative number of nerve fibres, claiming on this basis that Middle Pleistocene hominins and Neanderthals had more fine-tuned tongue control than either australopithecines or apes. Subsequently, however, it was demonstrated that hypoglossal canal size and nerve sizes are not correlated, and it is now accepted that such evidence is uninformative <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> human speech evolution.|$|E
25|$|Over four days, the Russian Navy used four {{different}} diving bells and submersibles {{to try to}} attach to the escape hatch without success.

On the fifth day, President Vladimir Putin authorised the navy to accept British and Norwegian offers of assistance.

After many years of notice, there was still skepticism that the deployment would ever occur.

The squadron's equipment deficiencies were valued at $16million, and there was a need to buy $700,000 of equipment immediately. The UN initially estimated the cost of the entire operation at $US1billion, equivalent to its own budget. The reluctance to commit funds ultimately reduced training of the deployed forces; Senator Jo Vallentine said in Parliament that the Namibia operation nearly fell apart {{due to a lack of}} advance funding, and Senator Jocelyn Newman called it disgraceful. The UN General Assembly did not approve the UNTAG budget until 1 March 1989, less than two weeks before the advance party deployed and after the deployment of the start-up team. Gration authorised Operation Picaresque on 3 March 1989. In addition to a lack of funds, there was little intelligence on Namibia; the region was [...] "generally unknown to the Australian public, the policy-makers and to the troops and civilians who deployed there".|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the decision, {{the justices}} {{discussed}} the trimester framework at great length.

[...] Roe supporters are quick to point out, however, that the memo only reflects Blackmun's uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the trimester framework, not the framework or the holding itself. In his opinion, Blackmun also clearly explained how he had reached the trimester framework – scrutinizing history, common law, the Hippocratic Oath, medical knowledge, and the positions of medical organizations.
