25|$|The western portal is {{decorated}} with special splendour. An important role in its decoration is played by the cantilevered stairs {{that lead to the}} upper level, with profiled butts to the steps. The doorways are framed with broad rectangular plaitbands, with ledges in the upper part, with columns, fillets and strips of various, mostly geometrical, fine and intricate patterns. Between the outer plathand and the arched framing of the openings there are representations of doves and sirens with women's crowned heads. Such reliefs were widely used in fourteenth-century Armenian art and in earlier times in architecture, miniatures and works of applied art, on various vessels and bowls. The entrance tympanums are decorated with bas-reliefs showing, on the lower tympanium, the Holy Virgin with the Child and Archangels Gabriel and Michael <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides,</b> and, on the upper tympanium, a half-length representation of Christ and figures of the Apostles Peter and Paul. As distinct from the reliefs of Noravank's vestry, these ones are carved on a plain surface, which gives them greater independence. The figures are distinguished by their plasticity of form, softness of modeling, and accentuation of certain details of clothing.|$|E

60|$|To {{hand-rail}} and stanchion we clung, {{and finally}} {{as we saw}} the end approaching, snapped the buckles of our harness to the rings <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides.</b> In another moment the deck reared at an angle of ninety degrees and we hung in our leather with feet dangling a thousand yards above the ground.|$|E

60|$|With every roll of {{the ship}} the long rows of sitting Celestials would sway forward brokenly, and her headlong dives knocked {{together}} the line of shaven polls from end to end. When the wash of water rolling on the deck died away for a moment, it seemed to Jukes, yet quivering from his exertions, that in his mad struggle down there he had overcome the wind somehow: that a silence had fallen upon the ship, a silence in which the sea struck thunderously <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{would have}} sold his soul to root her, in her beauty, to the floor, {{and make her}} arms drop <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides,</b> and have her at his mercy. But he could not look at her, and not be afraid of her. He saw a {{strength}} within her that was resistless. He {{saw that she was}} desperate, and that her unquenchable hatred of him would stop at nothing. His eyes followed the hand that was put with such rugged uncongenial purpose into her white bosom, and he thought that if it struck at hIm, and failed, it would strike there, just as soon.|$|E
60|$|Jean, in his eager, hungry devouring of {{the beloved}} face, did {{not on the}} first instant grasp the {{significance}} of its expression. He was seeing the features that had haunted him. But quickly he interpreted her expression as the somber, hunted look {{of a woman who}} would bear no more. Under the torn blouse her full breast heaved. She held her hands clenched <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides.</b> She was' listening, waiting for that jangling, slow step. It came, and with the sound she subtly changed. She was a woman hiding her true feelings. She relaxed, and that strong, dark look of fury seemed to fade back into her eyes.|$|E

60|$|Then, suddenly, {{the music}} stopped. The lights flared {{out from the}} ceiling and {{from every corner of}} the apartment. Slender and erect, her arms hanging limply <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides,</b> without a touch of color in her cheeks or a coil of her black hair disarranged, without a sign of heat or {{disturbance}} or passion in her face, John found Aida Calavera standing within a few feet of him, her eyes seeking for his. She laid her fingers upon his arm. The room was ringing with shouts of applause, in which John unconsciously joined. Every one was trying to press forward toward her. With her left hand she waved them back.|$|E
60|$|It {{was rough}} but hearty dancing. Each dancer {{composed}} his own {{steps on the}} spur of the moment, but executed them with a degree of precision and violence that would have caused civilised dancing masters to blush with shame and envy. Mrs Gore and Nelly danced too, weeping the while with joy, and so did the White Swan, but her performances were peculiar. She danced with a slowness of manner and a rigidity of person that are utterly indescribable. She looked as if all her joints had become inflexible, except those of her knees, and her arms hung straight down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides,</b> while she pendulated about the floor and gazed at the rafters in deep solemnity.|$|E
60|$|One day, {{while sitting}} on a tomb, I saw a woman coming from the village with a heavy basket on her head, and on coming to the gate she turned in, and setting the basket down walked to a spot about thirty yards from where I sat, and at that spot she {{remained}} for several minutes standing motionless, her eyes cast down, her arms hanging <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides.</b> A cottage woman in a faded cotton gown, of a common Hampshire type, flat-chested, a rather long oval face, almost colourless, and black dusty hair. She looked thirty-five, but was probably less than thirty, as women of their class age early in this county and get the toil-worn, tired face when still young.|$|E

60|$|As {{she drew}} nearer to his rooms she walked slower, forcing herself {{to think what}} she should do, what she should let him do! But she {{continued}} resolutely forward. She would not shrink now--whatever came of it! Her heart fluttered, seemed to stop beating, fluttered again. She set her teeth; a sort of desperate hilarity rose in her. It was an adventure! Then she was gripped by the feeling {{that had come to}} her on the roof. The whole thing was bizarre, ridiculous! She stopped, and drew the letter from her glove. It might be ridiculous, but it was due from her; and closing her lips very tight, she walked on. In thought she was already standing close to him, her eyes shut, waiting, with her heart beating wildly, to know what she would feel when his lips had spoken, perhaps touched her face or hand. And she had a sort of mirage vision of herself, with eyelashes resting on her cheeks, lips a little parted, arms helpless <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides.</b> Yet, incomprehensibly, his figure was invisible. She discovered then that she was standing before his door.|$|E
6000|$|He caught {{hold of her}} hands, but she shrank back, till her passionate {{little face}} and loose dark hair were caught among the pink {{clusters}} of the apple blossom. Ashurst raised one of her imprisoned hands and put his lips to it. He felt how chivalrous he was, and superior to that clod Joe--just brushing that small, rough hand with his mouth I Her shrinking ceased suddenly; she seemed to tremble towards him. A sweet warmth overtook Ashurst from top to toe. This slim maiden, so simple and fine and pretty, was pleased, then, {{at the touch of}} his lips! And, yielding to a swift impulse, he put his arms round her, pressed her to him, and kissed her forehead. Then he was frightened--she went so pale, closing her eyes, so that the long, dark lashes lay on her pale cheeks; her hands, too, lay inert <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides.</b> The touch of her breast sent a shiver through him. [...] "Megan!" [...] he sighed out, and let her go. In the utter silence a blackbird shouted. Then the girl seized his hand, put it to her cheek, her heart, her lips, kissed it passionately, and fled away among the mossy trunks of the apple trees, till they hid her from him.|$|E
6000|$|Peter Sherringham {{had said}} nothing; he was {{watching}} Miriam and her attitude. She wore a black dress which fell in straight folds; her face, under her level brows, was pale and regular--it had a strange, strong, tragic beauty. [...] "I don't know what's in her," [...] he said to himself; [...] "nothing, it would seem, from her persistent vacancy. But such a face as that, such a head, is a fortune!" [...] Madame Carré brought her to book, giving her {{the first line of}} the speech of Clorinde: [...] "Vous ne me fuyez pas, mon enfant, aujourd'hui." [...] But still the girl hesitated, and for an instant appeared to make a vain, convulsive effort. In this convulsion she frowned portentously; her low forehead overhung her eyes; the eyes themselves, in shadow, stared, splendid and cold, and her hands clinched themselves <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides.</b> She looked austere and terrible and was during this moment an incarnation the vividness of which drew from Sherringham a stifled cry. [...] "Elle est bien belle--ah ça," [...] murmured the old actress; and in the pause which still preceded the issue of sound from the girl's lips Peter turned to his kinsman and said in a low tone: [...] "You must paint her just like that." ...|$|E

6000|$|That {{young man}} thought it {{in effect a}} speech {{denoting}} an intelligence of the question, yet he rather resented the idea that Gabriel should assume it would strike him as a revelation; and to show his familiarity with the line of thought it indicated, {{as well as to}} play his part appreciatively in the little circle, he observed to Mrs. Rooth, as if they might take many things for granted: [...] "In other words, your daughter must find her safeguard in the artistic conscience." [...] But he had no sooner spoken than he was struck with the oddity of their discussing so publicly, and under the poor girl's handsome nose, the conditions which Miss Rooth might find the best for the preservation of her personal integrity. However, the anomaly was light and unoppressive--the echoes of a public discussion of delicate questions seemed to linger so familiarly in the egotistical little room. Moreover, the heroine of the occasion evidently was losing her embarrassment; she was the priestess on the tripod, awaiting the afflatus and thinking only of that. Her bared head, of which she had changed the position, holding it erect, while her arms hung <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides,</b> was admirable; her eyes gazed straight out of the window and at the houses {{on the opposite side of}} the Rue de Constantinople.|$|E
60|$|The {{day after}} her death we {{children}} were taken to see our beloved Margarita for the last time; but {{when we arrived at}} the door, and the others following my mother went in, I alone hung back. They came out and tried to persuade me to enter, even to pull me in, and described her appearance to excite my curiosity. She was lying all in white, with her black hair combed out and loose, on her white bed, with our flowers on her breast and <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides,</b> and looked very, very beautiful. It was all in vain. To look on Margarita dead was more than I could bear. I was told that only her body of clay was dead--the beautiful body we had come to say good bye to; that her soul--she herself, our loved Margarita--was alive and happy, far, far happier than any person could ever be on this earth; that when her end was near she had smiled very sweetly, and assured them that all fear of death had left her--that God was taking her to Himself. Even this was not enough to make me face the awful sight of Margarita dead; the very thought of it was an intolerable weight on my heart; but it was not grief that gave me this sensation, much as I grieved; it was solely my fear of death.|$|E
6000|$|Pickering rose, and we strolled {{away into}} the forest, talking of lighter things. At last we reached {{the edge of the}} wood, sat down on a fallen log, and looked out across an {{interval}} of meadow at the long wooded waves of the Taunus. What my friend was thinking of I can't say; I was meditating on his queer biography, and letting my wonderment wander away to Smyrna. Suddenly I remembered that he possessed a portrait of the young girl who was waiting for him there in a white-walled garden. I asked him if he had it with him. He said nothing, but gravely took out his pocket-book and drew forth a small photograph. It represented, as the poet says, a simple maiden in her flower--a slight young girl, with a certain childish roundness of contour. There was no ease in her posture; she was standing, stiffly and shyly, for her likeness; she wore a short- waisted white dress; her arms hung <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sides</b> and her hands were clasped in front; her head was bent downward a little, and her dark eyes fixed. But her awkwardness was as pretty as that of some angular seraph in a mediaeval carving, and in her timid gaze there seemed to lurk the questioning gleam of childhood. [...] "What is this for?" [...] her charming eyes appeared to ask; [...] "why have I been dressed up for this ceremony in a white frock and amber beads?" ...|$|E
60|$|The door opened, and {{the wife}} appeared, one child in her arms, the other <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
60|$|Bob {{looked and}} looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>side</b> face till he was bewitched into putting down his brush.|$|R
