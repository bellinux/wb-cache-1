5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{with minimal}} convection moved {{off the coast}} of Africa near Dakar between <b>August</b> 14 and <b>August</b> 15. It moved westward, and gradually developed thunderstorms across the wave axis. On <b>August</b> 21, while located about 450miles (725km) east of the Lesser Antilles, convection increased further within the system, though unfavorable upper-level wind shear prevented rapid development. It continued to become better organized, and though a Reconnaissance flight into the system reported strong winds, it lacked a surface circulation. Late on <b>August</b> 21 the wave passed through the northern Lesser Antilles, and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear the system became much better organized on <b>August</b> 22. A surface circulation formed, and the system developed into Tropical Storm Dean on <b>August</b> 22 near Saint Croix. Dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to the presence of 50mph (80km/h) winds in the storm.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on <b>August</b> 14, moved westward as a disorganized system, and passed through the Cape Verde islands on <b>August</b> 15. On <b>August</b> 17, a weak {{area of low pressure}} developed in the system about 750miles (1,200km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. Convection increased over the western portion of the wave axis, and the system began to become better organized on <b>August</b> 18 while located about 1,250miles (2,000km) east of the Lesser Antilles. However, convection around the system diminished on <b>August</b> 19, and later that day it began to move through the Lesser Antilles. Despite favorable upper-level winds and falling atmospheric pressures, there were initially no signs of a circulation at the surface. Convection again increased early on <b>August</b> 20, and it gradually became better organized. Based on a ship's wind report of the system, it is estimated the wave developed into Tropical Depression Nine on <b>August</b> 21 while located about 260miles (415km) south of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed on <b>August</b> 11 and gradually organized. The next day, an atmospheric circulation developed. Based on this, this system {{was classified as}} Tropical Depression Nine on <b>August</b> 13. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was named Hilary. The system gradually accelerated to the northwest and reached its peak strength on <b>August</b> 15 with winds of 60mph (95km/h). Tropical Storm Hilary then started a gradual weakening trend. It became a depression on <b>August</b> 16, turned {{a little bit more}} westward, and dissipated on <b>August</b> 17. Hilary never came near land, and as such caused no death or damage.|$|E

50|$|<b>Augusts</b> Strautmanis {{started to}} play chess at an early {{childhood}} {{under the guidance of}} his father. Already in 1926 at the Latvian Second Chess Congress, the new chess player won a high fourth place (after Fricis Apšenieks, Teodors Bergs and Vladimirs Petrovs) and was included in the first independent Latvian team which participated at the 2nd Chess Olympiad in The Hague in 1928. <b>Augusts</b> Strautmanis played at second board and got 7.5 points out of 16 possible (+6 -7 =3). In 1938/39 in the Latvian First Speed Chess Championship, where 1319 participants took part at various stages, <b>Augusts</b> Strautmanis becomes the winner. During the years of Second World War he won the Riga Championship of 1943, shared the 3rd-6th place at the Latvian Chess Championship of the same year. Also, in the post-war years, <b>Augusts</b> Strautmanis continued to successfully participate in the Latvian Chess Championships - after the second place in 1946 (Alexander Koblencs won it) he became the Latvian Champion of 1948 (after winning the additional fight with Igor Zhdanov). At the USSR team championship semi-final of 1948 in Riga, <b>Augusts</b> Strautmanis represented the Latvian team. In 1949, at the Latvian championship he still shared the 3rd-4th place, but the last time <b>Augusts</b> Strautmanis played at the Latvian championship finals of 1951. In later years, <b>Augusts</b> Strautmanis did not take active part in important tournaments, but after opening of the Sports School at Talsi District in 1954, he became a trainer of the chess section.|$|R
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} a tropical depression over the central Caribbean Sea around 12:00 UTC on <b>August</b> 23. Trekking west-northwestward, the system strengthened into a tropical storm about 24 hours later. It gradually intensified, and reach hurricane status south of Jamaica on <b>August</b> 25. The hurricane then curved northwest and intensified into a Category 2 hurricane on <b>August</b> 27. Early the following day, the cyclone made landfall near Cancún, Quintana Roo, with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). The storm weakened to a Category 1 during its brief transit across the Yucatán Peninsula, before re-intensifying into a Category 2 hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico late on <b>August</b> 28. The hurricane quickly strengthened, and attained its peak intensity on <b>August</b> 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). However, nearing the Texas Gulf Coast, the storm waned in intensity, and was only a Category 1 hurricane {{by the time it}} made a final landfall near Matagorda, Texas, on <b>August</b> 30. Continuing inland, the hurricane weakened, and degenerated into a remnant low over New Mexico on <b>August</b> 31.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on <b>August</b> 9. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and reached the Lesser Antilles on <b>August</b> 15. While passing through the islands, convection greatly increased, causing wind gusts of up to , though it remained disorganized. On <b>August</b> 22, convection organized while the system was over the western Bahamas, and it developed into Tropical Depression Eleven later that day. Conditions were only marginally favorable due to lack of outflow to its west, but the depression strengthened to reach tropical storm status on <b>August</b> 23.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave spawned Tropical Storm Dean on <b>August</b> 22 {{over the}} Lesser Antilles. Strong wind shear quickly weakened Dean to {{cause it to}} dissipate on <b>August</b> 23. The remnants turned northward, and redeveloped on <b>August</b> 26 {{to the north of}} Bermuda. Located over warm waters and in an area of favorable conditions, Dean steadily strengthened while moving to the northeast, and peaked just below hurricane status on <b>August</b> 27 southwest of Newfoundland. The storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters, and became extratropical on <b>August</b> 28. Tropical Storm Dean lightly affected Newfoundland, though no damages were reported.|$|E

5|$|A {{vigorous}} upper-level low developed west of Alberto on <b>August</b> 7 and <b>August</b> 8. This {{caused an}} increase in vertical shear, weakening the hurricane down to a tropical storm on <b>August</b> 9. The low also caused the storm {{to turn to the}} northwest. However, on <b>August</b> 10, Alberto became better organised and was upgraded to hurricane status again. It then moved in a gradual curve towards the north and northeast through a break in a subtropical ridge between <b>August</b> 11 and <b>August</b> 12. Alberto made its closest approach to Bermuda on <b>August</b> 11, passing about 345mi (555km) east of the island. The strong storm became a Category3 major hurricane on <b>August</b> 12 and reached its second and highest peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), and a 60mi (95km) wide eye was observed. Alberto was an unusual storm in that it reached its peak intensity at a high latitude, north of 35˚N, after it had re-curved. The hurricane began to weaken due to increasing upper-level westerlies on <b>August</b> 13 and <b>August</b> 14, while moving east-northeastward. Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm on <b>August</b> 14.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on <b>August</b> 7. It tracked across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development due to strong wind shear. The wave then split into two, with the northern portion dissipating over Cuba on <b>August</b> 15 and the southern portion continuing westward. The wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on <b>August</b> 16. Deep convection increased over the wave upon entering the Pacific, and early on <b>August</b> 19 it started to become better organized. After the development of a low-level circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on <b>August</b> 20 while located about 275miles (445km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E

5|$|After {{a rather}} lengthy lull punctuated by only Tropical Depression Seven-E, a {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Eight-E on <b>August</b> 21. Initially taking a westward track, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Fausto on <b>August</b> 22. It {{turned to the}} west-northwest and stayed on that path {{for the next six}} days. Fausto steadily strengthened and intensified into a hurricane on <b>August</b> 22. It continued to intensify, peaking as a Category4 on <b>August</b> 24, and also substantially increased in size. The hurricane began to weaken thereafter, and was a minimal tropical storm by the time it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on <b>August</b> 27. The tropical cyclone dropped to a depression and degenerated into a non-convective swirl of clouds on <b>August</b> 28.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened {{due to the}} establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on <b>August</b> 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on <b>August</b> 24 and <b>August</b> 25 to peak as a 145mph (230km/h) Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed for a motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250mi (400km) north of the Lesser Antilles on <b>August</b> 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category4 intensity, though weakened late on <b>August</b> 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{acquired a}} closed circulation and became Tropical Depression One-C on <b>August</b> 22. It stayed disorganized {{for the next}} several days.

5|$|As {{early as}} <b>August</b> 10, {{computer}} models anticipated the hurricane to accelerate {{to the northeast}} and become extratropical within three days, but this did not materialize. A westerly trough that had been influencing Alberto’s motion outran the storm, and a strong ridge developed {{to the north and}} west, causing the storm to turn abruptly to the south on <b>August</b> 15, and to complete a large loop over the open Atlantic. Alberto turned to the southwest on <b>August</b> 16 and to the west on <b>August</b> 17. The storm then took a sharp turn toward the northwest as a large, slow-moving mid-level trough was carving out over the eastern United States. Alberto began to strengthen, and reached hurricane status for the third time on <b>August</b> 18. The hurricane continued to turn to the north on <b>August</b> 19 and to the northeast on <b>August</b> 20 and <b>August</b> 21. During this time, Alberto reached a third peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h) on <b>August</b> 20, and a 70mi (110km) wide eye was observed.
