5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla</b> {{is driven}} by the {{sympathetic}} nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla</b> can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion. Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla</b> lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla</b> {{is derived}} from neural crest cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla</b> and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla</b> are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.|$|E
5|$|Pheochromocytomas are {{tumors of the}} <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla</b> {{that arise}} from chromaffin cells.

40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} the molecular {{mechanisms by which}} catecholamine synthesis is controlled in pheochromocytomas – tumors that synthesize and release catecholamines, which are related to various clinical manifestations of the condition. Methods: We measured the concentrations of mRNA coding for the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), dopamine b-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase (PNMT) and for the catecholamine contents in 12 pheochromocytomas and 12 normal <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullas.</b> Results: The mean content of total catecholamine and the b-actin mRNA expression in the pheochromocytomas were almost {{the same as those}} in the normal <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullas.</b> However, the tyrosine hydroxylase, AADC and DBH mRNA concentrations in the pheochromocytomas were greater than those of the normal <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullas.</b> Conversely, the PNMT mRNA concentration in the pheochromocytomas was lower than that in the normal <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullas.</b> These differences are responsible for the difference in the proportions of catecholamines between pheochromocytomas and normal <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullas.</b> The constitutive expression of the catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme mRNAs varied in magnitude among the pheochromocytomas, and the tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expressions correlated with the contents of total catecholamine in the tumors (r= 0. 964, P< 0. 0001). Conclusions: These findings indicate that catecholamine production in pheochromocytomas is pri-marily controlled by the level of gene expression. European Journal of Endocrinology 138 383 – 38...|$|R
40|$|Daily urinary {{excretion}} of catechol amines {{in normal}} rats and in rats {{from which the}} <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> had been removed has been determined by a photofluorimetric method. In both groups, reserpine (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) produces: (1) A decrease in the urinary excretion of noradrenaline which persists for more than 3 weeks; this action is not influenced by monoamine oxidase inhibitors and mecamylamine. (2) An increase, within 20 to 68 hr, in the urinary excretion of adrenaline, even though the urine of rats without <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> does not usually contain adrenaline. These effects are prevented by monoamine oxidase inhibitors and, in the normal animals, are reduced by mecamylamine. In both groups, dexamphetamine (6 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) produces {{an increase in the}} excretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline, the adrenaline appearing in the urine of the rats without <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> within 20 to 44 hr. Mecamylamine prevents the effect of dexamphetamine on the excretion of noradrenaline. Dexamphetamine, administered within a week of reserpine treatment, produces its usual effects on the urinary excretion of catechol amines in normal rats, but has no effect in rats without <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae.</b> The results are discussed with regard to both the mechanism by which reserpine and dexamphetamine influence the peripheral stores of adrenaline and noradrenaline, and the significance of the adrenal and extra-adrenal chromaffin system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Adrenal</b> <b>medullas</b> of 2 baboons perfused with formaldehyde/glutaraldehyde and {{tannic acid}} were studied by light and {{electron}} microscopy. Tissues were postfixed in OsO 4. This procedure allows identification of noradrenaline cells {{on the basis}} of a selective reaction of glutaraldehyde with noradrenaline vesicles. As positive control for noradrenaline cells, similarly treated mouse <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullas</b> were also examined. Light microscopic examination of thick sections of baboon medullas did not show noradrenaline cells. In contrast, mouse <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullas</b> showed noradrenaline cells scattered in small groups among the much lighter adrenaline cells. By electron microscopy no noradrenaline cells were seen in the baboon <b>medulla</b> while mouse <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullas</b> showed noradrenaline cells with vesicles possessing exceedingly dense cores and light spaces within their limiting membranes. Otherwise, the majority of the baboon chromaffin cells showed chromaffin vesicles which were round or elongated, 150 - 520 nm in diameter, and heterogenous in electron density. Cytoplasmic densities were occasionally seen attached to the inner aspect of the plasmalemma, particularly along areas close to blood capillaries. These densities could be chromaffin vesicles in the process of exocytosis. This is the first report of exocytotic profiles in a primate medulla. Occasional small vesicle-containing cells also were present. The vast majority of their vesicles were electron dense. Several possible alternatives for the varied catecholamine vesicular osmiophilia, were discussed. It was suggested that this could be attributed to varied concentration of noradrenaline and adrenaline neurohormones among the vesicle population...|$|R
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla</b> is at {{the centre}} of each adrenal gland, and is {{surrounded}} by the adrenal cortex.

5|$|The central adrenomedullary vein, in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla,</b> is {{an unusual}} type of blood vessel.

5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla,</b> which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system.

The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E
40|$|Many humans with IDDM {{eventually}} {{lose the}} capacity to secrete epinephrine from their <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae.</b> The mechanism for this pathological change is unknown. We hypothesized that this abnormality is attributable to neuropathic changes in the greater splanchnic nerves or in the chromaffin cells that they innervate. To study this hypothesis, we isolated rat adrenal glands, perfused them ex vivo, and measured the epinephrine content of the perfusate under various conditions of stimulation. We used transmural electrical stimulation (20 - 80 V, at 10 Hz) to induce epinephrine secretion indirectly by selectively activating residual splanchnic nerve terminals within the isolated glands. Under these conditions, epinephrine secretion was severely attenuated in glands from female BB-Wistar rats with diabetes of 4 mo duration compared with their age-matched, nondiabetic controls. These perfused diabetic <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> also demonstrated decreased catecholamine release in response to direct chromaffin cell depolarization with 20 mM K+, evidence that a functional alteration exists within the chromaffin cells themselves. Nonetheless, total catecholamine content of <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> from these diabetic rats was {{not significantly different from}} controls, indicating that the secretory defect was not simply attributable to a difference in the amount of catecholamines stored and available for release. Herein, we also provide histological evidence of degenerative changes within the cholinergic nerve terminals that innervate these glands...|$|R

40|$|Stimulation of nociceptors by {{intradermal}} capsaicin produces {{depression of}} bradykinin (BK) -induced synovial plasma extravasation (PE) that is markedly enhanced by subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. This depression is {{mediated by the}} <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae,</b> a propriospinal pathway between the afferent nociceptive input and preganglionic neurones projecting to the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae,</b> and a spino-bulbo-spinal pathway. Here we investigated the role of spinal ascending and descending pathways in the interaction between noxious and vagal afferent inputs, leading to inhibition of BK-induced PE mediated by the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae.</b> Nociceptors in the paw were activated by capsaicin and depression of BK-induced PE was measured in rats with intact or cut subdiaphragmatic vagus nerves. After cutting the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) contralateral to the stimulated hindpaw (segmental level C 5 /C 6 and T 8 /T 9), depression of BK-induced PE was weak or absent both in rats with intact vagus nerves and in vagotomised rats, suggesting that an ascending excitatory pathway was interrupted. After cutting the DLF ipsilateral to the stimulated hindpaw, depression of BK-induced PE was already markedly enhanced, {{even in the absence}} of vagotomy. Ipsilateral DLF lesion (L 2 /L 3) below the level of the spinal output to the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> produced the same effect, suggesting interruption of a descending inhibitory pathway that relays the effect of vagal activity to the level of the capsaicin-induced nociceptive input. Contralateral and ipsilateral hemisection of the spinal cord (C 5 /C 6) produced the same changes as the corresponding DLF lesions. Ipsi- or contralateral lesion of the dorsal funiculus at the spinal level T 8 /T 9 had no effect on depression of BK-induced PE generated by cutaneous noxious stimulation of the forepaw. We suggest that noxious stimulation activates an ascending pathway of the spino-bulbo-spinal excitatory circuit which projects through the DLF contralateral to the nociceptive input, and that the inhibitory pathway which is activated by vagal afferent activity projects through the DLF ipsilateral to the nociceptive input...|$|R
5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla,</b> which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E

40|$|Recently we {{have found}} that {{inhibition}} of bradykinin-induced synovial plasma extravasation by transcutaneous electrical stimulation at strengths which excite unmyelinated afferent axons is mediated by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Here we tested whether stimulation of nociceptors in the rat paw by intradermally injected capsaicin inhibits bradykinin-induced synovial plasma extravasation and whether this inhibition is mediated by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal or sympatho-adrenal axis. Furthermore, we tested whether inhibition of bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation generated by intraperitoneally injected capsaicin, which preferentially excites visceral afferents, is mediated by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal or sympatho-adrenal axis. We used normal rats, subdiaphragmatically vagotomized rats, rats with denervated <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> and rats with acutely transected spinal cords at the segmental levels T 1 /T 2 or T 12 /L 1. Injection of capsaicin into the plantar or palmar surface of the paws produced a depression of bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation. The inhibition elicited from the forepaw was larger than that from the hindpaw. The inhibition of bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation elicited from both paws was potentiated by subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. Denervation of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> abolished the inhibitory effect of intradermal capsaicin in vagus-intact and in vagotomized animals. After spinalization at the segmental level T 1 /T 2, capsaicin injected into the forepaw did not depress bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation either in vagus-intact or in vagotomized animals. Capsaicin injected into the hindpaw in these spinalized animals produced a small depression. After spinalization at the segmental level T 12 /L 1 no depression was produced by capsaicin injected into the hindpaw. Depression of bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation generated by intraperitoneal injection of capsaicin in vagus-intact and in vagotomized animals was also abolished or attenuated after denervation of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae.</b> This shows that this depression was also largely dependent on the activation of the sympatho-adrenal system. We conclude that depression of bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation during stimulation of nociceptors by capsaicin is mediated predominantly by the sympathoadrenal pathway. This finding differs from the inhibitory mechanism of depression of bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation generated by cutaneous electrical stimulation, which is mediated by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis...|$|R
25|$|The catecholamines, {{epinephrine}} and norepinephrine, secreted by the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla</b> {{form one}} component of the extended fight-or-flight mechanism. The other component is sympathetic stimulation. Epinephrine and norepinephrine have similar effects: binding to the beta-1 adrenergic receptors, and opening sodium and calcium ion chemical- or ligand-gated channels. The rate of depolarization is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period of repolarization is shortened. However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{chemical}} terms, epinephrine {{is one of}} a {{group of}} monoamines called the catecholamines. It is produced in some neurons of the central nervous system, and in the chromaffin cells of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medulla</b> from the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine.|$|E

40|$|Amplification of {{endogenous}} cholinergic activity—produced by the {{intravenous injection}} of edrophonium, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor {{which does not}} enter the central nervous system, into normal subjects—resulted in significant and briefly sustained increments in the plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (153 ± 15 − 234 ± 29 pg/ml, P < 0. 01) and epinephrine (16 ± 3 − 34 ± 5 pg/ml, P < 0. 01) measured with a single-isotope derivative method. These increments were not attributable to reflex responses to hemodynamic changes and similar increments in plasma norepinephrine occurred in adrenalectomized (epinephrine deficient) patients. Thus, cholinergic activation results in direct stimulation of sympathetic postganglionic neurons, with augmented norepinephrine release, and of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae,</b> with augmented epinephrine release, in man. Four diabetic patients with hypoadrenergic postural hypotension exhibited blunted sympathetic postganglionic neural responses, and normal adrenomedullary responses, to cholinergic stimulation (and to standing) indicative {{of the presence of}} a sympathetic postganglionic axonal lesion in diabetic adrenergic neuropathy. Nondiabetic patients with hypoadrenergic postural hypotension due to documented or probable central nervous system lesions exhibited normal responses to cholinergic stimulation produced in this fashion demonstrating the presence of intact sympathetic postganglionic neurons and <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> in these patients and providing further support for the conceptual soundness of this approach to the study of human adrenergic physiology and pathophysiology...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of neuropeptide gene expression {{has been investigated}} by using rat <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> grown in explant culture. After 3 days in culture the (now denervated) explants exhibited a 10 -fold increase in leucine-enkephalin (leu-EK) content. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide completely blocked the rise, whereas inhibition of RNA synthesis with actinomycin D or alpha-amanitin inhibited the increase by 50 %. Inhibition of DNA synthesis with 1 -beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (cytosine arabinoside) had no discernible effect. To determine whether the rise in leu-EK was associated {{with an increase in}} specific mRNA coding for the opiate peptide precursor, blot hybridization analysis was performed. A single species of preproenkephalin mRNA was detected after various culture periods. The amount of mRNA increased 34 -fold after 2 days in culture and 74 -fold after 4 days. Consequently, the rise in mRNA levels preceded the increase in the amount of leu-EK. Depolarization of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> with either elevated potassium or veratridine, which prevents leu-EK accumulation, inhibited the increase in the amount of preproenkephalin mRNA. Moreover, the effect of veratridine was blocked by tetrodotoxin, suggesting that transmembrane sodium ion influx affects the increase in the amount of message. Our studies suggest that elevation of leu-EK in explanted (denervated) medullae is associated with increased amounts of mRNA coding for the peptide precursor and that these processes can be regulated by depolarization...|$|R

25|$|Increased {{epinephrine}} secretion {{is observed}} in pheochromocytoma, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction {{and to a}} lesser degree in benign essential familial tremor. A general increase in sympathetic neural activity is usually accompanied by increased adrenaline secretion, but there is selectivity during hypoxia and hypoglycaemia, when the ratio of adrenaline to noradrenaline is considerably increased.

25|$|Epinephrine is {{synthesized}} in the medulla of the {{adrenal gland}} in an enzymatic pathway that converts the amino acid tyrosine {{into a series of}} intermediates and, ultimately, epinephrine.

Experiments {{were performed on}} rats exposed to either IH (15 -s hypoxia- 5 -min normoxia; 8 h/day) or to room air (normoxia; controls) from ages postnatal day 0 (P 0) to P 5. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed expression of mRNAs encoding α 3 -, α 5 -, α 7 -, and β 2 - and β 4 -nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits in <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> from control P 5 rats. Nicotine-elevated intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) in AMC and nAChR antagonists prevented this response, suggesting that nAChRs are functional in neonatal AMC. In IH-treated rats, nAChR mRNAs were downregulated in AMC, {{which resulted in a}} markedly attenuated nicotine-evoked elevation in [Ca 2 +]i and subsequent catecholamine secretion. Systemic administration of antioxidant prevented IH-evoked downregulation of nAChR expression and function. P 35 rats treated with neonatal IH exhibited reduced nAChR mRNA expression in <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae,</b> attenuated AMC responses to nicotine, and impaired neurogenic catecholamine secretion. Thus the response to neonatal IH lasts for at least 30 days. These observations demonstrate that neonatal IH downregulates nAChR expression and function in AMC via reactive oxygen species signaling, and the effects of neonatal IH persist at least into juvenile life, leading to impaired neurogenic catecholamine secretion from AMC...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to examine the effects of intermittent hypoxia (IH) and sustained hypoxia (SH) on hypoxia-evoked catecholamine (CA) secretion from chromaffin cells in neonatal rats and assess the underlying mechanism(s). Experiments were performed on rat pups exposed to either IH (15 -s hypoxia/ 5 -min normoxia; 8 h/day) or SH (hypobaric hypoxia, 0. 4 atm) or normoxia (controls) from P 0 to P 5. IH treatment facilitated hypoxia-evoked CA secretion and elevations in the intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and these responses were attenuated, but not abolished, by treatments designed to eliminate Ca 2 + flux into cells (Ca 2 +-free medium or Cd 2 +), indicating that intracellular Ca 2 + stores were augmented by IH. Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) levels of <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> were elevated in IH-treated pups. IH treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullae</b> and antioxidant treatment prevented IH-induced facilitation of CA secretion, elevations in [Ca 2 +]i by hypoxia, and the up-regulation of NE and E. The effects of neonatal IH treatment on hypoxia-induced CA secretion and elevation in [Ca 2 +]i, CA, and ROS levels persisted in rats reared under normoxia for > 30 days. In striking contrast, chromaffin cells from SH-treated animals exhibited attenuated hypoxia-evoked CA secretion. In SH-treated cells hypoxia-evoked elevations in [Ca 2 +]i, NE and E contents, and ROS levels were comparable with controls. These observations demonstrate that: 1) neonatal IH and SH evoke opposite effects on hypoxia-evoked CA secretion from chromaffin cells, 2) ROS signaling mediates the faciltatory effects of IH, and 3) the effects of neonatal IH on chromaffin cells persist into adult life...|$|R
