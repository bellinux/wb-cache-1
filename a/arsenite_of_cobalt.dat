40|$|Cobalt is an {{essential}} oligoelement which enters {{in the composition of}} vitamin B 12. For the general population, food and beverages represent the main source <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> exposure. Traces <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> are also present in cement and various household products. In industry, the potential for exposure to cobalt is particularly important during the production <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> powder, the production, processing and use of hard metals, the polishing <b>of</b> diamonds with <b>cobalt</b> containing disks and the processing <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> alloys. Except in the production <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> powders, these activities involve exposure not only to cobalt but also to other substances such as tungsten carbide, iron and diamond which may modulate the biological reactivity <b>of</b> <b>cobalt.</b> Cobalt salts are used for the preparation of enamels and pigments. Cobalt is mainly absorbed from the pulmonary and the gastrointestinal tracts. Absorption through the skin can occur but is low. Concomitant exposure to tungsten carbide increases the pulmonary absorption rate <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> metal. Cobalt is not a cumulative toxin and is mainly excreted in urine {{and to a lesser extent}} via faeces. Cobalt in blood and urine mainly reflects recent exposure. In the past, outbreaks of cardiomyopathy occurred among heavy consumers <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> fortified beer. It is likely that poor nutrition and ethanol had played a synergistic role.

40|$|Surface {{ablation}} <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> cemented {{tungsten carbide}} hardmetal with pulsed UV laser {{has been in}} situ diagnosed by using the technique of laser-induced optical emission spectroscopy. The dependence of emission intensity <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> lines on number of laser shots was investigated at laser fluence of 2. 5 J/cm(2). As a comparison, the reliance of emission intensity <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> lines {{as a function of}} laser pulse number by using pure cobalt as ablation sample was also studied at the same laser condition. It was found that for surface ablation of tungsten carbide hardmetal at laser fluence of 2. 5 J/cm(2), the intensities <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> lines fell off dramatically in the first 300 consecutive laser shots and then slowed down to a low stable level with even more shots. For surface ablation <b>of</b> pure <b>cobalt</b> at the same laser condition, the intensities <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> lines remained constant more or less even after 500 laser shots and then reduced very slowly with even more shots.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of bubbling oxygen, the most important effect of anions in the solutions is on the pathways of oxygen reduction during reactive deposition <b>of</b> <b>cobalt.</b> In {{the presence}} of C 1 - ions, oxygen reduction proceeds mainly through a two-electron process to form HO ~ and OH ions as intermediate products. On the other hand, oxygen is also reduced by a two-electron pathway, but with the formation f H 202 ions as the main product in {{the presence of}} SO ~ ions. However, in acetate solutions, a likely mechanism of oxygen reduction is a four-electron pathway with the formation of water. During reactive deposition <b>of</b> <b>cobalt,</b> oxygen reduction takes place prior to the deposition <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> and the potential shifts to the cathodic side as compared to the deposition <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> in the absence <b>of</b> oxygen. <b>Cobalt</b> deposition processes and the po-rous structure <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> electrodes are therefore directly affected by the pathways of oxygen reduction.

40|$|Hard metal is an alloy of {{tungsten}} carbide (WC) in a matrix <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> metal (Co). The inhalation of hard metal dust can cause an alveolitis which may progress to interstitial fibrosis. This study was undertaken to compare, both in vivo and in vitro, the bioavailability <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> metal when mixed or not with WC {{and to assess}} whether this factor had any influence on the cellular toxicity of hard metal particles. In vivo, non-toxic doses <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> metal were administered intratracheally in the rat, alone (Co, 0. 03 mg/ 100 g) or mixed with tungsten carbide (WC-Co, 0. 5 mg/ 100 g containing 6. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> metal particles).

40|$|International audienceCobalt {{particle}} size, cobalt reducibility, {{and metal}} surface sites {{in a series}} of ruthenium- and rhenium-promoted cobalt silica-supported Fischer– Tropsch catalysts were studied by X-ray diffraction, UV–vis spectroscopy, in situ X-ray absorption, in situ magnetic method, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, DSC-TGA thermal analysis, and propene chemisorption. The catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation; in several catalyst syntheses, sucrose was added to the impregnating solutions. Mononuclear octahedral cobalt complexes were observed in the catalysts after impregnation and drying. Cobalt repartition on silica in the impregnated and dried catalysts depended primarily on the pH of the impregnating solution. Cobalt repartition was uniform on the silica surface if the pH of the impregnating solution was higher than the point of zero charge (PZC) of silica, but was less uniform at pH below that of the PZC <b>of</b> silica. <b>Cobalt</b> dispersion proceeded during catalyst calcination in air. Decomposition <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> nitrate and crystallization <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> oxide seemed to be the crucial steps in the preparation <b>of</b> highly dispersed <b>cobalt</b> catalysts. Promotion with noble metals resulted in greater cobalt dispersion, probably due to higher concentrations <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> oxide crystallization sites. Addition of sucrose modified the structure <b>of</b> supported <b>cobalt</b> complexes and led to higher temperatures <b>of</b> crystallization <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> oxide and to catalysts with extremely high cobalt dispersion. In situ magnetization measurements show that promotion with Ru moderated the temperature <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> oxide to metal phases, whereas the effect was less significant for Re-promoted catalysts. The addition of sucrose during impregnation, although significantly enhancing cobalt dispersion, did not diminish cobalt reducibility. Due to a combination <b>of</b> high <b>cobalt</b> dispersion and reducibility, the ruthenium- and rhenium-promoted catalysts prepared using sucrose had the highest number <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> metal surface sites.

Three fractions (nominal added, dissolved and free) <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> were determined in the liquid media and were correlated with data from batch toxicity experiments. The average concentration <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> that was required for 50 % inhibition of methanogenic activity (IC 50) for free Co 2 + in the three sets of measurements was 13 mu mol/L {{with a standard deviation}} of 22 % and a similarity of 72 % between the data obtained in the three different media for the range <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> concentrations investigated.

The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using solutions <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> nitrate and dihydrogen hexachloroplatinate. Both variation of catalyst calcination temperature between 473 and 773 K and promotion with 0. 1 wt % of Pt had no significant affect on the size of supported Co 3 O 4 crystallites. The size <b>of</b> <b>cobalt</b> oxide particles in the calcined catalysts seems to be influenced primarily by the pore diameter <b>of</b> the support. <b>Cobalt</b> reducibility was relatively low in monometallic cobalt alumina-supported catalysts and decreased as a function of catalyst calcination temperature.
