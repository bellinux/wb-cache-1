40|$|Invasive {{plants can}} have {{ecological}} impacts and cause economic harm particularly when recreational opportunities are lost. While {{the value of}} nature-related tourism has been assessed, {{little is known about}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plants on recreational choices. This study uses non-market valuation techniques for the first time to quantify the net benefit <b>of</b> managing <b>invasive</b> plants in upland areas. We surveyed 1436 Florida residents to determine their preferences for state parks using discrete choice experiment questions with various <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plants and other attributes that impact visitation. Results imply that residents would be willing to pay $ 5. 41 per-visit to reduce the coverage <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plants, $ 3. 72 to improve facilities, $ 3. 73 to increase the diversity of native plant species, and $ 6. 71 to increase the diversity of native animal species. Using score variables to capture interaction effects, demographic variables were found to influence the marginal willingness-to-pay for invasive species control by -$ 1. 13 to +$ 0. 97 per visit. Those who have taken action against or are more knowledgeable about invasive species were also found to influence a respondent's willingness to pay (+$ 2. 47 and +$ 0. 83, respectively). Respondents who consider invasive species to be beneficial (e. g., since many species were imported for their esthetics) would be willing to pay an additional $ 0. 80 per visit to a park with increased coverage. Using annual attendance data from 115 Florida state parks, we calculated statewide willingness-to-pay to manage invasive plants in upland parks. Park users would be willing to spend $ 89. 4 Â million annually to reduce the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plants in the parks, which provides a baseline for evaluating control programs.

40|$|Interorganizational system {{standards}} are reaching {{a new era}} in industry. When asked about interorganizational systems, invariably most people think of electronic data interchange (EDI) standards (ANSI X 12). Albeit EDI still remains the preeminent type of interorganizational system, IOS solutions have been overhauled since the mid- 1990 s. IOS solutions are now collaboratively developed, structured around discretely defined cross-company business process standards and able to be distributed via the web. Compared with EDI technology from the past, the notions of open standards, modularity, scalability, and interorganizational business process reengineering have become embedded in modern-day IOS development. This paper is intended to examine <b>assimilation</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> interorganizational system standards and process innovations (IOS SPI) among members of an industrial group where an IOS standards development organization (SDO) exists.

40|$|Abstract — Regime shifts {{refer to}} sudden {{changes in the}} {{structure}} or function of an eco-system due to external forces on the system. Such shifts arise because these systems have multiple equilibria so external disturbances may drive the state between different regions of attraction. Examples of such shifts include the shift in eutrophic state of shallow lakes in response to nutrient loading {{as well as the}} collapse of fisheries in response to the introduction <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> species. A key measure of an eco-system’s resilience to such shifts is measured by first passage times (FPT) between the basins of attraction for different equilibria. Prior work in eco-system management has assumed low-dimensional linearized models driven by Brownian motions. This paper uses sum-of-square (SOS) programs to bound FPT probabilities for more complex nonlinear population processes in which the primary disturbance is a Poisson jump process.

At three study areas in southern New England, we examined the interaction of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) herbivory and three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> shrub control over seven growing seasons on the dynamics of nine herbaceous and shrub guilds. Although evidence of synergistic interactions was minimal, the separate effects <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> shrub control and deer herbivory on plant community composition and dynamics were profound.

While deer exclusion and intensive invasive shrub control increased native shrubs and forbs, it also increased invasive vines.

40|$|The {{majority}} of the empirical work regarding work-family conflict (WFC) {{has been focused on}} the experiences of White, middle class, Anglo-Americans. The labor force, however, is experiencing major demographic changes as increasing numbers of U. S. -born Latinos and Asians become employees. Although second generation Latinos and Asians {{play a major role in}} the U. S. economy and workplace, their experiences as employees have seldom been examined. Because they are exposed to collectivistic and individualistic values simultaneously, their <b>assimilation</b> <b>levels,</b> or identification with the U.

Using 103 second generation Latino and Asian employees, the present study was aimed to understand the influence of cultural variables on WFC by examining the relationship between their <b>assimilation</b> <b>levels</b> and type <b>of</b> WFC.

The pollinator-mediated plant interactions that occur between native and exotic plants are of particular interest due to the increasing frequency of plant invasions worldwide. While effects <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plant species on native plant pollination have been documented, the mechanisms that drive such interactions are poorly understood. This dissertation focuses on the mechanisms of pollinator-mediated interactions between native and invasive plants through the study of (i) the effects of floral neighborhood on the pollination of a native plant (Chapter 1), (ii) the influence <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> pollen deposited on native stigmas (Chapter 2), and (iii) the effects of an exotic plant on native reproductive fitness over the course of an invasion (Chapter 3). I explored how the heterospecific floral neighborhood affects pollinator visitation and composition of pollinator assemblages for native plant, Phacelia parryi. Through observations of pollination in natural patches of P. parryi, I found that floral neighborhood changed pollinator assemblage composition and that native bees were superior pollinators compared to nonnative honeybees (Chapter 1). Next, a series of hand pollination experiments was used to examine how pollen from the invasive Brassica nigra influences pre- and post-fertilization stages in Phacelia parryi. Mixed pollen applications resulted in deleterious effects on both seed set and pollen tube growth when compared to pure conspecific pollen deposition (Chapter 2). Finally, I tested the effects <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> B. nigra abundance on the reproductive fitness of Phacelia parryi by simulating four stages in invasion and measuring pollinator visitation, pollen deposition and seed set. Native individuals near the invasion and within areas <b>of</b> low <b>invasive</b> density showed the highest reproductive fitness resulting from facilitation of pollinator visits, while natives within areas <b>of</b> high <b>invasive</b> density showed high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> pollen deposition. Isolation from the invasive reduced native fitness as a result of low pollinator visitation and conspecific pollen receipt (Chapter 3). Collectively, these results underscore the importance of determining the mechanisms for pollinator-mediated interactions between native and exotic plants and present valuable information for the mitigation <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plant species...|$|R

Extracorporeal CO 2 removal (ECCO 2 R) techniques have not been systematically evaluated in these patients. MethodsThis is a pilot study of a novel ECCO 2 R device that utilizes a single venous catheter with high CO 2 removal rates at low blood flows. Twenty hypercapnic patients with COPD received ECCO 2 R. Group 1 (n = 7) consisted of patients receiving noninvasive ventilation with a high likelihood <b>of</b> requiring <b>invasive</b> ventilation, group 2 (n = 2) consisted of patients {{who could not be}} weaned from noninvasive ventilation, and group 3 (n = 11) consisted <b>of</b> patients on <b>invasive</b> ventilation who had failed attempts to wean. ResultsThe device was well tolerated, with complications and rates similar to those seen with central venous catheterization. Blood flow through the system was 430. 5 ± 73. 7 mL/min, and ECCO 2 R was 82. 5 ± 15. 6 mL/min and did not change significantly with time. Invasive ventilation was avoided in all patients in group 1 and both patients in group 2 were weaned; PaCO 2 decreased significantly (P <. 003) with application of the device from 78. 9 ± 16. 8 mm Hg to 65. 9 ± 11. 5 mm Hg.

To examine this hypothesis, we mutated all of the G 1 cyclin genes in strains competent to form pseudohyphae. Interestingly, mutation of each G 1 cyclin results in a different filamentation phenotype, varying from a significant defect in cln 1 /cln 1 strains to enhancement of filament production in cln 3 /cln 3 strains. cln 1 cln 2 double mutants are more defective in pseudohyphal development and haploid invasive growth than cln 1 strains. FLO 11 transcription, which correlates with the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> growth, is low in cln 1 cln 2 mutants and high in grr 1 cells (defective in proteolysis of Cln 1, 2), suggesting that Cln 1, 2 /Cdks regulate the pseudohyphal transcriptional program.

From January 2010 to April 2012, all consecutive acute myeloid leukemia patients in 33 Italian centers were prospectively registered.

We recorded data regarding comorbid conditions, employment, hygienic habits, working and living environment, personal habits, hobbies, and pets. All invasive fungal infections occurring within 30 days after the first course of chemotherapy were recorded. Of the 1, 192 patients enrolled in this study, 881 received intensive chemotherapy and were included in the present analysis. Of these, 214 developed an invasive fungal infection, including 77 proven/probable cases (8. 7 %). Of these 77 cases, 54 were proven/probable invasive mold infections (6. 1 %) and 23 were proven yeast infections (2. 6 %). Upon univariate analysis, a significant association was found between invasive mold infections and age, performance status, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, cocaine use, job, hobbies, and a recent house renovation. Higher body weight resulted in a reduced risk <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> mold infections.

By facilitating parameter variation at each <b>of</b> the quality <b>levels</b> and from each of the perspectives, we were able to examine their impact on user quality perception. Results show that a significant reduction in frame rate does not proportionally reduce the user's understanding of the presentation independent of technical parameters, that multimedia content type significantly impacts user information <b>assimilation,</b> user <b>level</b> <b>of</b> enjoyment, and user perception of quality, and that the device display type impacts user information assimilation and user perception of quality. Finally, to ensure the transfer of information, low-level abstraction (network-level) parameters, such as delay and jitter, should be adapted; to maintain the user's <b>level</b> <b>of</b> enjoyment, high-level abstraction quality parameters (content-level), such as the appropriate use of display screens, should be adapted...|$|R

Overall, 40.1, 22.3, 25.6, 0.4, 29.9, 14.8, 27.3 and 37.0  % of the strains were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and furan, respectively. 447 were invasive infections. The resistance <b>level</b> <b>of</b> our <b>invasive</b> strains {{was significantly lower}} than that presented by 11, 7, 10 and 11 other European countries included in the 2013 European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network report for ceftriaxone, imipenem, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, respectively, but significantly {{higher than that of}} 13, 1, 17 and 13 European countries for the same antibiotics. We also observed that the percentages of resistance <b>of</b> our <b>invasive</b> strains to three of the four antibiotics decreased over the study. In parallel, antibiotic consumption remained stable in our four hospitals from January 2013 to July 2015.|$|R
40|$|Plant invasions have {{tremendous}} potential to alter food webs by changing basal resources. Recent studies document how plant invasions {{may contribute to}} increased arthropod abundances in detritus-based food webs. An obvious mechanism for this phenomenon—a bottom-up effect resulting from elevated <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> detritus from the invasive plant litter—has not been explicitly studied. We {{examined the effects of}} an annual grass invasion on ground arthropod assemblages in the coastal sage scrub (CSS) of southern California. Bottom-up food web theory predicts that the addition of detritus would increase generalist-feeding arthropods at all trophic levels; accordingly, we expected increases in fungi, Collembola, and common predators such as mites and spiders. For the common ant taxa, habitat alteration may also be important for predicting responses. Thus we expected that Forelius mccooki and Pheidole vistana, the most common ant species, would decline because of changes in soil temperature (F. mccooki) and habitat structure (P. vistana) associated with litter. We studied trends observationally and conducted a 3 -year experiment in which we manipulated litter quantity. In contrast to other published studies, most detritus-based arthropod taxa declined in areas of high grass invasion, and, within trophic levels, responses often varied idiosyncratically. For the two most common taxa, a native ant (F. mccooki), and predatory mites in the Anystidae, we experimentally linked declines in abundance to increased <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> grass litter. Such declines, especially those exhibited by the most common ant taxa, could have cascading effects on the CSS ecosystem, where ants are numerically dominant and thus may have broad influences on food web and ecosystem properties. Our results highlight that accurately predicting arthropod responses to invasive plant litter requires careful consideration of the structural and food resources provided by detritus to each particular food web...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} conceptual, but empirically applicable, model for {{determining}} the optimal allocation of resources between exclusion and control activities for managing an invasive species with an uncertain discovery time. This model is used to investigate how to allocate limited resources between activities {{before and after the}} first discovery <b>of</b> an <b>invasive</b> species and the effects of the characteristics <b>of</b> an <b>invasive</b> species on limited resource allocation. The optimality conditions show that it is economically efficient to spend a larger share of outlays for exclusion activities before, rather than after, a species is first discovered, up to a threshold point. We also find that, after discovery, more exclusionary measures and fewer control measures are optimal, when the pest population is less than a threshold. As the pest population increases beyond this threshold, the exclusionary measures are no longer optimal. Finally, a comparative dynamic analysis indicates that the efficient <b>level</b> <b>of</b> total expenditures on preventive and control measures decreases with the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the <b>invasive</b> species stock and increases with the intrinsic population growth rate, the rate of additional discoveries avoided, and the maximum possible pest population. invasive species, exclusion, control, eradication, public expenditures, Environmental Economics and Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|The rate of CO 2 <b>assimilation</b> and <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> {{metabolites}} of the C 4 {{cycle and}} reductive pentose phosphate pathway in an attached leaf of maize (Zea mays L) were measured over {{a range of}} intercellular CO 2 concentration (Ci) of 10 to 190 microliters per liter. The CO 2 assimilation rate was saturated at a Ci of around 175 microliters per liter. The <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate and fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate decreased substantially with increasing Ci. The <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> 3 -phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and pyruvate increased with increasing Ci. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> dihydroxyacetone phosphate increased moderately from Ci of 10 microliters per liter to 20 to 50 microliters per liter and stayed almost constant {{over the rest of}} the range of Ci investigated. The <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> fructose 6 -phosphate did not show any significant changes over the range <b>of</b> Ci. The <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> glucose 6 -phosphate decreased slightly with increasing Ci. Although photosynthetically inactive pools of malate, asparate, and alanine could mask real changes in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the photosynthetically active pools of these compounds, the apparent <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> these compounds and the total amount of intermediates in the C 4 cycle (malate, aspartate, pyruvate, PEP, and alanine) increased with increasing Ci. The results suggest that there is carbon input into the C 4 cycle from the reductive pentose phosphate pathway which increases the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> total intermediates of the C 4 cycle with increasing Ci...|$|R

As a result of the critical role of the liver, it provides a lot of enzymes that have medical and clinical significance like aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT). These two enzymes perform a process called transamination which is the process of transferring the amino group from amino acid to ketoacidosis where the first one is transformed into ketoacidosis which is also transformed into amino acid. Nigella sativa contains the essential acids that the human body needs. They help increasing the reactions between the enzymes that result in rebuilding damaged cells which is caused by training...|$|R
