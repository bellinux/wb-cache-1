They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers {{to go out on a}} date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors <b>are</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> party, and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan.

25|$|A common {{variant of}} the Zoroaster images derives from a Sassanid-era rock-face carving. In this {{depiction}} at Taq-e Bostan, a figure is seen to preside over the coronation of Ardashir I or II. The figure is standing on a lotus, with a baresman in hand and with a gloriole around his head. Until the 1920s, this figure was commonly {{thought to be a}} depiction of Zoroaster, but in recent years is more commonly interpreted to be a depiction of Mithra. Among the most famous of the European depictions of Zoroaster is that of the figure in Raphael's 1509 The School of Athens. In it, Zoroaster and Ptolemy <b>are</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> discussion in the lower right corner. The prophet is holding a star-studded globe.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{long-term}} data on habitat changes, so {{the extent of}} human impact is unclear. Vegetation such as tussac grass, fachine, and native box (Hebe elliptica) have been heavily affected by introduced grazing animals. Many breeding birds similarly only live on offshore islands, where introduced animals such as cats and rats are not found. Virtually the entire area of the islands is used as pasture for sheep. There is also an introduced reindeer population, which {{was brought to the}} islands in 2001 for commercial purposes. Rats and grey foxes have been introduced and <b>are</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> detrimental impact on birds that nest on the shores, as are feral cats. Twenty-two introduced plant species are thought to provide a significant threat to local flora.|$|E

25|$|From {{a sample}} of 129 beluga adults from the Saint Lawrence River {{examined}} between 1983 and 1999, a total of 27% had suffered cancer. This is a higher percentage than that documented for other populations of this species and {{is much higher than}} for other cetaceans and for the majority of terrestrial mammals; in fact, the rate is only comparable to the levels found in humans and some domesticated animals. For example, the rate of intestinal cancer in the sample is much higher than for humans. This condition is thought to be directly related to environmental contamination, in this case by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and coincides with the high incidence of this disease in humans residing in the area. The prevalence of tumours suggests the contaminants identified in the animals that inhabit the estuary <b>are</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> direct carcinogenic effect or they are at least causing an immunological deterioration that is reducing the inhabitants' resistance to the disease.|$|E

500|$|Interactions with Succinea sp. B may {{be having}} a {{significant}} impact on Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, as both species may be competing for food, breeding or wintering habitat. Hubricht (1985) reported that Succinea putris (Succinea sp. B of Hoagland and Davis) is a [...] "very common species within its range. I found no other Succineidae with it.

[...] It does not appear that the other sympatric snail species (e.g., Oxyloma spp.) occurring at the Falls <b>are</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> significant impact on Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, as they are thought to be native species.
