40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three chapters. In Chapter I (Price Caps with Capacity Precommitment), we study the effectiveness of price cap regulation in a monopolistic setting under demand uncertainty. In our model, a monopolist facing an uncertain demand. In the absence of capacity precommitment, price caps remain an effective regulatory instrument, {{just as they are}} when demand is deterministic. Price caps are also an effective instrument to regulate a monopoly that makes irreversible capacity investments ex-ante, and then chooses its output up to capacity upon observing the realization of demand. In this scenario, however, the optimal price cap must trade off the incentives for capacity investment and capacity withholding, is well above the unit cost of capacity and, when the unit cost of capacity is low, is below the price cap that maximizes capacity. Moreover, a price cap alone cannot eliminate inefficiencies. Under standard regularity assumptions on the demand distribution, the comparative static properties of price caps above the optimal price cap are analogous to those they have in the absence of capacity precommitment. The Chapter II and Chapter III are aimed at analyzing the competitive consequences of imposition of the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> <b>Principle</b> (ALP, henceforth) requirements for international transfer pricing. In order to discourage tax shifting activities by multinational fi rms, most countries follow taxation policies that are based on the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations, which recommend that, for tax purposes, internal pricing policies be consistent with ALP (i. e., that transfer prices between companies of multinational enterprises for tax purposes be established on a market value basis, thus comparable to transactions between independent, unrelated, parties). Moreover, ALP puts associated and independent enterprises on a more equal footing for tax purposes, it avoids the creation of tax advantages that would otherwise distort the relative competitive positions of either type of entity. The failure to comply with the ALP may result in a penalty. The OECD s recommendation that transfer prices between parent firms and their subsidiaries be consistent with the ALP for tax purposes does not restrict internal pricing policies. In Chapter II (Strategic Incentives for Keeping One Set of Books under the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> <b>Principle),</b> we show that under imperfect competition parent rms accounting policies determine the properties of market outcomes: if parents keep one set of books (i. e., their internal transfer prices are consistent with the ALP), then competition in the external (home) market softens (intensi es) relative to an equilibrium where parent fi rms and subsidiaries are integrated. In contrast, if rms keep two sets of books (i. e., their internal transfer prices differ from those used for tax purposes) or maintain asymmetric accounting policies, then competition intensi es in both markets. Keeping one set of books turns out to be an equilibrium for most of the parameter space. In Chapter III (The Non-Neutrality of the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> <b>Principle</b> with Imperfect Competition), we show that under imperfect competition the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> <b>Principle</b> is non-neutral: a strict (lax) application of the ALP softens competition among subsidiaries (parents). Thus, under imperfect competition regulating transfer pricing optimally requires trading off its impact on market outcomes and tax revenue...|$|E

40|$|Many studies into {{construction}} procurement methods reveal {{evidence of}} a {{need to change the}} culture and attitude in the construction industry, transition from traditional adversarial relationships to cooperative and collaborative relationships. At the same time there is also increasing concern and discussion on alternative procurement methods, involving a movement away from traditional procurement systems. Relational contracting approaches, such as partnering and relationship management, are business strategies that align the objectives of clients, commercial participants and stakeholders. It provides a collaborative environment and a framework for all participants to adapt their behaviour to project objectives and allows for engagement of those subcontractors and suppliers down the supply chain. The efficacy of relationship management in the client and contractor groups is proven and well documented. However, the industry has a history of slow implementation of relational contracting down the supply chain. Furthermore, there exists little research on relationship management conducted in the supply chain context. This research aims to explore the association between relational contracting structures and processes and supply chain sustainability in the civil engineering construction industry. It endeavours to shed light on the practices and prerequisites for relationship management implementation success and for supply sustainability to develop. The research methodology is a triangulated approach based on Cheung. s (2006) earlier research where questionnaire survey, interviews and case studies were conducted. This new research includes a face-to-face questionnaire survey that was carried out with 100 professionals from 27 contracting organisations in Queensland from June 2008 to January 2009. A follow-up survey sub-questionnaire, further examining project participants. perspectives was sent to another group of professionals (as identified in the main questionnaire survey). Statistical analysis including multiple regression, correlation, principal component factor analysis and analysis of variance were used to identify the underlying dimensions and test the relationships among variables. Interviews and case studies were conducted to assist in providing a deeper understanding as well as explaining findings of the quantitative study. The qualitative approaches also gave the opportunity to critique and validate the research findings. This research presents the implementation of relationship management from the contractor. s perspective. Findings show that the adaption of relational contracting approach in the supply chain is found to be limited; contractors still prefer to keep the suppliers and subcontractors at <b>arm.</b> <b>s</b> <b>length.</b> This research shows that the degree of match and mismatch between organisational structuring and organisational process has an impact on staff. s commitment level and performance effectiveness.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{subjective}} straight-ahead {{direction is}} a very basic perceptual reference for spatial orientation and locomotion. The perceived straight-ahead along the horizontal and vertical meridian is largely determined by both otolith and somatosensory inputs which are altered in microgravity. The Straight Ahead in Microgravity (SAM) experiment will be conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) to examine how this spatial processing changes {{as a function of}} spaceflight. METHODS Data will be collected before the flight, at one-month intervals during long-duration stay (180 days) on board ISS, and after return to Earth. Control studies will also be performed during parabolic flights. Three different protocols will be used in each test session: (1) Fixation: The subject will be asked to look at actual targets (normal vision) and then to imagine these same targets (occluded vision) in the straight-ahead direction. Targets will be located at near distance (<b>arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length,</b> ~ 0. 5 m), medium distance (~ 1 m), and far distance (beyond 2 m). This task will be successively performed with subject s body aligned with the spacecraft interior, and with subject s body tilted forward and backward by an operator. (2) Saccades: The subject will be asked to make horizontal and vertical saccades, first relative to the spacecraft interior reference system, and then relative to the subject s head reference system. This task will be successively performed with subject s body aligned with the spacecraft interior, and with subject s body tilted in roll or in pitch by an operator. (3) Linear Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) : The subject will be asked to stare at actual visual targets (normal vision) at various distances (near, medium, far) in the straight-ahead direction. Vision will then be occluded, and the subject will be asked to continue staring at the same imagined targets while he/she is passively translated forward-backward, up-down, or side-to-side. The subject's body motion will be performed by the restrained operator while the subject is free-floating. EXPECTED RESULTS The coupling of downward gaze with vergence eye movements observed on Earth is expected to increase in microgravity. Saccadic eye movements made in darkness along perceived axes are expected to be more closely aligned with the body s longitudinal axis in 0 g compared to 1 g, as the reference system for spatial orientation moves from an allocentric (gravitational) to an egocentric (idiotropic) vector. Changes in the linear VOR will reflect adaptive changes in otolith-ocular reflex contributions to the perceived straight-ahead. DISCUSSION A change in an individual's egocentric reference might have negative consequences on evaluating the direction of an approaching object or on the accuracy of reaching movements or locomotion. Consequently, investigating how microgravity affects the egocenter is important for understanding the problems associated with long-term effects of microgravity on astronauts' and how they re-adapt to the return of gravitational forces on Earth or other planetary surfaces.

It investigates whether the firm’s optimal transfer price {{coincides with the}} arm’s length price and examines how the firm might respond if it is compelled to follow the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle.</b> The main findings are: (1) {{in the absence of}} tax transfer incentives, the firm’s optimal transfer price does not coincide with the arm’s length price. If the firm is compelled to follow the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle,</b> it has an incentive to circumvent the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle</b> by keeping two sets of books, one for internal management, and another for tax reporting purposes; (2) the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle</b> can affect the MNF’s decision on whether or not to foreclose its competitor.

Imposing the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle</b> induces the firm to supply its competitor, but the firm can revert to its foreclosure decision by keeping two sets of books.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the {{regulations}} found in the OECD model and the OECD TP guidelines concerning the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle.</b> The core of the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle</b> is that transactions between associated enterprises should be treated the same as transactions between independent enterprises. This principle can be found in Article 9 of the OECD model. One transaction that may fall within the scope of Article 9 of the OECD model is business restructuring. Business restructuring was previously an unregulated TP area but with the new OECD TP guidelines, from 2010, regulations have been formulated. The aim with thesis is therefore to examine how the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle</b> should be applied to the new guidelines for business restructurings of intangibles with an uncertain value {{at the time of the}} restructuring. In order to answer the question set out in this thesis some of the factors that affect the application of the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle</b> have been examined separately. Firstly the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle</b> that is the generally accepted TP method used by both taxpayers and tax administrations in order to find a fair price for transactions between associated enterprises. The principle seeks to identify the controlled transaction and thereafter find a comparable uncontrolled transaction that is similar to the transaction performed between the associated enterprises. The second part examined the meaning of the term business restructuring according to the new guidelines since there is no other legal or general definition. Business restructurings are defined as cross-border redeployments of functions assets and risks, performed by MNEs. As long as a transaction falls within this definition it will be subjected to the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle</b> for tax purposes. The third part examined intangibles since that also lack a general definition. The identification and valuation of intangibles is a complex and uncertain thing to do for both taxpayers and tax administrations. When applying the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle</b> it is however found that the issue of identification of what constitutes and intangible may be unnecessary. The aspect that should be considered is instead the value of the intangible or more precise, the value that independent enterprises would have agreed upon in a similar situation. The applicability of the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle</b> to business restructurings of intangibles with an uncertain value at the time of the restructuring should be found by performing a comparability analysis. In order to perform a comparability analysis, the controlled transaction firstly has to be identified. Thereafter, a comparable uncontrolled transaction needs to be found. An equivalent uncontrolled transaction may not be found in all cases and it should in those cases be examined what independent enterprises would have done if they had been in a comparable situation. The arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle</b> should be applied to business restructurings of intangibles with an uncertain value in the same manner as for any other uncontrolled transaction. The issues for this type of a transaction become the identification of what constitutes a business restructuring and also how to determine a fair value for the intangibles. The OECD TP guidelines lack some guidance as to the issues that can occur when a comparable uncontrolled transaction cannot be found. This creates an unsatisfactory guesswork for both taxpayers and tax administrations when trying to determine what independent enterprises would have done if they had been in a similar situation. This creates an unnecessary uncertainty when trying to apply the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>principle.</b> ...|$|R

Our empirical results suggest that with small data sets, the MDL approach yields more accurate predictions than the MML estimators. The empirical results also demonstrate that the revised MML estimators introduced here perform better than the original MML estimator suggested by Wallace and Freeman. 1 INTRODUCTION Two related but distinct approaches to statistical inference and model selection are the Minimum Description <b>Length</b> (MDL) <b>principle</b> (Rissanen, 1978, 1987, 1996), and the Minimum Message <b>Length</b> (MML) <b>principle</b> (Wallace & Boulton, 1968; W [...] ...|$|R
