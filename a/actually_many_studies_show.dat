40|$|In mammals, the {{environmental}} light/dark cycle strongly synchronizes the circadian clock within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) to 24 hr. It {{is well known}} that not only photic but also nonphotic stimuli can entrain the SCN clock. <b>Actually,</b> <b>many</b> <b>studies</b> have <b>shown</b> that a daytime injection of 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(din-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH DPAT), a serotonin 1 A/ 7 receptor agonist, as a nonphotic stimulus induces phase advances in hamster behavioral circadian rhythms in vivo, as well as the neuron activity rhythm of the SCN in vitro. Recent reports suggest that mammalian homologs of the Drosophila clock gene, Period (Per), are involved in photic entrainment. Therefore, we examined whether phase advances elicited by 8 -OH DPAT were associated with a change of Period mRNA levels in the SCN. In this experiment, we cloned partial cDNAs encoding hamster Per 1, Per 2, and Per 3 and observed both circadian oscillation and the light responsiveness of Period. Furthermore, we found that the inhibitory effect of 8 -OH DPAT on hamster Per 1 and Per 2 mRNA levels in the SCN occurred only during the hamster’s mid-subjective day, but not during the early subjective day or subjective night. The present findings demonstrate that the acute and circadian time-dependent reduction of Per 1 and/or Per 2 mRNA in the hamster SCN by 8 -OH DPAT is strongly correlated with the phase resetting in response to 8 -OH DPAT...|$|R
