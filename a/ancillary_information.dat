40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{having an impact on}} forest {{ecosystems}} around the world and is expected to alter the suitable habitat of individual tree species. Forest managers require resources about potential impacts of climate change at the regional scale to aid in climate mitigation efforts. By understanding the geographic distribution of changes in suitable habitat, migration corridors can be identified for conservation and active management. With the increased availability of climate projection data, <b>ancillary</b> Geographic <b>Information</b> Systems data, and field observations, modeling efforts at the regional scale are now possible. Here, we modeled and mapped the continuous distribution of Tsuga canadensis throughout the state of Maine at the regional scale(30 m) with high precision (89 % of pixels had a coefficient of variation ≤ 4. 0 %). The random forest algorithm was used to create a strong prediction of suitable habitat for the years 2050 and 2100 from both high and low emission climate projections. The results clearly suggest a significant gain in suitable habitat for Tsuga canadensis range with a general northwest expansion...|$|R
40|$|For many {{applications}} of modelling environmental conditions or developing scenarios for environmental change analysis soil property data {{in form of}} spatial layers are needed. Raster data formats are widely used for the modelling of movements through space and the storage of parameters, which change constantly and without a pattern that could be described by a plain mathematical function. This study into providing spatial soil property layers uses a soil database where the soil properties are stored in tables of generalized combinations of attributes and linked to a spatial layer of delineated mapping units with the aim to investigate the potential of providing a measure of spatial positioning of attributes within spatial mapping units and options of mapping all attributes associated with the mapping unit to a raster layer. The method developed {{in the course of}} the study resulted in a set of spatial data of major soil properties. It also indicates that linking soil morphological data with <b>ancillary</b> spatial <b>information</b> by a multi-criteria analysis could largely improve the mapping of typological soil properties.

40|$|Terrestrial {{ecosystems}} sequester 2. 1 Pg {{of atmospheric}} carbon annually. A {{large amount of}} the terrestrial sink is realized by forests. However, considerable uncertainties remain regarding the fate of this carbon over both short and long timescales. Relevant data to address these uncertainties are being collected at many sites around the world, but syntheses of these data are still sparse. To facilitate future synthesis activities, we have assembled a comprehensive global database for forest ecosystems, which includes carbon budget variables (fluxes and stocks), ecosystem traits (e. g. leaf area index, age), as well as <b>ancillary</b> site <b>information</b> such as management regime, climate, and soil characteristics.

40|$|Since radio {{continuum}} {{observations are}} {{not affected by}} dust obscuration, they are of immense potential diagnostic power as cosmological probes and for studying galaxy formation and evolution out to high redshifts. However, the power-law nature of radio frequency spectra ensures that <b>ancillary</b> spectroscopic <b>information</b> remains critical for studying {{the properties of the}} faint radio sources being detected in rapidly-increasing numbers on the pathway to the Square Kilometre Array. In this contribution, I present some of the key scientific motivations for exploiting the immense synergies between radio continuum observations and multi-object spectroscopic surveys. I review some of the ongoing efforts to obtain the spectra necessary to harness the huge numbers of star-forming galaxies and AGN that current and future radio surveys will detect.

Although three-pulse triple-quantum filtering has been demonstrated to be better suited for in vivo imaging, the absence of the refocusing pulse in the filter increases its sensitivity to magnetic field inhomogeneities. Therefore, several TQF cycles have been developed previously to correct image distortions caused by B(0) inhomogeneities. In this paper, we present a new 12 -step phase-cycling TQF scheme based on three radiofrequency pulses which allows the compensation of B(0) variations both with and without <b>ancillary</b> B(0) map <b>information.</b> The method offers 40 % higher signal-to-noise-ratio efficiency compared with the previously developed B(0) -correcting phase-cycling schemes...|$|R
