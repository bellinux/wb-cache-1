5|$|A {{large dam}} across the Yangtze River was {{originally}} envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919. He stated that a dam capable of generating 30million horsepower (22GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on {{plans in the}} Three Gorges. In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam {{in anticipation of a}} Japanese victory over China.|$|E
5|$|Explorer and {{archaeologist}} Alfred Maudslay visited Quiriguá {{for three}} days in 1881; {{they were the first}} pre-Columbian ruins that he saw and they were sufficiently impressive to inspire him to take up a permanent interest in Central American archaeology. He was able to return on three further occasions, the last being in 1894, and he made the first efforts to clear the monuments before recording them. He carried out a very thorough examination and made a photographic record of all visible monuments, carried out some minor excavations, made paper and plaster molds of the hieroglyphic inscriptions <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> principal sculptures; these molds were then shipped to the Victoria and Albert Museum, with casts being transferred to the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{during the}} American {{occupation}} of Mexico after the Mexican-American War, Raynolds and other U.S. Army personnel {{were the first}} confirmed to have reached the summit Pico de Orizaba, the tallest mountain in Mexico, and inadvertently set {{what may have been}} a 50-year American alpine altitude record. In 1859, Raynolds was placed in charge of the first government-sponsored expedition to venture into the upper Yellowstone region that was later to become Yellowstone National Park. Heavy winter snowpack in the Absaroka Range of Wyoming prevented the expedition from reaching the Yellowstone Plateau, forcing them to divert to the south and cross Union Pass at the northern end of the Wind River Range. After negotiating the pass the expedition entered Jackson Hole <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> Teton Range, now within Grand Teton National Park.|$|E

5|$|In 1926 and 1927, Norwegian Eyvind Tofte circumnavigated <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> island from Odd I. However, he {{was also}} {{prevented}} from landing. The Norwegian whale-ship owner Lars Christensen financed several expeditions to the Antarctic, in part for research and in part to claim land for Norway. The latter was motivated by the British taxation of whaling stations in the Antarctic, and Christensen hoped {{to be able to}} establish stations on Norwegian territory to gain better privileges and so at least the taxes went to his home country. The first expedition to land on the island was the Christensen-financed second Norvegia expedition, led by Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad. They landed on 2 February 1929 and claimed the island for Norway. Larsen attempted to land again in 1931, but was hindered by pack ice. On 6 March 1931, a Norwegian royal proclamation declared the island under Norwegian sovereignty and on 23 March 1933 the island was declared a dependency.|$|E

The anniversary of this survey is observed in Massachusetts as Forefathers' Day and is traditionally associated with the Plymouth Rock landing tradition.

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} American Revolutionary War, the state opened up these former Iroquois lands {{for sale and}} development. Cooper's father {{purchased}} several thousand acres of land in upstate New York along {{the headwaters of the}} Susquehanna River. By 1788, William Cooper had selected <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> site where Cooperstown would be established. He erected a home on the shore of Otsego lake and moved his family there in the autumn of 1790. He soon began construction of the mansion that would be known as Otsego Hall. It was completed in 1799 when James was ten.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, acting without {{explicit}} government authority, Antonio López de Santa Anna, {{known for}} his military leadership, came out of retirement from his hacienda near Xalapa <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> defenses of Veracruz.

In March, he went to the Gordon River from Port Renfrew and in mid March {{continued}} on to more surveying at Atla Lake in the Whistler region. By early April Swannell had moved on to the Lillooet River. By July, he and his crew had returned to the Nechako Valley <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> areas around Fraser Lake and the Nechako River and the Endako Valley. That year, Swannell left Endako in December, taking a 400-mile sleigh ride to Ashcroft to meet the CPR. He arrived home on New Year's Eve.|$|E

500|$|The American trader Josiah Gregg {{wrote about}} the ruins of Chaco Canyon, {{referring}} in 1832 to Pueblo Bonito as [...] "built of fine-grit sandstone". In 1849, a U.S. Army detachment passed through <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> ruins, following United States acquisition of the Southwest with its victory in the Mexican War in 1848. The canyon was so remote, however, that it was scarcely visited over the next 50 years. After brief reconnaissance work by Smithsonian scholars in the 1870s, formal archaeological work began in 1896 when a party from the American Museum of Natural History based in New York City —the Hyde Exploring Expedition—began excavating Pueblo Bonito. Spending five summers in the region, they sent over 60,000 artifacts back to New York and operated a series of trading posts in the area.|$|E
500|$|The {{same month}} as the March poll, {{an article in}} The Hill quoted Specter as stating he was {{considering}} leaving the Republican party to run for re-election as an Independent candidate. Specter later denied the validity of those claims, announcing on March 18, [...] "To eliminate any doubt, I am a Republican, and I am running for reelection in 2010 as a Republican on the Republican ticket." [...] However, on April 28, 2009, Specter announced he was leaving the Republican Party and becoming a Democrat because he disagreed with the increasingly conservative direction the Republican Party was heading in and found his personal philosophy was now better aligned with the Democrats. Although Specter said that he primarily based his decision on principle, he also admitted it was partially due to his poor chances at winning the Republican primary: [...] "I have traveled the state <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, observed other public opinion polls and {{have found that the}} prospects for winning a Republican primary are bleak." ...|$|E
500|$|Koos de la Rey {{had been}} {{absent from the}} army {{immediately}} after the Battle of the Modder River, having gone to Jacobsdal to bury his son Adriaan, {{who had been killed}} by a British shell during the battle. He arrived at the defensive positions on 1 December <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> Boer lines the following day. [...] He found the defences lacking, and realised that Cronje's position at Spytfontein was vulnerable to long range artillery fire from the hills at Magersfontein. [...] He therefore recommended that they should move their defensive position forward to Magersfontein, to deny the British this opportunity. [...] Cronje, who was the more senior officer, disagreed with him, so De la Rey telegraphed his objections to President Martinus Theunis Steyn of the Orange Free State. [...] After consulting with President Paul Kruger of the Transvaal, Steyn visited the front on 4 December at Kruger's suggestion. Steyn also wished to settle a rift that had developed between the Transvaal and Free State Boers over the poor performance of his Free Staters in the battle on 28 November. [...] He spent the next day touring the camps and defences, then summoned a krijgsraad (council of war).|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly positive. In a pre-broadcast review, Terry Ramsey of The Daily Telegraph {{labelled}} the story's shift from a Gothic house to a military research base [...] "an inspired piece of modernisation". He praised the two lead actors, and say that [...] "the script is sharp and witty and the updating is clever, while remaining true to the original. A modern classic." [...] Serena Davies, also of The Daily Telegraph praised the episode for being [...] "pacy, sharp and witty, as we've come to expect from the Moffat and Gatiss crack creative duo, and rather less inscrutable than the New Year episode." [...] Davies rated the episode {{four out of five}} stars. Chris Harvey, again from The Daily Telegraph identified a range of clues, cultural references and possible inspirations. He suggests that the scene in which [...] "Sherlock Holmes clambered alone {{to the top of a}} Dartmoor mound <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> landscape below, it appeared to be a direct visual reference to ... Wanderer above the Sea of Fog" [...] by 19th century German Romantic landscape painter Caspar David Friedrich. Harvey also identified several references to Thomas Harris' character Hannibal Lecter, plot similarities to the 2005 film Batman Begins, and jokes similar to Scooby-Doo.|$|E
500|$|A dress {{rehearsal}} {{was held on}} May 2, two days before taping. Several NBC executives watched the rehearsal and were concerned that Monica did not care enough about Paul to sleep with him on their first date. NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer believed that the audience would perceive her as [...] "a slut". Crane, Kauffman and Warner Bros. executives disagreed, <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> other people watching the rehearsal to support their position. Despite the audience agreeing with them, {{they had to take}} NBC's considerations into account in case they lost the commission; they rewrote Monica's lines to show that she cared about Paul. NBC also wanted a scene removed that implied the supposedly-impotent Paul was getting an erection, as it would violate network standards. Crane and Kauffman rewrote the scene and found they preferred the new version, as it made the scene [...] "smart and subtler". They sought to protect other parts of the script, some major and some minor; NBC wanted two of the pilot's three storylines downplayed to subplots, but the writers were adamant that all three should carry equal weight. They also favored not cutting the [...] "Mr. Potato Head" [...] line. Their final script draft was completed on May 3.|$|E
