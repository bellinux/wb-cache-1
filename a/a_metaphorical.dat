During his career Black wrote several important opinions relating to church-state separation. He delivered {{the opinion of the}} court in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), which held that the establishment clause was applicable not only to the federal government, but also to the states.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} {{of the book and}} {{the subject matter of the}} poem within it share <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> connection in the decay of memory. In this light, critic Peter Schwenger asserts that Agrippa can be understood as organized by two ideas: the death of Gibson's father, and the disappearance or absence of the book itself. In this sense, it instantiates the ephemeral nature of all text.|$|E

5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album {{as a rock}} opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration with the audience became so acute that he spat on them. Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most recognisable concept albums.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Ariel Hanson is a {{scientist}} who becomes associated with Raynor's Raiders after her home colony on the planet Agria is invaded by Zerg in Wings of Liberty, where she is voiced by Ali Hillis. A selfless and altruistic individual, she mainly wishes for life to return to normal. She {{is considered to be}} the moral opposite of Tychus Findlay, acting as <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> angel on Raynor's shoulder, and represents a positive moral influence on Raynor. Originally designed as a male character, Hanson was changed in development to female to act as a love interest for Raynor, albeit limited by Raynor's status as a mercenary and fugitive, and moreover the fact that Raynor is still trying to sort himself out in relation to Sarah Kerrigan.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Macedonian painted artwork {{includes}} frescoes and murals, {{but also}} decoration on sculpted artwork such as statues and reliefs. For instance, trace colors still {{exist on the}} bas-reliefs of the late 4th-century BC Alexander Sarcophagus. Macedonian paintings have allowed historians to investigate the clothing fashions as well as military gear worn by the ancient Macedonians. Aside from metalwork and painting, mosaics are another significant form of surviving Macedonian artwork. The Stag Hunt Mosaic of Pella, with its three-dimensional qualities and illusionist style, show clear influence from painted artwork and wider Hellenistic art trends, although the rustic theme of hunting was tailored to Macedonian tastes. The similar Lion Hunt Mosaic of Pella illustrates either a scene of Alexander the Great with his companion Craterus, or simply a conventional illustration of the royal diversion of hunting. Mosaics with mythological themes include scenes of Dionysus riding a panther and Helen of Troy being abducted by Theseus, the latter of which employs illusionist qualities and realistic shading similar to Macedonian paintings. Common themes of Macedonian paintings and mosaics include warfare, hunting, and aggressive masculine sexuality (i.e. abduction of women for rape or marriage); these subjects are at times combined within a single work and perhaps indicate <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> connection.|$|E

25|$|Early {{forms of}} analogical reasoning, {{inductive}} reasoning and categorical syllogism {{were introduced in}} Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Sharia (Islamic law) and Kalam (Islamic theology) from the 7th century {{with the process of}} Qiyas, before the Arabic translations of Aristotle's works. Later during the Islamic Golden Age, there was a logical debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that Qiyas refers to inductive reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that Qiyas does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to categorical syllogism in a real sense and analogical reasoning in <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058–1111) (and in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term Qiyas refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a real sense.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>metaphorical</b> {{interpretation}} {{suggests that}} Kolob may {{be construed as}} a metaphor for Jesus. The symbolic interpretation was explained by Hugh Nibley in The Temple and The Cosmos. Advocates of the symbolic interpretation believe it harmonizes better with other Mormon beliefs and with beliefs in the greater Christian community, as it does not require that God have a physical throne within this universe.|$|E

25|$|However, Rakim {{left the}} label in 2003 and Oh, My God was indefinitely shelved. After Rakim {{eventually}} left Aftermath Entertainment, {{he stated that}} the reason he departed the label was because of creative differences with Dr. Dre. Rakim used <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> example that Dr. Dre wanted Rakim to write about killing someone, while Rakim {{wanted to write about}} the resurrection of someone.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{confusion}} {{about the idea of}} dissonance is created by the fact that musicians and writers sometimes use the word dissonance and related terms in a precise and carefully defined way, more often in an informal way, and very often in <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> sense ("rhythmic dissonance"). For many musicians and composers, the essential ideas of dissonance and resolution are vitally important ones that deeply inform their musical thinking on a number of levels.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{the concept}} of {{governmental}} interest analysis was developed by Brainerd Currie and is preferred by many American conflicts writers. Currie focused on each state's substantive rules, rather than on <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> test, for {{the seat of the}} legal relationships and assumed that governments are less interested in what happens within their territorial boundaries than in the well-being of their subjects. The methodology that he proposed relies almost entirely on the personal nexus between the litigants and the states.|$|E

5000|$|... "Einstein" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Kelly Clarkson, from her fifth studio album, Stronger (2011). Originally titled as [...] "Dumb + Dumb = You", [...] "Einstein" [...] was written by Clarkson, Toby Gad, Bridget Kelly, and James Fauntleroy II, with Gad handling the production. Lyrically, the song is written in a woman's first-person narrative about her acquiescence and infuriation towards her ex-lover, whom she described in the song as [...] "dumb". Written in wordplay, it uses various mathematical-related equations and topics as rhetorical devices to describe their relationship, notably referencing the German-born physicist Albert Einstein in <b>an</b> <b>metaphorical</b> lyric, {{which led to the}} song being named after him.|$|R
25|$|The term sixth borough {{is used to}} {{describe}} any {{of a number of}} places not that are not politically within the borders of any of the five boroughs of New York City that have instead been referred to as <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> part of the city by virtue of their geographic location, demographic composition, special affiliation with New York City, or cosmopolitan character. They include adjacent cities and counties in the New York metropolitan area as well as in other states, U.S. territories, and foreign countries.|$|E
25|$|Like Tefillin, Karaites {{interpret}} the scripture that mandates inscribing the Law on doorposts and city gates as <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> admonition, specifically, {{to keep the}} Law at home and away. This is because the previous commandment in the same passage is the source for Tefillin for Rabbinic Judaism, and is understood metaphorically due to the language. As a result, the entire passage is understood as a metaphor. Therefore, they do not put up mezuzot, although many Karaite Jews do have a small plaque with the Ten Commandments on their doorposts.|$|E
25|$|Lines one {{to twenty}} one {{describe}} {{the election and}} praise of Kesh as recorded by Nisaba, twenty two to forty four liken the temple to the moon against the sky containing the life sources of Sumer and its cosmic dimensions filling the world. Lines forty five to fifty seven give <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> description of the temple reaching both for the heaven and descending into the underworld. Lines fifty eight to seventy three discuss {{the complexities of the}} temple with vast quantities of oxen and sheep. The temple is likened to the trees from which wood was used in its construction. The gods and functions of the temple are described and praised during temple dedication with different parts of the temple described: its interior and exterior appearance, its gate, courtyard, door and walls. The hymn ends on the conclusion to approach the temple.|$|E
50|$|The term 'blood libel' {{can also}} refer to any {{unpleasant}} and damaging false accusation, {{and it has}} taken on <b>a</b> broader <b>metaphorical</b> meaning. However, this usage remains controversial {{and it has been}} protested against by Jewish groups.|$|R
5000|$|A {{novel of}} short stories by Italian writer Mario Soldati called Salmace (Salmacis), a title that spans the entire collection. In the story it tells of the {{transformation}} of a man into a woman, in <b>a</b> highly <b>metaphorical</b> context.|$|R

25|$|According to the Talmud, manna {{was found}} near {{the homes of}} those with strong belief in God, and far from the homes of those with doubts; indeed, one {{classical}} midrash says that manna was intangible to Gentiles, as it would inevitably slip from their hands. The Midrash Tanhuma holds that manna melted, formed liquid streams, was drunk by animals, flavored the animal flesh, and was thus indirectly eaten by Gentiles, this being {{the only way that}} Gentiles could taste manna. Despite these hints of uneven distribution, classical rabbinical literature expresses the view that manna fell in very large quantities each day. It holds that manna was layered out over 2,000 cubits square, between 50 and 60 cubits in height, enough to nourish the Israelites for 2,000 years and to be seen from the palaces of every king in the East and West. This is probably <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> statement.|$|E
25|$|Henry Gray {{wrote the}} {{original}} version of Gray's Anatomy with an audience of medical students and physicians in mind, especially surgeons. For many decades however, precisely because Gray's textbook became such a classic, successive editors made major efforts to preserve its position as possibly the most authoritative text on the subject in English. Toward this end, a long-term strategy {{appears to have been}} to make each edition come close to containing a fully comprehensive account of the anatomical medical understanding available at the time of publication. Given the explosion of medical knowledge in the 20th century, it is easily appreciated that this led to a vast expansion of the book, which threatened to collapse under its own weight in <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> and physical sense. From the 35th edition onward, increased efforts were made to reverse this trend and keep the book readable by students. Nevertheless, the 38th edition contained 2,092 pages in large format – the highest page count of any and an increase from the 35th edition, which had 1,471 pages. The current 41st edition has 1,584 pages.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, M. E. Lamb {{suggested}} that the play may have borrowed {{an aspect of the}} ancient myth of Theseus: the Athenian's entry into the Labyrinth of the Minotaur. The woods of the play serve as <b>a</b> <b>metaphorical</b> labyrinth, and for Elizabethans the woods were often an allegory of sexual sin. The lovers in the woods conquer irrational passion and find their way back. Bottom with his animal head becomes a comical version of the Minotaur. Bottom also becomes Ariadne's thread which guides the lovers. In having the new Minotaur rescue rather than threaten the lovers, the classical myth is comically inverted. Theseus himself is the bridegroom of the play who has left the labyrinth and promiscuity behind, having conquered his passion. The artisans may stand in for the master craftsman of the myth, and builder of the Labyrinth, Daedalus. Even Theseus' best known speech in the play, which connects the poet with the lunatic and the lover may be another metaphor of the lover. It is a challenge for the poet to confront the irrationality he shares with lovers and lunatics, accepting the risks of entering the labyrinth.|$|E
