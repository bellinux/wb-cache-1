5|$|In {{spite of}} the doubts {{highlighted}} {{in relation to the}} construction of a synagogue, the Perushim, confidently in possession of the ambiguous firman, began clearing away the rubble from the Ruin courtyard in September 1836. As the foundations of he-Hasid's original synagogue were revealed, they discovered <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>old</b> documents dating from 1579, signed by Israel ben Moses Najara. After much debate, they decided not to rebuild the Ruin, but initially erect a small structure {{on the edge of the}} Ashkenasic compound. The Arab creditors, however, still refused to relinquish the claims they had on the Jews and continued to interfere with the works. Zoref, claiming that the Ashkenazim currently in Jerusalem were not related in any way to those who had borrowed the money at the turn of the 18th century, was forced to appear in court requesting a further ruling cancelling the debts. He mentioned that an injunction had already been passed that absolved the Ashkenazim from repaying the debt and maintained that the Turkish Statute of Limitations cancelled out the debts of Judah heHasid's followers. Although the court ruled in the Ashkenazim's favour, Zoref nevertheless had to appease the Arab instigators with annual bribes in order to allow building to continue. At some point this arrangement ceased and in 1851, he was struck on the head with a sword and died of his wounds three months later. By January 1837 however, the Perushim had dedicated the modest Menachem Zion Synagogue in the northwestern corner of the courtyard. In 1854, a second smaller synagogue was built within the compound. The actual plot upon which he-Hasid's synagogue had stood 130 years earlier, however, remained in ruins.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the British remaining in the region, several states also held competing claims on the future state of Michigan. In 1779, Virginia established Illinois County with boundaries that encompassed all of the land east of the Mississippi River, north of the Ohio River and west of the Appalachian Mountains. For all practical purposes, however, the county government never exercised actual control beyond an area limited to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>old</b> French settlements along the major rivers. The {{overwhelming majority of the}} northwestern lands were controlled by the native tribes. New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts also claimed portions of what was to become Michigan, but were even less able to enforce their pretensions, given Britain's control of the Great Lakes and the hostility of the tribes.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} days battle the Persians had either inflicted massive {{casualties}} on Astyages' personal guard that {{was made up of}} cavalry, or the rest of his army that was also cavalry. Nevertheless, the Persians still claimed victory the first day. The second day of the battle Cyrus, assuming the battle had ended, secretly retired south {{with the rest of the}} armed forces, while only Cambyses and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>old</b> men remained in the city. When Cyrus was forced to fight again, Astyages' ingenious move of cavalry occurred, which was aimed at capturing the poorly guarded city. As he was assuming the battle had not ended, he easily captured the city, while only Cambyses is reported to have been wounded and later died. It is debated among today's historians if the second day is to be counted as part of the original battle, or that it should be counted as a separate battle. As the Persians retired south, Astyages readily abandoned the city, which is based partly on the scant sources from Nicolaus, therefore not becoming a complete victory for Astyages, as he is not known to put a garrison there after he and his forces went south after the Persians. It was however a psychological blow to the Medes as they thought the Persians were lucky in the first battle, but again the Persians won, this time tactically. Both armies later went back to their camps and organized their armies while deciding where to meet for the next fight. Then as the year passed, both forces agreed to meet at the Persian capital which Astyages wished to capture.|$|E

500|$|Old cultivars {{are often}} oddly shaped, russeted, {{and have a}} variety of textures and colors.

500|$|Coward was {{homosexual}} but, {{following the}} convention of his times, this was never publicly mentioned.

No private considerations have been allowed to deflect the drive of his career; like Gielgud and Rattigan, like the late Ivor Novello, he is a congenital bachelor." [...] Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering [...] "any sexual activities when over-advertised" [...] to be tasteless. Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, [...] "There are still <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>old</b> ladies in Worthing who don't know." [...] Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.|$|E
500|$|Following the 1927 renumbering, Route 37 {{existed in}} two {{separate}} sections, one running from downtown Trenton to the White Horse Circle, concurrent with U.S. Route 206, and one running from Route 40 (now Route 70) in Lakehurst to Point Pleasant. [...] The remainder of the route between White Horse and Lakehurst remained incomplete.

In addition, some maps labeled these routes as being part of Route 37. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 37 was legislated to run along its current alignment from Route 70 in Lakehurst to Route 35 in Seaside Heights. The number was dropped between Trenton and White Horse in favor of U.S. Route 206, while the section between Seaside Heights and Point Pleasant became a realignment of Route 35.|$|E

The construction of the Parade Ground required demolition of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>old</b> buildings and cornfields. The Parade Ground was immediately used by the National Guard for brigade practice, replacing the parade ground of Prospect Park. [...] The ground received unspecified [...] "improvements" [...] in 1893–1894. With the city's approval, particularly overgrown areas of the property were made passable. Wide walking paths were built over original walkways, including the thin paths {{that led to the}} Van Cortlandt family cemetery, high on the nearby bluffs.

500|$|Plant life {{along the}} trail is varied. The trail passes through several {{different}} biomes from south to north, and the climate changes significantly, particularly dependent upon elevation. In the south, lowland forests consist mainly of second-growth; nearly the entire trail has been logged {{at one time or}} another. There are, however, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>old</b> growth locations {{along the trail}}, such as Sages Ravine straddling the Massachusetts-Connecticut border and atop higher peaks along the trail {{on either side of the}} same border, the Hopper (a glacial cirque westward of the trail as it traverses Mt. Greylock in Massachusetts), and [...] "The Hermitage", near Gulf Hagas in Maine. In the south, the forest is dominated by hardwoods, including oak and tulip trees, also known as yellow poplar. Farther north, tulip trees are gradually replaced by maples and birches. Oaks begin to disappear in Massachusetts. By Vermont, the lowland forest is made up of maples, birch and beech, which provide spectacular foliage displays for hikers in September and October. While the vast majority of lowland forest south of the White Mountains is hardwood, many areas have some coniferous trees as well, and in Maine, these often grow at low elevations.|$|E
