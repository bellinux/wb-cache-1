5000|$|On February 7, 2012, the {{three-judge panel}} ruled 2-1 {{in favor of}} the plaintiffs, declaring Proposition 8 unconstitutional. Reinhardt {{authored}} the majority opinion and Judge Smith filed a dissent on the constitutional issue while concurring that the defendant-intervenors had the standing to appeal and that Judge Walker's ruling should not be denied. In describing the issue before the court, Reinhardt said the usage of the word [...] "marriage" [...] was what was at stake, not any substantive legal rights: [...] "Because under California statutory law, same-sex couples had all the rights of opposite-sex couples, regardless of their marital status, all parties agree that Proposition 8 had one effect only. It stripped same-sex couples of the ability they previously possessed to obtain from the State, or any other authorized party, an important right—the right to obtain and use the designation of 'marriage' to describe their relationships. Nothing more, nothing less." [...] The decision was made on narrow grounds, although Reinhardt wrote that [...] "were we unable... to resolve the matter on the basis we do, we would not hesitate to proceed to the broader question - the constitutionality of denying same-sex couples the right to marry", and that in their decision the only facts that mattered are in fact <b>adjudicative</b> <b>facts</b> capable of being proper findings, about the parties and their actions and motives, and facts conceded by the defendants, and therefore the standard of review became irrelevant in the appeal.|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to show that rules of {{evidence}} are often unworkable in s.   1  Canadian Charter cases. A survey reveals that courts tend to use these rules selectively when a party attempts to demonstrably justify a reasonable limit to a guaranteed right or freedom. A parallel is made with the Supreme Court of Canada's flexibility in admitting extrinsic material in constitutional references. American law is useful in that it establishes the key distinction between <b>adjudicative</b> <b>facts</b> and legislative facts. Rules of evidence apply only to the former category. Legislative facts correspond to facts needed for a s. 1 demonstration. It should be recognized in Canada that rules of evidence are inapplicable to such facts because of the specific purpose and importance of judicial reasoning in Charter cases...|$|E

40|$|The United States 2 ̆ 7 {{commitment}} to adversarial justice is {{a defining feature of}} its legal system. Standing doctrine, for example, {{is supposed to}} ensure that courts can rely on adverse parties to present the facts courts need to resolve disputes. Although the U. S. legal system generally lives up to this adversarial ideal, it sometimes does not. Appellate courts often look outside the record the parties developed before the trial court, turning instead to their own independent research and to factual claims in amicus briefs. This deviation from the adversarial process is an important respect in which the nation 2 ̆ 7 s adversarial commitment is more myth than reality. This myth is problematic for many reasons, including the fact that it obscures the extent to which some of the most significant cases the Supreme Court decides, such as Citizens United v. FEC, rely upon 2 ̆ 2 facts 2 ̆ 2 that have not been subjected to rigorous adversarial testing. The adversarial myth exists because the U. S. legal system 2 ̆ 7 s current procedures were designed to address adjudicative facts-facts particularly within the legislative facts-more general facts {{about the state of the}} world. Recognizing knowledge of the parties-but many cases turn instead on this distinction between <b>adjudicative</b> and legislative <b>facts</b> helps identify those cases in which existing practices undermine, rather than promote, adversarial justice. This Article concludes with suggestions for reform, including liberalizing standing doctrine when legislative facts are at issue. If courts are going to turn to nonparties for help in resolving disputes of legislative fact, it is better that they be brought into the process earlier so the factual claims they offer can be rigorously tested...|$|R
40|$|Eyewitness {{testimony}} is widely {{held to be}} the most powerful and pervasive type of evidence routinely introduced into courts of law and the most important source of evidence leading to conviction. The aim of the current research was {{to address the issue of}} eyewitness testimony in the British legal system. Specifically, the research was designed to examine contemporary understanding of the potential limitations of eyewitness memory and to compare the Cognitive Interview with the 'standard' British police interview. The survey of opinion about the limitations of eyewitness memory included all those groups involved in the legal process; police investigators, solicitors, barristers and members of the public (potential eyewitnesses and jurors). The major findings from this survey were that there was considerable lack of awareness of the actual implications of <b>adjudicative</b> <b>facts</b> that bear on the reliability of eyewitness testimony, and that solicitors and barristers were more in tune with findings of empirical research than were police officers. Investigation of the Cognitive Interview and its constituent parts failed to replicate the extremely positive results reported in the body of previous research by the interview authors, Fisher and Geiselman: significant and consistent enhancement effects were not typically found. The practical and theoretical explanations of these findings are discussed with particular reference to the importance of the method of training and the recent developments of the Cognitive Interview...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the {{concern over the}} state of deportation proceedings in the United States. Professor Kidane argues {{that a lack of}} formal rules of procedure and evidence is the main factor contributing to the unpredictability, and inconsistency inherent in our system of immigration law. The argument is placed in context by reviewing the growth of the administrative agencies up through the adoption of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Kidane notes that the APA embodies one approach as a compromise between those advocating strict formal rules of procedure and evidence and those supporting a more relaxed system for administrative proceedings. However, Professor Kidane continues by stating that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) effectively made many of the evidentiary and procedural provisions of the APA inapplicable to immigration proceedings. Kidane argues that, by adopting more relaxed evidentiary standards and informal procedural rules, the INA violates basic principles of due process and fundamental fairness; resulting in a system that lacks uniformity and integrity. After reviewing the main problems inherent in the INA 2 ̆ 7 s lax evidentiary standards, such as free admission of hearsay and administrative notice of <b>adjudicative</b> <b>facts,</b> Professor Kidane argues that important lessons could be learned from the more formal system of evidentiary and procedural rules adopted by the Department of Labor (DOL). By noting the similarity between DOL proceedings and deportation proceedings, Kidane draws the conclusion that the DOL provisions would make a good substitute for the rules currently in place in the immigration arena. Professor Kidane concludes by arguing that these formal rules must be adopted for deportation proceedings in order to restore integrity and predictability to the system...|$|E
40|$|Judicial reasons {{often include}} general {{statements}} {{about the nature and}} behaviour of people and institutions {{and the nature of the}} world and society. These statements might be called social facts ('SF') and are made as part of judicial development and general application of law. The presence of SF statements in judicial reasoning in Australian cases has been acknowledged by commentators and judges. However, there has been little empirical examination of this phenomenon. This article discusses a content analysis study of SF in negligence cases in the Australian High Court. This study confirms that judges do refer to SF in their judicial reasoning and that SF play a range of roles in judicial reasoning. This includes predicting social, economic and behavioural consequences of legal rules, as part of setting a context or background to judicial reasons, and as a tool to evaluate <b>adjudicative</b> <b>facts.</b> SF do not generally dominate judicial reasoning. However, they appear to have a significant role to play in certain complex and more important cases. While there were overall commonalities in the way judges used SF, some individual differences between judges emerged. Judges do not use SF in all cases in the same way. Judges referred to SF more in high significance cases, and cases with multiple separate judgments. Judges also referred to SF more in single and dissenting judgments than in joint and majority judgments. Most SF referred to by judges were not sourced or referenced in any way and reference to empirical research was very rare. Where a source or reference for a SF was given by a judge it was usually to a legal source. Most SF appeared to source from judicial 'common sense ' with the potential dangers this brings to the accuracy and legitimacy of judicial reasoning...|$|E
