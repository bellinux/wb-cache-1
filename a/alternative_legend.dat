5000|$|There are <b>alternatives</b> <b>legends</b> {{that attempt}} to explain {{the origin of this}} enigmatic sculpture. Some of these legends say that the image of Christ of La Laguna was sculpted by angels and even by the Evangelist Saint Luke.

When Baiju {{returned}} home, he was shocked to find his entirely family gone. He became a mendicant, and wandered from place to place, looking for his beloved adopted grandchild Meera. People {{thought of him as}} an insane person, and thus, he {{came to be known as}} [...] "bawra". (<b>Alternative</b> <b>legends</b> say that he came to be known as [...] "Bawra", because he was obsessed with classical music.) ...|$|R

5000|$|An <b>alternative</b> <b>legend</b> has it {{that its}} breast was {{scorched}} fetching water for souls in Purgatory. The association with Christmas more probably arises {{from the fact that}} postmen in Victorian Britain wore red jackets and were nicknamed [...] "Robins"; the robin featured on the Christmas card is an emblem of the postman delivering the card.|$|E
50|$|A local legend {{states that}} the city is named after Dandelappa, a local deity, a servant of the Mirashi landlords, who lost his life because of his loyalty.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{use of the}} comitium as {{a political}} assembly area, along with the beginnings of Rome itself, is blurred between legend and archaeological discovery. The traditional stories of King Servius Tullius and Romulus have many similarities regarding {{the origins of the}} Comitia, leading Romulus to be often interpreted as a copy of Tullius. Both were closely related to the god Vulcan, played a role in organizing the comitia, and were depicted as founders of Rome. Other conflicting, or [...] "duel" [...] mythologies include the supposed tomb of Romulus, who was struck and killed during the Sabine conflict and was buried under the Vulcanal. <b>Alternative</b> <b>legends</b> state that he was only wounded and that spot was where Faustulus was killed separating the twins during combat. Many of the legends themselves transferred to the comitum from the Palatine. For example, the pomeriam where Remus is said to have slept as well as the Ficus Ruminalis and the sculpture of the she-wolf suckling the twins have competing legends. The original Palatine settlement, the Roma Quatrata, contained the relics of Romulus. An extension of the square city is seen in the [...] "Septimontium", the original seven hills. Ancient stories suggest that Tarpeia was drawing water from a spring here when she saw Tatius for the first time.|$|R

50|$|An <b>alternative</b> <b>legend</b> has {{the dragon}} outwitted {{by a local}} farmer's boy, called Jim Pulk or Jim Puttock, said in some {{versions}} to be from Wick, after the Mayor of Arundel offered a reward. He killed the dragon by cooking it a giant poisoned pie, which he took to the knuckerhole on a horse and cart. The dragon ate up pie, horse and cart. When it had expired the boy returned and cut off its head. In some versions he then dies himself, probably of the same poison he used on the dragon, though this is possibly a later addition designed to explain the Slayer's Slab.|$|E
5000|$|A similar legend {{applies to}} Dun Cow Rib Farm in Halfpenny Lane, Whittingham, Lancashire, {{just outside the}} town of Longridge. Embedded in its wall is a large rib, {{supposedly}} from a giant dun cow that gave milk freely to all comers, but died of shock when an old witch asked it to fill a riddle (sieve) instead of a pail. An <b>alternative</b> <b>legend</b> claims that the giant cow's milk saved the local inhabitants from the Plague, and it was buried at nearby Cow Hill, near Grimsargh. It was also claimed that the cow would quench its thirst at [...] "Nick's Water-Pot", a well on the summit of Parlick. In reality, the rib is probably from a whale or Bronze Age aurochs.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, an <b>alternative</b> <b>legend</b> {{about its}} {{manufacture}} {{is that it}} was built by a local blacksmith for the siege of Threave Castle in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. According to this tale, which was lent credence by Sir Walter Scott, when King James arrived at Threave to besiege the Earl of Douglas, the Clan MacLellan presented him with this bombard. The first shot fired is said to have passed clean through the castle, severing the hand of Margaret, Countess of Douglas on the way. The gun was subsequently named after [...] "Mollance", the lands gifted to the blacksmith for his service, and [...] "Meg", the name of his wife. Later historians have not taken this legend particularly seriously, not least because of the improbability that such a weapon could be forged by a village smith.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 69 - 70). The purpose of this research was to identify English-phics. legend signs which have a low comprehension level among native Spanish-speaking drivers in Texas border areas and to develop and evaluate alternative Spanish and English legends for each sign. To accomplish these objectives, passenger car driver and truck driver surveys were conducted at selected international bridge crossings along the Texas-Mexico border. Researchers showed drivers a set of standard or alternative highway signs and asked what they thought each sign meant. Comparisons were then made between the comprehension level (the percentage of correct responses) of the standard sign and the comprehension level of each alternative. With respect to the signs tested in the passenger car driver survey, none of the alternatives to the STOP FOR SCHOOL BUS LOADING OR UNLOADING standard sign proved to be better than the standard sign. In contrast, all three of the alternatives to the FASTEN SAFETY BELTS-STATE LAW standard sign were statistically significantly better than the standard sign. Of these, the PONGASE EL CINTURON DE SEGURIDAD-LEY ESTATAL legend is recommended for use in the Texas border area. For the RIGHT LANEENDS standard sign, none of the alternatives showed a statistically significant improvement in comprehension among border drivers. For the signs evaluated in the truck driver survey (the WEIGH STATION-NEXT RIGHT-OPEN standard sign, the WEIGHT LIMIT- 10 TONS standard sign, and the LOAD ZONED BRIDGE standard sign), at least one of Spanish-legend alternatives developed for each sign proved to be statistically better than the standard sign. However, none of the <b>alternative</b> <b>legends</b> for any of the signs had comprehension levels high enough to recommend their use...|$|R

In 1953 they traveled to France to review his preliminary maquette. The story of Frances’s polite resistance to Matisse’s first cut-out design and how she persuaded the artist to provide <b>alternatives</b> is now <b>legend.</b> Matisse eventually created a 12-by-11-foot ceramic-tile wall mural for the courtyard.

50|$|William Tell (German: Wilhelm Tell) is a 1934 German-Swiss {{historical}} film {{directed by}} Heinz Paul and starring Hans Marr, Conrad Veidt and Emmy Göring. It {{is based on}} the 1804 play William Tell by Friedrich Schiller about the Swiss folk hero William Tell. It was made in Germany by Terra Film, with a separate English-language version supervised by Manning Haynes also being released. While working on the film Veidt, who had recently given sympathetic performances of Jews in Jew Suss (1934) and The Wandering Jew, was detained by the authorities. It was only after pressure from the British Foreign Office that he was eventually released. It is also known by the <b>alternative</b> title The <b>Legend</b> of William Tell.|$|R
5000|$|Various legends exist {{about the}} saint. One legend says after the ibadah (act of {{obedience}} and submission) of 36 years {{standing in the}} water in River Chenab near Chiniot , Pakistan, {{he was awarded the}} status of [...] "Bu Ali" [...] (Fragrance of Ali). After achieving this Rutba (rank) he was visited by many other Sufi saints. An <b>alternative</b> <b>legend</b> to explain his name says that Muhammad appeared to him in a dream and offered him a wish. The Qalandar asked for prophethood and was told that all positions have been filled and Muhammad was the last one. He asked to be Ali and was told that position was also filled. He then asked for at least the fragrance of Ali and that wish was granted. In fact, a proper scholarly view of his name is that Bu Ali is simply another abbreviated form of the Kuniyyat Abu Ali.|$|E
5000|$|Just {{outside the}} town of Longridge, within the parish of Whittingham, lies Halfpenny Lane [...] , so named because of a toll charged to cattle drovers for an {{overnight}} stay. Dun Cow Rib Farm {{was built on the}} lane by Adam Hoghton in 1616, and contains embedded in its wall a large rib. According to legend, the rib came from a giant [...] "dun cow" [...] which roamed the area {{at the time of the}} Plague, and whose milk saved the local inhabitants, and was buried at nearby Cow Hill, near Grimsargh. An <b>alternative</b> <b>legend</b> claims that the cow gave milk freely to all comers, but died of shock when an old witch asked it to fill a riddle (sieve) instead of a pail. In reality, the rib is probably from a whale or Bronze Age aurochs. With reference to the rib from the Great Dun Cow, a rib bone was also to be found at Grimsargh Hall Farm.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the legend}} {{related to this}} Taktsang (which in Tibetan {{language}} is spelt [...] (stag tshang) which literally means [...] "Tiger's lair", {{it is believed that}} Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche) flew to this location from Tibet {{on the back of a}} tigress from Khenpajong. This place was consecrated to tame the Tiger demon. An <b>alternative</b> <b>legend</b> holds that a former wife of an emperor, known as Yeshe Tsogyal, willingly became a disciple of Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambahva) in Tibet. She transformed herself into a tigress and carried the Guru on her back from Tibet to the present location of the Taktsang in Bhutan. In one of the caves here, the Guru then performed meditation and emerged in eight incarnated forms (manifestations) and the place became holy. Subsequently, the place came to be known as the “Tiger's Nest”. The popular legend of the Taktsang monastery is further embellished with the story of Tenzin Rabgye, who built the temple here in 1692. It has been mentioned by authors that the 8th century guru Padmasmabhava had reincarnated again in the form of Tenzin Rabgye. The corroborative proofs mooted are: that Tenzin Rabgye was seen (by his friends) concurrently inside and outside his cave; even a small quantity of food was adequate to feed all visitors; no one was injured during worship (in spite of the approach track to the monastery being dangerous and slippery); and the people of the Paro valley saw in the sky various animal forms and religious symbols including a shower of flowers that appeared and also vanished in the air without touching the earth.|$|E

[...] The New York Times likewise gave it {{a positive}} review and stated: [...] "With reverberations and a choral backdrop straight out of Seal, it’s his only overreach. Mr. Legend is more charming one-on-one." [...] The Village Voice also gave it a favorable review and stated: [...] "As the dying industry is still breathing in the toxins of useless filler, patrons like John Legend are fully indulging their creativity in all its flawed glory, just like the soul giants of yesteryear." [...] AllHipHop likewise gave it a positive review and stated: [...] "Even if Evolver is less cohesive due to the integration of the Pop sound to the <b>alternative</b> styles <b>Legend</b> played around with in Once Again, it still is light years ahead of any artist mimicking his suave persona."

5000|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, states began to specify a {{mechanical}} stop signal arm which the driver would swing {{out from the}} left side of the bus to warn traffic of a stop in progress. The portion of the stop arm protruding in front of traffic was initially a trapezoidal shape with [...] painted on it. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 131 regulates the specifications of the stop arm as a double-faced regulation octagonal red stop sign at least 45 cm across, with white border and uppercase legend. It must be retroreflective and/or equipped with alternately flashing red lights. As an <b>alternative,</b> the [...] <b>legend</b> itself may also flash; this is commonly achieved with red LEDs.

One stop signal arm is required; a second may also be installed. The second stop arm, when it is present, is usually mounted near the rear of the bus, and is not permitted to bear a [...] or any other legend on the side facing forward when deployed.|$|R
