30|$|In Fig.  9 <b>a,</b> the <b>anomalies</b> of the {{standardized}} residuals can be separated into five periods, namely <b>anomalies</b> <b>A</b> 1 –A 5. <b>Anomalies</b> <b>A</b> 1 –A 4 were positive values, {{which meant that}} the observed values were higher than the modeled values. <b>Anomaly</b> <b>A</b> 5 was a negative value, which indicated that the model overestimated {{the influence of the}} environmental parameters for the corresponding period. In Fig.  9 b, the time series of the daily average of the environmental parameters that were included in the model are shown. Comparing Fig.  9 <b>a</b> and b, <b>anomalies</b> <b>A</b> 1 –A 5 frequently corresponded to variations in the environmental parameters. For example, the decreases in barometric pressure coincided with the peaks of the anomalies of the residuals for <b>anomalies</b> <b>A</b> 1, A 4, and A 5. The increases in wind speed were simultaneously observed with the anomaly peaks for <b>anomalies</b> <b>A</b> 1, A 2, A 4, and A 5. Variations in air temperature, soil temperature, and soil humidity sometimes coincided with the anomaly peaks. Among the environmental parameters in the model, wind speed and barometric pressure were the most effective parameters when viewed in light of their coefficients of the model and their numbers of digits (Table  3). Thus, we compared <b>anomalies</b> <b>A</b> 1 –A 5 with the time series of wind speed and barometric pressure {{as well as with the}} volcanic activities.|$|R

5|$|A {{public enquiry}} {{was held in}} 1873, to {{determine}} whether it would be advantageous for the city to be administered by a municipal corporation.

Something of <b>an</b> <b>anomaly,</b> the Parliamentary Boundary Commission of 1868 had decided that the urban parts of Fletton and Woodston were so involved in Peterborough that they ought to be in the borough and added the newly built-up portions of these parishes to the parliamentary constituency. In local matters they were still in Huntingdonshire and, as the City of Peterborough did not extend south of the River Nene, the full title of the new municipality was the City and Borough of Peterborough and its inhabitants, citizens and burgesses.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, by compromising CIA methods, Ames {{enabled the}} KGB and its successor, the SVR, to filter feed {{material}} to the CIA from 1986 to 1993. In 1987, KGB agent Aleksandr Zhomov offered to sell the CIA intelligence on how the Soviets had detected and arrested the CIA's agents. The SE Division accepted Zhomov and assigned him the cryptonym GTPROLOGUE. Zhomov, who was actually a Soviet double agent assigned to protect Ames, furnished fake documents ascribing the CIA's agent losses to superior KGB surveillance and luck. He then told the CIA that he would identify upcoming KGB plants, but only {{on the condition that}} the CIA treat them as genuine, lest the KGB discover the leak and arrest him. The fake agents soon overwhelmed Moscow Station's resources, and Zhomov disappeared in July 1990 after receiving payment from the U.S. The spurious sources and the disinformation they provided reportedly convinced the CIA that the 1985–1986 debacle was <b>an</b> <b>anomaly,</b> thus protecting Ames. Other genuine CIA agents were compromised by the Soviets, who used them to feed false intelligence back to the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Moving on to 300 AF Cocoon, {{the pair}} find Snow {{fighting}} a giant paradox-fueled monster that is dissolving the crystal pillar. After resolving the paradox, which delays {{the fall of}} Cocoon until 500 AF, Snow disappears again as <b>an</b> <b>anomaly</b> from another time. The pair {{then go to the}} city of Academia on Gran Pulse in 400 AF where they are attacked by the city's AI, which claims they were killed in 200 AF. Traveling to 200 AF, they discover a paradox whereby a man-made fal'Cie meant to re-levitate Cocoon was able to turn on its creators using the AI that designed it and take over the government. Resolving the paradox, Noel and Serah travel to an alternative 400 AF Academia. In this world, the pair find Hope and Alyssa again, who had put themselves in stasis. They explain their new plan to mechanically float a new Cocoon to hold humanity, which Serah and Noel help with before heading to 500 AF Academia. They are betrayed by Alyssa (revealed to be a living paradox doomed to disappear in the corrected timeline) and trapped by Caius in dream-worlds. Before being trapped, Serah meets the spirit of Yeul, who explains that she is the seeress of Paddra, continually reincarnated throughout history, while Caius is her immortal guardian, gifted with Etro's own heart.|$|E
