40|$|Significant {{changes in}} vehicle loads have {{occurred}} in China due {{to the development of}} the automobile industry and transportation within the past two decades, particularly the rapid increase in traffic flow and the large-scale emergence of heavy trucks. However, research into vehicle loadings on urban bridges is not well developed. In this study, based on traffic flow data collected using a weigh-in-motion system installed on an expressway in an urban logistics zone, we analyzed the traffic flow, vehicle types, and gross vehicle weight (GVW) features and developed models for the vehicle load and fatigue load. According to the <b>axle</b> <b>space,</b> <b>axle</b> types, and axle number, the trucks in the traffic flow were classified into 10 representative vehicle types. The probability distribution of the GVW was fitted to a three-class mixed log-normal distribution. Using the improved Gumbel method, we determined the extreme value distribution of the vehicle loadings in the purpose reference period and assessed the vehicle loadings of urban bridges. In addition, using the equivalent damage theory, six equivalent vehicle models were established according to the measurements of the axle weight and <b>axle</b> <b>space,</b> thereby obtaining a simplified model of fatigue vehicle loadings on urban expressway bridges...|$|R

The paper justifies a relevance of the synthesis of new kinds of engagement with the simplified geometry of the contacting condition. A typical solution for powered mechanisms received by F. L. Livinin and his disciples is characterized. The paper describes {{the arrangement of the}} coordinate systems used to obtain the function of the position of the gear-powered transmission consisting of two wheels with fifteen leads. For them, also the coordinates of the contact points are obtained, and errors of function of the position in tooth changeover are calculated. To obtain the function position was used a method of matrix transformation and equality of radius and unit normal vectors at the contact point. This transmission can be used in mechanical and instrumentation engineering, and other sectors of the economy. Both reducers and multipliers can be made on its basis. It has high manufacturability (with no special equipment required for its production), and a displacement function is close to linear. This article describes the influence of the <b>axle</b> <b>spacing</b> error {{on the quality of the}} transmission characteristics. The paper presents the graphic based relationships and tabular estimates for nominal <b>axle</b> <b>spacing</b> and offsets within ï‚± 0. 2 mm. This error of <b>axle</b> <b>spacing</b> is significant for gearing. From the results of this work we can say that the transmission is almost insensitive to errors of <b>axle</b> <b>spacing.</b> Engagement occurs without an exit of contact point on the lead edge. To solve the obtained system of equations, the numerical methods of the software MathCAD package have been applied. In the future, the authors expect to consider other possible manufacturing and mounting errors of gear-powered transmission (such as the error of the step, misalignment, etc.) to assess their impact on the quality of engagement. </p...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, {{weigh-in-motion}} (WIM) sensors {{have been used in}} the United States to collect vehicle weight data for designing pavements and monitoring their performance. The use of these sensors is now being expanded for enforcement purposes to provide virtual weigh stations for screening vehicles in traffic streams for overweight violations. A study found that static weigh stations in Indiana were effective for identifying safety violations, but ineffective for identifying overweight vehicles. It was also determined that the alternative approach to identifying overweight vehicles using virtual weigh stations requires a high level of WIM data accuracy and reliability that can only be attained with a rigorous quality control program. Accurate WIM data is also essential {{to the success of the}} Long-term Pavement Performance project and the development of new pavement design methods. This dissertation proposes a quality control program that addresses vehicle classification, speed, <b>axle</b> <b>spacing,</b> and weight accuracy by identifying robust metrics that can be continuously monitored using statistical process control procedures that differentiate between sensor noise and events that require intervention. The speed and <b>axle</b> <b>spacing</b> accuracy is assessed by examining the drive tandem <b>axle</b> <b>spacing</b> of the population of Class 9 vehicles. The weight accuracy is assessed by examining the left-right steer axle residual weight of the population of Class 9 vehicles. Data mining of these metrics revealed variations in the data caused by incorrect calibration, sensor failure, temperature, and precipitation. The accuracy metrics could be implemented in a performance-based specification for WIM systems that is more feasible to enforce than the current specifications based on comparing static vehicle weights with dynamic vehicle weights measured by the WIM sensors. The quality control program can also be used by agencies to prioritize maintenance to more effectively allocate the limited funds available for sensor repair and calibration. This research provides a tool that agencies can use to obtain and sustain higher quality WIM data. ...|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{classification}} {{techniques were}} evaluated {{using data from}} a 1993 investigation of the traffic flow patterns on I- 20 in Georgia. First we improved the data by sifting through the data base, checking against the original video for questionable events and removing and/or repairing questionable events. We used this data base to critique the performance quantitatively of a classification method known as Scheme F. As a context for improving the approach, we show in this paper that scheme F can be represented as a McCullogh-Pitts neural network, oar as an equivalent decomposition of the plane. We found that Scheme F, among other things, severely misrepresents the number of vehicles in Class 3 by labeling them as Class 2. After discussing the basic classification problem {{in terms of what}} is measured, and what is the desired prediction goal, we set forth desirable characteristics of the classification scheme and describe a recurrent neural network system that partitions the high dimensional space up into bins for each axle separation. the collection of bin numbers, one for each of the axle separations, specifies a region in the <b>axle</b> <b>space</b> called a hyper-bin. All the vehicles counted that have the same set of in numbers are in the same hyper-bin. The probability of the occurrence of a particular class in that hyper- bin is the relative frequency with which that class occurs in that set of bin numbers. This type of algorithm produces classification results that are much more balanced and uniform with respect to Classes 2 and 3 and Class 10. In particular, the cancellation of errors of classification that occurs is for many applications the ideal classification scenario. The neural network results are presented {{in the form of a}} primary classification network and a reclassification network, the performance matrices for which are presented...|$|R

This research identifies and develops a new methodology and algorithm to explore the accuracy of each station 2 Ì† 7 s weight and spacing data at a corridor level, and further implements the Statistical Process Control (SPC) method, finite mixture model, <b>axle</b> <b>spacing</b> error rating method, and data flag method in published research to examine the soundness of WIM systems. This research employs the historical WIM data to analyze sensor health and compares the evaluation results of the methods. The results suggest the new triangulation method identified most possible WIM malfunctions that other methods sensed, and this method unprecedentedly monitors the process behavior with controls of time and meteorological variables. The SPC method appeared superior in differentiating between sensor noises and sensor errors or drifts, but it drew wrong conclusions when accurate WIM data reference was absent. The <b>axle</b> <b>spacing</b> error rating method cannot check the essential weight data in special cases, but reliable loop sensor evaluation results were arrived at by employing this multiple linear regression model. The results of the data flag method and the finite mixed model results were not accurate, thus they {{could be used as}} additional tools to complement the data quality evaluation results. Overall, these data quality analysis results are the valuable sources for examining the early detection of system malfunctions, sensor drift, etc., and allow the WIM operators to correct the situation on time before large amounts of measurement are lost...|$|E
