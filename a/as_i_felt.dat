500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network. As Hurwitz explained, [...] "I had taken it as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> I could as a series. I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where I {{think a lot of the}} actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, [...] "If there's a way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd be up for it".|$|E
2500|$|Almost as a {{reaction}} to the seemingly endless studio sessions surrounding God's Foot, Hatfield recorded the album Bed in 1998 in six days, about which she says on her website: [...] "It sounds as raw <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt.</b> It has no pretty sheen. The mistakes and unattractive parts were left in, not erased. Just like my career. Just like life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, he {{was cast}} as Angela Channing's (Jane Wyman) lawyer Greg Reardon in {{the soap opera}} Falcon Crest, without {{requiring}} an audition. MacCorkindale asked for the character, originally an American named Brad, to be rewritten as English, and also directed one episode. He rejected a contract extension after appearing in 59 episodes and left the series in 1986 because he [...] "felt that the work I was doing was fun and lucrative but not as stretching <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> I wanted or needed. I also was finding fault {{with much of the}} work, not only Falcon Crest, but everything. I was actually ready to quit acting and try producing so I could put myself on the line." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> such a shudder <b>as</b> <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> {{before or since}} and hope I shall never feel again.|$|R
60|$|I {{brought the}} tongs <b>as</b> well. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like it. Old Bill {{collared}} the knife. We crept downstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks to you, Francisco, that I am {{not lying}} there beside them," [...] the {{merchant}} said. [...] "I {{did not know}} that you were so close at hand, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> slipped <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that my end had come." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{we looked}} full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my {{strong desire to}} get {{something}} out of him. And <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that it came quicker, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.|$|E
60|$|THE COUNT. She {{will never}} return to Venice. I feel now <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> when the Campanile fell.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked from}} one to the other. I have no doubt that I looked as bewildered <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> an indescribable woolen such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{had never}} <b>felt</b> ... Excessive joy is more devastating than deep sorrow... Parlichev ...|$|R
60|$|I {{am afraid}} it was hypocritical in me, but seeing that my aunt felt {{strongly}} on the subject, I {{tried to look}} <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> strongly too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{what you}} say is as natural to me <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it," [...] said Dale. [...] "I wondered. You're {{certainly}} full of fire, An', Helen, what do you say?" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{face grew}} cold <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the blood leave it. At that moment mention of George Wright fixed once {{for all my}} hate of him.|$|E
60|$|She felt, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> the {{imperative}} necessity of saying {{anything that might}} soothe him. At a sign from me she gave him her promise to return.|$|E
60|$|You see I am {{a pretty}} well-sized man myself, and, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{confidence}} in my strength, my stick, and the goodness of my cause, I was bold.|$|E
60|$|I beard a {{crunching}} of gravel. Even <b>as</b> <b>I</b> wheeled <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{a tremendous}} {{pull on the}} lasso and I seemed to be sailing in the air. I got a blurred glimpse of Herky-Jerky leaning back on the taut lasso. Then I plunged down, slid over the rocks, and went souse into the spring.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{gave one}} desperate {{bound to the}} right, and, my lame leg notwithstanding, I believe that few men {{could have made a}} better jump. At any rate, it was none too soon, for <b>as</b> <b>I</b> jumped <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the wind made by the {{tremendous}} downward stroke of the monster's trunk. Then I ran for it.|$|R
60|$|Oh, why had I come? I was mad. I cursed my weakness.... And, when I saw her {{standing}} there, cold and indifferent <b>as</b> ever, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> so furious a rage within me that I {{could have killed}} her. And <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sick with love....|$|R
6000|$|On that I had paused, and, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> myself {{still holding}} her, I was not {{surprised}} when my pause had an effect. [...] "You do let it go?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could see}} that the poor girl was near crying, and I resumed my chair without {{speaking}} and looked at her (I hope) as mildly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> towards her.|$|E
60|$|The Archduchess {{frowned upon}} me, and I {{was at once}} made {{conscious}} that I had fallen under her displeasure. I fancy, however, that I appeared <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> quite unimpressed.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> shuddered <b>as</b> he spoke: <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> his {{influence}} in my marrow--his hold on my limbs.|$|R
60|$|I {{left the}} room, feeling much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> {{at the station}} at Marseilles. I was not {{satisfied}} with him. I thought his conduct very strange.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>as</b> {{she spoke}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> rather than saw that this lady was searching {{me with her}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very, Ralph! I {{would rather}} go through twenty battles, again, than feel <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> when I saw you start, {{and thought that}} I should never see you again, alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} it is," [...] said I, doubtfully, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> within, that {{dissolving}} of airy visions which I have generally {{found the first}} sensation on visiting any celebrated object.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I did. I {{noticed her}} {{particularly}} because she seemed the only creature there who LOOKED as lonely and friendless <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>FELT.</b> I had YOU, {{but she had}} no one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I said <b>as</b> much. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{very much}} the same way when I was your age. And you like our prospects?... Well, you've thought things out. Neale, the {{building}} of the U. P. will be hell!" ...|$|R
60|$|But even <b>as</b> <b>I</b> spoke <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sorry, {{remembering how}} many jobs {{he had been}} after in his time, and how soon they ended when he had got them.|$|R
60|$|At last I {{rose with}} a sigh to seek help, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> rose <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that there was {{something}} set about my neck. It was the collar of great emeralds which Guatemoc had given to me, and that I had given to Otomie. She had set it there while I slept, and with it a lock of her long hair. Both shall be buried with me.|$|R
60|$|The {{succeeding}} words thrilled me strangely as {{he spoke}} them: especially <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in uttering them, his eye had turned on me.|$|E
60|$|My heart {{stood still}} for a moment, and then gave a great throb <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the warm clasp of her hands and the tremulous touch of her lips upon my forehead.|$|E
60|$|Feels {{not such}} awful wonder <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> When first my smitten eyes beat full on thee, And {{all night long}} before thy feet I knelt Till thou wert wearied of Idolatry.|$|E
60|$|I {{could see}} {{the back of her}} head only, but I knew, from David's face, that she had given him a quick look which did not imply that she was stung. Indeed <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> now, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> before, that though she was {{agitated}} and in some fear of me, she was also enjoying herself considerably.|$|R
6000|$|... "I could {{scarcely}} believe I had done it. I {{put my hand}} into the emptiness, {{and there was the}} thing as solid <b>as</b> ever. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it awkwardly, and threw it on the floor. I had a little trouble finding it again.|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} her warmly and gratefully, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> really <b>felt.</b> But the anxious look still remained {{on her face}} while I was speaking, and the first question she asked, when I had done, related to Count Fosco.|$|R
