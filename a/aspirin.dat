5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because <b>aspirin</b> {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. <b>Aspirin</b> is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of <b>aspirin</b> and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than <b>aspirin</b> alone. Effervescent formulations of <b>aspirin,</b> such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than <b>aspirin</b> in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical <b>aspirin</b> may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> can induce {{swelling}} of skin tissues in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one {{to six hours}} after ingesting <b>aspirin</b> {{in some of the}} people. However, when the <b>aspirin</b> was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these people; the <b>aspirin</b> had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. <b>Aspirin</b> {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of <b>aspirin.</b> Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of <b>aspirin</b> used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking <b>aspirin,</b> and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. <b>Aspirin</b> may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and <b>aspirin.</b> The acetyl portion of the <b>aspirin</b> molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. <b>Aspirin</b> is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of <b>aspirin.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using <b>aspirin.</b> Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when <b>aspirin</b> is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take <b>aspirin</b> or other salicylates. <b>Aspirin</b> is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of <b>aspirin</b> during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take <b>aspirin</b> because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. <b>Aspirin</b> {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin,</b> {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which <b>aspirin</b> is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. <b>Aspirin</b> given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. <b>Aspirin</b> is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. <b>Aspirin</b> may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. <b>Aspirin</b> is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E
5|$|Between World War I and World War II, {{many new}} <b>aspirin</b> brands and aspirin-based {{products}} entered the market. The Australian company Nicholas Proprietary Limited, through the aggressive marketing strategies of George Davies, built Aspro {{into a global}} brand, with particular strength in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K. American brands such as Burton's <b>Aspirin,</b> Molloy's <b>Aspirin,</b> Cal-Aspirin and St. Joseph <b>Aspirin</b> tried {{to compete with the}} American Bayer, while new products such Cafaspirin (<b>aspirin</b> with caffeine) and Alka-Seltzer (a soluble mix of <b>aspirin</b> and bicarbonate of soda) put <b>aspirin</b> to new uses. In 1925, the German Bayer became part of IG Farben, a conglomerate of former dye companies; IG Farben's brands of <b>Aspirin</b> and, in Latin America, the caffeinated Cafiaspirina (co-managed with Sterling Products) competed with less expensive aspirins such as Geniol.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{the use of}} <b>aspirin</b> for {{prevention}} is the phenomenon of <b>aspirin</b> resistance. For people who are resistant, aspirin's efficacy is reduced. Some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to <b>aspirin.</b>|$|E
5|$|March 2009 {{recommendations}} from the USPSTF {{on the use}} of <b>aspirin</b> for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use <b>aspirin</b> when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81mg) <b>aspirin</b> female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause. Low-dose <b>aspirin</b> use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower <b>aspirin</b> doses (75 or 81mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring <b>aspirin</b> for long-term prevention.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{with the}} IG Farben {{conglomerate}} dismantled {{because of its}} {{central role in the}} Nazi regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary—the other half of which it already owned. However, Bayer <b>Aspirin</b> made up {{only a small fraction of}} the British <b>aspirin</b> market because of competition from Aspro, Disprin (a soluble <b>aspirin</b> drug) and other brands. Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized <b>aspirin</b> (Anadin and Excedrin), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that scientists at Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: acetaminophen. After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as Panadol in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1980s, several studies {{suggested}} a link between children's consumption of <b>aspirin</b> and Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required warning labels on all <b>aspirin,</b> further suppressing sales. The makers of Tylenol also {{filed a lawsuit against}} Anacin <b>aspirin</b> maker American Home Products, claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly held back Tylenol sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> {{and other}} NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may delay {{the healing of}} skin wounds. <b>Aspirin</b> may however help heal venous leg ulcers that have not healed {{following}} usual treatment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend <b>aspirin</b> on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using <b>aspirin</b> for primary prevention entirely. <b>Aspirin</b> has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. <b>Aspirin</b> buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of <b>aspirin</b> seen with lower doses. In addition, <b>aspirin</b> induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show <b>aspirin</b> helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the <b>aspirin</b> is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen {{has been shown to}} be as effective as <b>aspirin</b> and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> is an {{important}} part of the treatment of those who have had a myocardial infarction (heart attack). One trial found that among those likely having an ST-segment elevation MI, <b>aspirin</b> saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30-day death rate from 11.8% to 9.4%. There was no difference in major bleeding, but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given <b>aspirin.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of <b>aspirin</b> have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that <b>aspirin</b> is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose <b>aspirin</b> is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
5|$|But they {{overlooked}} that inexpensive <b>aspirin</b> {{had become}} available in India {{and other places}} after October 1918, when the Bayer patent expired. In responding, Starko pointed to anecdotal evidence of <b>aspirin</b> use in India and argued that even if <b>aspirin</b> over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for other high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with growing}} {{legal and illegal}} {{competition}} for the globally marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and <b>Aspirin.</b> One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing <b>Aspirin</b> powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets—complete with the distinctive Bayer cross logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in Rensselaer, New York, to produce <b>Aspirin</b> for the American market without paying import duties. Bayer also sued the most egregious patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its <b>Aspirin</b> sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the American Medical Association, especially after the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the United States Pharmacopeia; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid) to discourage doctors referring to anything but <b>Aspirin.</b>|$|E
5|$|For a {{small number}} of people, taking <b>aspirin</b> can result in {{symptoms}} resembling an allergic reaction, including hives, swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy, but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of <b>aspirin,</b> resulting in an overdose.|$|E
5|$|Formulations {{containing}} {{high concentrations}} of <b>aspirin</b> often smell like vinegar because <b>aspirin</b> can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions, yielding salicylic and acetic acids.|$|E
5|$|Low-dose <b>aspirin</b> use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes <b>aspirin</b> useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in {{people who have had}} a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of <b>aspirin</b> a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of <b>aspirin</b> are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
5|$|Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness {{characterized}} by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given <b>aspirin</b> for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 {{were reported to}} the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, chickenpox, or diarrhea. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and <b>aspirin</b> was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General's warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, <b>aspirin</b> taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline {{was found in the}} United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric <b>aspirin</b> use were issued. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now recommends <b>aspirin</b> (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take <b>aspirin,</b> unless it is on the advice of a doctor.|$|E
5|$|Taking it with vitamin C {{is a more}} {{recently}} investigated method of protecting the stomach lining. Taking equal doses of vitamin C and <b>aspirin</b> may decrease the amount of stomach damage that occurs compared to taking <b>aspirin</b> alone.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} <b>aspirin</b> to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that <b>aspirin</b> had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, <b>aspirin</b> had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of <b>aspirin</b> as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide <b>aspirin</b> tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether <b>aspirin</b> had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that <b>aspirin</b> prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that <b>aspirin</b> caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking <b>aspirin.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that <b>aspirin</b> be taken indefinitely. Frequently, <b>aspirin</b> is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that <b>aspirin</b> be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E
5|$|An {{irreversible}} inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme, {{usually by}} forming a covalent bond to the protein. Penicillin and <b>aspirin</b> are common drugs that act in this manner.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> {{can cause}} {{prolonged}} bleeding after operations {{for up to}} 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding {{was associated with the}} preoperative use of <b>aspirin</b> alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding people.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin</b> {{is used as}} an {{anti-inflammatory}} {{agent for}} both acute and long-term inflammation, {{as well as for}} treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aspirin,</b> in {{the form}} of leaves from the willow tree, has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated sodium {{salicylate}} with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. In {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century, other chemists established the chemical structure and came up with more efficient methods to make it. In 1897, scientists at Bayer began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for common salicylate medicines. By 1899, Bayer had named the drug <b>Aspirin</b> and was selling it around the world. The word <b>Aspirin</b> was Bayer's brand name; however, their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to competition between many brands and formulations.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} {{different}} types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by <b>aspirin.</b> <b>Aspirin</b> irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
5|$|Both {{dogs and}} horses are {{susceptible}} to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, {{but it is a}} convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of laminitis in horses. It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be counterproductive for treatment. <b>Aspirin</b> should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian; in particular, cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of <b>aspirin,</b> making it potentially toxic. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25mg/kg of <b>aspirin</b> every 48 hours for 4 weeks.|$|E
5|$|However, Sterling Products did not market Panadol in the United States {{or other}} {{countries}} where Bayer <b>Aspirin</b> still dominated the <b>aspirin</b> market. Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs, most significantly, McNeil Laboratories with liquid Tylenol in 1955, and Tylenol pills in 1958. By 1967, Tylenol was available without a prescription. Because {{it did not}} cause gastric irritation, acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another analgesic, anti-inflammatory drug was introduced in 1962: ibuprofen (sold as Brufen in the U.K. and Motrin in the U.S.). By the 1970s, <b>aspirin</b> had a relatively {{small portion of the}} pain reliever market, and in the 1980s sales decreased even more when ibuprofen became available without prescription.|$|E
5|$|In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated acetyl {{chloride}} with sodium salicylate to produce acetylsalicylic acid {{for the first}} time; {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis. In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines, and identified a new way to synthesize it. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug <b>Aspirin</b> and was selling it around the world. The word <b>Aspirin</b> was Bayer's brand name, rather than the generic name of the drug; however, Bayer's rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of <b>aspirin</b> brands and products.|$|E
5|$|Like flour mills, {{factories}} that make <b>aspirin</b> tablets must {{pay attention to}} {{how much of the}} powder gets into the air inside the building, because the powder-air mixture can be explosive. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit in the United States of 5mg/m3 (time-weighted average). In 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set a legal permissible exposure limit for <b>aspirin</b> of 5mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v. OSHA decision in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Low-dose <b>aspirin</b> supplementation has {{moderate}} benefits {{when used}} for prevention of pre-eclampsia. This benefit is greater when started in early pregnancy.|$|E
