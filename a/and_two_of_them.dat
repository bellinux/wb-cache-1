5|$|Various {{modifications}} {{were made}} to Valletta's fortifications during British rule. The most significant of these was the construction of Fort Lascaris between 1854 and 1856. Other alterations included the addition of batteries and concrete gun emplacements, changes to parapets and their embrasures, {{and the construction of}} gunpowder magazines.

5|$|Djajakusuma often {{included}} traditional arts in his films, <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> (Lahirnja Gatotkatja and Bimo Kroda) {{were based}} on traditional wayang stories and used wayang-inspired costumes and tempos. This focus on aspects of traditional culture {{fell out of the}} mainstream after 1965, having been replaced by films about city life. Djajakusuma's theatrical productions experimented with new storytelling techniques, adapting the traditional styles for the modern world. As a lecturer teaching screenwriting and the history of theatre, Djajakusuma focused on Indonesian arts. He argued that Indonesians should rely on local culture, not continuously look towards the West. In other areas he was mostly apolitical.|$|E

5|$|Hogarth {{designed}} the series for an original commission by Jonathan Tyers in 1736 {{in which he}} requested a number of paintings to decorate supper boxes at Vauxhall Gardens. Hogarth {{is believed to have}} suggested to Tyers that the supper boxes at Gardens be decorated with paintings as part of their refurbishment; among the works featured when the renovation was completed was Hogarth's picture of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. The originals of Four Times of the Day were sold to other collectors, but the scenes were reproduced at Vauxhall by Francis Hayman, <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> Evening and Night, hung at the pleasure gardens until at least 1782.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of the 31 {{described}} {{species of}} Monoplacophora (a class of mollusks) live below 2000meters. Of these 11 species, two live {{exclusively in the}} hadal zone. The greatest number of monoplacophorans are from the eastern Pacific Ocean along the oceanic trenches. However, no abyssal monoplacophorans have yet {{been found in the}} Western Pacific and only one abyssal species has been identified in the Indian Ocean. Of the 922 known species of chitons (from the Polyplacophora class of mollusks), 22 species (2.4%) are reported to live below 2000meters <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are restricted to the abyssal plain. Although genetic studies are lacking, at least six of these species are thought to be eurybathic (capable of living {{in a wide range of}} depths), having been reported as occurring from the sublittoral to abyssal depths. A large number of the polyplacophorans from great depths are herbivorous or xylophagous, which could explain the difference between the distribution of monoplacophorans and polyplacophorans in the world's oceans.|$|E
5|$|In 1654, {{only five}} years after its passage, the Act was repealed. Two years earlier the colony had been seized by Protestants {{following}} the execution of King Charles I of England and {{the outbreak of the}} English Civil War. In the early stages of that conflict, the colonial assembly of Maryland and its neighbors in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King. Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies, <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> the Virginian William Claiborne and Puritan leader Richard Bennett, took control of the colonial government in St. Mary's City in 1652. In addition to repealing the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen, Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion. Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1657 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692.|$|E

5|$|The National Championship Game against Stanford was a {{completely}} different story. UConn started the game with its worst first half in school history by scoring only 12 points; only eleven teams in tournament history have been held to 12 points or less in the first half: {{three of them were}} against UConn teams, <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> (Southern and Temple) just days earlier in the 2010 Tournament.

Maya Moore gave UConn the lead (23–22) in the second half with a three-pointer and led the team on a scoring run of 30–6 that eventually secured the national championship with a final score of 53–47. It was the only game in the Huskies' 78-game winning streak that was won by fewer than 10 points. Moore was named the Tournament Most Outstanding Player, to go along with her second straight Wade Trophy award and Academic All-America of the Year award. Charles, who won the John R.
