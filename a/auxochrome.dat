50|$|The {{presence}} of an <b>auxochrome</b> in the chromogen molecule is essential to make a dye. However, if an <b>auxochrome</b> {{is present in the}} meta position to the chromophore, it does not affect the color.|$|E
50|$|An <b>auxochrome</b> helps a dye to bind to {{the object}} {{that is to be}} colored. Electrolytic {{dissociation}} of the <b>auxochrome</b> group helps in binding and it is due to this reason a basic substance takes an acidic dye.|$|E
50|$|It {{increases}} {{the color of}} any organic compound. For example, benzene does not display color as {{it does not have}} a chromophore; but nitrobenzene is pale yellow color {{because of the presence of}} a nitro group (-NO2) which acts as a chromophore. But Para-hydroxynitrobenzene exhibits a deep yellow color, in which -OH group acts as an <b>auxochrome.</b> Here the <b>auxochrome</b> (-OH) is conjugated with the chromophore -NO2. Similar behavior is seen in azobenzene which has a red color, but para-hydroxy azobenzene is dark red in color.|$|E
50|$|A {{molecule}} exhibits colour {{because it}} absorbs colours only of certain frequencies and reflects or transmits others. They {{are capable of}} absorbing and emitting light of various frequencies. Light waves with frequency very close to their natural frequency are absorbed readily. This phenomenon, known as resonance, means that the molecule can absorb radiation of a particular frequency which is same as the frequency of electron movement within the molecule. Chromophore {{is the part of}} the molecule where the energy difference between two different molecular orbitals falls within the range of the visible spectrum and hence absorbs some particular colours from visible light. Hence the molecule appears coloured. When <b>auxochromes</b> are attached to the molecule, the natural frequency of the latter gets changed and thus the colour gets modified. Different <b>auxochromes</b> produce different effects in the chromophore which inturn causes absorption of light {{from other parts of the}} spectrum. Normally, <b>auxochromes</b> which intensifies the colour are chosen.|$|R

Heterocycle incorporation in the 3 - and 13 -positions shifted the chlorin absorption and emission {{to the red}} (up to lambdaem = 680 nm), thus these readily incorporated substituents function analogously to <b>auxochromes</b> present in chlorophylls, for example, formyl and vinyl groups. Photophysical, theoretical and X-ray crystallographic experiments revealed small but {{significant differences between the}} behavior of the furan- and the thiophene-based <b>auxochromes.</b> Four regioisomeric bis-thienylchlorins (3, 10; 3, 13, 3, 15 and 10, 15) were oxidatively electropolymerized; the chlorin monomer geometry {{had a profound impact on}} the polymerization efficiency and the electrochemical properties of the resulting material.

5000|$|The {{electronic}} {{transitions in}} organic compounds {{and some other}} compounds can be determined by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, provided that transitions in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible range {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} exist for this compound. Electrons occupying a HOMO of a sigma bond can get excited to the LUMO of that bond. This process is denoted as a σ → σ* transition. Likewise promotion of an electron from a π-bonding orbital to an antibonding π orbital* is denoted as a π → π* transition. <b>Auxochromes</b> with free electron pairs denoted as n have their own transitions, as do aromatic pi bond transitions. Sections of molecules which can undergo such detectable electron transitions can be referred to as chromophores since such transitions absorb electromagnetic radiation (light), which may be hypothetically perceived as color somewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum.

30|$|Dyes are organic {{compounds}} {{consisting of two}} main groups of compounds, chromophores (responsible for {{the color of the}} dye) and <b>auxochromes</b> (responsible for intensity of the color) (Christie 2001). Dyes usually have a synthetic and complex aromatic structure, which makes them more stable and difficult to biodegrade (Sayan 2006). According to the color index (C.I.) which is managed by the society of dyers and colorists, currently more than 10, 000 various types of dyes are synthesized and available in the world (Elkady et al. 2011). It is estimated that approximately 12  % of synthetic dyes are lost during manufacturing and processing operations, and 20  % of these lost dyes enter in the industrial wastewater (Chowdhury et al. 2011 a). The dyes used in the textile industries include several structure varieties such as acidic, reactive, basic, disperse, azo, diazo, anthraquinone based and metal complex dyes (Banat et al. 1996).|$|R
40|$|International audienceBecause photochromes act as light-induced {{molecular}} switches, {{there is}} considerable interest in exporting their molecular functionality in the solid state {{in order to develop}} photoresponsive materials. In that context, we have carried out a DFT investigation of a series of photochromic derivatives of trans/cis-azobenzene and open/closed-diarylethene adsorbed onto rutile (110) and anatase (101) slabs. By varying the <b>auxochromes</b> and the photochromic state, we examine the trends in the surface-adsorbate interplay in terms of the electronic structure, adsorption geometries, and Bader charge transfer. Using principal components analysis, we demonstrate how the dipole moment of the isolated photochrome {{in the direction of the}} anchoring group is the most important predictor of the electronic structure of the adsorbed system. A key point of this paper is to show how the energy levels of the isolated photochrome and bare slab change as a result of adsorption and how first-principles modeling helps to rationalize and predict these trends...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDyes {{undergoing}} excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) {{are known}} to present large Stokes shifts {{as a result of}} the important geometrical reorganisation following photon absorption. When the ESIPT process is not quantitative, one can obtain dual emitters characterised by two distinct fluorescence bands, observed due to emissions from both the canonical and ESIPT isomers. However, dual emission generally requires to maintain a very specific balance, as the relative excited-state free energies of the two tautomers have to be within a narrow window to observe the phenomenon. Consequently, simple chemical intuition is insufficient to optimise dual emission. In the present contribution, we investigate, with the help of quantum-mechanical tools and more precisely, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC), a wide panel of possible ESIPT/dual emitters with various substituents. The selected protocol is first shown to be very robust on a series of structures with known experimental behaviour, and next is applied to novel derivatives with various substituents located at different positions. This work encompasses the largest chemical library of potential ESIPT compounds studied to date. We pinpoint the most promising combinations for building dual emitters, highlight unexpected combination effects and rationalise the impact of the different <b>auxochromes...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to study the {{relationship}} between the structure of N-benzylsalicylthioamide derivatives and their retention behavior in high-pressure liquid chromatography. Furthermore, the influence of various substituents on electron absorption spectra in ultraviolet spectral range was studied. All studied derivatives have two absorption maxima in ultraviolet spectral range at 260 nm and 293 nm. The substitution of an <b>auxochrome</b> on the acyl ring leads to bathrochromic shift and hyperchromic shift, especially of the first absorption maxima. The presence of an <b>auxochrome</b> on the amide ring leads to hyperchromic shift as well. HPLC reversed-phase chromatography, using XDB-C 18 ZORBAX column and mobile phase with various composition of acetonitrile, was used to obtain retention times of the derivatives. Using this data, the correlation equations between retention factor (mobile phase with no acetonitrile), resp. slope of the dependence of the logarithm of retention factor on the volume fracture of acetonitrile in mobile phase, and partition coefficient octanol-water, resp. hydrophobic substituent constants, were derived.

One series of choline-esters and one series of phospholipids were based on β-apo- 8 ’-carotenic acid, whereas another series of phospholipids was based on retinoic acid. The final products generally had good surfactant properties. In addition, hydrophilic carotenoids derived from sodium and potassium β-apocarotenoates, carotenoid-oxime salts, and norbixin and its potassium salts were prepared and examined for their surfactant properties. Selected carotenoid choline-ester analogues and phospholipids were examined for their potential use as transfection agents. The carotenoid compounds were as effective as commercial standards concerning complexation and protection of nucleic acids. Preliminary biological confirm the transfection activity of the new carotenoid lipids. A novel method for radical induction was examined. Stable radicals were observed at room temperature upon addition of small amounts of base to DMF or DMSO, contradicting earlier claims of their inertness. The reaction of radicals with polyene-carbonyl compounds resulted in electrontransfer to the polyenes, forming reduced anions or radical anions. The synthetic potential of this reaction was also demonstrated. Pyran-groups operate as strong <b>auxochromes</b> in polyene-dyes.

30|$|With {{the limit}} of forest {{resources}} all over the world, high-yield pulp (HYP), containing attractive features, such as high bulk, high opacity, high stiffness, good printability et al., has been gaining increasing interests in the manufacturing of uncoated and coated fine paper and paperboards. However, {{the main drawback of}} HYP is the color reversion, since it contains much more lignin [1 – 4]. The special chemical structure of lignin is easily influenced by a certain external environment, for instance, temperature, light, and the presence of metal cations. Among them, the light is the main factor. When the long term exposed under the sunshine, the structure of lignin can easily generate chromophores or <b>auxochromes,</b> losing the brightness of paper to make it yellowing. It leads to the weakness of light stability, especially the brightness stability of HYP, which greatly hindered its application in some high-value paper. According to the research about the light-induced yellowing mechanism of HYP, different proposed yellowing inhibition methods were studied, such as chemical modification of lignin, exploring a new bleaching process of high-yield pulp and adding chemical auxiliaries. From the perspective of cost and effect of light stability, adding chemical auxiliaries (ultraviolet absorbents, radical scavenger, and fluorescent brighteners, et al.) is considered as the most feasible method to exhibit the yellowing of HYP.|$|R
40|$|Chlorins, as {{the core}} {{structures}} of chlorophylls, have been extensively studied for harvesting solar energy, fluorescent imaging and photodynamic therapy against cancer. This thesis is concerned with design and synthesis of novel chlorins as antennae for harvesting light and sensitising near infrared lanthanide luminescence. In the first part, a series of chlorin monomers, dimers and polymers were synthesised and their photophysical properties were characterised. The chlorin monomers were substituted with five-membered heterocycles, such as thiophenes and furans. These heterocycles function as <b>auxochromes</b> analogous to the natural ones in chlorophylls, and extend chlorin absorption and emission strongly to the red (up to λem = 680 nm). A borylation method was developed to prepare borylated chlorins, which gave access to directly linked chlorin dimers through Suzuki coupling reaction. Different regioisomers of chlorin dimer were prepared, including β-meso homodimers, meso-meso homodimers and heterodimers. The dimerisation resulted in red-shifted absorption and emission. Chlorin polymerisations were performed both electrochemically and chemically. Bis-thienylchlorins yielded chlorin films and an organic solvent soluble copolymer with hexylthiophene, respectively. These polymers from both polymerisations have red absorptions beyond 700 nm, and might be used as light-harvesting antennae. In the second part, chlorins were used as chromophores to sensitise near infrared lanthanide luminescence. Two types of chlorin-lanthanide dyads were prepared through lanthanide coordination with cyclen derivatives and dipicolinic acids (DPA). The cyclen-based dyads were poorly soluble in water, thus their near infrared emissions were not observed. The other type of complexes was fully soluble in H 2 O and THF. Both Nd and Yb emission were recorded even upon excitation into the Q bands of chlorins. In the dyads with free base chlorins, the singlet state of chlorins might {{be involved in the}} sensitisation of lanthanide luminescence. These DPA-based dyads presented two-color emission based on one chlorin and two-color excitation based on one lanthanide ion. These dyads would enable in theory 4 -color imaging. In the last part, a microwave-assisted two-step synthesis was described to prepare dipyrromethanes, which are the key intermediates in the chlorin synthesis. This mild method took advantage of the nucleophilicity of pyrrole and the electrophilicity of N,N-dimethylaminomethyl pyrroles. The usually used acid catalysis is detrimental to many functionalities, thus our methods enable the synthesis of dipyrromethanes with acid sensitive groups or a formyl group...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDyes {{undergoing}} {{excited state}} intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) received increasing attention {{during the last}} decades. If their unusual large Stokes shifts and sometimes dual-fluorescence signatures have paved the way toward new applications, the rapidity of ESIPT often prevents its investigation with sole experimental approaches, and theoretical simulations are often welcome, if necessary, to obtain a full rationalization of the observations. In the present paper, we evaluate both the absorption and the fluorescence spectra of, respectively, the enol and keto forms {{of a series of}} hydroxyphenylbenzimidazole (HBI) using a robust protocol based on Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT). Optical spectra were obtained accounting for both vibronic and environmental effects. The aim of this work is therefore not to evaluate the radiationless pathway going through the twisted ESIPT structures, though excited-state reaction paths between enol and keto forms have been rationalized. First we have compared three dyes differing by the strength of the donor groups, and we have quantified the impact of the flexible butyl chain substituting the imidazole side. In accordance with experiments, we show that the presence of a dialkylamino <b>auxochrome</b> allows to tune the excited-state potential energy surface leading to a weaker tendency to ESIPT. This trend is rationalized in terms of both structural and electronic effects. Next, larger hydroxyphenyl-phenanthroimidazole (HPI) were considered {{to assess the impact of}} a stronger p-delocalization. 00 energies and vibrationally resolved spectra of the corresponding fluoroborate derivatives were studied as well. The dialkylamino <b>auxochrome</b> significantly decreases the 00 energies due to the presence of an important charge transfer character, while the addition of a BODIPY moiety induces a change of the emission signature now localized on the BODIPY side rather than on the NBO core...|$|E

The chromophores contain either platinum acetylide or ortho-metalated 2 -thienylpyridinyl(platinum) end-groups (DPP-Pt(CC) and DPP-Pt(acac), respectively). The ground state redox potentials of the chromophores were determined by solution electrochemistry, and the HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated. The chromophores' photophysical properties were characterized by absorption, photoluminescence, and time-resolved absorption spectroscopy on time scales from sub-picoseconds to microseconds. Density functional theory (DFT) computations were performed to understand the molecular orbitals involved in both the singlet and triplet excited state photophysics. The results reveal that in both platinum DPP derivatives the organometallic auxochromes {{have a significant effect}} on the chromophores' photophysics. The most profound effect is a reduction in the fluorescence yields accompanied by enhanced triplet yields due to spin-orbit coupling induced by the metal centers. The effects are most pronounced in DPP-Pt(acac), indicating that the orthometalated platinum <b>auxochrome</b> is able to induce spin-orbital coupling to a greater extent compared to the platinum acetylide units.

Spectrophotometric analysis of oil was carried out to obtain information regarding the types, numbers and position of chromophores and <b>auxochrome,</b> and saturated and unsaturated compounds.

Maximum activity was observed on bacterial strains compared with fungal strains. Among bacteria, Bacillus subtilis was highly sensitive; fungi were less susceptible to oil and Saccharomyces cerivisiae were the most susceptible. Minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations of the seed oil varied between 3 to 10 mg/ 50 μL against all bacterial and fungal strains used in this study.

40|$|During {{membrane}} {{treatment of}} secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plants, a reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) containing trace organic contaminants is generated. As {{the latter are}} of concern, effective and economic treatment methods are required. Here, we investigated electrochemical oxidation of ROC using Ti/Ru 0. 7 Ir 0. 3 O 2 electrodes, focussing on the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), and 28 pharmaceuticals and pesticides frequently encountered in secondary treated effluents. The experiments were conducted in a continuously fed reactor at current densities (J) ranging from 1 to 250 A m(- 2) anode, and a batch reactor at J = 250 A m(- 2). Higher mineralization efficiency was observed during batch oxidation (e. g. 25. 1 +/- 2. 7 % DOC removal vs 0 % removal in the continuous reactor after applying specific electrical charge, Q = 437. 0 A h m(- 3) ROC), indicating that DOC removal is depending on indirect oxidation by electrogenerated oxidants that accumulate in the bulk liquid. An initial increase and subsequent slow decrease in SUVA(254) during batch mode suggests the introduction of <b>auxochrome</b> substituents (e. g. -Cl, NH 2 Cl, -Br, and -OH) into the aromatic compounds. Contrarily, in the continuous reactor ring-cleaving oxidation products were generated, and SUVA(254) removal correlated with applied charge. Furthermore, 20 of the target pharmaceuticals and pesticides completely disappeared in both the continuous and batch experiments when applying J >= 150 A m(- 2) (i. e. Q >= 461. 5 A h m(- 3)) and 437. 0 A h m(- 3) (J = 250 A m(- 2)), respectively. Compounds that were more persistent during continuous oxidation were characterized {{by the presence of}} electrophilic groups on the aromatic ring (e. g. triclopyr) or by the absence of stronger nucleophilic substituents (e. g. ibuprofen). These pollutants were oxidized when applying higher specific electrical charge in batch mode (i. e. 1. 45 kA h m(- 3) ROC). However, baseline toxicity as determined by Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition tests (Microtox) was increasing with higher applied charge during batch and continuous oxidation, indicating the formation of toxic oxidation products, possibly chlorinated and brominated organic compounds.

30|$|For the dye molecules, the {{chemical}} structure is normally divided as the chromophore (main skeleton) and <b>auxochrome</b> (substituent groups) parts. The chromophore part generally determines the light fastness properties. Oppositely, {{the change in}} fastness properties {{is dominated by the}} auxochromes (Cristea and Vilarem 2006). Flavonoid compounds are mostly found as the main components in natural dyes and the remaining components anthraquinones, naphtoquinones and indigoids. Anthraquinones and indigoids typically exhibit superior light fastness. Although the numerous advantages have been gained from the natural dyes, the color fading due to the degradation of dye is still be one of the major problems in textile color. Normally, the color fading directly affects in the loss of intact dye molecule resulting in the change of original dye color (Ahn et al. 2014). In general, the stability of natural dye is mostly influenced by {{the chemical}} and physical states of the dye. Moreover, the source and the intensity of illumination, humidity, temperature (heat), and the atmospheric pollution as the external factors can affect the stability of natural dyes as well. The light source containing UV radiation is one of the important factors that affect the stability of the dyes by photofading process (McLaren 1956; Padfield and Landi 1996; Gantz and Sumner 1957). Under exposing to light, both temperature and humidity can influence the fading rate of dyed textiles (Egerton and Morgan 1970). In addition, the natural dyes can react with gas contaminants in the atmosphere, e.g., sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen and ozone {{even in the absence of}} light. In terms of thermal affecting stability, it is known that higher temperature accelerates the oxidation of the natural dyes. It has been reported that the oxidation reaction of amor cork tree dye is accelerated two times by every 2  °C increase in temperature under heating in 100  °C oven (Ramos et al. 1995; Ahn 2011). Thermal degradation behavior of the alizarin and Phellodendron bark, alizarin and indirubin has also been studied by GC–MS and HPLC–DAD-MS (Ahn 2011; Ahn and Obendorf 2004). In addition, Ahn et al. (2014) investigated the thermal resistance of the natural dyes. The thermal stabilizing performance of alizarin and purpurin was attributed to the formation of fiber-metal-dye chelated complex by aluminum or iron ions mordanting prior to dyeing.|$|E
