5|$|Prince Eugene was {{expected}} to be in position by 11:00, but due to the difficult terrain and enemy fire, progress was slow. Lord Cutts' column – who by 10:00 had expelled the enemy from two water mills upon the Nebel – had already deployed by the river against Blenheim, enduring over the next three hours severe fire from a heavy six-gun battery posted near the village. The rest of Marlborough's army, waiting in their ranks on the forward slope, were also forced to bear the cannonade from the French artillery, suffering 2,000 casualties before the attack could even start. Meanwhile, engineers repaired a stone bridge across the Nebel, and constructed five additional bridges or causeways across the marsh between Blenheim and Oberglauheim. Marlborough's <b>anxiety</b> <b>was</b> finally allayed when, just past noon, Colonel Cadogan reported that Eugene's Prussian and Danish infantry were in place – the order for the general advance was given. At 13:00, Cutts was ordered to attack the village of Blenheim whilst Prince Eugene was requested to assault Lutzingen on the Allied right flank.|$|E
25|$|When {{prevalence}} {{estimates were}} based on the examination of psychiatric clinic samples, social anxiety disorder was thought to be a relatively rare disorder. The opposite was found to be true; social <b>anxiety</b> <b>was</b> common, but many were afraid to seek psychiatric help, leading to an underrecognition of the problem.|$|E
25|$|By 1897 some <b>anxiety</b> <b>was</b> {{caused by}} {{the opening of a}} Bristol Technical College which began to draw some of the {{students}} who would have attended University College, Bristol. However, it is argued that this threat was more imaginary than real as the University College was able to cater for more academic interests.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to detecting the meanings of anxiety in women with reproductive disorders, which allows us to determine the «targets» of psychotherapy. The choice of self-actualization direction is important for pregnant women. The <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> associated with the refusal of professional realization. The meaning of normal <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> the confrontation with life difficulties. The meanings of pathological <b>anxiety</b> <b>are</b> avoiding difficulties, a passive position, the feeling of powerlessness...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Anxiety</b> <b>is</b> {{an emotion}} {{characterized}} by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior, such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination. It is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events, such as the feeling of imminent death. <b>Anxiety</b> <b>is</b> {{not the same as}} fear, which is a response to a [...] real or perceived immediate threat, whereas <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> the expectation of future threat. <b>Anxiety</b> <b>is</b> a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue and problems in concentration. <b>Anxiety</b> can <b>be</b> appropriate, but when experienced regularly the individual may suffer from an anxiety disorder.|$|R
25|$|According to the survivors, {{some of the}} {{passengers}} {{were aware of the}} Frosta as it traveled upriver, and there was a growing anxiety over {{what appeared to be a}} collision course, although this <b>anxiety</b> <b>was</b> somewhat tempered by their belief that the ferry would maneuver to avoid the ship, especially since there was no indication of danger from the George Prince. When the Frosta sounded the danger signal, there was an immediate panic from those who could see the ship, and their flight from danger alerted others. It can never be known whether {{the passengers}} on the side opposite the oncoming ship were aware of the danger, as all the survivors were on the side of the impact.|$|E
25|$|Republic's <b>anxiety</b> <b>was</b> erased by the resounding {{success of}} The Quiet Man (Republic, 1952), a pet project which Ford {{had wanted to}} make since the 1930s (and almost did so in 1937 with an {{independent}} cooperative called Renowned Artists Company). It became his biggest grossing picture to date, taking nearly $4million in the US alone {{in its first year}} and ranking in the top 10 box office films of its year. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won Ford his fourth Oscar for Best Director, as well a second Best Cinematography Oscar for Winton Hoch. It was followed by What Price Glory? (1952), a World War I drama, the first of two films Ford made with James Cagney (Mister Roberts was the other) which also did good business at the box office ($2million).|$|E
500|$|Off the field, the {{throwing}} controversy {{was beginning to}} affect Meckiff adversely. In his 1961 autobiography, prophetically titled Thrown Out, he said the accusations took a deep personal toll on him and his family, and prompted him to shun the public. He became known by the derisive nickname [...] "Chucker" [...] and was credited on the front cover of his autobiography as [...] "Ian 'Chucker' Meckiff". Meckiff reported that from the Melbourne Test onwards, his son was verbally abused by classmates; Meckiff's parents were persistently told their son bowled illegally. He added that doctors believed his <b>anxiety</b> <b>was</b> contributing to stomach ailments. At the time, players {{were not allowed to}} talk to the media during the season, and Meckiff was upset because he could not rebut his accusers while they were free to attack him. He denied ever throwing, but admitted he may have been open to suspicion after bowling 15 to 20 overs in a day's play, as his body would begin to fall away in the delivery stride due to fatigue. He had a permanently bent bowling arm; he generated his pace from his wrist action, and asserted that his thin wrists gave the impression that his whole arm was bending.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTest <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> {{concerned}} about {{a large portion of}} our society (students, family environment). The portion affected from the test <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> increasing year by year. Test <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> not related with studying or studying much. The idea that studying much and getting new knowledge cause <b>anxiety</b> and stress <b>is</b> common. A student being tired by studying much can rest after a brief relaxation and exercise. What creates the <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> the fear of being unsuccessful and the thought that is the end of some values because of the failure. Determination of students’ test <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> very important for the success in applied teaching activities. In this study intending to determine secondary school students’ test anxiety, test anxiety scale and data collected from interviews were evaluated from the view of gender, class grades and enrolled educational institutions. After the analyses gained by descriptive statistical techniques and One-Way ANOVA, {{it was found that the}} students had mid-level test anxiety, and girls had higher test anxiety level than boys...|$|R
50|$|Somatic <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> the {{physical}} symptoms of anxiety, such as butterflies in the stomach. It is commonly contrasted with cognitive <b>anxiety,</b> which <b>is</b> the mental manifestations of anxiety, or the specific thought processes that occur during anxiety, such as concern or worry. These different components of <b>anxiety</b> <b>are</b> especially studied in sports psychology, specifically relating {{to how the}} anxiety symptoms affect athletic performance.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion: Among {{patients}} receiving NIV for ARF, <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> frequent and potentially severe. Moderate to severe <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> associated with NIV failure and {{a trend toward}} higher mortality. Future studies should evaluate the benefit strategy aiming at improving anxiety management in ICU patients.|$|R
500|$|The 1920s in the United States was {{a period}} marked by {{considerable}} anxiety and discussion over the crossing of racial boundaries, the so-called [...] "color line" [...] between blacks and whites. This <b>anxiety</b> <b>was</b> exacerbated by the Great Migration, in which {{hundreds of thousands of}} blacks left the rural south for northern and midwestern cities, where, together with new waves of immigrants, they changed the social makeup. The practice of persons [...] "crossing the color line"—attempting to claim recognition in another racial group than the one they were believed to belong to—was known as [...] "passing". As many African Americans had European ancestry in varying proportions, some appeared visibly European. The legacy of slavery, with its creation of a racial caste, and the imposition in the early 20th century of the so-called one-drop rule (by which someone with even one ancestor of sub-Saharan-African origin was considered black) led to a hardening of racial lines that had historically been more fluid; at any time, the concept of race was [...] "historically contingent." [...] Although the exact numbers of people who passed is, for obvious reasons, not known, many estimates were made at the time. The sociologist Charles S. Johnson (1893–1956) calculated that 355,000 blacks had passed between 1900 and 1920.|$|E
500|$|The first Test {{began at}} the Sydney Cricket Ground on 2 December 1932, and was played in a tense and heated atmosphere. Bradman, whose {{discomfort}} and poor form against the tourists' bowling in the preparatory games had become sources of <b>anxiety,</b> <b>was</b> prevented from playing by illness. England won the game by 10 wickets; Larwood's match figures were 10 for 124, with only limited use of fast leg theory. The match's most successful batsman was Australia's Stan McCabe, who scored 187 in his side's first innings, attacking both the orthodox and leg theory attacks in a [...] "death or glory" [...] approach. During the match Hugh Buggy, {{a reporter for the}} Melbourne Herald, used the word [...] "bodyline" [...] to describe the English leg theory bowling. The term was soon universally adopted in Australia, though English sources continued to refer to [...] "leg theory". The second Test, at Melbourne beginning 30 December, was played on a much slower pitch that blunted the English pace attack. Larwood was further handicapped by pains from sore feet, caused by a new pair of boots. Bradman returned to the Australian side and scored a century, guiding his team to victory by 111 runs; his success led many commentators to suppose that fast leg theory would thenceforth prove ineffective. The series was tied 1–1 and, {{in the words of the}} writer-historian Ronald Blythe, [...] "all was sweetness and light".|$|E
2500|$|Epicurus {{was also}} a {{significant}} source of inspiration and interest for both Arthur Schopenhauer, having particular influence on the famous pessimist's views on suffering and death, as well as one of Schopenhauer's successors: Friedrich Nietzsche. [...] Nietzsche cites his affinities to Epicurus in a number of his works, including The Gay Science, Beyond Good and Evil, and his private letters to Peter Gast. [...] Nietzsche was attracted to, among other things, Epicurus' ability to maintain a cheerful philosophical outlook in the face of painful physical ailments. [...] Nietzsche also suffered from a number of sicknesses during his lifetime. However, he thought that Epicurus' conception of happiness as freedom from <b>anxiety</b> <b>was</b> too passive and negative.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Anxiety</b> <b>is</b> {{distinguished}} from fear, {{which is an}} appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat. <b>Anxiety</b> <b>is</b> related to the specific behaviors of fight-or-flight responses, defensive behavior or escape. It occurs in situations only perceived as uncontrollable or unavoidable, but not realistically so. David Barlow defines anxiety as [...] "a future-oriented mood state in which one is not ready or prepared to attempt to cope with upcoming negative events," [...] {{and that it is}} a distinction between future and present dangers which divides anxiety and fear. Another description of <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> [...] agony, dread, terror, or even apprehension. In positive psychology, <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> described as the mental state that results from a difficult challenge for which the subject has insufficient coping skills.|$|R
50|$|<b>Anxiety</b> <b>is</b> {{a complex}} multi-faceted {{disorder}} with many symptoms. <b>Anxiety</b> <b>is</b> difficult to model because psychiatrists who clinically diagnose anxiety follow the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM IV) of the American Psychiatric Association, which includes self-reporting from patients. Since animals cannot {{explain to us}} how they feel, animals cannot <b>be</b> diagnosed with <b>anxiety</b> disorder. However symptoms of <b>anxiety</b> can <b>be</b> inferred from animal behavior.|$|R

5000|$|Mark H. Ashcraft defines math anxiety as [...] "a {{feeling of}} tension, apprehension, or fear that interferes with math performance" [...] (2002, p. 1). The first math <b>anxiety</b> {{measurement}} scale <b>was</b> developed by Richardson and Suinn in 1972. Since this development, several researchers have examined math anxiety in empirical studies. Hembree (1990) conducted a meta-analysis of 151 studies concerning math anxiety. It determined that math <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> related to poor math performance on math achievement tests and that math <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> related to negative attitudes concerning math. Hembree {{also suggests that}} math <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> directly connected with math avoidance.|$|R

Although females report being more anxious than males in interviews, their <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> not as readily detected as that for males.
