Namely, express consent should {{be obtained from the}} individual before marketing communications are sent to him by email or SMS. Lack of such prior consent is presumed unless the sender proves the contrary. The law provides for immediate cessation of sending marketing communications at the individual’s short notice. It should be also noted that in Russia it is expressly prohibited to send emails or SMS messages using <b>autodial.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1970s, the Toronto Transit Commission's (TTC) policy was to {{suppress}} information concerning suicide jumpers in the Toronto subway, however data were publicly released following {{a request from}} journalists in 2009. As an interim measure, in June 2011, the TTC implemented a [...] "Crisis Link" [...] campaign, with posters exhorting persons contemplating suicide to press an <b>autodial</b> button on one of 141 designated payphones located on 69 stations' platforms to speak directly with a trained counsellor with the Distress Centres of Toronto. Platform screen doors have already been built in underground mass transit systems in cities in Europe and Asia; however, the first screen doors in Canadian metro stations are scheduled for Toronto in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} and groups have developed <b>autodialing</b> machines to open safes. Unlike fictional machines that can open any combination {{in a matter of}} seconds, such machines are usually specific to a particular type of lock and must cycle through thousands of combinations to open a device. A good example of such a device is a project completed by two students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Kyle Vogt and Grant Jordan. Their machine, built to open a Sargent and Greenleaf 8400 lock on a Diebold Safe, found an unknown combination in 21,000 tries. [...] Lockmasters, Inc. markets two <b>autodialing</b> machines that work on a variety of 3-digit combination safe locks.|$|R

The Phone Slave is an intelligent answering machine, conversing with callers to format messages and relaying personal greetings to identified partles. Its owner can access these voice messages as well as electronic mail via speech recognition or Touch-Tones over the phone network. Access to both lncoming and outgoing messages, an on-line directory, and <b>autodial</b> features are also provided by a touch-sensitive color monitor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{two major}} questions. First, {{what is the}} schizophrenia that is afflicting the library profession in general and public librarians in particular? Second, what knowledge and skill competencies must public librarians possess {{to survive in the}} remainder of this century, particularly in utilizing information technology? In the latter part of this paper I will suggest six competency areas that should be emphasized both for public librarians and all professional librarians. Most public librarians have difficulty thinking of libraries as just one type of information technology. The general public thinks of public libraries primarily as a collection of books or a room or building where a collection of books, periodicals, manuscripts, or even possibly video-cassettes are kept. Clearly, to meet their needs, people go to many other information resources than just the public library. Today, the emergence of videotex, teletex, <b>autodial</b> tape services, electronic banking services, electronic publishing, laser printing on demand, and many other technol-ogies are expanding the information user's options...|$|E

Depending on {{the circumstances}} of the violating communication, the TCPA’s penalties can exceed by orders of magnitude any plausible economic estimate of the recipient’s actual harm, such that the TCPA, as applied, likely violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment...|$|R
25|$|There were {{optional}} {{systems to}} dial {{the phone or}} pick it up, but these were generally implemented as separate devices also intended to be used {{on one end of}} the connection or the other. For instance, the <b>autodialler</b> was a system that automated the action of picking up the phone and dialing a number, and was normally implemented as a separate box that connected to another port on the host computer. Such devices were typically expensive and generally used by larger organizations like banks, who might use one to send an end-of-day file to branch offices.|$|R
40|$|The {{centralized}} storm {{information system}} is now capable of ingesting and remapping radar scope presentations on a satellite projection. This can be color enhanced and superposed on other data types. Presentations {{from more than one}} radar can be composited on a single image. As with most other data sources, a simple macro establishes the loops and scheduling of the radar ingestions as well as the <b>autodialing.</b> There are approximately 60 NWS network 10 cm radars that can be interrogated. NSSFC forecasters have found this data source to be extremely helpful in severe weather situations. The capability to access lightning frequency data stored in a National Weather Service computer was added. Plans call for an interface with the National Meteorological Center to receive and display prognostic fields from operational computer forecast models. Programs are to be developed to plot and display locations of reported severe local storm events...|$|R
40|$|Liquified Petroleum gas (LPG) is {{the common}} one for all cooking applications. Most of us are prone to much {{difficulty}} when the gascylinder gets emptied during the peak cooking hours. We present this paper {{in order to create}} awareness about the decreasing weight due toconsumption of the gas and to automatically dial to the gas booking office. Continuous measurement of the weight cannot be done usingelectronic weight gauges, since it causes fatigue in the springs. Hence we move to contact less detection involving acoustic wave. In this system, the inbuilt pressure sensor in RFID is used to measure the level of the gas inside the cylinder. The output of the pressure sensor is given to the PIC controller, where the voltage corresponding to the gas weight is stored. The same is displayed in the LCD, which is connected to the output port of the controller. A threshold value is set in the controller. Once the threshold level is reached, the voltage value is given to the alarm, which alarms the user. And also it is given to the <b>autodialler...</b>|$|R
