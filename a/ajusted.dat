The temperature profile (TP) of the intracluster medium (ICM) is of primeval importance for deriving the dynamical {{parameters of the}} largest equilibrium systems known in the universe, in particular their total mass profile. Analytical models of the ICM often assume that the ICM is isothermal or parametrize the TP with a polytropic index γp.

In this article, I present a theoretical model of a relaxed cluster where the TP is instead structured by electronic thermal conduction. Neglecting cooling and heating terms, the stationnary energy conservation equation reduces to a second order differential equation, whose resolution requires two boundary conditions, taken here as the inner radius and the ratio between inner and outer temperature.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} work we had {{considered}} a Gaussian ensemble of random matrices {{in the presence}} of a given external matrix source. The measure is no longer unitary invariant and the usual techniques based on orthogonal polynomials, or on the Coulomb gas representation, are not available. Nevertheless the n-point correlation functions are still given in terms of the determinant of a kernel, known through an explicit integral representation. This kernel is no longer symmetric though and is not readily accessible to standard methods. In particular finding the level spacing probability is always a delicate problem in Fredholm theory, and we have to reconsider the problem within our model. We find a new class of universality for the level spacing distribution when the spectrum of the source is <b>ajusted</b> to produce a vanishing gap in the density of the state. The problem is solved through coupled non-linear differential equations, which turn out to form a Hamiltonian system. As a result we find that the level spacing probability p(s) behaves like [- C s^ 83] for large spacing s; this is consistent with the asymptotic behavior [- C s^ 2 β + 2], whenever the density of state behaves near the edge as ρ(λ) ∼λ^β.

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} not a mere {{overview}} of the existing legal literature bearing on choice of law rules for marriage, {{nor is it a}} simple survey of the whole range of arguments endorsing one approach over another with regard to this issue: it rather puts forward a sustained argument towards a more appropriate {{way of looking at the}} conflict of law problems in marriage. Though choice of law rules for marriage has long preoccupied scholars and judges alike, the ever increasing antagonism between the preponderance of conflict values [predictability, certainty] and the growing concern to guarantee <b>ajust</b> result in individual atypical cases makes the continuous exploration of this particular topic both necessary and of significant legal interest. The study seeks essentially to establish that, contrary to what most scholars would have us believe, the intractable conflict problems in marriage are not inherent in the inefficiency of the traditional general choice of law rules, nor simply in the interrelation between different social, religious and legal cultures. Rather,they are attributable to the structure of a seemingly modem methodology that focuses more and more on the the attainment of <b>ajust</b> substantive result, the astonishing lack of consensus among legal systems, the disregard of coordination of policy considerations relevant in marriage, the parochial and nationalistic focus in choice of law, as well as in the application of the rule that lex fori is the only source of conflict norms. Further, the inappropriate application of the general choice of law rules, and the lasting antinomy between the international objectives [the attribution of an international relationship to the relevant system] and the national sources of conflict of laws are at the heart of the choice of law problems in marriage. The emerging academic movement to modernise choice of law rules for marriage, with a view to guaranteeing desirable results in hard cases, defeats the very essence of conflict of laws, and renders illusory what little certainty and predictability the normative criteria of the com 1 icts orthodoxies may provide. The underlying reason lies in the inherent disregard of the practical difficulties facing the officials who have, outside the courts, to apply the law and to reconcile the competing goals of predictability and flexibility. The present writer's objective is the development of a more appropriate approach which can establish an equilibrium between the much needed certainty in the present subject and judicial appreciation of the difficulties presented in the individual atypical cases, without scuttling the established conflicts orthodoxies, and at the same time to eliminate the social evil termed "limping marriage". Finally, the domestic and intemationallaw reform agencies should avoid the parochial and nationalistic focus in choice of law, and the rule that lex fori is the only source of conflicts norms if they wish to make a claim that their aim is the attainment of a universal uniform body of rules which will ensure the universal validity of a marriage, and the maximum harmony of decisions...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{recursive}} estimation of a non stationnary signal, disturbed by an independent additive noise. This kind of problem typically has to be solved when the signal is not correctly described by a statistical model, and particularly when the baseline has no regular and no predictible fluctuations, or when the additive measurement noise is non stationnary. In this case, the design of a state estimating filter (the signal and its derivatives) is quite difficult because it is necessary to perform the best tradeoff between the elimination of the additive noise, and the tracking of the high dynamics of the signal. We propose, first, a discrete-type "majorant" model (series of integrators) 'which is a particular case of ARIMA models. Then, we show how to estimate in real time the statistical parameters of the noises in this model, which are used to adapt automatically the Kalman filter gain. However, risky high level dynamics of the signal may occur, and the model is no longer a "majorant" one. A bias appears, and to avoid this problem, we propose to join a high dynamics detector, based on the generalised likelihood ratio. This non linear part of the algorithm reduces the delay and finally leads to an efficient procedure.

This model uses an evolution in density and luminosity of the luminosity function with two breaks at redshift ~ 0. 9 and 2 and contains the two populations of the Lagache et al.

To {{study the}} {{association}} of depression with a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, {{taking into account the}} main risk factors and noncommunicable diseases in Russia residents. Material and methods. The data of ESSE-RF multicenter study (a representative sample of the unorganized male and female population aged 25 - 64 years from 8 regions surveyed in 2012 - 2014) were used in the work. A total 11884 people were involved into the study including 35. 9 % men. The examination included a survey on the standard questionnaire containing data on disease history, etc. The level of depression was assessed by the validated in Russian Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 1983). hsCRP level was determined in all patients. Results. The continuing association between elevated levels of depression (HADS-D ≥ 8 +) and high level of hsCRP ≥ 3. 0 mg/l (odds ratio [OR] 1. 15; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 03 - 1. 27; p= 0. 009) was found in the multivariate model, after adjustment for sex, age, education, and risk factors. Reducing of the relationship of elevated levels of depression {{with a high level of}} hsCRP (OR 1. 11; 95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 24; p= 0. 048) was found with the additional introduction of diseases in the model. This relationship was reduced to not statistically significant level (OR 1. 08; 95 % CI 0. 98 - 1. 20; p= 0. 134) in the full model adjusted for regions. Conclusion. The reduced association of depression with hsCRP <b>ajusted</b> for aggregate risk factors was found in the study. This suggests about multifactor affecting on this relationship. </p...|$|E

A Igreja, instituição hegemônica na Idade Média, vive as tensões da modernidade e luta para refazer-se continuamente (manter seu núcleo). Para isso a instituição deve ajustar-se ao mundo moderno. Na tentativa de mostrar os problemas existentes entre Igreja e mundo moderno, buscamos nos documentos elaborados pela instituição, "ler" sua tentativa de controle sobre a sociedade moderna, o que, diante do inevitável, resulta no "ajustamento" e "diálogo". A Pastoral Operária de Campinas é a referência que torna evidente o palco desta tensão, ao mesmo tempo em que demonstramos a relação existente entre a Igreja, seus agentes e a sociedadeAbstract: The {{objective}} of this master's thesis is to demonstrate the conflict that exists between the catholic church, modernity, and the institution's agents. The church, a hegemonic institution in the Middle Ages, lives the tensions of modernity and struggles to continually renovate itself (maintain its nucleus). To this ender the institution should <b>ajust</b> itself to the modern world. In iIIustrating the existing problems between {{the church and the}} modern world, we haze researched the documents elaborated by the institution, "reading" its attempts at controlling modern society, which faced with the inevitable, has resulted in "adjustments" and "dialogue". The lookers Pastoral of Campinas is the reference which mains evident the site of these tensions while une examine the existing relation between the church, its pastoral agents and societ...|$|R
40|$|So far, the {{researches}} about {{belief in}} <b>ajust</b> world (BJW) have obtained many achievements {{in the fields}} of the behavior of punishing the victim, and the functions of building psychological well-being. There are researches indicated that there are links between religion and BJW especially with Ultimate Justice (Begue, 2002). But to the people who don't have a religion, which support his or her sense of BJW? So we use the participants from China, which don't have religion, and the participants from Indonesia, which are all religion believer to find the answer: The result shows that, both participants from the two countries have the same level of general BJW and social belief; while the Immanent and Ultimate BJW supernatural and pragmatic belief; the Indonesian participants score higher than Chinese participants. To the relationship between BJW and spiritual faith, Chinese participants' BUJ and general BJW are connected with social belief; while the Indonesian part shows the general BJW and Ultimate BJW are corresponded with all belief; and the Immanent BJW is related with Pragmatic Belief and Social Belief The scales we apply are the Just Word scale (Rubin & Peplau, 1973) and Belief in Immanent/Ultimate Justice Scale (Maes, 1999), both have good validity and reliability; and the scale ofspiritual belief (Song Xingchuan, 2004) to find out the difference between Indonesian and Chinese students, and we also use the classical "trolley problem", which is added the variable of obey or violate the norm, to estimate the extend of one concern about the social norm...|$|R
40|$|The Density Functional Theory (DFT) {{method and}} the 6 - 31 G** basis set were {{employed}} to calculate the molecular properties of artemisinin and 20 derivatives with different degrees of cytotoxicity against the human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG 2 line. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) {{were employed to}} select the most important descriptors related to anticancer activity. The significant molecular descriptors related to the compounds with anticancer activity were the ALOGPS_log, Mor 29 m, IC 5 and GAP energy. The Pearson correlation between activity and most important descriptors {{were used for the}} regression partial least squares (PLS) and principal component regression (PCR) models built. The regression PLS and PCR were very close, with variation between PLS and PCR of R 2 = ± 0. 0106, R 2 <b>ajust</b> = ± 0. 0125, s = ± 0. 0234, F(4, 11) = ± 12. 7802, Q 2 = ± 0. 0088, SEV = ± 0. 0132, PRESS = ± 0. 4808 and SPRESS = ± 0. 0057. These models were used to predict the anticancer activity of eight new artemisinin compounds (test set) with unknown activity, and for these new compounds were predicted pharmacokinetic properties: human intestinal absorption (HIA), cellular permeability (PCaCO 2), cell permeability Maden Darby Canine Kidney (PMDCK), skin permeability (PSkin), plasma protein binding (PPB) and penetration of the blood-brain barrier (CBrain/Blood), and toxicological: mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. The test set showed for two new artemisinin compounds satisfactory results for anticancer activity and pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties. Consequently, further studies need be done to evaluate the different proposals as well as their actions, toxicity, and potential use for treatment of cancers...|$|R
