Visual inspection revealed high Varroa destructor and Aethina tumida infestations and low Oplostomus fuligineus infestations. A pathogen screen based on bacterial/fungal cultures or microscopic examinations revealed the absence of American and European foulbrood, chalkbrood disease, <b>acariosis</b> and nosemosis. However, 13 bee samples (15. 47  %) {{were found to be}} infected by viruses as determined by PCR-based techniques. Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV; 8. 33  %) and Black queen cell virus (4. 76  %) were the most common. From the former we found a strain with an unusual molecular signature of the capsid region, which was taxonomically positioned between ABPV and Israeli acute paralysis virus. We also discovered Lake Sinai virus (LSV; 3. 57  %) {{for the first time in}} Africa. Eight honey samples collected in regions where cotton was cultivated were subjected to multi-residue and quality control analyses...|$|E
