This cause was disputed by McGregor who believed that the wake turbulence from an Air France Boeing 727 that had taken off before them had caused the crash.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky {{attended}} Harvard University, {{where he}} studied film and social anthropology, and the American Film Institute {{where he studied}} directing. He won several film awards after completing his senior thesis film, Supermarket Sweep, which {{went on to become}} a National Student Academy Award finalist. Aronofsky's feature debut, the surrealist psychological thriller Pi, was shot in November 1997. The low-budget, $60,000 production, starring Sean Gullette, was sold to Artisan Entertainment for $1 million, and grossed over $3 million; Aronofsky won the Directing Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>Independent</b> Spirit Award for best first screenplay.|$|E

5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> outlook. Those who knew him well thought him destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E
5|$|Due to its sharp {{turns with}} {{restricted}} headroom, high-sided vehicles can only use the left-hand lane {{of the western}} tunnel, {{so it was not}} possible to reverse the tidal flow in the evening. On 20 April 2007 the morning tidal flow was discontinued, after reports by TfL and the Metropolitan Police (MPS) of an increase in dangerous motoring behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during counterflow operations. The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> committee was set up to evaluate the decision. The ending of the counterflow system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due to the change.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to gain {{increased}} support from Polish nationalists and patriots, Napoleon termed the war the Second Polish War—the First Polish War had been the Bar Confederation uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768. Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> Poland created. This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen. Napoleon refused to manumit the Russian serfs because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.|$|E
5|$|It contested the 2008 provincial {{election}} {{under the}} Wildrose Alliance banner, {{and was able}} to capture seven {{percent of the popular vote}} but failed to hold its single seat in the Legislative Assembly. Support for the party rose sharply in 2009 as voters grew increasingly frustrated with the Progressive Conservative (PC) government, resulting in a surprise win by outgoing leader Paul Hinman in an October by-election. In the fall of 2009 Danielle Smith was elected as leader and by December the Wildrose was leading provincial opinion polls ahead of both the governing PCs and the opposition Liberals. Wildrose's caucus grew to four members in 2010, after two former PC members of the Legislative Assembly defected in January <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> MLA joined the party in June of that year.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1966, the Historic Preservation Act {{created the}} National Register of Historic Places and the {{corresponding}} State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPO). Initially, the National Register consisted of the National Historic Landmarks designated before the Register's creation, {{as well as any}} other historic sites in the National Park system. Approval of the act, which was amended in 1980 and 1992, represented the first time the United States had a broad-based historic preservation policy. The 1966 act required those agencies to work in conjunction with the SHPO <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> federal agency, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), to confront adverse effects of federal activities on historic preservation.|$|E

5|$|Peter Dinklage is an American {{actor and}} producer. Dinklage studied acting at the Bennington College where he starred {{in a number}} of amateur stage productions. He made his film debut in the 1995 comedy-drama Living in Oblivion. After {{appearing}} in a series of supporting parts in much of the 1990s and early 2000s, he made his breakthrough by starring in the Tom McCarthy-directed comedy-drama The Station Agent (2003), which had him play a railroad-obsessed introvert who inherits an abandoned train depot. He was cast in the role by director Tom McCarthy who recalled fondly his appearance in McCarthy's play The Killing Act (1995). For his performance, he received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Best Actor <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>Independent</b> Spirit Awards nomination for Best Male Lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} the {{settlement}} agreement, or consent decree, were released on May 26, 2015.

The agreement is not an admission or evidence of liability, nor is it an admission by the city, CDP, or its officers and employees that they have engaged in unconstitutional, illegal, or otherwise improper activities or conduct. Pending approval from a federal judge, the consent decree will be implemented and the agreement is binding.|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} of the Agreement (formally {{referred to as the}} Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly, with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.|$|E

5|$|Bach was in {{his second}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, where the feast was the only {{occasion}} during Lent when festive music was permitted. The theme of the hymn suits both the Annunciation and Palm Sunday, in a spirit of longing expectation of an arrival. An unknown poet retained, as in the other chorale cantatas of Bach's second cantata cycle, the hymn's first and last stanza unchanged, but paraphrased the themes of the inner stanzas to a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes da caccia, two solo violins, strings and continuo. All instruments play in the opening festive chorale fantasia, while the soprano carries the hymn tune and the lower voices answer in counterpoint of instrumental motifs. An oboe da caccia accents the first aria, the solo violins and strings return in the second aria, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> horn part crowns the closing chorale.|$|E
5|$|In February 1975, Whitlam {{decided to}} appoint Senator Murphy a {{justice of the}} High Court of Australia, even though Murphy's Senate seat would not be up for {{election}} if a half-Senate election were held. Under proportional representation, Labor could win {{three of the five}} New South Wales seats, but if Murphy's seat was also contested, it was most unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, appointing Murphy would almost certainly cost the ALP a Senate seat at the next half-Senate election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis, felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 22 October, as the HV neared {{completion}} of the operations to secure Konavle, the 4th Guards Brigade and the 163rd Infantry Brigade moved north-east from Dubrovnik and attacked the VRS positions closest to the city. The main HV attack, assigned to the 3rd and the 5th Battalions of the 4th Guards Brigade, was directed to capture Vlaštica Peak. The 1st Battalion <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> armoured-mechanized company of the 4th Guards Brigade were deployed to draw {{off some of the}} VRS defences as they attacked towards the village of Cerovac and Hum railway station. The 163rd Infantry Brigade supported the main axis of the operation, advancing from Župa Dubrovačka towards Vlaštica. By 26 October, the VRS left flank in Popovo field collapsed and the town of Trebinje, the main Bosnian Serb centre in the region, came into jeopardy. However, Tuđman gave way to international pressure to halt the military operations around Dubrovnik and the fighting stopped by 1 November 1992.|$|E
5|$|The LCL had governed, {{primarily}} {{under the}} stead of Sir Thomas Playford, for 32 years, and finally lost to Labor in 1965. A {{year and a}} half later, when Playford retired, Steele Hall was elected to replace him. A young farmer from a rural constituency, Hall had never conflicted with the party line, and was expected to uphold the existing LCL principles, having spoken out in support of the Playmander and the restrictive Legislative Council before. However, when the LCL was returned to office in 1968 under his leadership, with the help of malapportionment, Hall was under pressure. Labor had led the LCL 52.0 to 43.8% on primary votes, but owing to the Playmander, both ended with 19 seats <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> supported the LCL and returned them to power. Large protests against the Playmander broke out, and there were strong calls for reform.|$|E
