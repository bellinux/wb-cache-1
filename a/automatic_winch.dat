50|$|The centrepiece of {{the complex}} is the timber-lined recital {{auditorium}} which accommodates 353 patrons on stepped tiers with a flat performance area 17 m wide and 12 m deep. The auditorium design has been dictated by the requirements to have natural acoustics for music. This has been achieved {{through the use of}} a traditional ‘rectangular box’ design with a maximum ceiling height of 8 m. The auditorium can be tuned for different instruments and various music/drama performances to achieve desired acoustic qualities. This is accomplished by a system of moveable full-height wall reflectors, suspended ceiling reflectors and rotating wall panels with differing degrees of absorptive linings. The ceiling loft is mechanised with 27 variable speed <b>automatic</b> <b>winch</b> lines which give a great degree of flexibility for a range of shows.|$|E
50|$|The {{snatching}} aircraft - {{typically a}} Dakota has a 20 ft arm that is hanging down at 45 {{degrees from the}} plane, supporting a hook at the tip.The hook {{is attached to a}} steel rope attached to an <b>automatic</b> <b>winch</b> containing 1000 ft of steel cable aboard the tow plane. On flyover, the hook engages in a square shaped loop of nylon tow rope, supported on two poles about 20 ft apart 10 ft off the ground. This loop is attached to an 180 ft nylon tow rope which is attached {{to the front of the}} glider. The special design of the hook means it is less likely to snag the ground but will grab the loop.When the hook engages in the loop, initially the rope pays out from the winch, and then gradually a brake is automatically applied until up to typically 800 ft max of cable is paid out. This, and the stretch in the nylon rope, reduces shock loading to less than 1G and for a duration of around 3 - 6 seconds by which time the glider is airborne. The steel wire is then winched in.It was possible for one plane to pick up 2 gliders in this way - first one, and then another.Gliders were retrieved for re-use in this way after combat operations.Some casualties were evacuated from the D Day landings back to UK using this technique.Several rescues of downed aircraft passengers were also performed by landing gliders to pick up survivors and then snatching them from remote locations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The world’s first ship-to-ship {{automatic}} dock-ing {{system has}} been developed to provide a safe and reli-able solution for docking between two ships exchanging containers in ocean. The system consists of vacuum pads, robot arms, cables, <b>automatic</b> <b>winches</b> and fenders. Basi-cally, the docking status is maintained by contact force of fenders and cable tension controlled by <b>automatic</b> <b>winches.</b> All the developmental procedures from the conceptual design to the final prototype-system demonstration are presented focusing {{on the details of}} the two most important features: the passive- and emergency-mode controls. The passive-mode control makes the docking system freely follow the relative motion between the two ships without resistance. In case of emergency, the emergency-mode control is activated and the docking connection can be instantly released. A prototype was built to demonstrate the technical and operational feasibility in the actual ocean environment...|$|R
50|$|Atlante tugboats are {{equipped}} with a type Britannia tow cable with automatic release, long 400 m (diameter of 40 mm), with <b>automatic</b> towing <b>winch</b> for adjusting the shooting power.They {{are equipped}} with exhaustion means for fire intervention on other units and a fixed installation for anti-pollution duties.|$|R
