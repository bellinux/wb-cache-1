5|$|In time, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia was victorious {{and placed}} the relics in a church in Brookwood Cemetery in Woking, with the enshrinement {{ceremony}} occurring in September 1984. The St Edward Brotherhood of monks was organized there as well. The church is now named St Edward the Martyr Orthodox Church, and it is {{under the jurisdiction of}} a traditionalist Greek Orthodox community. However, while the bones are of approximately the right date, they are of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> late twenties or early thirties rather than a youth in his mid teens.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} production team IKIOI. It opens with a birds-eye view shot from the ground, showing several buildings and trees; just before the first verse, a short shot of Amuro is seen. The first verse opens with Amuro walking down a street in Los Angeles, California, singing to the track. During the verse, intercut scenes include various shadows of children holding instruments behind Amuro. The chorus opens with Amuro walking down along a bridge with the children playing their instruments behind her. When the second chorus starts, the camera pans over to several buildings and landscapes around Los Angeles. The camera then pans into several individuals citizens in the city: an elderly couple, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car, a couple who have just finished surfing, and a woman walking her dog.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{studies of}} the mummy were first thought to reveal <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 50s, but {{subsequent}} examinations have shown that he was instead {{likely to have been}} in his mid-30s when he died. The identity of this mummy (Cairo Museum catalog n° 61057) was called into question in 1980 by the published results of Dr. James Harris, a professor of orthodontics, and Egyptologist Edward Wente. Harris had been allowed to take x-rays of all of the supposed royal mummies at the Cairo Museum. While history records Ahmose I as being the son or possibly the grandson of Seqenenre Tao, the craniofacial morphology of the two mummies are quite different. It is also {{different from that of the}} female mummy identified as Ahmes-Nefertari, thought to be his sister. These inconsistencies, and the fact that this mummy was not posed with arms crossed over chest, as was the fashion of the period for male royal mummies, led them to conclude that this was likely not a royal mummy, leaving the identity of Ahmose I unknown.|$|E

5|$|Umran {{was first}} given {{the command of}} the 5th Brigade in Homs, but was {{promoted}} in June to become commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade. As head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, Jadid appointed friends to senior positions, purged his enemies and appointed several Ba'athists to senior positions. Ahmad Suwaydani, {{one of the new}} members of the Military Committee, was appointed Head of Military Intelligence and Mazyad Hunaydi became Head of the Military Police. The Military Academy at Homs was put under Ba'athist control—several hundred Ba'athists, including Assad's brother Rifaat al-Assad, were given a crash course in military teaching before being given command. Assad became the de facto head of the Syrian Air Force, a dizzying promotion for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> thirties. Considering that the members of the Military Committee were all too young to be perceived as the real leaders of Syria by the populace, the Military Committee appointed Colonel Amin al-Hafiz to the post of Minister of the Interior.|$|E

25|$|During {{excavation}} of Mound 72, a ridge-top burial mound south of Monks Mound, archaeologists found {{the remains of}} <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 40s who was probably an important Cahokian ruler.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was shot several times, and his brother ran him over while escaping in the stolen car; Tamerlan died soon after.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the older}} artists whose work stimulated Leonardo's {{scientific}} interest was Piero della Francesca, then <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 60s, {{who was one}} of the earliest artists to systematically employ linear perspective in his paintings, and who had a greater understanding of the science of light than any other artist of his date. While Leonardo's teacher, Verrocchio, largely ignored Piero's scientifically disciplined approach to painting, Leonardo and Domenico Ghirlandaio, who also worked at Verrocchio's workshop, did not. Two of Leonardo's earliest paintings, both scenes of the Annunciation show his competent understanding of the linear perspective.|$|E
25|$|Later in 572, the thirty-five dukes {{assembled}} in Pavia to hail king Cleph. The new monarch extended {{the boundaries of}} the kingdom, completing the conquest of Tuscia and laying siege to Ravenna. Cleph tried to pursue the policy of Alboin consistently, which aimed to break the legal-administrative institutions firmly established during Ostrogoth and Byzantine rule. He achieved this by eliminating much of the Latin aristocracy, through occupying their lands and acquiring their assets. However, he too, fell victim to regicide in 574, slain by <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> entourage who perhaps colluded with the Byzantines.|$|E

Thanks to the rejuvenative properties of the Starheart, Scott's physical body is again temporarily revitalized so that he resembles <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 30s or early 40s.

25|$|Another three {{deaths were}} {{confirmed}} on 16 August, total death cases tally {{now stands at}} 62. The 59th death is a 6-year-old kid with Down's syndrome. He had the flu for 3 days and confirmed as a H1N1 patient. He died on 13 August due to pneumonia with underlying Down's syndrome with AVSD and pulmonary hypertension. A 3-year-old child was hospitalised on 1 August after having symptoms for 5 days. Confirmed to have contracted the virus on 3 August and antiviral drugs were given on the same day. However, he died on 14 August due to severe pneumonia. <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 50s who had symptoms on 28 July was hospitalised. He was also suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea two days before he was admitted. On 13 August, he was confirmed dead due to septicaemia with severe pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Aged 17, {{she agreed}} to marry Nikifor Vladimirovich Blavatsky, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> forties who worked as Vice Governor of Erivan Province. Her reasons for doing so were unclear, {{although}} she later claimed that she was attracted by his belief in magic. Although she tried to back out shortly before the wedding ceremony, the marriage took place on 7 July 1849. Moving {{with him to the}} Sardar Palace, she made repeated unsuccessful attempts to escape and return to her family in Tiflis, to which he eventually relented. The family sent her, accompanied by a servant and maid, to Odessa to meet her father, who planned to return to Saint Petersburg with her. The escorts accompanied her to Poti and then Kerch, intending to continue with her to Odessa. Blavatsky claimed that, fleeing her escorts and bribing the captain of the ship that had taken her to Kerch, she reached Constantinople. This marked the start of nine years spent traveling the world, possibly financed by her father.|$|E
