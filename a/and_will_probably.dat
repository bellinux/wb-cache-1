5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E
25|$|The EMU is now {{waiting in}} the SKM sheds in Gdynia Cisowa <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> {{be used as an}} old-style {{customer}} service office on one of the stops. The train is well preserved and SKM officials say the renovation will not be difficult.|$|E
25|$|Also 19 {{deposits}} of oil shales {{have been identified}} in Canada. The most explored deposits are in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. These are not as large as those in the Western United States, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> remain undeveloped in the foreseeable future since they are much more expensive and much smaller than the oil sands.|$|E

25|$|In surfing, Justin Mujica, European surfing {{champion}} in 2004, is {{now back in}} the competitions after recovering from a knee injury. Tiago Pires reached the number one position at ASP WQS rating, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> {{be part of the}} main surfing competition. Ruben Gonzalez is an international acclaimed surfer and the only one to achieve the national title in two consecutive tournaments.|$|E
25|$|Even if new {{technology}} is able to compete with traditional recovery boiler technology the transition {{will most likely be}} gradual. First, manufacturers of recovery boilers such as Metso, Andritz and Mitsubishi, can be expected to continue development of their products. Second, Tomlinson recovery boilers have a long life span, often around 40 years, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> not be replaced until the end of their economic lifetime, and may in the meantime be upgraded at intervals of 10 – 15 years.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{transmission}} of a swine flu virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible (zoonotic swine flu). In all, 50 cases {{are known to}} have occurred since the first report in medical literature in 1958, which have resulted in a total of six deaths. Of these six people, one was pregnant, one had leukemia, one had Hodgkin's lymphoma and two were known to be previously healthy. Despite these apparently low numbers of infections, the true rate of infection may be higher, since most cases only cause a very mild disease, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> never be reported or diagnosed.|$|E

25|$|In all {{instances}} where R2 is used, the predictors are calculated by ordinary least-squares regression: that is, by minimizing SSres. In this case R2 increases as we {{increase the number}} of variables in the model (R2 is monotone increasing with the number of variables included—i.e., it will never decrease). This illustrates a drawback to one possible use of R2, where one might keep adding variables (Kitchen sink regression) to increase the R2 value. For example, if one is trying to predict the sales of a model of car from the car's gas mileage, price, and engine power, one can include such irrelevant factors as the first letter of the model's name or the height of the lead engineer designing the car because the R2 will never decrease as variables are added <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> experience an increase due to chance alone.|$|E
500|$|The Tao Te Ching or Daodejing {{is widely}} {{considered}} the most influential Taoist text. According to legend, {{it was written by}} Laozi, and often the book is simply referred to as the [...] "Laozi." [...] However, authorship, precise date of origin, and even unity of the text are still subject of debate, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> never be known with certainty. The earliest texts of the Tao Te Ching that have been excavated (written on bamboo tablets) date back to the late 4th century BCE. Throughout the history of religious Taoism, the Tao Te Ching {{has been used as a}} ritual text.|$|E
500|$|Many {{details about}} the making of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari are in dispute <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> remain {{unsettled}} due to {{the large number of}} people involved in the making of the film, many of whom have recalled it differently or dramatized their own contributions to its production. Production of the film was delayed about four or five months after the script was purchased. Pommer originally chose Lang as the director of Caligari, and Lang {{even went so far as}} to hold preparatory discussions about the script with Janowitz, but he became unavailable due to his involvement with the filming of The Spiders, so Wiene was selected instead. According to Janowitz, Wiene's father, a successful theatre actor, had [...] "gone slightly mad when he could no longer appear on the stage", and Janowitz believed that experience helped Wiene bring an [...] "intimate understanding" [...] to the source material of Caligari.|$|E

500|$|The band {{released}} teaser trailers first, and {{the full}} video premiered on June 27, 2011, 1 pm (Eastern Time), on the band's website. Jon Blistein of Billboard commented that the video [...] "is sweet <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> make you smile." [...] AOL's The Boot also liked the video, writing, [...] "If the storyline itself doesn't make you fall head over heels, the gorgeous scenery surely will, as the clip was shot in various picturesque places around the world." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Taste of Country noted that the video was [...] "heart-pinching". The Tennessean wrote that the [...] "sweet sentimentality should score with fans of ... 'Need You Now'." [...] However, Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed the video [...] "sugary". Robbie Daw of Idolator wrote, [...] "Lady A's [...] "Just A Kiss" [...] video got us choked up after one viewing. Clearly {{we need to get}} out more." ...|$|E
500|$|For the 2002 album One Deep Breath, Joseph {{combines}} [...] "structured melodic {{pieces and}} free-form ambient compositions", which [...] "departs dramatically {{from the previous}} more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings, Hear the Masses and Rapture". [...] Binkelman writes, [...] "It is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between." [...] For instance, the song [...] "Dance of Life" [...] was inspired by Antonín Dvořák's opera, [...] "Rusalka". [...] It {{is a bit more}} straightforward in its piano presentation, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> appeal the most to hardcore fans of solo instrumental music, says Instrumental Weekly. [...] Then the album closes with its title track, [...] "One Deep Breath", that [...] "floats and meanders for more than ten minutes, bringing in ocean sounds". It is [...] "far and away the most ambient of everything else to be found here", [...] and is [...] "stunning, both in its execution and how radical a change it is from what has come before".|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} of the Palmyrene deity as Aurelian's Sol Invictus is inferred from a passage by Zosimus reading: [...] "and the magnificent temple of the sun he (i.e. Aurelian) embellished with votive gifts from Palmyra, setting up statues of Helios and Bel". Three deities from Palmyra exemplified solar features: Malakbel, Yarhibol and Shamash, hence {{the identification of the}} Palmyrene Helios appearing in Zosimus' work with Malakbel. Some scholars criticize the notion of Malakbel's identification with Sol Invictus; according to Gaston Halsberghe, the cult of Malakbel was too local for it to become an imperial Roman god and Aurelian's restoration of Bel's temple and sacrifices dedicated to Malakbel were a sign of his attachment to the sun god in general and his respect to the many ways in which the deity was worshiped. Richard Stoneman suggested another approach in which Aurelian simply borrowed the imagery of Malakbel to enhance his own solar deity. The relation between Malakbel and Sol Invictus can not be confirmed <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> remain unresolved.|$|E

500|$|NME writer Rick Martin, despite hearing [...] "flashes {{of their}} {{previous}} class" [...] proving [...] "they haven't completely lost their confrontational electro-rock streak", considered {{too much of it}} [...] "pedestrian, anodyne and utterly unremarkable", and wondered [...] "why they ever ditched the near-perfect mid-'90s FM rock of [...] "Stupid Girl"." [...] BBC Music writer Tom Hocknell felt that the band's relocation to L.A. made [...] "no discernible difference to the band's sound" [...] but that [...] "despite occasional lapses into overproduced mess, the surprise here is their enthusiasm." [...] Similarly, Jamie Carson of Clash disapproved of the production, calling it [...] "pompousness" [...] and [...] "annoying", and Mark Davison of No Ripcord remarked that [...] "for all the interesting noises that the band have come up [...] production really doesn't do them any favours, cramming them into a fairly narrow space and stripping them almost entirely of any sense of atmosphere", concluding that the album is nonetheless [...] "enjoyable, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> go down better than their last two releases." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel {{opens in}} 1954 {{in the small}} logging {{settlement}} of Twisted River on the Androscoggin River in northern New Hampshire. A log driving accident on the river has just claimed {{the life of a}} young logger, Angel, who slipped and fell under the logs. Dominic Baciagalupo is the camp's Italian-American cook who lives above the kitchen with his 12-year-old son, Daniel. Dominic lost his wife, Rosie, 10 years previously when a drunk Dominic, Rosie and a logger and mutual friend, Ketchum, were dancing on the frozen river, and the ice broke and Rosie went under. Later another accident happens that changes the lives of Dominic, Daniel and Ketchum. [...] "Injun Jane", the kitchen's dishwasher and girlfriend of the local law officer, Constable Carl, is having an affair with Dominic. One night, mistaking her for a bear attacking his father, Daniel kills her with an eight-inch cast-iron skillet. Dominic takes Jane's body and deposits it on the kitchen floor of Carl's house, knowing that Carl will be passed out drunk <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> believe he killed her, as he often beat her up. Early the next morning Dominic and Daniel tell Ketchum what happened and flee Twisted River in case the bad-tempered Carl finds out what really happened.|$|E

"There is a {{twist to}} this story which will please every humanist <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> keep Harvard professors puzzled for years," [...] said Keough at a press conference.

2500|$|In July 2009, Girls Aloud {{announced}} {{they would take}} a year-long hiatus to pursue solo projects. In August 2010, bandmate Nicola Roberts revealed {{that she was not}} anticipating a reunion of Girls Aloud until 2012. Walsh had revealed that she does not think it is possible Girls Aloud will ever [...] "officially break up". She explained that they are planning to tour again <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> take breaks from time to time, doing solo projects but they will never permanently go their separate ways.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-1952 Pakistani Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin {{unveiled}} to Bowles [...] "substantial" [...] concessions that Pakistan {{was prepared}} to make on its military presence in Kashmir if India agreed to {{the appointment of a}} plebiscite administrator. The Pakistanis asked Bowles to convey this message informally and Bowles was also instructed to do this in the [...] "capacity of a friendly messenger". Nehru rejected this offer.
