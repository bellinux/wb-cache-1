5|$|Before Croatia's {{independence}} distinct Croatian football federations <b>and</b> <b>teams</b> were occasionally formed {{separately from}} the official Yugoslavian organisations. Ivo Kraljević served as {{the manager of the}} initial federation, established in 1939, and organised non-sanctioned matches played by unofficial national squads up to 1956. These temporary sides, playing non-competitive fixtures, were led by seven different managers.|$|E

The reserve team competed in the Hampshire League 2004 from 2008 to 2011. In addition to their first and reserve teams, Andover FC also ran a number of youth teams; an under-18s team competing in the North East Hampshire Youth League, <b>and</b> <b>teams</b> for other age groups ranging from under-7s to under-15s. The under-18s also competed in the FA Youth Cup.|$|E
5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known of clubs <b>and</b> <b>teams,</b> players and locations.|$|E

5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with the players <b>and</b> <b>teams,</b> as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E

The model was empirically tested with data from 141 knowledge-intensive teams. The empirical findings showed that team collectivism had a positive relationship with <b>team</b> development competition <b>and</b> a negative relationship with team hypercompetition. Regarding the outcomes, <b>team</b> development competition <b>and</b> <b>team</b> hypercompetition had an indirect relationship with knowledge sharing <b>and</b> <b>team</b> flexibility through team empowerment.

Nanking itself was surrounded by formidable stone walls stretching almost fifty kilometers (31 miles) around the entire city. The walls, which had been constructed hundreds of years earlier during the Ming Dynasty, rose up to twenty meters (65 feet) in height, were nine meters (30 feet) thick, and had been studded with machine gun emplacements.

40|$|When {{working as}} a member of a team, {{individuals}} must make decisions concerning the allocation of resources (e. g., effort) toward individual goals <b>and</b> <b>team</b> goals. As a result, individual <b>and</b> <b>team</b> goals, <b>and</b> feedback related to progress toward these goals, should be potent levers for affecting resource allocation decisions. This research develops a multilevel, multiple-goal model of individual <b>and</b> <b>team</b> regulatory processes that affect the allocation of resources across individual <b>and</b> <b>team</b> goals resulting in individual <b>and</b> <b>team</b> performance. On the basis of this model, predictions concerning the impact of individual <b>and</b> <b>team</b> performance feedback are examined empirically to evaluate the model and to understand the influence of feedback on regulatory processes and resource allocation. Two hundred thirty-seven participants were randomly formed into 79 teams of 3 that performed a simulated radar task that required teamwork. Results support the model and the predicted role of feedback in affecting the allocation of resources when individuals strive to accomplish both individual <b>and</b> <b>team</b> goals. One of the hallmarks of the changing nature of work is the increasing shift to the use of teams as the basic organizing unit. This shift has implications for training that is designed to enhance both individual <b>and</b> <b>team</b> performance. Although a number of tea...|$|R
