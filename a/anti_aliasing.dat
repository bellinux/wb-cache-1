In this paper {{we will discuss}} the spatial domain sampling and prevention of aliasing in digital cameras. We focus on the widely used birefringent <b>anti</b> <b>alias</b> filters that are often called optical low pass filters (OLPF). We show 2 D models for all contributions to spatial domain sampling and derive optimum filter parameters for minimum aliasing and best possible image sharpness.

These tails must be eliminated {{in order to maintain the}} transverse and longitudinal beam size. Instead of the currently used phosphor camera system, this instrument consists of a Multi Wire Proportional Chamber (MWPC) front end coupled to an EPICS compliant VME-based electronics package. Low momentum tails are detected with a resolution of 5 mm in the MWPC at a high dispersion point near a bending magnet. While phosphor is typically not sensitive in the nano amp range, the MWPC is sensitive down to about a pico amp. The electronics package will process the signals from each of the MWPC wires to generate an array of beam currents at each of the lower energies. The electronics will have a wideband analog front end, active <b>anti</b> <b>alias</b> filter, and high-speed analog to digital converter for each wire. Data from multiple wires will be processed with an embedded digital signal processor and results placed in a set of VME registers. An EPICS application will assemble the data from these VME registers into a display of beam current vs. beam energy (momentum) in the LANSCE control room. This display will update at least once per second, but will be a representation of the real time signal processing results from the electronics package...|$|R

40|$|Rendering is {{generating}} {{surface and}} three-dimensional effects on an object {{displayed on a}} monitor screen. Ray tracing as a rendering method that traces ray for each image pixel has a drawback, that is, aliasing (jaggies effect). There are some methods for executing <b>anti</b> <b>aliasing.</b> One of those methods is OGSS (Ordered Grid Super Sampling). OGSS is able to perform aliasing well. However, this method requires more computation time since sampling of all pixels in the image will be increased. Fragment <b>Anti</b> <b>Aliasing</b> (FAA) is a new alternative method that can cope with the drawback. FAA will check the image when performing rendering to a scene. Jaggies effect is only happened at curve and gradient object. Therefore, only this part of object that will experience sampling magnification. After this sampling magnification and the pixel values are computed, then downsample is performed to retrieve the original pixel values. Experimental {{results show that the}} software can implement ray tracing well in order to form images, and it can implement FAA and OGSS technique to perform <b>anti</b> <b>aliasing.</b> In general, rendering using FAA is faster than using OGSS although there is some situation where the time effectiveness is equal. This is possible since the process of intersection searching on FAA needs additional time. Rendered images using FAA are relatively similar to those using OGSS...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} and investigate Tiled Shading. The tiled techniques, though simple, enable substantial improvements to both deferred and forward shading. Tiled Shading has previously been talked about {{only in terms of}} deferred shading (Tiled Deferred Shading). We contribute a more detailed description of the technique, introduce Tiled Forward Shading (a generalization of Tiled Deferred Shading to also apply to forward shading), and a thorough performance evaluation. Tiled Forward Shading has many of the advantages of deferred shading, e. g. scene management and light management is decoupled. At the same time, unlike traditional deferred and tiled deferred shading, Full Screen <b>Anti</b> <b>Aliasing</b> and transparency is trivially supported. We also contribute a thorough comparison of the performance of Tiled Deferred, Tiled Forward and traditional deferred shading. Our evaluation shows that Tiled Deferred Shading has the least variable worst case performance, and scales the best with faster GPUs. Tiled Deferred Shading is especially suitable when there are many light sources. Tiled Forward Shading is shown to be competitive for scenes with fewer lights, while being much simpler than traditional forward shading techniques. Tiled shading also enables simple transitioning between deferred and forward shading. We demonstrate how this can be used to handle transparent geometry, frequently a problem when using deferred shading. ...|$|E

Piezoelectric sensor is a kind of sensor that most widely used in measuring acceleration, is also called acceleration sensor or accelerometer, because its impulse response is excellent and is suitable for measuring shock.

40|$|Filtering and {{frequency}} down conversion are two key operations in modern radio communications systems. Two separate circuits, the mixer and the filter, {{have traditionally been}} used to perform these functions. As the operation of such circuits is continuously being pushed to higher frequency bands, {{there is a need}} to devise circuit architectures and design techniques allowing the best possible use of the technology bandwidth. This work exploits the use of multi rate signal processing techniques, namely decimation, in a classical N-path filter structure as a means of achieving high selectivity filtering together with the additional function of frequency down conversion that is particularly useful in modern communication systems. Besides, the proposed technique also provides an increased <b>anti</b> <b>aliasing</b> response without increasing the operating frequency of the circuits. A theoretical study of the new architecture is presented first. Then, several switched capacitor circuits are described. An integrated circuit implementation of this technique is also presented. The circuit has two passbands, one centered at 37. 5 MHz and the other centered at 12. 5 MHz, the input sampling rate is 100 M samples/s. The circuit was implemented in 0. 8 um CMOS technology. The power dissipation is 125 m W drawn from a 5 V supply. The die area is 10. 25 mm" 2.

40|$|In {{a process}} monitoring/control {{applications}} tens {{to thousands of}} sensors are used for monitoring system parameters. To achieve overall system goals, their reliable performance is critical. Generally a sensor’s output signal is too small or too noisy {{and may not be}} compatible with the input requirements of a Data Acquisition System. The sensor is interfaced to Data Acquisition System, through cabling, junction boxes and Interface Electronics like excitation circuitry, multiplexers, signal-conditioning circuitry etc. An interface or signal conditioning circuit does impedance matching, filtering, multiplexing, pre-amplification, amplification and digitization to make the sensor’s output signal compatible with the Data Acquisition System. Conventional Signal Conditioning includes Multiplexers, <b>Anti</b> <b>aliasing</b> filters, Operational Amplifier, Instrumentation Amplifiers, Isolation Amplifiers and Charge Preamplifiers etc. Operational Amplifiers e. g. voltage followers with High input impedance and low output impedance are used for impedance matching between the sensor and processing electronics. <b>Anti</b> <b>aliasing</b> filters remove noise from the sensor’s output signal. Normally the sensor is located away from the processing electronics and data is transmitted through wires/cables. During transmission, interference from external fields’ especially strong Audio Frequency, Radio Frequency and 50 Hz power line fields affects the sensor’s output signal. To minimize the effect of external field twisted pair shielded cables are used. Amplifiers with Differential input configuration are used to suppress the effect of interfering signals. Differential input Instrumentation Amplifiers with High input impedance, high CMRR; are most widely employed. Isolation Amplifiers isolate the input and output circuits by an extremely high impedance. Galvanic, optical isolations are most common. The conditioned data is transmitted to Data Acquisition System (DAS) and at the DAS the signal is multiplexed, filtered and digitized using Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs), followed by Digital Filtering and processing. For Control applications, the processed data is converted back to analog form using Digital to Analog Converters (DACs) for interfacing to external world. The transmission distance varies from tens of centimeters to few meters. Depending upon the distance twisted pair cables, IR transmission and Optical transmission is employed. During transmission, the data is prone to interferences from EMI, EMC, Noise and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) degradation with distance. This affects the reliability of the system and increases the overall system cost. To eliminate the effects due to the environmental disturbances during transmission and to maintain signal integrity, it is preferred to have a unique and compact solution for each sensor where signal conditioning (excitation, filtering, amplification, compensation and digitization) is carried out and digital data can be transmitted to Data Acquisition System. Here each sensor has its own signal conditioning module. Directly interfacing sensors with micro controller yields simple and compact design solutions. Direct Sensor interface Technology (DSiT) is one {{of the state of the}} art technologies for sensor interfaces where an unconditioned, uncompensated, raw output signals from sensors are interfaced directly to a single-chip solution. The sensors’ output are multiplexed using Multiplexer; Amplified using Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA), digitized using ADC, filtered using Digital Filters and transmitted using Digital Interfaces (SPI, I 2 C, UART) in a single chip. DSiT scheme incorporates all the elements necessary in an instrumentation system creating a balanced combination of features, to create truly intelligent sensor systems. The sensors are interfaced directly to a single DSiT chip, without any additional circuitry and the direct digital data transmission is achieved with the help of Digital Interfaces SPI, UART, SMBus/I 2 C. As this involves onchip signal conditioning and digital data transmission, expenditure on additional signal conditioning circuitry, analog interfaces for analog data transmission, separate Analog to Digital Converter for each sensor is reduced. This reduces the overall system cost and as the count of discrete components is reduced the system reliability is improved. In addition, as the data is transmitted digitally the effects of noise, S/N degradation and electromagnetic interferences are eliminated. The accuracy level achieved is sufficiently good for monitoring and control applications. In Launch Vehicles/Satellites number of sensors are used for performance evaluation, monitoring and control purposes. Harnessing, signal conditioning of the sensors’ output and onboard processing of the sensor data is carried out individually for each sensor. Implementation of the DSiT system will reduce the total weight of the launch vehicles and satellites, resulting in reduced overall system cost, increased reliability and reduced onboard processing overhead. In addition, the reduction in weight allows incorporation of larger payloads/ more propellant loading in payloads which increases the life of the Satellites. As it is compact, it can be readily used for facility parameter measurements during the ground testing of liquid engines and stages at LPSC/ISRO. Implementation of DSiT for facility parameter measurements will reduce the cabling cost and improve the reliability of the chain...|$|E
40|$|We present {{details of}} Tiled and Clustered Forward Shading in its {{application}} to rendering transparent geometry and using Multi Sampling <b>Anti</b> <b>Aliasing</b> (MSAA). We detail how transparency and MSAA is supported, and present performance results measured on modern GPUs. Previous techniques for handling large numbers of lights are usually based on deferred shading [Andersson 2009; Lauritzen 2010]. However, deferred shading techniques struggle with impractically large frame buffers when MSAA is used, and make supporting transparency difficult. In addition, deferred shading {{makes it more difficult}} to support custom shaders on geometry. Tiled Forward Shading is a new and highly practical approach to real-time shading scenes with thousands of light sources, introduced by Olsson and Assarsson in 2011 [2011]. Their results, measured on an GTX 280 GPU, indicated that tiled forward shading was impractically slow. Performance on more recent GPUs has improved considerably (approaching that of tiled deferred), which opens up the possibility of using the technique to support transparency and MSAA. Clustered Shading further extends tiled shading by adding depth partitioning [Olsson et al. 2012]. We show how Clustered Forward Shading can be extended to support transparency efficiently. Forward shading naturally supports both transparency and MSAA, which has been shown in previous work. However, the performance and implementation details have not previously been investigated. We provide details on how to construct the light grid for use with transparency. When the transparent geometry is considered, the depth range optimization cannot be fully used. Instead, only a more conventional hierarchical depth test can be used. The grid structure can be built once, and quickly pruned to prepare a more efficient instance for opaque geometry. However, as each transparent layer must consider all the lights in the tile, performance does not scale linearly with the depth complexity, but far worse (Figure 1, right). To improve on this we extend clustered forward shading by constructing the grid using a pre-pass over all geometry (not just opaque), and flagging clusters as a side effect. This allows us to quickly find the unique clusters used. As clusters contain only space around actual samples that need shading, efficiency is much better (Figure 1, left). For deferred shading a single 1080 p, 16 x MSAA, 16 -bit float RGBA buffer requires over 250 Mb of memory. In addition, each sample may need to be shaded individually, effectively running shading at a per-sample frequency. For forward shading, no G-Buffers are required and MSAA is trivially enabled. A brief performance and memory comparison is shown in Figure 2, showing that clustered forward outperforms tiled forward by more than 2 times, and also outperforms tiled deferred, if MSAA is used...|$|E
