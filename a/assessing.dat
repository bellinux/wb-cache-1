5|$|Fleiss' kappa (named after Joseph L.

This contrasts with other kappas such as Cohen's kappa, which only work when <b>assessing</b> the agreement between not more than two raters or the interrater reliability for one appraiser versus themself. The measure calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance. There is no generally agreed-upon measure of significance, although guidelines have been given.|$|E
