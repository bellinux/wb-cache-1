40|$|The {{breeding}} {{objectives for}} Swedish Warmblood horses are aiming for producing horses {{that have a}} good conformation and are internationally competitive in dressage and show jumping. It also states that the horses should be durable. The aim of this thesis was to investigate whether {{it is possible to}} use existing competition statistics for genetic evaluation of durability and, if so, how this should be done. Number of years in competition (NYC) was used as a measure of durability. Genetic analyses were performed using linear animal models where heritabilities, genetic correlations, and breeding values (EBV) were estimated. It was concluded that birth year and age at first placing should be included as fixed effects in the model. Age at first placing is, to a great extent, reflecting the talent of the horse and since information about durability is desired, the suggestion is to adjust for the age effect in the analyses of NYC. Three different datasets were tested when heritabilities and EBVs were estimated. The datasets varied based on sex and birth year of the included horses. Heritabilities for NYC were in the same range for all three datasets (total 0. 06 - 0. 07; show jumping 0. 08 - 0. 12; dressage 0. 07 - 0. 08; eventing 0. 04 - 0. 08) and there were high correlations between EBVs within the same discipline for the different datasets. The genetic correlations between total NYC and performance traits from competition and Riding Horse Quality Test (RHQT) were higher for jumping traits (0. 65 - 0. 69) than for dressage (0. 27 - 0. 40) indicating that there are connections between level of performance and NYC. The conclusions of the results were that it is recommended to estimate EBVs for NYC for stallions with a linear animal model and that they should be published for each discipline separately. Besides the genetic analyses, the study showed that horses with successful results from more than one discipline at an early age had significantly more years in competition compared to the other horses. This indicates that an <b>all-round</b> <b>training</b> of young horses has a positive effect on the durability of the horse...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Regular {{physical}} activity may improve {{different aspects of}} wellbeing in older people, such as quality of life, vitality and depression. However, there is little experimental evidence to support this assumption. Therefore, we examined the effect of different training protocols on quality of life, vitality and depression of older adults living in long-term care facilities. Methods Subjects (n = 173, aged 64 to 94 years, living in long-term care facilities), were randomized to six months of three different moderate-intensity group exercise training protocols, or to an 'educational' control condition. Exercise consisted of two 45 – 60 -minute training sessions per week of 1) resistance training; 2) all-round, functional training; or 3) a combination of both. Perceived health, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the Vitality Plus Scale (VPS) and the Dementia Quality of Life questionnaire (DQoL) were administered at baseline and after six months. Results In the combined training group a small but significant decline was seen in perceived health, DQoL and VPS score compared to the control group. Conclusions We conclude that neither strength <b>training</b> nor <b>all-round,</b> functional <b>training</b> of moderate intensity is effective in improving quality of life, vitality or depression of older people living in long-term care facilities. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a project-based syllabus as an innovative approach to translator training in higher education. The learner-centred syllabus raises {{the awareness of}} translation skills and competences among trainee translators and can provide an enhanced <b>all-round</b> translator <b>training</b> in higher education, from an academic {{as well as a}} vocational perspective. The project-based syllabus was trialled in the module Translation and Technology of the Master’s degree in Translation Studies at Durham University (UK), which aims to familiarise students with internet-based and computer-aided translation tools. A three-year study conducted between 2009 and 2012 was an inquiry into the impact of the syllabus on students’ translation competences and skills. The quality and quantity of literature since the 1980 s have shown that Translation Studies has become an independent discipline, partly thanks to scholars who have mapped the discipline, such as Holmes (1988) and Toury (1995, 2012), and others who have directed the spotlights on didactics, such as Kiraly (1995) and Pym (1993 - present) among others. The discussion of didactics and pedagogy, particularly in relation to translation technology, is to be found mainly in articles, chapters in collected volumes, or in conference papers. Against this background, the project-based syllabus is put forward as a suitable and complementary teaching method which helps students meet academic as well as professional requirements. In the thesis, I will place the project-based syllabus in context, describe its origin, discuss the rationale for its implementation, and the outcomes of the study...|$|R
40|$|The present essay {{discusses}} {{the results of}} a survey aimed at investigating {{the state of the art}} in translator training practices at tertiary level at Universities and Translator and Interpreter (T&I) Institutions and assesses the degree to which their educational and professional goals are equipped to meet the challenges that prospective translators increasingly have to face in a rapidly evolving world. The object of the survey was to observe and report on the situations where translation is taught as an end in itself rather than as a means of learning a foreign language. Thus, T&I institutions as well as other centres of higher education, especially modern language faculties with established professionally-oriented translation courses, mainly in Europe and North America were included in the survey. The first part of the essay provides an overview of the way curricula and courses are structured and examines the underlying rationale. The second part looks specifically at methodological issues such as the inclusion and sequencing of theoretical and practical components, and the availability of up-to-date technological tools. The final part of the essay {{discusses the}}se findings in relation to market needs and the rapidly changing profile of translators in the professional world. An important aspect of the survey was to glean whether the courses offered by the various institutions envisaged a blend of educational and vocational ingredients in order better to meet real-life criteria. What emerged was a general trend on the part of the majority of institutions to envisage an <b>all-round</b> translation <b>training</b> programme in their curricula to satisfy not only market needs but also the growing demands within higher education for professionally-oriented degrees...|$|R
40|$|The Era of {{knowledge}} Economy has come, and “knowledge” {{has become a}} key resource for enterprises. How to keep creating and utilizing new knowledge has become an important topic for modern business management. In the future, how to manage “knowledge” efficiently and effectively will be a crucial issue. However, {{due to differences in}} training backgrounds, people may have different perspectives on knowledge management; and effectiveness {{of knowledge}} management may not be maximized due to lack of integration. Because of this, the Departments of Library and Information Science, Business Administration, Information Management, Computer Science and Information Engineering in National Taiwan University have worked together to propose a “Knowledge Management Curriculum Program” with an aim to educate and to <b>train</b> <b>all-round</b> knowledge management professionals. This paper begins with that knowledge management (KM) will be the trend of business management in the 21 st century, followed by the need to train cross-field KM professionals and channels for such training. Lastly, it takes “KM Curriculum Program, NTU” as an example to explain the ideas behind its education and training. Furthermore, by sharing of experiences, it is our hope to motivate other colleges and universities to draw up similar programs to train more skillful KM professionals and to improve Taiwan’s competitiveness in the business world.

50|$|The trophy was {{originally}} awarded in a competition held between bomber squadrons of the Air Defence of Great Britain, which {{came in the}} Wessex Bombing Area — the precursor of Bomber Command. Wing Commander Charles Portal, commander of No. 7 Squadron, won the trophy in its initial year of 1927, and then again in 1928. The 1928 contest {{took place at the}} North Coates Fitties bombing range where Portal, in a Vickers Virginia flying at 10000 ft, dropped his bombs to within 30 - 40 yd of the target. From 1930 until 1936, the competition was confined to night bombing squadrons in home commands, and was then in abeyance until revived in 1949, when it was awarded to the Bomber Command squadron showing the best <b>all-round</b> excellence in <b>training</b> throughout the year. The annual awards gradually petered out in the late 1950s. In 2011 the trophy was found to be at the official residence of the Chief of the Air Staff, and at their request was transferred to the Officer's Mess of No. 57 Squadron at RAF Wyton. In August 2013 No. 57 Squadron also acquired Captain Minôt's Military Cross, presented to them by one of his last remaining relatives.|$|R
40|$|Background: African politicians, {{bureaucrats and}} technocrats have thrown their weight {{in support of}} {{monitoring}} and evaluation (M&E). This weight has compelled training institutions to add M&E to their offerings. Most often {{at the end of}} these training programmes, attendees know what they have learnt but seem not to internalise it and, worse, they hardly ever put their newly acquired knowledge into practice. This allegation has led to what we term ‘monitoring and evaluation training hopping’ where participants move from one training to another hoping that they will eventually fully comprehend the skill and apply it to their work. This rarely happens and as such participants often blame themselves and yet the problem is with the training institutions that are teaching the middle-third tier (how to monitor and evaluate) as well as the bottom-third tier (data and information management). However, the top-third tier that links M&E to ‘the what’ and ‘the how’ as well as ‘the why’ in the development intervention and public policy landscape is missing. Objectives: To propose a M&E curriculum that institutionalises M&E within implementation and management of development interventions. Method: We use systems thinking to derive the key themes of our discussion and then apply summative thematic content analysis to interrogate M&E and related literature. Firstly, we present and describe a model that situates M&E within development and public policy. This model ‘idealises or realises’ an institutionalised M&E by systematically linking the contextual as well as key terms prominent in established descriptions of M&E. Secondly, we briefly describe M&E from a systems thinking approach by pointing out its components, processes, established facts, as well as issues and debates. Lastly, we use this model and the systems thinking description of M&E to propose an institutionalised M&E curriculum. Results: Our results show that for an explicit understanding of M&E, one needs to understand all three tiers of M&E. These are development interventions and public policy (top tier), M&E concepts, terminologies and logic (middle tier) and data collection and storage, data processing and analysis, reporting and some aspects of integrating the findings into planning, implementation and management (bottom tier). Conclusion: Unless we offer an <b>all-round</b> M&E <b>training,</b> we will not move beyond monitoring and evaluating development interventions for compliance...|$|R
40|$|In today's {{environment}} and society, modern technology is present everywhere. This so-called modern era offers so many healthy {{as well as}} unhealthy alternatives for physical exercise {{that the amount of}} it is dangerously diminishing. It is something we must stand up to. Every individual must realize that physical exercise is necessary. Each physical activity leads us over the cliffs that are called diseases of contemporary times. Illnesses like diabetes type 2, osteoporosis, arteriosclerosis, heart and veins illnesses, high cholesterol and excessive body weight can be avoided by adequate, everyday, at least one hour long sport activity. In order to introduce the effects of ‘modern’ society and era to children, we have to use appropriate and qualitative methods of presenting information throughout the whole teaching process, especially in Physical Education. In the process of physical education pupils develop their movement skills. We have to start building an appropriate attitude towards sport activities in pupils, starting very early, in pre-school period in order to engage them in sports in their later lives. If our aim is to make exercising an important personal value of people, we have to build a positive attitude towards it in children. Parents and the primary environment play a significant role here, since {{it is very important that}} exercising and active free time start in the child’s family. In the child’s secondary environment, that is school, the teachers are the ones who influence the individuals the most, especially in Physical Education, that is why they have to offer them as many sport activities as possible during the lessons as well as in other out-of-school activities. Therefore, sports education should start at a very early age. On account of the influences of modern society and technology we decided to investigate and focus on Physical Education and the teacher’s sports activity in this research, since the teacher is the one who can offer sports to children and make them integrate sports as an important part of their everyday lives. In addition, the teacher is the one who can plan and execute qualitative Physical Education lessons. The subjects of our research were: •	the present situation in Physical Education through separate quality indicators (lesson planning and execution, teaching methods and forms, checking and evaluation, student motivation, individualisation and differentiation, constant teacher professional development and training, inclusion in school as well as out-of-school activities, work conditions and satisfaction with one’s own work, frequency of sport activities, types of sport activities, participating in sport activities in one’s free time); •	differences according to separate criteria (lesson planning and execution, teaching methods and forms, checking and evaluation, student motivation, individualisation and differentiation, constant teacher professional development and training) for Physical Education quality as regards the teachers’ age, education, work experience and title; •	differences in the frequency and ways of engaging in sports according to the teachers’ age •	types of sports activities that teachers engage in; •	does the teacher’s own sport activity have a positive influence on teaching Physical Education. In presented Master’s Thesis there are a theoretical part and an empirical part. The first part describes facts and research results in the sports field, sports education and engaging in sports. The second part introduces the results of a basic statistic analysis questionnaire in the first part and results of a questionnaire of performed statistically important differences in the second part. The analysis of the present situation indicates that the teachers usually develop schemes of work and lesson plans in line with curriculum objectives of Physical Education. However, they also tend to cooperate with their fellow colleagues, the class teachers. The most commonly used teaching method is direct demonstration; most common teaching forms are circuit <b>training,</b> <b>all-round</b> exercising, obstacle courses and relay races. When forming a learner’s grade, teachers usually consider the progress the learner makes, their effort, cooperation during the lessons and their gained knowledge. The teachers’ most important components of motivation are stimulative words and setting realistic aims, as well as praising the learners for their achievements. When considering differentiation and individualisation, teachers most commonly talk about helping learners when they feel that they are falling behind and paying attention to all learners equally. Teachers rarely take part in permanent professional development seminars. They usually get involved in school activities at professional work group meetings and at Physical Fitness Report testing. Teachers never receive their own personal sport equipment (52, 6...|$|R
