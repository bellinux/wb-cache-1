5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice <b>and</b> <b>dreams</b> <b>of</b> her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E

25|$|The Eugene Mall was a car-free zone in {{the heart}} of Eugene, Oregon, {{designed}} to encourage pedestrian access to shopping and entertainment areas. Dedicated on February 13, 1971, the mall opened amid three days of fanfare <b>and</b> <b>dreams</b> <b>of</b> a revitalized downtown. Conflict over the scope and use of the mall began immediately and continued for 30 years until the last remaining parts of the mall were opened to automobile traffic. At that time, a former Eugene mayor commented that the city's dreams for a bright future just hadn't worked. Many residents, however, shared the much-earlier view of a former downtown merchant, that Eugene had sustained more damage from the mall than it would have from a natural disaster.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{completion}} of SAO, Asuna remains unconscious and is instead detained in another virtual reality called Alfheim Online. She is forced {{to play the role}} of «Titania the Queen of Fairies», with Nobuyuki Sugō, the man responsible for imprisoning her, playing as Oberon the Fairy King. This is done so that Sugō could marry Asuna in the real world, while she is unconscious and thus take over RCT Progress Inc. She attempts to escape the World Tree where she is imprisoned and manages to steal a GM card which she throws out of the window when she hears Yui's voice. Upon being released she creates two avatars for Alfheim, Asuna (being the healer of the team) and Erika (a battle-type avatar), and went on to continue living together with Kirito. She enrolls at the SAO Survivor School with Kazuto Kirigaya in the real world after everything ended. In the real world, Asuna's parents want her to follow in their footsteps. However, after living in SAO and meeting Kirito, she gains a different perspective and looks back on her past with disgust. She officially becomes Kazuto's real-life girlfriend <b>and</b> <b>dreams</b> <b>of</b> marrying him and having a family with him in the future.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} the morality built upon the basis of Hartmann's philosophy is the realization that all is one and that, while every attempt to gain happiness is illusory, yet before deliverance is possible, all forms of the illusion must appear and be tried to the utmost. Even he who recognizes the vanity of life best serves the highest aims by giving himself up to the illusion, and living as eagerly as if he thought life good. It is only through the constant attempt to gain happiness that people can learn the desirability of nothingness; and when this knowledge has become universal, or at least general, deliverance will come and the world will cease. No better proof of the rational nature {{of the universe is}} needed than that afforded by the different ways in which men have hoped to find happiness and so have been led unconsciously to work for the final goal. The first of these is the hope of good in the present, the confidence in the pleasures of this world, such as was felt by the Greeks. This is followed by the Christian transference of happiness to another and better life, to which in turn succeeds the illusion that looks for happiness in progress, <b>and</b> <b>dreams</b> <b>of</b> a future made worth while by the achievements of science. All alike are empty promises, and known as such in the final stage, which sees all human desires as equally vain and the only good in the peace of Nirvana.|$|E
