Inhalation of fecal remnants (frass) is the likely sensitizing agent; however isolated frass has not been tested for its ability to induce experimental asthma in mice. Methods Mice (Balb/c or C 57 Bl/ 6) were sensitized and challenged with GC frass or GC frass devoid of proteases and measurements of airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness were performed (interleukin (IL) - 5, - 13, and interferon gamma (IFNγ) levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, serum IgE levels, airway hyperresponsiveness, cellular infiltration, and mucin production). Results Sensitization and challenge of Balb/c mice with GC frass resulted in increased airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were not susceptible to this model of sensitization; however they were sensitized to GC frass using a more aggressive sensitization and challenge protocol. In mice that were sensitized by inhalation, the <b>active</b> <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> in GC frass played a role in airway hyperresponsiveness as these mice had less airway hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine and less mucin production.

40|$|Summary. Fibrinolysis serves an {{important}} role in the process of coagulation, ensuring that clots that are formed in response to injury resolve after the injured tissue is repaired. Fibrinolysis occurs because the protein plasminogen is converted to the <b>active</b> <b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> plasmin by its activating molecules (primarily tissue plasminogen activator). One of the inhibitors of fibrinolysis is a 2 -antiplasmin, which acts as the primary inhibitor of plasmin(ogen). Congenital deficiency of a 2 -antiplasmin causes a rare bleeding disorder because of increased fibrino-lysis. Despite the rare nature of this disorder, understanding of the actions of a 2 -antiplasmin and the results of its deficiency has provided the oppor-tunity for better understanding of the fibrinolytic system in both how it affects the risk of bleeding and its impact on other bodily systems. Here, we review the history of the discovery of a 2 -antiplasmin, our understanding of its genetics and function, and our current knowledge of its congenital deficiency. We also discuss some of the current avenues of investi-gation into its impact on other diseases and physio-logical states...|$|E

Viable, but not formaldehyde- or sodium azide-killed, cryptococcal strains undergo brain microvascular endothelial cell-dependent plasminogen-to-plasmin activation, which results in enhanced, plasmin-dependent cryptococcal invasion of primary bovine brain microvascular endothelial cells and fungal ability to degrade plasmin substrates. In the present work, brain microvascular endothelial cells cultured with viable, but not killed, cryptococcal strains led to significant increases in both urokinase mRNA transcription and cell-associated urokinase protein expression. Soluble urokinase was also detected in conditioned medium from brain microvascular endothelial cells cultured with viable, but not killed, C. neoformans.

Although it is considered safe, EcN is closely related to the uropathogenic E. coli strain CFT 073 and contains many of its predicted virulence elements. Thus, it is relevant to assess whether virulence-associated genes are functional in EcN. One of these genes encodes the secreted autotransporter toxin (Sat), a member of the serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATEs) that are secreted following the type V autotransporter pathway. Sat is highly prevalent in certain E. coli pathogenic groups responsible for urinary and intestinal infections.

With increasing appearance of antimicrobial resistance and in as' sociation with diabetic ulcers, maggot therapy was revisited in the 1980 s. Three mechanisms by which sterile maggots of the green bottle fly Lucilia sericata may improve healing of chronic wounds have been proposed: Biosurgical debridement, disinfecting properties, and stimulation of the wound healing process. However, the influence of maggot excretion products (MEP) on blood coagulation as part of the wound healing process has not been studied in detail. Here, we demonstrate that specific MEP-derived <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> from Lucilia sericata induce clotting of human plasma and whole blood, particularly by activating contact phase proteins factor XII and kininogen as well as factor IX, thereby providing kallikrein-bypassing and factor Xla-like activities, both in plasma and in isolated systems. In plasma samples deficient in contact phase proteins, MEP restored full clotting activity, whereas in plasma deficient in either factor VII, IX, X or II no effect was seen. The observed procoagulant/ intrinsic pathway-like activity was mediated by (chymo-) trypsin-like proteases in total MEP, which were significantly blocked by C 1 -esterase inhibitor or other contact phase-specific protease inhibitors. No significant influence of MEP on platelet activation or fibrinolysis was noted.

Protein C functions as an anticoagulant when converted to the <b>active</b> <b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> form on the endothelial cell surface. Thrombomodulin (TM), an endothelial cell surface receptor specific for thrombin, {{has been identified as}} an essential component for protein C activation. Although protein C can be activated directly by the thrombin–TM complex, the conversion is known as a relatively low-affinity reaction. Therefore, protein C activation has been believed to occur only in microcirculation. On the other hand, we have identified and cloned a novel endothelial cell surface receptor (EPCR) that is capable of high-affinity binding of protein C and activated protein C. In this study, we demonstrate the constitutive, endothelial cell–specific expression of EPCR in vivo. Abundant expression was particularly detected in the aorta and large arteries. In vitro cultured, arterial endothelial cells were also found to express abundant EPCR and were capable of promoting significant levels of protein C activation. EPCR was found to greatly accelerate protein C activation by examining functional activity in transfected cell lines expressing EPCR and/or TM. EPCR decreased the dissociation constant and increased the maximum velocity for protein C activation mediated by the thrombin–TM complex. By these mechanisms, EPCR appears to enable significant levels of protein C activation in large vessels. These results suggest that the protein C anticoagulation pathway is important for the regulation of blood coagulation not only in microvessels but also in large vessels...|$|E

Hence, these two mutations were introduced into the truncated factor IX (rf 9), and their effect on the expressed proteolytic activity was determined. The truncated fIX was overexpressed by pET 22 /rf 9 lacking the first N-terminal domain which is essential for the protein expression in prokaryotic cells. In the fIX gene mutations at positions A 21975 G and A 32881 C were introduced. The native and the two mutated forms of rf 9 were retrieved and purified from cytoplasm using a Q-Sepharose ff column. The purified proteins were activated by ‘Russell’s viper venom FX activating protein’ (RVV-X). Both mutations significantly increased the proteolytic activity of the protein as shown by the Km and Vmax values, indicating that these polymorphisms might be responsible for the thrombophilic incidence in the above mentioned patient...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the prevalence, distribution, {{and structure of}} espP in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and assessed the secretion and proteolytic activity of the encoded autotransporter protein EspP (extracellular serine protease, plasmid encoded). espP was identified in 56 of 107 different STEC serotypes. Sequencing of a 3, 747 -bp region of the 3, 900 -bp espP gene distinguished four alleles (espPα, espPβ, espPγ, and espPδ), with 99. 9 %, 99. 2 %, 95. 3 %, and 95. 1 % homology, respectively, to espP of E. coli O 157 :H 7 strain EDL 933. The espPβ, espPγ, and espPδ genes contained unique insertions and/or clustered point mutations that enabled allele-specific PCRs; these demonstrated the presence of espPα, espPβ, espPγ, and espPδ in STEC isolates belonging to 17, 16, 15, and 8 serotypes, respectively. Among four subtypes of EspP encoded by these alleles, EspPα (produced by enterohemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC] O 157 :H 7 and the major non-O 157 EHEC serotypes) and EspPγ cleaved pepsin A, human coagulation factor V, and an oligopeptide alanine-alanine-proline-leucine-para-nitroaniline, whereas EspPβ and EspPδ either were not secreted or were proteolytically inactive. The lack of proteolysis correlated with point mutations near the <b>active</b> <b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> site. We conclude that espP is widely distributed among STEC strains and displays genetic heterogeneity, {{which can be used}} for subtyping and which affects EspP activity. The presence of proteolytically active EspP in EHEC serogroups O 157, O 26, O 111, and O 145, which are bona fide human pathogens, suggests that EspP might play a role as an EHEC virulence factor...|$|E
40|$|Allergen {{exposure}} can induce {{an early}} innate immune response; however, the {{mechanism by which}} this occurs has not been addressed. In this report, we demonstrate a role for the <b>active</b> <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> in German cockroach (GC) feces (frass) and protease-activated receptor (PAR) - 2 in modulating the innate immune response. A single exposure of GC frass induced inflammatory cytokine production and cellular infiltration in the airways of mice. In comparison, exposure to protease-depleted GC frass resulted in diminution of inflammatory cytokine production and airway neutrophilia, but {{had no effect on}} macrophage infiltration. Selective activation of PAR- 2 confirmed that PAR- 2 was sufficient to induce airway inflammation. Exposure of GC frass to PAR- 2 -deficient mice led to decreased immune responses to GC frass compared to wild-type mice. Using the macrophage as an early marker of the innate immune response, we found that GC frass induced significant release of tumor necrosis factor-α from primary alveolar macrophages. This effect was dependent on the intrinsic proteases in GC frass. We confirmed GC frass-induced cytokine expression was mediated by activation of NF-κB and ERK in a macrophage cell line. Collectively, these data suggest a central role for GC frass protease-PAR- 2 activation in regulating the innate immune response through the activation of alveolar macrophages. Understanding the potential role of protease-PAR- 2 activation as a danger signal or adjuvant could yield attractive therapeutic targets...|$|R

We hypothesize that the activity of these neutrophil <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> is regulated by the expression of naturally occurring inhibitors (serpina 1 and serpina 3) produced locally within the bone marrow. We found that serpina 1 and serpina 3 were transcribed in the bone marrow by many different hematopoietic cell populations and that a strong reduction in expression occurred both at the protein and mRNA levels during mobilization induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or chemotherapy. This decreased expression was restricted to the bone marrow as serpina 1 expression was maintained in the liver, leading to no change in plasma concentrations during mobilization. The down-regulation of serpina 1 and serpina 3 during mobilization may contribute to {{a shift in the}} balance between <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> and their inhibitors, and an accumulation of <b>active</b> neutrophil <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> in bone marrow extravascular fluids that cleave and inactivate molecules essential to the retention of hematopoietic progenitor cells within the bone marrow. These data suggest an unexpected role for serpina 1 and serpina 3 in regulating the bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment as well as influencing the migratory behavior of hematopoietic precursors...|$|R
40|$|The high {{reactivity}} of the serine residue at the <b>active</b> site of <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> is often {{attributed to the}} formation of a hydrogen bond between this serine and a histidine residue. In the case of the <b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> subtilisin, the catalytic serine residue can be specifically replaced by a cysteine residue and this modified enzyme is called thiol-subtilisin. By studying the D 2 O effect on acyl-enzyme formation with subtilisin and thiol-subtilisin, we present evidence that thiol-subtilisin but not subtilisin may contain a hydrogen bond. Based on the comparison of the catalytic activities of subtilisin and thiol-subtilisin, a rigid active site model for the <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> is proposed in which the histidine residue operates in a fixed steric position both as a general base and as a general acid, and this, rather than the formation of a hydrogen bond, accounts for the high nucleophilicity of the serine residue...|$|R
