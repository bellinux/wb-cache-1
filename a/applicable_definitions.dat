40|$|The new {{cataloging}} code Resource Description and Access (RDA) {{provides a}} system of instructions for recording relationships between related resources {{by means of a}} controlled vocabulary of relationship designators. The purpose of this two years master’s thesis in Archive, Library and Museum studies is to examine the construction of this system, as well as its theoretical foundation. One theoretical point of departure is the necessity of operational definitions for consistent identification of bibliographic relationships. Another such point of departure is that the theoretical model on which RDA is based (the FRBR model) is not a complete description of the biblio­graphic universe, but merely a limited representation of a set of assumptions about that universe. The thesis first examines Barbara B. Tillett's and Richard P. Smiraglia's theories and taxonomies of bibliographic relationships. The analysis shows that, in spite of their claims to provide a theoretical basis for consistent treatment of bibliographic relationships, neither Tillett nor Smiraglia offers operationally <b>applicable</b> <b>definitions.</b> The thesis then turns to RDA in order to examine the instructions and the list of relationship designators. After an introductory survey of RDA chapters 24 to 28, the possibility to record relationship designators at different entity levels is discussed. Remarkably, RDA neither provides instructions for how to choose between the entity levels, nor does it point out what this choice signifies. Finally, a selection of relationship designators representing content relationships is examined. The selected designators are analysed and compared to corresponding categories in literary theorist Gérard Genette's attempt to classify intertextual relationships. The analysis shows that though some of the selected designators are satisfactorily operationalized, most are not...|$|E

Hanford Site liquid effluent streams discharging to the soil column are categorized as Phase I and Phase II Streams, and Miscellaneous Streams. There were originally 33 Phase I and Phase II Streams, however some of these streams have been eliminated. Miscellaneous Streams are those liquid effluent streams discharged to the ground that are not categorized as Phase I or Phase II Streams, and are subject to the requirements of several milestones identified in the Consent Order. The three criteria for identifying streams that are potentially affecting groundwater are: (1) streams discharging to surface contaminated areas (referred to as category `b` streams); (2) potentially contaminated streams (referred to as category `c` streams); and (3) streams discharging within 91 meters (300 feet) of a contaminated crib, ditch, or trench (referred to as category `d` streams). Miscellaneous Streams that meet any of these criteria must be evaluated for application of best management practices (BMP). The purpose of this report is to provide the best management practice preferred alternative. The list of BMP streams has been revised since the original submittal. Several streams from the original list of BMP streams have already been eliminated through facility upgrades, reduction of steam usage, and facility shutdowns.

40|$|The {{potential}} of different field boundary types in lowland farmland {{to contribute to}} arthropod biodiversity and sustainable agriculture was investigated. Field boundaries, categorised according to nationally <b>applicable</b> <b>definitions,</b> were found to represent ecologically differing habitats based on their woody abundance {{and the frequency of}} young and mature emergent trees. These habitat characteristics were determining factors in the community structure and composition of overwintering epigeal arthropods. Hedgerows supported the most species rich carabid and staphylinid assemblage. Degraded hedgerow boundaries supported the most equitable carabid community, and provided a refuge for carabid species with poor dispersal power to a greater extent that hedgerows or post and wire fences. The grassy and natural regeneration vegetation associated with post and wire boundaries supported high densities of all taxa particularly overwintering carabid and staphylinid polyphagous predators. A subset of all field boundary types was required for complete species representation, indicating that maximising the heterogeneity of field boundary habitats represented at the farm-scale will enhance arthropod biodiversity in farmland. Carabidae and Staphylinidae actively selected overwintering sites and the physiological condition of polyphagous predators was generally high. It was concluded that heterogeneous distributions in field boundaries {{were more likely to be}} the result of differential microhabitat selection rather than differential survival overwinter. This indicated that favourable overwintering microhabitats occurred in all field boundary types. Generally, overwintering survival did not appear to be a regulating factor in the population dynamics of polyphagous predators. Margins adjacent to pre-existing boundaries may contribute to enhanced densities and physiological condition of some polyphagous predators, both over winter and in early spring. The results were discussed in relation to field boundary management and agri-environment policy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGame Conservancy TrustGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|As {{teenagers}} {{explore their}} sexuality {{and seek to}} memorialize and exchange information related to their sexual development, their instantaneous ability to memorialize and share images with others, via cell phones or the Internet, presents {{a host of new}} problems to which our society must respond intelligently. The recent trend of harshly punishing these teens under the child pornography regime is not an intelligent solution. In light of this wave of prosecutorial overreaching, state and federal child pornography laws should be revised to specifically exempt sexting by minors from the reach of such laws. Child pornography laws were created to punish and deter a far different class of conduct—the conduct of adult pedophiles creating and disseminating images that depict sexual abuse of their child victims in a commercial context—not the conduct of older minors using technology to explore their sexuality and voluntarily exchange images with one another. Non-obscene depictions of nudity or sexual conduct created by teens and exchanged voluntarily among themselves for noncommercial purposes should be specifically excluded from the <b>applicable</b> <b>definitions</b> of child pornography and similar crimes. Instances of sexting, however, should not necessarily go unpunished, as they may constitute harmful invasions of the subject’s privacy. In cases in which nude or sexually themed images of minors, which were initially created with the subject’s consent, are disseminated or otherwise made available without or beyond the scope of the subject’s consent, such conduct should be cognizable as actionable invasions of the subject’s privacy under the publication of private facts branch of this common law tort. The subject should be able to seek relief not only against the individual who made such images available without her consent, but also against a website that continues to host such images after being notified of their presence. Websites that continue to facilitate the hosting of such images after the subject requests their removal should lose their immunity for hosting such content and should be held liable for facilitating the invasion of the subject’s privacy...|$|E
40|$|Allogeneic {{hematopoietic cell}} {{transplantation}} (HCT) can be curative for many hematologic diseases. However, complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse of primary malignancy remain significant {{and are the}} leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Effects of killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) -influenced NK cells on HCT outcomes have been extensively pursued over the last decade. However, {{the relevance of the}} reported algorithms on HLA matched myeloablative HCT with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is used for GVHD prophylaxis remains elusive. Here we examined the role of KIR and KIR-ligands of donor-recipient pairs in modifying the outcomes of ATG conditioned HLA matched sibling and unrelated donor HCT. The study cohort consisted of 281 HLA matched sibling and unrelated donor-recipient pairs of first allogeneic marrow or blood stem cell transplantation allocated into 'discovery' (135 pairs) and 'validation' (146 pairs) cohorts. High resolution HLA typing was obtained from the medical charts and KIR gene repertoires were obtained by a Luminex® based SSO method. All surviving patients were followed-up for a minimum of two years. KIR and HLA class I distributions of HCT pairs were stratified as per <b>applicable</b> <b>definitions</b> and were tested for their association with cause specific outcomes [acute GVHD grade II-IV (aGVHD), chronic GVHD needing systemic therapy (cGVHD) and relapse] using a multivariate competing risks regression model as well as with survival outcomes [relapse-free survival (RFS), cGVHD & relapse free survival (cGRFS) and overall survival (OS) ] by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. A significant association between KIR genotype mismatching (KIR-B/x donor into KIR-AA recipient or vice versa) and cGVHD was found in both discovery (p = 0. 001; SHR = 2. 78; 95 %CI: 1. 50 - 5. 17) and validation cohorts (p = 0. 005; SHR = 2. 61; 95 %CI: 1. 33 - 5. 11). High incidence of cGVHD associated with KIR genotype mismatching was applicable to both sibling and unrelated donors and was specific to recipients who had one or two C 1 bearing HLA-C epitopes (HLA-C 1 /x, p = 0. 001; SHR = 2. 40; 95 %CI: 1. 42 - 4. 06). When compared with KIR genotype mismatched transplants, HLA-C 1 /x patients receiving grafts from KIR genotype matched donors had a significantly improved cGRFS (p = 0. 013; HR = 1. 62; 95 %CI: 1. 11 - 2. 39). Although there was no effect of KIR genotype matching on survival outcomes, a significantly reduced incidence of relapse (p = 0. 001; SHR = 0. 22; 95 %CI: 0. 10 - 0. 54) and improved relapse-free survival (p = 0. 038; HR = 0. 40; 95 %CI: 0. 17 - 0. 95) was observed with one or more missing ligands for donor inhibitory KIR among the recipients of unrelated donor transplants. The present study for the first time presents the beneficial effects of KIR genotype matching in reducing cGVHD in myeloablative transplant setting using HLA matched (sibling and unrelated) donors. The findings offer a clinically applicable donor selection strategy that can help control cGVHD without affecting the risk of relapse and/or identify patients at a high risk of developing cGVHD as potential candidates for preemptive therapy. The findings also affirm the beneficial effect of one or more missing inhibitory KIR ligands in the recipient in reducing relapse and improving a relapse free survival in unrelated donor transplants...|$|E
