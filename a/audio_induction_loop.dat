2500|$|Telecoils or T-coils (from [...] "Telephone Coils") {{are small}} devices {{installed}} in hearing aids or cochlear implants.

In the UK and the Nordic countries, hearing loops are widely used in churches, shops, railway stations, and other public places. In the U.S.A., telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common. Audio induction loops, telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common also in Slovenia.|$|E

50|$|Monaural sound {{has been}} {{replaced}} by stereo sound in most entertainment applications. However, it remains the standard for radiotelephone communications, telephone networks, and <b>audio</b> <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> for use with hearing aids. A few FM radio stations, particularly talk radio shows, choose to broadcast in monaural, as a monaural signal has a slight advantage in signal strength and bandwidth over a stereophonic signal of the same power.|$|R

25|$|The primary {{signalling}} {{system is a}} fixed-block cab {{signalling system}} called HKT which transmits data to the trains through low-bandwidth <b>audio</b> frequency <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> between the rails. Different frequency combinations encode different target speeds; when a train enters a block with a lower target speed than its current speed it will initiate service braking until the two match. This allows blocks to be much shorter than the full-speed braking distance, but as the braking profile is encoded in the transmitted target speed it only works where all trains have similar braking characteristics.|$|R
50|$|An <b>induction</b> or {{inductive}} <b>loop</b> is an electromagnetic communication or {{detection system}} {{which uses a}} moving magnet to induce an electric current in a nearby wire. <b>Induction</b> <b>loops</b> are used for transmission and reception of communication signals, or for detection of metal objects in metal detectors or vehicle presence indicators. A common modern use for <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> is to provide hearing assistance to hearing-aid users.|$|R

Depending on the user group, other provisions may integrate sound and music more centrally to combine the play needs of younger users with their sensory needs.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>audio</b> <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> {{inside of}} a hearing aid might have one or more loops {{sometimes}} with a phase shift between them near {{the area in which}} a hearing aid user would be present.

5000|$|Three {{types of}} {{wireless}} systems are commonly used: FM, <b>audio</b> <b>induction</b> <b>loop,</b> and InfraRed. Each system has advantages and benefits for particular uses. FM {{systems can be}} battery operated or plugged into an electrical outlet. FM system produce an analog audio signal, meaning they have extremely high fidelity. Many FM systems are very small in size, allowing them {{to be used in}} mobile situations. The <b>audio</b> <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> permits the listener with hearing loss to be free of wearing a receiver provided that the listener has a hearing aid or cochlear implant processor with an accessory called a [...] "telecoil". If the listener does not have a telecoil, then he or she must carry a receiver with an earpiece. As with FM systems, the infrared (IR) system also requires a receiver to be worn or carried by the listener. An advantage of IR wireless systems is that people in adjoining rooms cannot listen in on conversations, making it useful for situations where privacy and confidentiality are required. Another way to achieve confidentiality is to use a hardwired amplifier, which contains or is connected to a microphone and transmits no signal beyond the earpiece plugged directly into it.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> {{system was}} installed in the Lawns (a hall of residence at Hull University) as a third year project by engineering students. By 1983 the system was fully operational. To cut costs, the students used Coca-Cola bottles as insulation. As a result, by 1993, the <b>loop</b> <b>induction</b> system was no longer functional. In 1994, the engineering team carried out a comprehensive survey {{of the system and}} were able to partially restore it to several of the Lawns halls, as well as fitting a new transmitter to Ferens Hall. The <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> system was abandoned in 1997 after the award of the LPAM licence.|$|R

SWS carriages have 37 seats (31 plus six that can be folded away to fit up to four wheelchairs), with a space for a servery (not used), a wheelchair hoist on each side, an <b>audio</b> <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> system, and an accessible toilet. SWG carriages have 37 seats, a luggage compartment and a diesel generator to power the carriages.|$|E
5000|$|An {{increasingly}} common application is for providing hearing aid-compatible [...] "assistive listening" [...] telecoil. In this application a loop or series of loops {{is used to}} provide an audio frequency oscillating magnetic field {{in an area where}} a hearing aid user may be present. Many hearing aids contain a telecoil which allows the user to receive and hear the magnetic field and remove the normal audio signal provided from the hearing aid microphone site. These loops are often referred to as a hearing loop or <b>audio</b> <b>induction</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|E
50|$|Making public {{services}} fully {{accessible to the}} public has led to some technological innovations. Public announcement systems using <b>audio</b> <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> technology can broadcast announcements directly into the hearing aid of anyone with a hearing impairment, making them useful in such public places as auditoriums and train stations. Australia's government has supported {{the creation of the}} National Public Toilet Map, to enable users to locate public toilet facilities throughout the country. GPS is also included as a feature. The service assists people with continence issues, which is estimated to be up to 18% of the population, including the elderly and families with young children.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} broadcast from a {{landing in the}} Electrical Engineering Department and carried by <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> {{in all of the}} campus residences. A year after launch the station moved the current studios in Norwood house but still retained the <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> transmitters, which were updated and expanded as new residences were built on campus. Over the years loudspeakers playing URB were added to the campus laundrettes and the students' union coffee shop. In summer 1994 renovations to the Westwood blocks severed the wires to the loops there and after that URB 963 could only be heard in Eastwood, Wessex and Norwood. On 8 February 2001 at 14:49 1449AM URB launched as a low powered AM service covering the whole campus and the remaining <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> on 963 were switched off. The addition of online and mobile streaming has also given the station a significant boost.|$|R
5000|$|URN was {{established}} from the University's Radio Broadcasting Club, who, {{in the late}} 1970s had an hour's slot on BBC Radio Nottingham. The station set up its first studio in the Cherry Tree buildings in 1978 and [...] "University Radio Nottingham" [...] started broadcasting to Hugh Stewart Hall and Cripps Hall of residence on 963 kHz (312m) in November 1979. Additional <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> were set up {{over the next few}} years in other halls on campus. A fifth <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> was installed on Sutton Bonington Campus in 1990, financed by their Guild.|$|R
50|$|On 30 January 1999, W963 rebranded {{itself as}} RaW and on 30 September 1999, the station began {{broadcasting}} on 1251 kHz AM, discarding the then obsolete <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> system.|$|R

40|$|<b>Induction</b> <b>loop</b> {{detectors}} {{have become}} the most utilized sensors in traffic management systems. The gathered traffic data is used to improve traffic efficiency (i. e., warning users about congested areas or planning new infrastructures). Despite their usefulness, their deployment and maintenance costs are expensive. Vehicular networks are an emerging technology that can support novel strategies for ubiquitous and more cost-effective traffic data gathering.
