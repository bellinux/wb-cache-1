5|$|Construction in Norway {{has always}} been {{characterized}} {{by the need to}} shelter people, animals, and property from harsh weather, including predictably cold winters and frost, heavy precipitation in certain areas, wind and storms; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> most of scarce building resources. Until modern times, transportation infrastructure was also primitive, and builders largely had to rely on locally available materials.|$|E

5|$|The Cycle Center is {{designed}} to encourage bicycle commuting to Millennium and Grant Parks {{as well as to}} work and other nearby downtown locations, such as the Art Institute of Chicago. It represents two major initiatives by the mayor: to promote cycling <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> city greener. By supporting cycling as an alternate form of transportation, it will help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality and promote the health benefits of cycling.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} vehicle and {{equipment}} camouflage differs from personal camouflage {{in that the}} primary threat is aerial reconnaissance. The goal is to disrupt the characteristic shape of the vehicle, to reduce shine, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> vehicle difficult to identify {{even if it is}} spotted.|$|E
5|$|First and Second World War dazzle camouflage, {{pioneered by}} English artist Norman Wilkinson, was {{used not to}} make ships disappear, but to make them seem smaller and/or faster, to {{encourage}} misidentification by an enemy <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> ships harder to hit. In the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy trialled a form of active camouflage, counter-illumination, using diffused lighting to prevent ships from appearing as dark shapes against a brighter sky during the night. It reduced visibility by up to 70%, but was unreliable and never went into production.|$|E

5|$|However, in 1726 Sheffield's Company of Cutlers sought {{parliamentary}} {{approval to}} make the river navigable from Holmstile in Doncaster to Tinsley, {{on the edge of}} Sheffield. Terminating at Tinsley placated the Duke of Norfolk, who represented the opposition from Sheffield, {{and a great deal of}} work had been done to reduce the opposition from landowners. The Act of Parliament was passed on 6 May 1726 giving the Cutlers powers to make cuts <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> river deeper and wider so that boats of 20 tonnes could reach Tinsley. There were a number of restrictions, intended to protect existing water-powered installations. Lord Frederick Howard's mills at Rotherham, Kilnhurst forge, Thrybergh dam and Sprotborough mills and water engine were specifically mentioned.|$|E
5|$|Some historians {{emphasize}} that the leagues were engaged in class struggle against a coalition of landowners and mafiosi and ignore evidence of strategic alliances between the Fasci and the Mafia. The leagues were not only led by socialists and anarchists; some were run by local gentry and mafiosi. The Mafia bosses Vito Cascioferro and Nunzio Giaimo led the Fasci in Bisacquino in alliance with Verro. The Mafia was sometimes needed to enforce flying pickets with credible threats of violence <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> strike costly to landowners by destroying their property.|$|E
5|$|TSN {{offered to}} {{broadcast}} her funeral live <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> signal available {{to any other}} stations at no charge. Her husband, Shannon England, agreed to the broadcast {{on the condition that}} the family would not be shown during the service. CBC also broadcast the service, marking the first time a Canadian athlete's funeral had been televised live on two networks. The Brier was just getting underway and games in the afternoon draw were delayed to allow curlers and fans to watch the funeral, which was broadcast on screens at the rink. Regina's Agridome and Schmirler's home Caledonian Curling Club also opened to show the funeral. Nine hundred people attended the service at the Regina Funeral Home, thousands watched at satellite locations around the province, and hundreds of thousands watched on television. The funeral was conducted by the Rev. Don Wells, and Sandra was eulogized by Brian McCusker, teammate Joan McCusker's husband.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} picked up by some U.S. {{television}} stations, such as WSNS (Channel 44) in Chicago. The telecasts of games one through four were produced by WSBK (Channel 38) in Boston and called by Bruins' announcers Fred Cusick and John Peirson. After efforts by WSBK to get rights to the four games in Moscow broke down, a last-minute deal by Boston public television station WGBH-TV allowed it to broadcast the CBC/CTV feed of games five through eight <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> telecast available to PBS stations in several American cities, mostly those who had NHL, minor-league, or major college hockey teams. WGBH fed the Canadian telecasts; games six, seven, and eight were seen on WGBH and PBS on a tape-delay in prime-time.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} gameplay {{itself was}} inspired by older strategy games, in particular, 1989's Herzog Zwei; in this game, the player controlled a transforming aircraft mecha that would normally fly about the field to issue orders for constructing new units, airlifting units to other areas, and directing combat, but the player could opt to transform the craft into a giant robot and engage directly in combat. For Brütal Legend, Schafer kept the same concept of a split-mode RTS, but wanted more focus on the ground combat; instead of spending 90% of the time controlling units as in Zwei, the player would only spend about 30% in this fashion within Brütal Legend. This subsequently led {{to much of the}} action and combat-driven gameplay outside of the stage battles. In a 2015 interview, Schafer said that much of the gameplay outside of stage battles were to provide tutorials for the Stage Battles, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> game more of an action-adventure than an RTS to avoid the stigma that impacts sales of RTS games. This caused the production to expand considerably around the merger of Vivendi-Activision, and Double Fine had difficulties convincing the new publishers to fund the expanded game.|$|E
5|$|WALL-E was {{the most}} complex Pixar {{production}} since Monsters, Inc. because {{of the world and}} the history that had to be conveyed. Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75,000 storyboards, WALL-E required 125,000. Production designer Ralph Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic, and that of the second act on the Axiom to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the Axiom environment. Pixar studied Chernobyl and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage. Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The overexposed light makes the location look more vast. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they would have lost shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E—who was made yellow to emulate a tractor—would not blend into the deserted Earth, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> plant more prominent.|$|E

25|$|The league format {{was further}} refined {{at the end}} of the 2003–04 season, with the {{participants}} better managing the dates of the matches so as to not interfere with the national squad set-ups <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> league more commercially viable.
