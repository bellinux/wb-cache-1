40|$|Background: The {{epidemiological}} {{investigation of}} acculturation {{has often been}} hampered by inconsistent definitions and measurement, and methodological short-comings. Adopting a bi-directional model, with good theoretical and psychometric properties, this study aimed to describe the temporal, ethnic and socio-demographic influences of acculturation {{for a group of}} Pacific mothers residing in New Zealand. Methods: Pacific mothers of a cohort of Pacific infants born at a large tertiary hospital in South Auckland in 2000 were interviewed at 6 -weeks, 4 -years and 6 -years postpartum. At each measurement wave <b>a</b> home <b>interview</b> <b>lasting</b> approximately 90 minutes was conducted with each mother. Adapting the General Ethnicity Questionnaire, two scales of acculturation were elicited: one measuring New Zealand cultural orientation (NZAccult) and one measuring Pacific Islands cultural orientation (PIAccult). Acculturation scores were standardised and analysed using random intercept polynomial and piecewise mixed-effects regression models, accounting for the longitudinal nature of the repeated measured data. Mothers who immigrated to New Zealand and those who lived their lives in New Zealand were investigated separately...|$|R

40|$|OPD- 2 – a {{new edition}} of the multiaxial {{diagnostic}} system for psychodynamically oriented therapists and psychiatrists, now with practical tools and procedures for treatment planning and for measuring change. Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis (OPD) {{is a form of}} multiaxial diagnostic and classification system based on psychodynamic principles, analogous to those based on other principles such as DSM-IV and ICD- 10. The OPD is based on five axes: I = experience of illness and prerequisites for treatment, II = interpersonal relations, III = conflict, IV = structure, and V = mental and psychosomatic disorders (in line with Chapter V (F) of the ICD- 10). After <b>an</b> initial <b>interview</b> <b>lasting</b> 1 – 2 hours, the clinician (or researcher) can evaluate the patient’s psychodynamics according to these axes and enter them in the checklists and evaluation forms provided. The new version, OPD- 2, has been developed from a purely diagnostic system to include a set of tools and procedures for treatment planning and for measuring change, as well as for determining the appropriate main focuses of treatment and developing appropriate treatment strategies. ...|$|R

This paper presents the findings from a study of 100 homeless youth regarding the presence of trauma in their lives, both before and during homelessness. Participants living in the Maritime Provinces volunteered to take part in <b>a</b> semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>lasting</b> one to two hours. The interview questionnaire was conducted by a trained interviewer, and was composed of standardized and adapted survey instruments, as well as questions regarding demographics, experiences prior to becoming homeless, assistance received while dealing with stressors, and current needs. The results indicate that trauma is both a cause and a consequence of youth being homeless, as a large majority of participants experienced a number of types of highly stressful events both preceding and during homelessness, and that trauma in the lives of both male and female homeless youth should be understood as a pervasive reality with serious implications. Implications for service delivery are discussed...|$|R
