5|$|Discovering the {{tertiary}} {{structure of a}} protein, or the quaternary structure of its complexes, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function. Common experimental methods of structure determination include X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, both of which can produce information at atomic resolution. However, NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem. Dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus. Circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal β-sheet / α-helical composition of proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower-resolution structural information about very large protein complexes, including assembled viruses; a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high-resolution information in some cases, especially for two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Solved structures are usually deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained {{in the form of}} Cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein.|$|E

25|$|Most of the MOD-series wind {{turbines}} went to sites outside of Ohio, {{but the first}} unit, the MOD-0 operated at NASA's Plum Brook facility near Sandusky from 1975 to 1988. Initially the wind turbine had a lattice tower, a 38.1m diameter two-bladed rotor mounted downwind from the tower, and a capacity of 100kW. Lockheed Corporation manufactured the aluminum rotor blades. The discovery of severe stress resulting from the rotor blades passing through the tower's wind shadow led to several redesigns. In 1979, NASA rebuilt the MOD-0 with an upwind rotor mounted on a teetering hub, with a steel spar reinforcing the blades. In 1982, a tubular tower replaced the lattice tower. Finally, in 1985 NASA tested a single-bladed rotor with a teetering hub. In 1981, two NASA Glenn engineers, Larry Viterna and Bob Corrigan, used the adjustable-pitch blade feature of the MOD-0 to invent an <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> for calculating wind turbine output in high winds, which has since become widely used in the wind power industry as the Viterna method.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} lab {{techniques}} {{are used to}} determine the properties of polymers. Techniques such as wide angle X-ray scattering, small angle X-ray scattering, and small angle neutron scattering are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow us to know a bit of the phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average molar mass and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, polyelectrolyte synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including emulsion polymerization, adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E
25|$|While {{creosote}} treated wood is {{no longer}} used {{in the building of}} structures and piers, old broken down piers still could contain these creosote preservatives. Many properties contain piers that were built before 2008 with creosote preservatives, and now remain in the water even if they are broken down. One simple remedy for this would be removing the pilings after they are broken down or are no longer in use. On the coast, after storms pass through, debris and wreckage breaks piers that are built on the water. One of the harder remedies is for pilings that have sunk {{to the bottom of the}} water and settled on the sediment. These pilings are not visible and are harder to detect. The pilings will then sit on the bottom and leach chemicals out into the sediment and ecosystem. A solution to the problem of hidden pilings could be an <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> or technique that could be used to track creosote compounds or byproducts in situ (the original place of contamination). If there was a technique that could be used out in the field that could trace higher concentrations of the chemical in the sediment, then hidden pilings could be isolated and removed from the environment. Many methods, such as gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), have been used to identify creosote preservatives in the ground water and sediment, but most methods must be taken back to the lab in order to be properly conducted due to the run time and size of the instrument. New studies have shown that the use of smaller, more user friendly bio-assays are available to researchers so they can be used in the field for faster identification of chemical compounds. A test that could identify creosote compounds or other toxic byproducts quickly and efficiently in the field would allow researchers to remove contaminated pilings before further damage can be done.|$|E
