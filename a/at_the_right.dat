The buffer regions carry the information {{necessary to get}} the pKa values as the concentrations of acid and conjugate base change along a buffer region.|$|E

5|$|When a {{compound}} has limited {{solubility in water}} it is common practice (in the pharmaceutical industry, for example) to determine pKa values in a solvent mixture such as water/dioxane or water/methanol, in which the compound is more soluble. In the example shown <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> the pKa value rises steeply with increasing percentage of dioxane as the dielectric constant of the mixture is decreasing.|$|E
5|$|A Penrose tiling is {{an example}} of non-periodic tiling {{generated}} by an aperiodic set of prototiles. Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Sir Roger Penrose, who investigated these sets in the 1970s. The aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original. A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry, as in the diagram <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified {{around the perimeter of}} the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that it was just as effective to apply sufficient pressure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, the French Academy of Sciences made {{understanding}} bicycle dynamics {{the goal}} of its Prix Fourneyron competition. Thus, {{by the end of}} the 19th century, , Emmanuel Carvallo, and Francis Whipple had showed with rigid-body dynamics that some safety bicycles could actually balance themselves if moving <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> speed. Bourlet won the Prix Fourneyron, and Whipple won the Cambridge University Smith Prize. It is not clear to whom should go the credit for tilting the steering axis from the vertical which helps make this possible.|$|E
5|$|In Sabre Wulf, {{the player}} guides the pith-helmeted adventurer Sabreman through a {{two-dimensional}} maze. The player must reconstruct an amulet from its four pieces {{scattered throughout the}} maze to bypass the guardian at its exit, a cave {{that leads to the}} game's sequel, Underwurlde. The maze is presented in flip-screens such that the player views one static tile of the maze's grid at a time. For example, when Sabreman reaches the left edge of one screen, he continues the maze <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> edge of the next screen.|$|E
