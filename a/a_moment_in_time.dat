5|$|Cibber's comedy Love's Last Shift (1696) is {{an early}} herald of a massive shift in {{audience}} taste, away from the intellectualism and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender-role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. According to Paul Parnell, Love's Last Shift illustrates Cibber's opportunism at <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something for everybody into his first play, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness.|$|E

[...] However, Sheffield called the omission of [...] "Angel" [...] "just plain crazypants." [...] Lean Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly commented that the album [...] "holds up surprisingly well". Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle praised the album saying [...] "every song on Celebration defines <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> a radio sing-along, a twirl under the glitterball. It's a pulsing testament to Madonna's often-overlooked pop prowess, from the scrappy electro beginnings of 'Everybody' and 'Burning Up' to the retro-disco swirl of 'Beautiful Stranger' and 'Hung Up', still a hands-in-the-air highlight." ...|$|E

This work also marks a phase in Lichtenstein's career when many of his works were given present-participial titles such as Sleeping Girl, Crying Girl and Blonde Waiting, which accentuates the works' [...] "relation to process and action." [...] According to The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, during this phase of Lichtenstein's career [...] "a constant if restrained and a gentle sense of humor contribute just as much to the cheerful lightness of Lichtenstein's work as the balanced, completely harmonious composition." ...|$|E

"Wind It Up", the album's lead single, {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics {{for its use}} of yodeling and an interpolation of The Sound of Music, but was moderately successful, peaking inside the top 10 in the US and the UK. The title track was well received and was a major success, reaching the top 10 in over 15 nations, including number two peaks in the US, Australia and the UK. To promote The Sweet Escape, Stefani was a mentor on the sixth season of American Idol and performed the song with Akon. The song earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Three more singles were released from the album; [...] "4 in the Morning", [...] "Now That You Got It" [...] which featured Damian Marley and [...] "Early Winter". To promote the album, Stefani embarked on a worldwide tour, The Sweet Escape Tour, which covered North America, Europe, Asia and the Pacific and part of Latin America. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly on June 6, 2011, Stefani stated {{that she had no}} plans to continue work as a solo artist, adding, [...] "That was <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time...</b> It went on a little longer than we all thought it would, because it was inspired and you have to go with wherever you're at in that time in your life... But everything works out how it should." ...|$|E
500|$|Love's Last Shift {{can be seen}} as {{an early}} sign of Cibber's {{sensitivity}} to shifts of public opinion, which was to be useful to him in his later career as manager at Drury Lane (see Colley Cibber). In the 1690s, the economic and political power balance of the nation tilted from the aristocracy towards the middle class after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and middle-class values of religion, morality, and gender roles became more dominant, not least in attitudes to the stage. Love's Last Shift {{is one of the first}} illustrations of a massive shift in audience taste, away from the analytic bent and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. The play illustrates Cibber's opportunism at <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something into his first play to please every section of the audience, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness. The way Vanbrugh, in his turn, allows the reformed rake to relapse quite cheerfully, and has the only preaching in the play come from the comically corrupt parson of [...] "Fatgoose Living", has made some early 20th-century critics refer to The Relapse as the last of the true Restoration comedies. However, Vanbrugh's play is also affected by the taste of the 1690s, and compared to a play like the courtier William Wycherley's The Country Wife of 20 years earlier, with its celebration of predatory aristocratic masculinity, The Relapse contains quite a few moments of morality and uplift. In fact it has a kind of parallel structure to Love's Last Shift: in the climactic scene of Cibber's play, Amanda's virtue reforms her husband, and in the corresponding scene of The Relapse, it reforms her admirer Worthy. Such moments have not done the play any favours with modern critics.|$|E

2500|$|In Du [...] "Cubisme" [...] Metzinger and Gleizes {{write that}} we can only know our sensations, not because they reject them {{as a means of}} inspiration. On the contrary, because {{understanding}} our sensations more deeply gave them the primary inspiration for their own work. Their attack on classical painting was leveled precisely because the sensations it offered were poor in comparison with the richness and diversity of the sensations offered by the natural world it wished to imitate. The reason classical painting fell short of its goal, according to Metzinger and Gleizes, is that it attempted to represent the real world as <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> in the belief that it was 3-dimensional and geometrically Euclidean.|$|E
2500|$|His role as Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956), {{directed}} by Vincente Minnelli {{and based on}} Irving Stone's best-seller, was filmed mostly on location in France.

2500|$|His early {{pictures}} were often {{of the town}} {{where he was born}} and raised, Vitebsk. Cogniat notes that they are realistic and give the impression of firsthand experience by capturing <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> with action, often with a dramatic image. During his later years, as for instance in the [...] "Bible series", subjects were more dramatic. He managed to blend the real with the fantastic, and combined with his use of color the {{pictures were}} always at least acceptable if not powerful. He never attempted to present pure reality but always created his atmospheres through fantasy.

2500|$|Cézanne, {{progressively}} {{leading up}} to 1906, moved away from classic pictorial arrangements, single view perspectives, and outlines that enclosed color. His attempt was {{to arrive at a}} [...] "lived perspective" [...] by capturing all the complexities that could be observed with the eye and captured by the senses, where both [...] "sight" [...] and [...] "touch" [...] became one. Cèzanne believed his paintings could capture <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> that once passed it was gone, that art and nature are the same. Cèzanne claimed: [...] "Art is a personal apperception, which I embody in sensations and which I ask the understanding to organize into a painting." [...] The true meaning of painting grew closer as the distance from tradition increased. Just as the Cubists he would inspire, Cèzanne had little interest in the rational naturalistic painting and classical geometrical perspective inherited from the Renaissance. [...] "Nor was he satisfied," [...] writes Merleau-Ponty, [...] "with the attempts of the Impressionists to dissolve this objective order into its original elements of light and atmosphere".|$|E
2500|$|In Du [...] "Cubisme" [...] Metzinger and Gleizes {{explicitly}} {{related the}} sense of time to multiple perspective, giving symbolic expression {{to the notion of}} ‘duration’ proposed by the philosopher Henri Bergson according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuum, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. The Salon Cubists used the faceted treatment of solid and space and effects of multiple viewpoints to convey a physical and psychological sense of the fluidity of consciousness, blurring the distinctions between past, present and future. One of the major theoretical innovations made by the Salon Cubists, independently of Picasso and Braque, was that of simultaneity, drawing to greater or lesser extent on theories of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, Charles Henry, Maurice Princet, and Henri Bergson. With simultaneity, the concept of separate spatial and temporal dimensions was comprehensively challenged. Linear perspective developed during the Renaissance was vacated. The subject matter was no longer considered from a specific point of view at <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> but built following a selection of successive viewpoints, i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous angles (and in multiple dimensions) with the eye free to roam from one to the other.|$|E
