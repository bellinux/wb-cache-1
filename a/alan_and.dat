5|$|Later, <b>Alan</b> <b>and</b> Joanna are {{stopped by}} a {{policeman}} on suspicion of stealing the campervan. Joanna gets her peanut-butter sandwich and smears it in the policeman's face. <b>Alan</b> <b>and</b> Joanna have an argument about the minute odds of the policeman having a peanut allergy and going into anaphylaxis, while in the background this is actually happening. They then carry {{the body of the}} policeman into the van. Soon, having run out of food and petrol, Alan changes the engine to run on alcohol and fermented excrement. The plan is of no use however, as the van explodes. They soon reach the beach and Joanna gives Alan three options: Give themselves up, swim the Channel to Spain or commit suicide. As Alan is not keen on the Spanish, they choose the third option and they are last seen walking naked into the sea, presumably to their deaths - although the alternate ending shows them hanging on to a buoy sometime later.|$|E

5|$|Another of Donnchadh's sons, Eóin (John), {{owned the}} land of Straiton. He was {{involved}} in the Galwegian revolt of Gille Ruadh in 1235, during which he attacked some churches in the diocese of Glasgow.

Tequila tracks Alan down to his sailboat {{to try to make}} sense of the situation, but the two are ambushed by the remnants of Hoi's gang.

Wong realizes that one of his gangsters named Foxy (Tung Wei), is an informant for the police. Foxy is beaten at the docks by Wong's henchman Mad Dog (Philip Kwok) in front of <b>Alan</b> <b>and</b> Wong. Alan then shoots Foxy in the chest, although he secretly placed a cigarette lighter in Foxy's breast pocket earlier to prevent the shot from being fatal. Foxy finds Tequila at a jazz bar and informs him that Wong's armory is in the nearby Maple Group Hospital. As Tequila takes Foxy to the hospital, Wong finds out that Foxy is alive and sends Alan to kill Foxy, as well as sending Mad Dog separately to cover Alan. At the hospital, Alan confronts Tequila, demanding to know the whereabouts of Wong's arsenal. While <b>Alan</b> <b>and</b> Tequila are distracted, Foxy is killed by Mad Dog.|$|E

5|$|This ending was the {{favourite}} {{amongst the}} actors. Mangan {{said that the}} alternative ending was the best moment {{in the whole of}} Green Wing. However, the alternative ending was rejected and the writers favoured the ending that was eventually broadcast.
