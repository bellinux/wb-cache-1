Los Angeles District Attorney Stephen Cooley produced a team of eight prosecutors, and filed four felony charges against her. Ryder hired noted celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos.

25|$|This {{variation}} of the patch clamp method {{is very similar to}} the whole-cell configuration. The main difference {{lies in the fact that}} when the experimenter forms the gigaohm seal, suction is not used to rupture the patch membrane. Instead, the electrode solution contains small amounts of an antifungal or antibiotic agent, such as amphothericin-B, nystatin, or gramicidin, which diffuses into the membrane patch and forms small pores in the membrane, providing electrical access to the cell interior. When comparing the whole-cell and perforated patch methods, one can think of the whole-cell patch as <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>door,</b> in which there is complete exchange between molecules in the pipette solution and the cytoplasm. The perforated patch can be likened to a screen door that only allows the exchange of certain molecules from the pipette solution to the cytoplasm of the cell.|$|E

Her arm, also floating in, carries a flame-lit lamp. The lamp is positioned very close to the bulb, and is a symbol of hope, clashing with the lightbulb. From the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center below the floating female figure. She looks up blankly into the blazing light bulb. Daggers that suggest screaming replace the tongues of the bull, grieving woman, and horse. A dove is scribed on the wall behind the bull. Part of its body comprises a crack in the wall through which bright light (hope, or the outside world) can be seen.

[...] In its review of True Blue, Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that [...] "she is using the music to hook in critics just as she's baiting a mass audience with such masterstrokes as 'Papa Don't Preach'." [...] Robert Christgau in a review for The Village Voice felt that [...] "she [...] doesn't speak for the ordinary teenaged stiff any more", adding that the [...] "antiabortion content of 'Papa Don't Preach' isn't unequivocal, and wouldn't make the song bad by definition if it were, the ambiguity is a cop-out rather than <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>door,</b> which is bad." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's sound {{team was}} {{composed}} of Kemal Amarasingham, Damin Djawadi and audio director Eric Brosius. According to Brosius, {{each member of the}} audio department did [...] "everything", without clear demarcations between roles. Like Thief, Thief II features a sound engine that simulates propagation in real-time. To achieve this effect, each level's geometry was input both to the level editor and to a [...] "separate [...] database", which mapped how sound would realistically propagate based on [...] "the physical room characteristics [...] how all the different rooms and areas are connected together". For example, noise travels freely through <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>door</b> but is blocked when the door is closed. The team used the new [...] "occlusion" [...] feature in EAX 2.0 to make Thief IIs sound environment more realistic and to allow the player to listen through doors. The game features more sound effects, music and speech than the original Thief. Thief IIs score, as with that of its predecessor, was designed to [...] "blur ambient [...] and music" [...] together. However, Brosius later stated that, while Thiefs soundtrack is composed of [...] "simple and hypnotic" [...] loops only a few seconds in length, Thief II features longer and [...] "more thoughtfully" [...] constructed pieces. He believed that this method had positive aspects, but that it resulted in a less immersive audio environment.|$|E

500|$|Benjamin Champney was {{a master}} at {{painting}} water and is known for warm autumn colors. William F. Paskell (18661951), in his later style, used broad brushstrokes and bright colors to create an impressionistic feeling. George McConnell (18521929) was known for the velvety pastel look of his paintings. Edward Hill often created a canopy-like depiction of trees to frame and accentuate {{the focus of a}} painting, a technique that gave many of his works a feeling of intimacy and solitude. [...] Many of the works of Samuel Lancaster Gerry (18131891) included dogs, people on horseback, and women and men in red clothing. Francis Seth Frost (18251902) was known to use small figures, wispy clouds, and an oval format. Alfred Thompson Bricher (18371908) was known for his quiet, calm water. Sylvester Phelps Hodgdon (18301906) painted at the extremes of the day – sunrise and sunset scenes – and often in Franconia Notch. John White Allen Scott (1815–1907) frequently painted passing storm clouds in his skies. Frank Henry Shapleigh had his own primitive style and used the same [...] "props" [...] {{over and over again in}} his paintings. [...] He is known for painting landscapes as seen from the inside of a house or barn looking out through <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>door</b> or window.

500|$|Lasseter {{was embarrassed}} {{with what was}} on the screen, later recalling, [...] "It was a story filled with the most unhappy, mean {{characters}} that I've ever seen." [...] He asked Disney for the chance to retreat back to Pixar and rework the script in two weeks, and Katzenberg was supportive. Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown to the production crew, many of whom had left other jobs to work on the project. In the meantime, the crew would shift to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter kept morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was [...] "a very scary time," [...] recalled story department manager BZ Petroff. Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators. Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>door</b> to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and would later go over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it. Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists would then draw the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with revising, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised. When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on Toy Story, Steve Jobs kept the work going with his own personal funding. Jobs did not insert himself much into the creative process, respecting the artists at Pixar and instead managing the relationship with Disney.|$|E
