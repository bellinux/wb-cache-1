5|$|Even {{though his}} {{military}} career begun almost <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought,</b> or by accident, Zamoyski is also remembered {{as one of}} the most accomplished Polish military commanders. In his tactics, he favored sieges, flanking maneuvers, conserving his forces, and the new Western art of fortification and artillery. The war with Muscovy shown him to be a skilled commander in sieges, and latter events would prove him to be an equally able leader in the open field.|$|E
5|$|Continuing the {{tradition}} {{set by the}} first game, Wipeout 3 contains electronica offerings from various artists, including The Chemical Brothers, Orbital, and the Propellerheads. Psygnosis' development manager, Enda Carey, focused on bringing together music early in the game's development cycle, instead of <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought</b> or last-minute addition to the game. Unlike previous soundtracks, Psygnosis selected a single music director, DJ Sasha, who worked with artists to create a cohesive soundtrack. Sasha included several of his own tracks made specifically for the game. The game disc is a Mixed Mode CD that allows Wipeout 3s soundtrack to be played in a standard compact disc player. To promote Wipeout 3 and its game music, Psygnosis sponsored a Global Underground tour for Sasha. Game pods featuring Wipeout 3 were placed at parties and venues, accompanied by a tie-in marketing campaign.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{also used}} the data to reveal details about the {{technique}} used and to predict that the painting will degrade very little if current conservation techniques are continued. During 2006, Mona Lisa underwent a major scientific observation that proved through infrared cameras she was originally wearing a bonnet and clutching her chair, something that da Vinci decided to change <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{some initial}} success the {{movement}} stagnated until after World War II. In 1946 {{efforts were made}} to revitalize and societies were created in New Jersey and Washington D.C., along with the inauguration of the Encampment for Citizenship. By 1968 there were thirty societies with a total national membership of over 5,500. However, the resuscitated movement differed from its predecessor in a few ways. The newer groups were being created in suburban locales and often to provide alternative Sunday schools for children, with adult activities <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought.</b>|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the canvas}} has shown {{that it was a}} type favored by Veronese, with an {{arrangement}} of threads creating a diagonal twill pattern. While he often preferred to paint on lightly colored grounds, for The Family of Darius before Alexander, as with many of his larger paintings, Veronese prepared the canvas only with plain gesso. Though he routinely made numerous preparatory sketches, Veronese made major revisions while working on The Family of Darius before Alexander, including painting out a balcony with figures directly behind the main group, and adding lightly sketched horses and figures to the left background, perhaps <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought.</b>|$|E

25|$|FlatSpin, {{along with}} GamePlan, was {{originally}} intended {{to be part of}} a pair of plays, both set in the London Docklands, and both using the same cast of seven. Ayckbourn has a flat in the Docklands, where he observed the neighbours do not know each other well and strange things can happen under their noses. The pair of plays was eventually joined by a third, RolePlay, written <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought,</b> and the trilogy, Damsels in Distress, was shown in the Stephen Joseph Theatre's 2001 season. Like the other two plays, this drew some inspiration from the London Docklands.|$|E
25|$|The fell {{is usually}} climbed from the minor road which {{runs along the}} base of the hill. From here Buckbarrow looks quite {{formidable}} and the crags are a deterrent to a direct ascent; however, all danger can be bypassed by starting the climb at the more westerly point of Harrow Head farm and following Gill Beck up to a height of around 350m (1,150ft) before bearing north easterly to the highest point above the crags. An alternative is to climb from Greendale, via Greendale Gill and Tongues Gills. Buckbarrow can also be bagged almost <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought</b> as the walker descends from Seatallan. Buckbarrow’s formidable crags are a popular rock climbing venue.|$|E

50|$|The {{game was}} not {{developed}} with an overarching plot structure {{in mind and}} this was implemented <b>as</b> something of <b>an</b> <b>afterthought</b> {{towards the end of}} development. The initial idea for relating the plot in-game came from Black's director, Alex Ward, who wanted to have a radio-play-style voiceover spoken over a 'black' screen.|$|R
500|$|Finally, Carr {{places his}} {{skepticism}} {{in a historical}} context, reflecting upon how previous detractors of technological advances have fared. While often correct, Carr points out that skepticisms such as Socrates' concerns about written language and the 15th-century Venetian editor Hieronimo Squarciafico's concerns about printed works failed to anticipate the benefits that these technologies might hold for human knowledge. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought,</b> a 2005 essay by playwright Richard Foreman is excerpted for its lament of the waning of the [...] "highly educated and articulate personality".|$|E
500|$|Fuseli's {{knowledge}} {{of art history}} was broad, allowing critics to propose sources for the painting's elements in antique, classical, and Renaissance art. According to art critic Nicholas Powell, the woman's pose may derive from the Vatican Ariadne, and {{the style of the}} incubus from , an archaeological site in Sicily. A source for the woman in Giulio Romano's The Dream of Hecuba at the Palazzo del Te has also been proposed. Powell links the horse to a woodcut by the German Renaissance artist Hans Baldung or to the marble Horse Tamers on Quirinal Hill, Rome. Fuseli may have added the horse <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought,</b> since a preliminary chalk sketch did not include it. Its presence in the painting has been viewed as a visual pun on the word [...] "nightmare" [...] and a self-conscious reference to folklore—the horse destabilises the painting's conceit and contributes to its Gothic tone.|$|E
500|$|The obverse of {{the coin}} {{features}} William Bradford. He wears a hat and carries a Bible under his arm. Bradford, noted for piety, {{is intended to be}} seen in a moment of meditation. Dallin's plaster models had the words [...] "HOLY BIBLE" [...] on the volume; these, together with Dallin's initials [...] "CED", were removed. Instead, the initial D was placed under Bradford's elbow, likely impressed upon the hub <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought</b> by a punch normally used to create the mint mark D for the Denver Mint. Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen deemed Bradford's broad collar near enough to Puritan wear of the day to pass, though they questioned the authenticity of the ruffled cravat. Bradford's portrait is in any case an invention; no genuine likeness of him is known. The crudeness of the lettering complained of by Fraser is not apparent due to the relatively small size {{of the coin}}s.|$|E
50|$|The Shake King is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Wario Land: Shake It! who kidnaps Queen Merelda and takes the Shake Dimension's treasures, among them the Bottomless Coin Bag that holds an infinite amounts of coins. Sweet-talked by Captain Syrup with promises of treasure, Wario defeats the Shake King and frees the Shake Dimension from his evil, though this registers <b>as</b> <b>a</b> complete <b>afterthought</b> in Wario's mind.|$|R
5000|$|Information {{may also}} be added after the main clause <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kind of <b>afterthought.</b> In ASL this is {{commonly}} seen with subject pronouns. These are accompanied by a nod of the head, and make a statement more emphatic: ...|$|R

Then, <b>as</b> though by <b>an</b> <b>afterthought,</b> he touched his breast several times, and after each touch, said in a voice of strange softness, [...] "Kari," [...] which I took it he meant was his name. At any rate, from that time forward I called him Kari.|$|R
500|$|Most of {{the episode}} is devoted to {{references}} and allusions to other works, {{as well as the}} show itself. The title sequence is deliberately shorter than most other episodes, poking fun at shows like Lost as well as the Sci-Fi Channel itself, which had shortened SG-1's Season 9 opening but changed it back after fans demanded it. When Martin learns that his main actor has backed out of the movie, the SG-1 team offers various suggestions for how to replace him or work around his non-availability—a reference to Michael Shanks's absence from the sixth season of Stargate SG-1. Anderson himself also pokes fun at the ending of the eighth-season episode , which was intended to be the series finale before the ninth season was announced. The final scene of [...] "200", which features interviews with the Wormhole X-Treme cast, was added <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought,</b> and contains comments from the real cast which were used out of context as an inside joke.|$|E
500|$|... "Revival" [...] {{initially}} {{took shape}} as an instrumental, with lyrics <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought.</b> [...] "An instrumental {{has to be}} real catchy and when you succeed it's very satisfying because you have transcended words and communicated with emotion," [...] said Betts. The song takes on a decidedly gospel flair midway through, accentuated by [...] "old-fashioned church-like hand clapping." [...] The Gregg Allman-penned [...] "Don't Keep Me Wonderin'" [...] follows, featuring Duane on slide guitar and Oakley's friend Thom Doucette on harmonica. [...] "Midnight Rider" [...] developed quickly and featured lyrics contributed by roadie Robert Payne, who threw out a suggestion to Gregg Allman while together at their equipment warehouse. Unable to gain {{a key to the}} nearby Capricorn Sound Studios, the duo broke in and recorded a quick demo with Twiggs Lyndon on bass and Johanson on congas. Duane eventually laid down acoustic guitar tracks for both [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Midnight Rider", as he was quicker to record and more technically savvy due to his session work in Muscle Shoals.|$|E
500|$|In 1947, Ross asked Sinnock {{to produce}} a design for a half dollar {{featuring}} Franklin. [...] The chief engraver adapted his earlier work for the obverse. [...] He had designed the medal from a bust of Franklin by Jean-Antoine Houdon. Sinnock based his design for the reverse on the 1926 commemorative half dollar for the sesquicentennial (150th anniversary) of American Independence. Numismatic writer Don Taxay later discovered that Sinnock had based his Liberty Bell (as depicted on both the Sesquicentennial half dollar and the Franklin half) on a sketch by John Frederick Lewis. Sinnock died in May 1947, before finishing the reverse design, which was completed by the new chief engraver, Gilroy Roberts. [...] Similar to Sinnock's work for the Roosevelt dime, the portrait is designed along simple lines, with Franklin depicted wearing a period suit. [...] The small eagle on the reverse was added <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>afterthought,</b> when Mint officials realized that the Coinage Act of 1873 required one to be displayed on all coins of greater value than the dime.|$|E
50|$|Traffic speeds {{are kept}} low - with a typical target speed being around 20 km/h (10-15 mph) - through the overall {{design of the}} street and {{features}} such as sharp changes of direction for traffic and narrowings where only one motor vehicle can pass at a time. Traditional traffic calming features such as road humps can also be used, but should be integrated into the design rather than being added <b>as</b> <b>an</b> engineered <b>afterthought.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} PETs is complex. It {{considers}} new {{as well as}} emerging systems. The addition of PETs onto existing systems leads to an impact on system functionality regarding privacy [30]. Because of this, PETs have often been viewed <b>as</b> almost <b>an</b> <b>afterthought</b> by users [30]. Additionally, {{there is a lack}} of awareness of the differences between PETs and PbD [30], as seen in the often unnoticed differences between the PETs and PbD paradigms [30]. There are several ways that these differences can be addressed, including the application of formal methods to facilitate architecture language and logic [18].|$|R
25|$|In 1930, basing {{himself on}} press reports, Henric Sanielevici turned his {{attention}} to the Messianic movements of Bessarabia, and in particular the Inochentist church. The latter had recently broken up with Russian Orthodoxy, forming a Charismatic group with its own version of Christian lore. The Inochentists allegedly preached mortification and sacred prostitution, reminding Sanielevici of the Orthodox sectarian activity depicted by Dmitry Merezhkovsky in his philosophical novels, and reviewed by him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> northernmost <b>afterthought</b> of Semitic-Dionysian religions.|$|R
