Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean and powered by plutonium stolen from Libyan terrorists. Doc demonstrates the time navigation system by punching in the date November 5, 1955: the day he invented time travel. <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> Libyans arrive and shoot Doc.

5|$|Hambleton, whose {{call sign}} was Bat 21 Bravo, was {{positioned}} immediately behind the pilot, {{who gave the}} signal for everyone to eject. Hambleton pulled the ejection seat handles and had a moment {{to make eye contact}} with the pilot as his seat rocketed out of the dying plane. <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col. Anthony R. Giannangeli, Lt. Col. Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex—were unable to eject and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found.|$|E
25|$|The White Lady, {{without making}} a sound, {{advances}} along the terrace. Raymonda follows her {{in a state of}} unconsciousness. At a signal from the White Lady, the garden is wrapped in mist. <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> mist vanishes and Jean de Brienne appears. Overjoyed, Raymonda runs into his arms and they are surrounded by glory, knights and celestial maidens. The garden is illuminated by a fantastic light and Raymonda expresses her joy to the White Lady, who interrupts her enthusiasm with a vision of what awaits her. Raymonda wants to return to her fiancé, but instead, she finds Abderakhman, who has taken Jean de Brienne's place. Abderakhman declares his passionate love for her, but Raymonda, though confused and upset, is quick to reject him. Imps and elves appear from everywhere surrounding Raymonda, who begs the White Lady to save her and Abderakhman tries to take Raymonda by force. Raymonda cries out and falls to the ground in a faint. The frightful vision disappears along with the White Lady.|$|E

On {{the left of the}} brigade, where the 7th Dutch Militia stood, a [...] "few files were shot down and an opening in the line thus occurred". The battalion had no reserves and was unable to close the gap. D'Erlon's troops pushed through this gap in the line and the remaining battalions in the Bylandt brigade (8th Dutch Militia and Belgian 7th Line Battalion) were forced to retreat to the square of the 5th Dutch Militia, which was in reserve between Picton's troops, about 100 paces to the rear. There they regrouped under the command of Colonel Van Zuylen van Nijevelt. <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> Prince of Orange ordered a counterattack, which actually occurred around 10 minutes later.

[...] <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> controller saw an explosion.|$|E

[...] The later crescents have changed to scarlet, and it evidences the [...] "mingling of anger and fear," [...] while the last crescent is quite scarlet, and it shows that [...] "already the fright is entirely overcome, and only the annoyance remains." ...|$|E
