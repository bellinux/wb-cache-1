5|$|The {{cutaneous}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé were originally described as fibrofolliculomas (abnormal growths of <b>a</b> <b>hair</b> follicle), trichodiscomas (hamartomatous lesions with <b>a</b> <b>hair</b> follicle at the periphery, often {{found on the}} face), and acrochordons (skin tags). Cutaneous manifestations are confirmed by histology. Most individuals (89%) with BHD are found to have multiple cysts in both lungs, and 24% have had one or more episodes of pneumothorax. The cysts can be detected by chest CT scan. Renal tumors can manifest as multiple types of renal cell carcinoma, but certain pathological subtypes (including chromophobe, oncocytoma, and oncocytic hybrid tumors) are more commonly seen. Although the original syndrome was discovered {{on the basis of}} cutaneous findings, it is now recognized that individuals with Birt–Hogg–Dubé may only manifest the pulmonary and/or renal findings, without any skin lesions. Though these signs indicate BHD, it is only confirmed with a genetic test for FLCN mutations.|$|E

5|$|Angle {{made his}} debut for Mexican {{promotion}} Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) on August 5, 2012 at Triplemanía XX, where he {{teamed up with}} Jeff Jarrett as Team Dorian Roldán in <b>a</b> <b>hair</b> vs. hair match, where they faced Team Joaquín Roldán (Electroshock and L.A. Park), with the Roldáns' hairs on the line. Electroshock won the match for his team by pinning Angle, forcing Dorian to have his head shaved bald. However, after the match, Angle, Jarrett and Dorian overpowered the winners and shaved Joaquín bald.|$|E
5|$|Back in AAA, {{following}} {{interference from}} Jake Roberts, Konnan lost a {{two out of}} three falls retirement match by count-out to Caras at Triplemanía I on April 30, 1993 in front of 48,000 fans in Mexico City, setting the all-time attendance record for a Mexican wrestling event.

5|$|In late 2005, two NHL {{players who}} had been listed as {{potential}} Olympians failed drug tests administered by the WADA. American Bryan Berard, who had competed in the 1998 Winter Olympics, tested positive for 19-Norandrosterone. Canadian José Théodore failed a drug test because he was taking Propecia, <b>a</b> <b>hair</b> loss medication that contains the non-performance-enhancing drug Finasteride. Both players received two-year bans from international competition, although neither had made their team's final roster.|$|E

5|$|Potty then scolds Patchy for his unsanitary {{environment}} (such as keeping {{ground beef}} {{in an old}} boot, having rats in the kitchen, not washing his hands after using the bathroom and not wearing <b>a</b> <b>hair</b> net). Fed up with Potty's criticisms, Patchy starts throwing patties at Potty, but they keep missing, and one eventually hits Mr. Pirateson, the Owner of Poop Deck. Patchy then tells the viewers to watch {{the rest of the}} SpongeBob episode while he watches Potty get fired, just as Mr. Pirateson forcefully shouts for Patchy to get in his office.|$|E
5|$|Another Green Wing {{series of}} running jokes is about hair. One {{of the more}} notable was various cracks about Mac's untidy hair, with Sue lending him <b>a</b> <b>hair</b> tie and hair clips before he goes in for an interview. Another was the {{character}} Karen getting her hair trapped in a printer in the first episode. Mac was {{often referred to as}} a Ginger by the other characters. Guy's hair becomes gradually curlier as the series goes on and Rachel dyes her hair from blonde to brunette after the first series. Other recurring jokes include Boyce's practical jokes, the bizarre games played by the human resources staff and surgery scenes where Caroline, Guy and Mac mess around while performing operations.|$|E
5|$|In November, Chaplin {{began working}} with Cherrill again {{in some of the}} Flower Girl's less {{dramatic}} scenes. While waiting for her scenes for several months, Cherrill had become bored and openly complained to Chaplin. During the filming of one scene, Cherrill asked Chaplin if she could leave early so that she could go to <b>a</b> <b>hair</b> appointment. Chaplin fired Virginia Cherrill and replaced her with Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in The Gold Rush. However, Hale's screen tests proved that she was unsuitable for the role. Chaplin also briefly considered sixteen-year-old actress Violet Krauth, but he was talked out of this idea by his collaborators. Chaplin finally re-hired Cherrill to finish City Lights. She demanded and got a raise to $75 per week. Approximately seven minutes of test footage of Hale survives and is included on the DVD release; excerpts were first seen in the documentary Unknown Chaplin along with an unused opening sequence.|$|E

5|$|Johansson has {{supported}} various charitable organizations, including Aid Still Required, Cancer Research UK, Stand Up To Cancer, Too Many Women (which works against breast cancer), and USA Harvest, which provides food {{for people in}} need. In 2005, Johansson became a Global Ambassador for the aid and development agency Oxfam. In 2007, Johansson took part in social advocacy {{as part of the}} anti-poverty campaign ONE, which was organized by U2 lead singer Bono. In March 2008, a UK-based bidder paid £20,000 on an eBay auction to benefit Oxfam, winning <b>a</b> <b>hair</b> and makeup treatment, a pair of tickets, and a chauffeured trip to accompany Johansson on a 20-minute date to the world premiere of He's Just Not That Into You.|$|E
5|$|Miceli {{wrestled}} {{a six-week}} tour for All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling {{at the beginning}} of 1989, where she won the IWA Women's title from Chigusa Nagayo before dropping it back to her the very next day. She then began training in Japan, learning the Japanese wrestling style, as well as Muay Thai, kickboxing, and boxing. She eventually signed a three-year deal with All Japan, which made her the first non-Japanese wrestler to do so. In addition, she worked for the TWA, feuding with Luna Vachon, whom she faced in <b>a</b> <b>Hair</b> vs Hair Mixed Tag Team match in September 1991. Miceli and her partner Eddie Gilbert defeated Vachon and Cactus Jack, which resulted in Vachon having her head shaved.|$|E
5|$|Molly {{lost her}} {{championship}} to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud led to <b>a</b> <b>Hair</b> versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in her having her head shaved. Greenwald maintains {{that it was}} her idea to have her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred because she wanted to do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using loose-fitting wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E

5|$|She {{left home}} in 1990 {{at the age}} of 16, and moved to Melbourne, where she {{qualified}} as a hairdresser and beauty therapist. By 1994 she was running <b>a</b> <b>hair</b> dressing store and managing seven employees. Her life was changed that year by a fall from a building in Melbourne in which fractured her third and fourth thoracic vertebrae, rendering her an incomplete paraplegic. She lay there for forty minutes before someone found her. She spent the next four weeks in the Austin Hospital in Heidelberg, and then another {{two and a half months}} in the Royal Talbot Rehabilitation Centre in Kew. She was forced to move back in with her parents, where she lived for the next five years, but within a year of her accident, she was managing five hairdressing stores.|$|E
5|$|The Boggs' {{neighbors are}} curious about their new house guest, and the Boggs throw a {{neighborhood}} barbecue welcoming Edward. Most {{of the neighbors}} are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries. This leads him to discover he can groom dogs' hair, and later he styles the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open <b>a</b> <b>hair</b> salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce Edward, but scares him away. Joyce tells the neighborhood women that he attempted to seduce her, reducing their trust in him. The bank refuses to give Edward a loan as {{he does not have}} a background or financial history.|$|E
5|$|The book , co-written by {{the three}} bodyguards fired the {{previous}} year, was published on August 1. It was the first exposé to detail Presley's years of drug misuse. He was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers. By this point, he suffered from multiple ailments: glaucoma, high blood pressure, liver damage, and an enlarged colon, each aggravated—and possibly caused—by drug abuse. Genetic analysis of <b>a</b> <b>hair</b> sample in 2014 found evidence of genetic variants that could have caused his glaucoma, migraines and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, his drug abuse had led to falls, head trauma, and overdoses that most likely had damaged his brain.|$|E
