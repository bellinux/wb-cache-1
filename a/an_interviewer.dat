5|$|Gummadi Venkateswara Rao was {{recommended}} to Chakrapani by Madhavapeddi Venkatramaiah. After auditioning other actors, Chakrapani asked Venkateswara Rao {{to make a}} cameo appearance as <b>an</b> <b>interviewer.</b> He received 5001,000 for a day's work, a generous salary for the time; actors in major film roles received 2,000 for 20 days of work. Chakrapani justified Venkateswara Rao's salary {{by saying that the}} actor's family included three children who had moved to Madras (now Chennai). For a photo shoot, Rama Rao lent Venkateswara Rao his coat and placed a tilaka on his forehead. Allu Ramalingaiah was cast as the comic teacher-cum-ayurvedic-doctor Panthulu.|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{will present}} and test a model linking actual applicant-interviewer demographic, human capital, and cultural capital similarity to <b>an</b> <b>interviewer??s</b> recommendation to hire. Actual similarity is proposed to influence <b>an</b> <b>interviewer??s</b> perceptions of similarity with an applicant. These perceptions, in turn, {{lead to the}} interviewer??s perceptions of the applicant??s Person-Organization (PO) fit and the applicant??s Person-Job (PJ) fit. Two main mechanisms are proposed to mediate the relationship between <b>an</b> <b>interviewer??s</b> perceptions of similarity and <b>an</b> <b>interviewer??s</b> perceptions of <b>an</b> applicant??s fit: liking and negative behavioral expectations. Lastly, both <b>an</b> <b>interviewer??s</b> PO and PJ fit perceptions of an applicant are posited to influence the interviewer??s recommendation to hire. A total of 118 interviewer-applicant dyads contacted through the Career Center Office at a University located in the southwestern United States participated in the study. Results partially support the model. An interviewer??s perceptions of similarity with an applicant are positively related to <b>an</b> <b>interviewer??s</b> fit evaluations. An interviewer??s negative behavioral expectations of an applicant mediate this relationship. Furthermore, perceived similarity is positively related to <b>an</b> <b>interviewer??s</b> liking of <b>an</b> applicant. In turn, liking is positively related to <b>an</b> <b>interviewer??s</b> PO fit perceptions. However, liking does not function as a mediator between perceived similarity and fit evaluations. Finally, fit evaluations are positively related to hiring recommendations. I discuss the main implications of the study as well as strengths, limitations, and future research...|$|R

5|$|It was in Brockville {{that the}} 21-year-old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting. In 1959, CFJR, a local radio station, hired {{him as a}} member of its news department; many of his stories, {{including}} his coverage of a local train wreck, were picked up by the CBC. By 1961, Jennings had joined the staff of CJOH-TV, then a new television station in Ottawa. When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> and co-producer for Vue, a late-night news program. His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him that resembled that of Dick Clark, and Jennings soon found himself hosting Club Thirteen, a dance show similar to American Bandstand.|$|E
5|$|The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Patience, {{opened at}} the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success, usurping Pinafore's {{position}} as the longest running piece in the series with the second-longest run in musical theatre history. Patience satirised the self-indulgent aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England. To popularise the opera in America, in 1882 Carte sent one of the artistes under his management, the young poet Oscar Wilde, on a lecture tour to explain to Americans what the aesthetic movement was about. Carte told <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> {{at that time that}} he had fifteen theatrical companies and performers touring simultaneously in Europe, America and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Their {{relationship}} was further strained in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> about deHavilland's new husband, Marcus Goodrich. When she read her sister's remarks, deHavilland was deeply hurt {{and waited for}} an apology that was never offered. The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for To Each His Own, deHavilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who extended her hand to congratulate her; deHavilland {{turned away from her}} sister. The two did not speak {{for the next five years}} after the incident. This may have caused an estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters, who maintained a covert relationship with their aunt, deHavilland.|$|E

25|$|At Brown's urging, NATO members pledged in 1977 to {{increase}} their individual defense spending three percent per year in real terms for the 1979-86 period. The objective, Brown explained, was to ensure that alliance resources and capabilities-both conventional and nuclear-would balance those of the Soviet bloc. Although some NATO members hesitated to confirm the agreement to accept new missiles and did not always attain the three percent target, Brown was pleased with NATO's progress. Midway in his term he told <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> that he thought his most important achievement thus far had been the revitalization of NATO.|$|E
