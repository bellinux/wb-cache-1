5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori <b>artists</b> <b>are</b> increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs.|$|E
5|$|In Hoysala art Hardy {{identifies}} two conspicuous {{departures from}} the more austere Western (Later) Chalukya art:ornamental elaboration and a profusion of iconography with figure sculptures, {{both of which are}} found in abundance even on the superstructure over the shrine. Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style. Hoysala <b>artists</b> <b>are</b> noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the Hindu epics and deities or in their use of motifs such as yalli, kirtimukha (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on pilaster, makara (aquatic monster), birds (hamsa), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.|$|E

5|$|The Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, {{located in}} Rimal, was {{completed}} in 1988 and named after its founder, former mayor Rashad al-Shawa. A two-story building with a triangular plan, the cultural centers performs three main functions: a meeting place for large gatherings during annual festivals, a place to stage exhibitions, and a library. The French Cultural Center {{is a symbol of}} French partnership and cooperation in Gaza. It holds art exhibits, concerts, film screenings, and other activities. Whenever possible, French <b>artists</b> <b>are</b> invited to display their artwork, and more frequently, Palestinian artists from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are invited to participate in art competitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} {{of the first generation}} of Netherlandish <b>artists</b> <b>are</b> often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references. Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals. Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the Life of Mary vastly predominate.|$|E
5|$|Jan van Eyck's {{use of oil}} as {{a medium}} was a {{significant}} development, allowing artists far greater manipulation of paint. The 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari claimed van Eyck invented the use of oil paint; a claim that, while exaggerated, indicates {{the extent to which}} van Eyck helped disseminate the technique. Van Eyck employed a new level of virtuosity, mainly from taking advantage of the fact that oil dries so slowly; this gave him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments, and his technique was quickly adopted and refined by both Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden. These three <b>artists</b> <b>are</b> considered the first rank and most influential of the early generation of Early Netherlandish painters. Their influence was felt across northern Europe, from Bohemia and Poland in the east to Austria and Swabia in the south.|$|E

5|$|Most {{conventions}} {{will feature}} {{some kind of}} an art show, in which artists' work is displayed, often for direct purchase or auction during the convention. There will often be a Dealers Den where art and comic book distributors and other merchants can sell their wares for a fee, and an Artists' Alley where individual <b>artists</b> <b>are</b> given space for no fee or a token fee, usually on the condition that they only sell their own work. Artists may also trade art between each other using sketchbooks. Erotic art is typically allowed if kept separate from other pieces, and only shown to adult attendees; a few conventions are rated strictly PG-13. Individual transactions are relatively small (usually around US$10–$50 for sketches or badges, $10–$200 for auction pieces), but the total can approach US$100,000 at the largest events (excluding professional dealers).|$|E
5|$|The Palais des Sports in the Mahamasina {{neighborhood}} is the country's only indoor performance space built to international standards. It {{was built in}} 1995 by the Government of China; it regularly hosts concerts, dance and other arts performances, expositions and novelty events like monster truck rallies. The city lacks a dedicated classical music performance space, and concerts by international <b>artists</b> <b>are</b> infrequent. Performances of classical, jazz and other foreign musical genres, modern and contemporary dance, theater and other arts occur at cultural arts centers funded by foreign governments or private entities. Among the best-known of these are the Centre Culturel Albert Camus and Alliance française d'Antananarivo, both funded by the French government. the Cercle Germano-Malgache, {{a branch of the}} Goethe-Institut funded by the German government; The American Center is funded by the United States government. Antananarivo has two dedicated cinemas, the Rex and the Ritz, both of which were built in the colonial era. These venues do not show international releases but occasionally screen Malagasy films or are used for private events and religious services.|$|E
5|$|The regular main {{composer}} for the Tales {{series is}} Motoi Sakuraba. His first {{work on the}} series was for Phantasia, and has since contributed to nearly every main entry since there in the capacity of a freelance composer. Sakuraba has become noted for his signature musical style, which {{is present in the}} majority of his Tales scores. He also frequently collaborates with Shinji Tamura. The entries Sakuraba has not worked on are Legendia, which was composed by Go Shiina, an in-house composer, and Innocence, whose composer was Kazuhiro Nakamura. Sakuraba and Shiina had collaborated on the score for Zestiria. Multiple titles in the series use licensed theme songs by multiple Japanese artists: among the <b>artists</b> <b>are</b> Garnet Crow (Eternia), Deen (Destiny/Hearts), Kokia (Innocence), Ayumi Hamasaki (Xillia/Xillia 2) and FLOW (Berseria). One recurring aspect of many earlier localizations was the removal of the Japanese theme song, such as with Symphonia, which had its theme song replaced with an orchestral version. The first western release of a Tales title to feature the theme song used in Japan was Vesperia.|$|E

The <b>artists</b> <b>were</b> able to pick their own themes, subject matter and style. Some of the mural locations were selected by the artists themselves. Each <b>artist</b> <b>was</b> evaluated and paid according to his or her skill and experience. [...] "Class A" [...] <b>artists</b> <b>were</b> upper-class <b>artists</b> - more established, considered highly skilled and experienced. They were paid $40 a week for 20 hours' work. [...] "Class B" [...] <b>artists</b> <b>were</b> less skilled and experienced, and were paid $27.50 a week for 20 hours of work. [...] "Class C" [...] <b>artists</b> <b>were</b> craftsman and laborers, receiving the lowest pay. When the PWAP project ended in June 1934 Region 13 had employed 3,600 artists and produced more than 16,000 works of art, created for public display.|$|R
