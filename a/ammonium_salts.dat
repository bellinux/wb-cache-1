5|$|Thus, the {{ammonium}} ion, , {{plays the}} same role in liquid ammonia as does the hydronium ion in water and the amide ion, , {{is analogous to the}} hydroxide ion. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> behave as acids, and amides behave as bases.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{compounds}} have a {{very long}} history, ammonium chloride having been known to Herodotus. They were well known by the Middle Ages. Alchemists knew nitric acid as aqua fortis (strong water), {{as well as other}} nitrogen compounds such as <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> and nitrate salts. The mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as aqua regia (royal water), celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold, the king of metals.|$|E
5|$|Separation of {{trivalent}} actinides from lanthanide {{fission products}} {{can be done}} by a cation-exchange resin column using a 90% water/10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) as eluant. It is usually followed by anion-exchange chromatography using 6 molar HCl as eluant. A cation-exchange resin column (Dowex-50 exchange column) treated with <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> is then used to separate fractions containing elements 99, 100 and 101. These elements can be then identified simply based on their elution position/time, using α-hydroxyisobutyrate solution (α-HIB), for example, as eluant.|$|E

50|$|The {{racemic mixture}} of this chiral {{compound}} may be separated into enantiomers by conversion into the diastereomeric tartaric acid <b>ammonium</b> <b>salt.</b> After purification of the diastereomer, the diamine can be regenerated by {{treatment of the}} <b>ammonium</b> <b>salt</b> with sodium hydroxide. Alternate reagents for chiral resolution include N-p-toluenesulfonylaspartic acid, N-benzenesulfonylaspartic acid, or N-benzoylglutamic acid.|$|R
5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} amino acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the bromination at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts,</b> R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia and <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> can {{be readily}} detected, in very minute traces, by the {{addition}} of Nessler's solution, which gives a distinct yellow colouration {{in the presence of the}} least trace of ammonia or <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts.</b> The amount of ammonia in <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> can be estimated quantitatively by distillation of the salts with sodium or potassium hydroxide, the ammonia evolved being absorbed in a known volume of standard sulfuric acid and the excess of acid then determined volumetrically; or the ammonia may be absorbed in hydrochloric acid and the ammonium chloride so formed precipitated as ammonium hexachloroplatinate, (NH4)2PtCl6.|$|E
50|$|Mellitic acid may be {{prepared}} by warming mellite with ammonium carbonate, boiling off the {{excess of the}} <b>ammonium</b> <b>salt,</b> and adding ammonia to the solution. The precipitated alumina is filtered off, the filtrate evaporated, and the <b>ammonium</b> <b>salt</b> of the acid purified by recrystallization. The <b>ammonium</b> <b>salt</b> is then converted into the lead salt by precipitation with lead acetate, and the lead salt is then decomposed by hydrogen sulfide.

25|$|Amides can be {{prepared}} by the reaction of ammonia with carboxylic acid derivatives. Acyl chlorides are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present {{in at least a}} twofold excess to neutralise the hydrogen chloride formed. Esters and anhydrides also react with ammonia to form amides. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> of carboxylic acids can be dehydrated to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150–200°C are required.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of hexachloroplatinic acid with an <b>{{ammonium}}</b> <b>salt,</b> such as <b>ammonium</b> chloride, gives ammonium hexachloroplatinate, {{which is}} relatively insoluble in ammonium solutions.

25|$|The first {{possible}} literary {{reference to}} the salt cementation parting process is in the Arthashastra, a 4th-century BC treatise from India, that mentions heating of gold with Indus earth.

In the experiments, four bubble separation parameters were used with β-lactoglobulin, albumin bovine, and starch (soluble) preferred as foaming agents and without additives. The enrichment of glycyrrhizic acid <b>ammonium</b> <b>salt</b> into the foam was influenced by different additive substances. The results showed that highest enrichment values were obtained from β-lactoglobulin as much as 368. 3 times.

25|$|Soon after inoculation, yeast {{begin to}} rapidly consume the {{available}} assimilable nitrogen {{with up to}} 46% of YAN being fully consumed by the onset of full fermentation. Because inorganic nitrogen, such as the <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> in DAP, are toxic to yeast in high levels, it is never added during inoculation when the biomass of the newly re-hydrated yeast is low. Many winemakers split up the dosage of DAP with the first addition being made {{at the end of}} the lag phase when the yeast enter their period of exponential growth and alcoholic fermentation begins. In most must this is around 48 to 72 hours after inoculation. A second dosage is then often added around a third of the way through sugar fermentation and often before the sugar levels hit 12-10 Brix (6.5 to 5.5 Baumé, 48.3 to 40.0 Oechsle) because as the fermentation progresses yeast cells are no longer able to bring the nitrogen into the cell due to the increasing toxicity of ethanol surrounding the cells. This leaves the nitrogen unused and available for spoilage organisms that may come afterwards.|$|E
500|$|One {{method for}} obtaining pure yttrium from the mixed oxide ores is to {{dissolve}} the oxide in sulfuric acid and fractionate it by ion exchange chromatography.

[...] When the counter-ion is nitrate, the light lanthanides are removed, and when the counter-ion is thiocyanate, the heavy lanthanides are removed. In this way, yttrium salts of 99.999% purity are obtained. In the usual situation, where yttrium is in a mixture that is two-thirds heavy-lanthanide, yttrium should be removed as soon as possible to facilitate the separation of the remaining elements.|$|E
500|$|The {{ammonium}} ion (...) has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals, acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and rubidium, {{and is often}} considered a close relative. For example, most alkali metal salts are soluble in water, a property which <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> share. Ammonium is expected to behave stably as a metal ( [...] ions {{in a sea of}} delocalised electrons) at very high pressures (though less than the typical pressure where transitions from insulating to metallic behaviour occur around, 100GPa), and could possibly occur inside the ice giants Uranus and Neptune, which may have significant impacts on their interior magnetic fields. It has been estimated that the transition from a mixture of ammonia and dihydrogen molecules to metallic ammonium may occur at pressures just below 25GPa. Under standard conditions, ammonium can form a metallic amalgam with mercury.|$|E
