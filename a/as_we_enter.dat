2500|$|A {{day after}} England were {{knocked out of}} the World Cup, an {{emotional}} Beckham made a statement {{in a news conference}} that he had stepped down as England captain, stating, [...] "It has been an honour and privilege to captain my country but, having been captain for 58 of my 95 games, I feel the time is right to pass on the armband <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> a new era under Steve McClaren." [...] (Beckham had won 94 caps up to that point.) He was succeeded by Chelsea captain John Terry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first phase}} {{encompasses}} {{the time between}} the late 19th century to the 1930s. This era {{gave birth to the}} 'Independent female worker.' From 1890 to 1930, women in the workforce were typically young and unmarried. They had little or no learning on the job and typically held clerical and teaching positions. Many women also worked in textile manufacturing or as domestics. Women promptly exited the work force when they were married, unless the family needed two incomes. Towards the end of the 1920s, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> into the second phase, married women begin to exit the work force less and less. Labor force productivity for married women 35–44 years of age increase by 15.5 percentage points from 10% to 25%. There was a greater demand for clerical positions and as the number of women graduating high school increased they began to hold more [...] "respectable", steady jobs. This phase has been appropriately labeled as the Transition Era referring to the time period between 1930 and 1950. During this time the discriminatory institution of marriage bars, which forced women out of the work force after marriage, were eliminated, allowing more participation in the work force of single and married women. Additionally, women's labor force participation increased because there was an increase in demand for office workers and women participated in the high school movement. However, still women's work was contingent upon their husband's income. Women did not normally work to fulfill a personal need to define ones career and social worth; they worked out of necessity.|$|E

She held her head high, as a woman should, and at her slender throat glowed the pearls of Dorothy Manners.|$|E
60|$|These are {{the voices}} which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> into the world. Society {{everywhere}} is in conspiracy against the manhood {{of every one}} of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty {{and culture of the}} eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs.|$|E
60|$|As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>entered</b> the door, he barred it, and I {{found myself}} {{in the face of}} another huge door, which was {{strongly}} locked; and, at last, passing through that, <b>we</b> <b>entered</b> the lobby of the house.|$|R

60|$|When {{we stand}} before the bust of John Hunter, or <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> the {{magnificent}} museum furnished by his labours, and pass slowly, with meditative observation, through this august temple, which the genius of one great man has raised and dedicated to the wisdom and uniform working of the Creator, we perceive at every step the guidance, we had almost said, the inspiration, of those profound ideas concerning Life, which dawn upon us, indeed, through his written works, but which he has here presented to us in a more perfect language than that of words—the language of God himself, as uttered by Nature.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that might}} be the case with those who are fairly well off, but would {{scarcely}} be so among the poorer classes. Besides, even they, were we living among them, would have no reason for suspecting our story. There seems no doubt, from what they say, that Tippoo is preparing for war again, and I think that we shall do well, as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> the city, to change our attire, or we might be forced into joining the army, which would be the last thing we want. What I should desire, above all things, is to get service of some kind in the Palace." ...|$|E
60|$|Or take {{a single}} play, Othello, and {{disregarding}} all minor characters, fix {{attention on the}} pure devotion of Desdemona, the jealousy of Othello, the villainy of Iago. The genius that in a single hour can make us understand these contrasting characters {{as if we had}} met them in the flesh, and make our hearts ache <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> into their joy, their anguish, their dishonor, is beyond all ordinary standards of measurement. And Othello must be multiplied many times before we reach the limit of Shakespeare's creative imagination. He is like the genii of the Arabian Nights, who produce new marvels while we wonder at the old.|$|E

As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> the house to which I shall lead you, you will surround the two persons I shall place in your charge, and will conduct them {{to the spot where}} the chariot will be waiting. You will defend them, if necessary, with your lives, should any disobey my order to let you pass through with them. As soon as they are placed in the chariot you will be free to join in the sack, and if you should be losers by the delay, I will myself make up your share to that of your comrades. You are sure, Boduoc, that all the other arrangements are perfect?" ...|$|E

Now, {{all that}} has been {{hitherto}} said refers to ornament whose distance is fixed, or nearly so; as when it is at any considerable height from the ground, supposing the spectator to desire to see it, and to get as near it as he can. But the distance of ornament is never fixed to the general spectator. The tower of a cathedral is bound to look well, ten miles off, or five miles, or half a mile, or within fifty yards. The ornaments of its top have fixed distances, {{compared with those of}} its base; but quite unfixed distances in their relation to the great world: and the ornaments of the base have no fixed distance at all. They are bound to look well {{from the other side of}} the cathedral close, and to look equally well, or better, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> the cathedral door. How are we to manage this? ...|$|E
6000|$|Christ {{comes to}} us in many ways. But most surely does Christ come to us, and often most happily, and most clearly does He speak to us--in {{the face of a}} little child, fresh out of heaven. Ah, let us take heed that we despise not one of these little ones, lest we despise our Lord Himself. For as often <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> into communion with little children, so often does Christ come to us. So often, as in Judaea of old, does He take a little child and set him in the midst of us, that from its simplicity, docility, and trust--the restless, the mutinous, and the ambitious may learn the things which belong to their peace--so often does He say to us, [...] "Except ye be changed and become as this little child, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me. For I am meek and lowly of heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls." ...|$|E

6000|$|... § XV. The date {{at which}} this corrupt form of Gothic first prevailed over the early {{simplicity}} of the Venetian types can be determined in an instant, {{on the steps of}} the choir of the Church of St. John and Paul. On our left hand, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>enter,</b> is the tomb of the Doge Marco Cornaro, who died in 1367. It is rich and fully developed Gothic, with crockets and finials, but not yet attaining any extravagant developement. Opposite to it is that of the Doge Andrea Morosini, who died in 1382. Its Gothic is voluptuous, and over-wrought; the crockets are bold and florid, and the enormous finial represents a statue of St. Michael. There is no excuse for the antiquaries who, having this tomb before them, could have attributed the severe architecture of the Ducal Palace to a later date; for every one of the Renaissance errors is here in complete developement, though not so grossly as entirely to destroy the loveliness of the Gothic forms. In the Porta della Carta, 1423, the vice reaches its climax.|$|E
60|$|When we {{had gone}} entirely round the church, we came at last to the chapel of the Annunziata, which stands {{on the floor of}} the nave, on the left hand <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>enter.</b> It is a very {{beautiful}} piece of architecture,--a sort of canopy of marble, supported upon pillars; and its magnificence within, in marble and silver, and all manner of holy decoration, is quite indescribable. It was built four hundred years ago, by Pietro de' Medici, and has probably been growing richer ever since. The altar is entirely of silver, richly embossed. As many people were kneeling on the steps before it as could find room, and most of them, when they finished their prayers, ascended the steps, kissed over and over again the margin of the silver altar, laid their foreheads upon it, and then deposited an offering in a box placed upon the altar's top. From the dulness of the chink in the only case when I heard it, I judged it to be a small copper coin.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. San Rocco {{before the}} Pope. (On {{the left of}} the door <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>enter.)</b> [...] A {{delightful}} picture in his best manner, but not much labored; and, [...] like several other pictures in this church, it seems to me to have [...] been executed at some period of the painter's life when he was either [...] in ill health, or else had got into a mechanical way of painting, from [...] having made too little reference to nature for a long time. There is [...] something stiff and forced in the white draperies on both sides, and a [...] general character about the whole which I can feel better than I can [...] describe; but which, if I had been the painter's physician, would have [...] immediately caused me to order him to shut up his painting-room, and [...] take a voyage to the Levant, and back again. The figure of the Pope [...] is, however, extremely beautiful, and is not unworthy, in its jewelled [...] magnificence, here dark against the sky, of comparison with the figure [...] of the high priest in the [...] "Presentation," [...] in the Scuola di San Rocco.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so, your Excellency," [...] the Baron {{was saying}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>entered</b> the Library. [...] "All the {{infantry}} were under my command." [...] He turned, and was duly presented to my Lady.|$|R
