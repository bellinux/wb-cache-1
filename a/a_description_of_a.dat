5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as <b>a</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define {{how much of the}} household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E

Proceeding to introduce both the Wiccan religion and her theoretical approach, Berger explains the British sociologist James A.

5|$|Andrew Farke and {{his colleagues}} in 2014 {{published}} <b>a</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new neoceratopsian, Aquilops americanus, through the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE. They analysed their taxa {{as well as most}} other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would have a large ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E
5|$|Martial's {{mention of}} gift-giving is {{repeated}} in the account by Dio, who says that Titus would throw wooden balls into the crowd from his seat in the box {{at the north end}} of the arena. These balls were inscribed with <b>a</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gift, either food, clothing, slaves, pack animals, horse, cattle, or gold or silver vessels. Anybody who caught one could hand over the ball to an official who would provide the named gift in return. This was not unusual: Suetonius mentions that Nero did the same, giving 1,000 birds daily, as well as food parcels, and vouchers for various extravagant gifts.|$|E
5|$|Ragnall's {{grant to}} the priory of Paisley is {{preserved}} in two documents: one {{dates to the}} late twelfth- or early thirteenth century, and a later copy is contained in an instrument which dates to 1426.

5|$|To {{underscore}} {{that the}} feast represents an exotic bygone world of pre-partition Poland, Mickiewicz {{added to this}} a list of random dishes, ingredients and additives, whose names he found in Compendium ferculorum and which had already been forgotten in his own time: kontuza (soup of boiled and sieved meat), arkas (sweet milk-based jelly), blemas (blancmange), pomuchla (Atlantic cod), figatele (meatballs), cybeta (civet), piżmo (musk), dragant (tragacanth), pinele (pine nuts) and brunele (prunes). This {{is followed by a}} similar enumeration of various kinds of fish, whose names are likewise taken from the inventory at the beginning of Czerniecki's book. <b>A</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> white-apron-clad chef and a reference to Prince Ossoliński's banquet in Rome, both found in Book 11, are also clearly inspired by Czerniecki's characterization of a master chef and his dedication, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Truso in Prussia {{was another}} Baltic seaport and trade emporium {{known from the}} {{reworking}} of Orosius' universal history by Alfred the Great. King Alfred included <b>a</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> voyage undertaken around 890 by Wulfstan from the Danish port of Hedeby to Truso, which is located {{near the mouth of}} the Vistula. Wulfstan gave a rather detailed description of the location of Truso, within the land of the Aesti, yet close to the Slavic areas west of the Vistula. Truso's actual site was discovered in 1982 at Janów Pomorski, near Elbląg.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Einstein {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{statistical model}} from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, {{based on a}} counting method that assumed that light could {{be understood as a}} gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms {{as well as to the}} proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} reference in England to {{the legend of}} the pig-faced woman is the fable of Tannakin Skinker, a 17th-century variation on the traditional loathly lady story, in particular on The Wife of Bath's Tale and The Marriage of Sir Gawain. The Skinker story is generally considered the basis for later English stories of pig-faced women. Between 4 and 11 December 1639, five ballads about Skinker were published in London, all of which are now lost. (A 1640 ballad, A Monstrous Shape: or, A Shapelesse Monster, <b>a</b> <b>Description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female creature born in Holland compleat in every part, save only a head like a swine, who hath travelled in many parts and is now to be seen in London, shees loving, courteous and effeminate and nere as yet could find a loving mate, is preserved in Samuel Pepys's extensive collection of ballads.) The earliest surviving record of the Tannakin Skinker story is that given in A Certaine Relation of the Hog-faced Gentlewoman called Mistris Tannakin Skinker, a 1640 chapbook.|$|E
