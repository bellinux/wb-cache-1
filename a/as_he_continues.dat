He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins to sing with a camera crew starting to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues.</b> Various personnel walk around him and adjust the set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on the boxes. The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman. On 22 November, the clip was premiered on Network Ten's Video Hits – which had Tate as executive producer.|$|E
5|$|Released in 2008, Devil May Cry 4 is {{the first}} game in the series not to feature Dante as the primary character, but a deutragonist. Dante is first seen as an {{antagonist}} by the game's lead character, Nero, after he presumably kills Sanctus, the leader from The Order of the Sword in charge of hunting demons. Across the story, Dante befriends Nero when he decides to face The Order. When Nero is kidnapped by Sanctus, the player controls Dante once again <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues</b> his fight against the Order. Before the game starts in flashback, Dante and Trish were informed by Lady about the Order of the Sword's dark secrets to conquer entire world using Sparda's powers and the hell gate, and thus Trish herself quickly goes to the Orders under guise of Gloria by giving the cult's leader Sanctus a sword of Sparda to expose his true evil color. After Nero and his girlfriend Kyrie are saved, and Sanctus is defeated, Dante entrusts Nero with Vergil's sword he has been wielding.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the poem, Gawain {{encounters}} numerous trials testing {{his devotion}} {{and faith in}} Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the Virgin Mary does he find his way. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues</b> his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle {{given to him by}} Bertilak's wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal. Another interpretation sees the work in terms of the perfection of virtue, with the pentangle representing the moral perfection of the connected virtues, the Green Knight as Christ exhibiting perfect fortitude, and Gawain as slightly imperfect in fortitude by virtue of flinching when under the threat of death.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues</b> his investigations, Craven is {{visited by}} Emma's ghost. The {{fingerprints}} on the getaway car used by Emma's killer match that of Lowe, a man Craven arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes Craven {{to meet his}} colleague, Harcourt (Ian McNeice), who informs him that Emma {{was a member of}} a subversive anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by Emma, had broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (Joe Don Baker), an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radioactive material, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with a wry sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Valhalla {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in chapter 2 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where it is}} described partially in euhemerized form. In the chapter, King Gylfi sets out to Asgard {{in the guise of}} an old man going by the name of Gangleri to find the source {{of the power of the}} gods. The narrative states that the Æsir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for him, so that when Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height that he has trouble seeing over it, and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri then quotes a stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900). <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues,</b> Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air at once. Among other things, the man says that the hall belongs to his king, and adds that he can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the door closes behind him. All around him he sees many living areas, and throngs of people, some of which are playing games, some are drinking, and others are fighting with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: High sitting on the lowest throne, Just-As-High sitting on the next highest throne, and Third sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall.|$|E

25|$|The Carol Ferris {{version of}} Star Sapphire appears in , voiced again by Olivia d'Abo but without her accent this time. Her costume here {{is similar to}} the one {{currently}} worn by the Star Sapphires. She is hired to be part of Vandal Savage's Legion of Doom since she is the counterpart to Green Lantern. Her plan is to break Hal Jordan's will by making him believe he had let a hostage (almost identical to Carol) get killed by a terrorist that he could have easily defeated before harm befell her. As Hal mourns the dead girl, Carol walks up to him and berates him for his failure to save the woman and for hurting Carol, driving her into becoming Star Sapphire. Weeping, Hal takes off his ring, becoming a broken man <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues</b> to mourn the dead woman. When Batman arrives, he reveals that the woman was an android used by Star Sapphire to trick him, and that she had exposed him to the Scarecrow's fear gas in order to break his will, to which Hal dons his ring and becomes Green Lantern once more. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, she faces off against him again. As they fight, Hal expresses anger over Carol's plan, saying that he couldn't believe what she did, only for her to coldly remark that he broke her heart, and she would never stop trying to kill him for it. She manages to capture him but he escapes and knock her out. Hal proceeds to take away Carol's Star Sapphire gem, reverting her back to normal, and admits that he keeps hurting her. This version is shown to be able to create both energy blasts and hard constructs. She was the only one to use the non-lethal version of Batman's contingency plans and was the last member to be defeated.|$|E
