5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term {{metalloid}} is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to describe metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms. It was first applied to metals that floated on water (lithium, sodium and potassium), <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> popularly to nonmetals. Only recently, since the mid-20th century, has it been widely {{used to refer to}} elements with intermediate or borderline properties between metals and nonmetals.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi {{does not}} respond to prey if the light is under 100lux (like a {{restaurant}} with only subdued artificial lighting), but responds to prey at distances from 6 to 10centimetres as the light level increases. A test suggested that P. schultzi′s hunting is stimulated only by vision, as prey close but hidden caused no response. A preliminary check showed that lures got the same responses from P. schultzi as live prey, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> detailed testing with the lures showed that: if the target moved erratically, P. schultzi did not pursue it; if the target was totally stationary, the spider approached very slow (between 5 and 100millimetres per minute), with very long pauses in the final stages, and the sequence was not completed in 43% of cases; if the lure jiggled on the same spot, P. schultzi approached much faster and the sequence was almost always completed; if a lure was pulled directly away from P. schultzi, the spider followed, and faster if the lure was pulled, up to a limit (P. schultzi generally moves very slowly).|$|E

5|$|The de Courtenays {{were heavily}} {{involved}} in the 15th century Wars of the Roses and Okehampton Castle was frequently confiscated. By the early 16h century the castle was still in good condition, but after Henry Courtenay was executed by Henry VIII the property was abandoned and left to decay, while the park was rented out by the Crown. Parts of the castle were reused as a bakery in the 17th century, but by the 19th century it was completely ruined and became popular with Picturesque painters, including J. M. W. Turner. Renovation work began properly in the 20th century, first under private ownership <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>more</b> extensively, after the castle was acquired by the state. In the 21st century it is controlled by English Heritage and operated as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term {{metalloid}} is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to describe metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms. It was first applied in the early 19th century to metals that floated on water (sodium and potassium), <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> popularly to nonmetals. Earlier usage in mineralogy, to describe a mineral having a metallic appearance, can be sourced to as early as 1800. Since the mid-20th century {{it has been used}} to refer to intermediate or borderline chemical elements. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) previously recommended abandoning the term metalloid, and suggested using the term semimetal instead. Use of this latter term has more recently been discouraged by Atkins et al. as it has a different meaning in physics—one that more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance rather than the overall classification of an element. The most recent IUPAC publications on nomenclature and terminology do not include any recommendations on the usage of the terms metalloid or semimetal.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th century, a {{high demand}} in Europe for American deer skins {{had led to}} a brisk trade between Native hunters and white traders. A few white traders and some {{settlers}} (primarily from the British colonies of Georgia and Carolina) were accepted by the Head of Coosa Cherokee. These were later joined by missionaries, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> settlers. After the American War of Independence, most new settlers came from the area of Georgia east of the Proclamation Line of 1763.|$|E

25|$|Active was a French ship {{launched}} in 1793. She came into British hands circa 1799 as a prize. Peter Everitt Mestaer purchased her and named her Active.

From 1802 she was a London-based merchantman, trading first with Hamburg <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> generally. She was last listed in 1815.|$|E
25|$|Having one RCD feeding {{another is}} {{generally}} unnecessary, provided {{they have been}} wired properly.

In this case a special 100 mA (or greater) trip current time-delayed RCD is installed, covering the whole installation, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> sensitive RCDs should be installed downstream of it for sockets and other circuits that are considered high-risk.|$|E
25|$|To {{the west}} a {{generally}} grassy shoulder runs for about 2km {{down into the}} valley of the How Beck and to the A591 road.

It slopes gently at first to around the 450m contour <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> steeply into the valley over a number of rocky crags. The bridleway to Sticks Pass rises over this shoulder. This ridge is drained by two gills just mentioned, which are now captured by a water leat and diverted into Thirlmere Reservoir.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, Broken Arrow {{began to}} grow {{from a small town}} into a {{suburban}} city. The Broken Arrow Expressway (Oklahoma State Highway 51) was constructed in the mid-1960s and connected the city with downtown Tulsa, fueling growth in Broken Arrow. The population swelled from a little above 11,000 in 1970 to more than 50,000 in 1990, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> than 74,000 by the year 2000. During this time, the city was more of a bedroom community. In recent years, city leaders have pushed for more economic development to help keep more Broken Arrowans working, shopping and relaxing in town rather than going to other cities.|$|E
25|$|Several racist skirmishes {{occurred}} in the town, including visiting football supporters from Stoke City F.C. who deliberately walked through multi-racial areas of the town {{before and after the}} match. Attacks followed, initially from Stoke City fans, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> serious retaliatory attacks and petrol bomb throwing from local male Bangladeshi groups. Following this, on 5 May 2001, there was a day of mounting tension and run-ins between racist and anti-racist groups in the town. Up to fifty National Front supporters, mainly from Birmingham and London arrived in the town, clashing with members of the Anti-Nazi League and local Asian groups. Five hundred police were deployed, and the events received extensive media coverage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the paradox}} of Achilles and the {{tortoise}}, Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a head start of 100 meters, for example. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise.|$|E

25|$|Ascents of Great Crag can {{be started}} from the hamlets of Rosthwaite, Stonethwaite or Watendlath. The Rosthwaite route uses the {{bridleway}} to Watendlath until {{the highest point}} is reached then goes southerly over boggy moorland <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> firmer rocky ground to reach the summit. The Stonethwaite path climbs steeply through woodland before reaching Dock Tarn; it is then a short ascent from the tarn north-westwards to the summit. These two routes can be combined to make a circular walk starting and finishing in Rosthwaite. The ascent from Watendlath utilises the popular path to Dock Tarn which has been diverted by signposts to avoid {{the worst of the}} boggy ground {{to the north of the}} fell; this path takes the walker very close to the summit and it is a simple climb through heather to attain the highest point.|$|E
25|$|The Book of Isaiah clearly {{claims that}} God {{is the source}} of at least some natural disasters, but Isaiah doesn't attempt to explain the {{motivation}} behind the creation of evil. In contrast, the Book of Job {{is one of the most}} widely known formulations of the problem of evil in Western thought. In it, Satan challenges God regarding his servant Job, claiming that Job only serves God for the blessings and protection that he receives from him. God allows Satan to plague Job and his family in a number of ways, with the limitation that Satan may not take Job's life (but his children are killed). Job discusses this with three friends and questions God regarding his suffering which he finds to be unjust. God responds in a speech <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> than restores Job's prior health, wealth, and gives him new children.|$|E
25|$|From the 1902 season, Johnson began {{appearing}} in County Championship matches for Somerset. His qualification {{for the county}} would {{appear to have been}} fairly flimsy: there is a story, which is also told of a later Somerset cricketer, Tom Lowry, that the county put his birthplace down as Wellington, which was true, without bothering to volunteer that it was not, in fact, the town of that name in Somerset. Employed as a stockbroker, he had time for fairly regular appearances in 1902 and 1903, fewer in 1904 and 1905, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>more</b> again in 1906. From then until the First World War, Johnson appeared in only a handful of matches in each season, but for five seasons from 1921 to 1925 he was nearly always in the Somerset side, finally retiring after a few unsuccessful matches in 1927.|$|E
