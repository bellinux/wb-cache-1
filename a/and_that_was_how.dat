25|$|In sources, Ardashir's {{religious}} {{relations and}} his father being a cleric are mentioned; {{so it can be}} deduced that Ardashir had no connections with royal houses and was only a cleric's son who knew about religion, but was not a cleric himself; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> he, by his religious knowledge, found the chance to be the first person in his inscriptions receiving the royal ring from Ahura Mazda, something a Persian nobleman did not need and only a newcomer had to claim to be from the line of gods. It should be mentioned that it was not precedent to Ardashir to take a royal ring from Ahura Mazda, and it is not seen even in Achaemenid inscriptions.|$|E
25|$|Bradman {{had only}} made 28, {{when he played}} Bill Voce into the slips. Jack Ikin caught the ball and threw it {{high in the air}} in joy. He had caught the great Bradman, and Australia, he thought, were three down for under a hundred on a good wicket. That was how it looked to Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> it looked to me sitting {{watching}} from the dressing room. Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was any doubt in his mind... the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.|$|E
25|$|Bhishma {{is often}} {{considered}} as {{a great example of}} devotion and sacrifice. His name itself is an honour to him - Bhishma which means severe because he took a severe vow to remain celibate for life and Pitamah which means Grandfather. Bhishma {{was one of the greatest}} Bramhacharis of all time. Accumulation of Ojas due to his Bramhacharyam made him the strongest warrior of the era. He had stature and personality that in those times were fit for kings. He was a true Kshatriya as well as a disciplined ascetic - a rare combination. Like a true Kshatriya, he never unnecessarily exhibited passion and anger. A symbol of truth and duty, the benevolent Bhishma was in all senses a true human. It is unfortunate that a person as noble as Bhishma saw a life full of loneliness, frustration and sadness. But that was how Vashishta's curse was supposed to unfold. Bhishma's human birth was destined to be marked with suffering, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> his life transpired right till the last moment; even his death was very painful. But the strong as steel character which he possessed ensured that he never shied away from his duty, and never stopped loving those dear to him.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Paudash Lake is named after an Indian Chief, there is {{universal}} agreement among anthropologists and archeologists that the Ojibwa tribe of Ontario never established regular settlements in most of Haliburton. This was not simply due to the Indians' nomadic habits, but also due to the extremely long and harsh winters {{and the lack of}} major rivers bisecting the area for transportation. Another significant influence was {{the fact that}} the lakes in Haliburton were not a major food source. But this is actually irrelevant because it is common knowledge among Ojibwa themselves and among scholars of other aboriginal hunter-fisher-gatherer peoples, that they did not establish permanent settlements because they had to move from one site of hunting-fishing-gathering to another and stayed only as long as needed. (It would be analogous to how modern sports fishermen try one lake and another, one spot and another.) But this has nothing to do with naming. As with the Eels Lake and Jacks Lake south of Paudash, it was the practice of early settlers - when the Indian presence still had strength - to name lakes after the apparent dominant Indian clan or extended family patriarch or chief. Jack's Lake was named after Jack Cow and Eels Lake after Eel Cow. It follows that settlers experienced the visits now and then of the Paudash family at Paudash Lake <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> the name was established.|$|E
500|$|Wearing Antoinist {{religious}} clothing {{indicates an}} intense {{involvement in the}} religion by the person who makes this choice. Although not mandatory, it is devoted to faithful who perform the worship, celebrations and other tasks in the temple—all of them are called [...] "moral work", as {{they are expected to}} participate in the moral elevation of followers. It was in 1906 that Antoine wore a special clothe for the first time, and it was the case of the faithful in 1910. Entirely black, the dress for men was designed by Antoine, and that for women by Catherine, who precisely codified their dimensions in their writings. There are also dresses for young people of both sexes, but they are never actually worn. Historically, the wearing of the dress {{was the subject of a}} debate among the first Antoinists, some of them refusing to wear it, and even generated a scandal so that Antoine had to justify himself on this subject, saying it had been revealed by inspiration. In the past, the dress was also worn in the street, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> the followers were immediately identified by the public. Currently, it is generally only worn in the context of worship, and it is put and removed in the locker room of the temple. Clothing for men is composed of a dress which resembles the one worn by Catholic clergy in the monastery, and closed by 13 buttons, plus a cashmere top hat. Clothing for women is a wide dress accompanied with a cape and a bonnet with a veil. In the Antoinist view, the collar is important as it is believed that the fluid resides here.|$|E
2500|$|After being a stalwart of chat shows, in {{the mid-1980s}} Monkhouse {{presented}} his own for the BBC, The Bob Monkhouse Show. The show lasted two series and showcased comedians of every age. Monkhouse was criticised for sycophancy towards his guests but {{said that they were}} all heroes of his <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> he really felt about them. Monkhouse was known as a keen supporter of new comedy and he used the show to introduce audiences to new comedians such as Kelly Monteith, Robin Williams and Jim Carrey. The format of the interviews varied between [...] "true" [...] chat and analysis of comedy, to scripted routines in which Monkhouse would willingly play the role of the guest's stooge as he did with Bob Hope. On one occasion the guest was the comedian Pamela Stephenson who, after prior arrangement with the show's producer, appeared in a series of fake plaster casts, apparently the result of accidents whilst at home. During the interview she produced a handgun and fired it on several occasions, destroying a plant pot on the set and a series of lights in the studio roof. She then presented a rocket launcher which she promptly [...] "fired" [...] destroying a camera. The gun, launcher and camera were props. None of this was known to Monkhouse who appeared genuinely frightened (although the production crew were aware).|$|E
