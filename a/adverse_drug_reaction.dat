40|$|BACKGROUND: Numerous {{observational}} {{studies suggest}} that preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> are a significant burden in healthcare, but no meta-analysis using a standardised definition for <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> exists. The aim {{of the study was}} to estimate the percentage of patients with preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> and the preventability of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> in adult outpatients and inpatients. METHODS: Studies were identified through searching Cochrane, CINAHL, EMBASE, IPA, Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science in September 2010, and by hand searching the reference lists of identified papers. Original peer-reviewed research articles in English that defined <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> according to WHO's or similar definition and assessed preventability were included. Disease or treatment specific studies were excluded. Meta-analysis on the percentage of patients with preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> and the preventability of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> was conducted. RESULTS: Data were analysed from 16 original studies on outpatients with 48797 emergency visits or hospital admissions and from 8 studies involving 24128 inpatients. No studies in primary care were identified. Among adult outpatients, 2. 0 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 2 - 3. 2 %) had preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> and 52 % (95 % CI: 42 - 62 %) of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> were preventable. Among inpatients, 1. 6 % (95 % CI: 0. 1 - 51 %) had preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> and 45 % (95 % CI: 33 - 58 %) of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> were preventable. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis corroborates that preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> are a significant burden to healthcare among adult outpatients. Among both outpatients and inpatients, approximately half of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> are preventable, demonstrating that further evidence on prevention strategies is required. The percentage of patients with preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> among inpatients and in primary care is largely unknown and should be investigated in future research...|$|R

30|$|Many {{studies have}} {{detected}} possible <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> or have analyzed the factors relevant to <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions.</b> These studies can generally {{be divided into}} two categories.

Currently, although there have been studies evaluating the relationships between a <b>drug</b> and <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> using the JADER database which collects reported spontaneous <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions,</b> an efficient approach to assess the association between <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> of <b>drugs</b> with the same indications as well as the influence of demographics (e. g. gender) has not been proposed. We utilized the REAC and DEMO tables from the May 2015 version of JADER for patients taking antidepressant drugs (SSRI, SNRI, and NaSSA). We evaluated the associations using association analyses with an apriori algorithm. Support, confidence, lift, and conviction were used as indicators for associations. The highest score in <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> for SSRI was obtained for "aspartate aminotransferase increased", "alanine aminotransferase increased", with values of 0. 0059, 0. 93, 135. 5, and 13. 9 for support, confidence, lift and conviction, respectively. For SNRI, "international normalized ratio increased", "drug interaction" were observed with 0. 0064, 1. 00, 71. 9, and NA. For NaSSA, "anxiety", "irritability" were observed with 0. 0058, 0. 80, 49. 9, and 4. 9. For female taking SSRI, the highest support scores were observed in "twenties", "suicide attempt", whereas "thirties", "neuroleptic malignant syndrome" were observed for male. Second, for SNRI, "eighties", "inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion" were observed for female, whereas "interstitial lung disease" and "hepatitis fulminant" were for male. Finally, for NaSSA, "suicidal ideation" was for female, and "rhabdomyolysis" was for male. Different combinations of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> were noted between the antidepressants. In addition, the reported <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>reactions</b> differed by gender.
