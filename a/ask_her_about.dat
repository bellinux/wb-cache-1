5|$|Yuuki Ashikaga is a {{high school}} {{freshman}} in his second semester at the fictional Sakakino Academy, who from his regular visits to the library, grows enamored by Kotonoha Katsura, a classmate who also comes to read. Despite being in a relationship, she genuinely reciprocates his interest. However, things become complicated when his sister, Chie, introduces him to Roka Kitsuregawa, a friend of hers. In {{an attempt to make}} herself seem harder to get, Roka claims that she is equally interested in Makoto Itou, another schoolmate. Her lie is unsuccessful, as Yuuki, aware that Makoto is Kotonoha's boyfriend, decides to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the affair.|$|E
25|$|After {{creating}} Yūko, Clamp {{believed her}} character was so interesting {{she could be}} the only main character in the series. However, they then wondered it would more interesting if they created another character who, like Yūko, would also be connected with the spirits and across the story would see Yūko's life and often <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the supernatural events. They compared Yūko and Watanuki with Doraemon and Nobita Nobi, respectively, from the manga series Doraemon. Unlike Yūko, Watanuki's personality and design were not difficult to write and illustrate. He {{was based on a}} real beautician who has not been identified by the authors.|$|E

There, she trained {{alongside}} Alicia Sacramone, of whom she said, [...] "She's kind of like my older sister. I can <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> anything because I know that she's been through it all." ...|$|E
5000|$|Her {{experience}} with the blacklist scarred her {{to such an extent}} that as late as 2002, she would freeze and go into a [...] "near trance" [...] when anyone <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> experiences during the McCarthy period.|$|R

2500|$|Of {{particular}} {{prominence in}} the soundtrack is the 1933 Taiwanese song [...] "Bāng Chhun-hong". As the producers were writing the script in New York, Woo Yen Yen called her mother to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the most popular song of her time. Her mother's first suggestion was [...] "Bong Chun Hong", a song which the producers came to like. The song was later adopted as the opening theme, and the character Siew Luan would hum it again as the film concludes, this time more wistfully as she would recount the days when she was young. Four major and three minor variations of [...] "Bong Chun Hong" [...] {{were included in the}} soundtrack. As Moviexclusive describes Sydney Tan's score, [...] "the [...] use of pianos and strings is complemented by the occasional wistful accompaniments of the traditional erhu, adding the essential 'Asian touch' to the music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Japp and Poirot find further clues: the gun {{has been}} wiped clean of {{fingerprints}} and {{large sums of}} money have been withdrawn from Mrs Allen's bank account on several occasions but there is no trace of money in the house. They also learn from a neighbour that Mrs Allen had a gentleman caller the previous evening whose description doesn't tally with that of her fiancé. [...] Feeling that Miss Plenderleith is keeping something back, they <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> this male visitor and she suggest that it was Major Eustace – a man that Mrs Allen had known in India and whom she has seen on several occasions in the past year. She got the feeling that Mrs Allen was afraid of the man and Japp and Poirot suggest that Major Eustace was blackmailing her – an idea which meets with approval from Miss Plenderleith. [...] Poirot points out though that it is unusual for blackmailers to kill their victims, normally it is the opposite way round. Japp, as part of his look round the house, searches a cupboard under the stairs which contains items such as umbrellas, walking sticks, tennis racquets, a set of golf clubs and a small attaché-case which Miss Plenderleith hurriedly claims is hers. The two men sense Miss Plenderleith's heightened tension.|$|E
2500|$|Lucinda's Secret was {{published}} on October 1, 2003. The novel opens upon an argument among the Grace children {{on whether or}} not to destroy the Field Guide, Jared alone insisting that they keep it. They eventually agree to consult their Great-Aunt Lucinda, who is now staying in a psychiatric hospital and is the only person whom they know to have been in contact with Arthur Spiderwick, who was her father. When they <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Arthur, it is revealed that the last she saw him was one day {{when she was a little}} girl, on which Arthur had set out from the house on foot and never returned. She is horrified that the Grace family is staying at the Estate, which she says is not safe, and even more worried when she hears that they have the Guide, believing her father to have taken it with him when he disappeared. However, when Jared takes the book from his backpack to show her, it has been replaced with another book, presumably by Thimbletack. Once home, the Grace children decide to find out what happened to their great-great uncle, and set out from the Estate with a map of the area on which is written [...] "September 14th. Five O'clock. Bring the remains of the book." [...] On their journey they meet a Phooka: a creature that talks only in riddles. They finally reach a river grove inhabited by thieves, who threaten to trap one of the children there unless the guide is given to them. The children flee, however, promising to bring the Guide as soon as they can. On passing by the Phooka again, one of his riddles leads them to think that Arthur is still alive, but imprisoned in Faerie with the elves.|$|E

50|$|Chad <b>asks</b> <b>her</b> {{to go to}} a party. When he <b>asks</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> parents, she {{mentions}} that she is adopted. The Salem witches reason that if Kim is adopted, she may be one of them. On the night of the party, they secretly guard her against all forms of magical attack.|$|R
6000|$|... "And to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> her {{relations}} with Deronda?" [...] said Grandcourt, with the coldest possible sneer in his low voice which in poor Gwendolen's ear was diabolical.|$|E

60|$|There was one girl--a pretty one--in a red shawl, {{crying in}} a corner like her heart would dissolve. Buck goes over and <b>asks</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{called him}} a 'titled fool' once, but perhaps that didn't mean anything. Did you ever <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> him?" [...] said Coventry, feeling rather ashamed of his curiosity, yet unable {{to resist the temptation}} of {{questioning}} unsuspecting Bella.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What you wanted!' said Tattycoram. 'Here it is! I {{was put in}} {{the next}} room not to see you. I heard you <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> it, I heard her say she hadn't got it, I was there when he left it, and I took it at bedtime and brought it away. Here it is!' ...|$|E
60|$|James Fielding {{did not let}} it be {{so without}} a great struggle; but nothing could persuade Sophy to take more than the £2,000. At last, when he found that nothing could change her determination, he gave in, and agreed {{that it should be}} as she wished. He then began to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> her future plans.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} Garrison had been {{formerly}} known as a male was not widely publicized until shortly after she {{was elected to the}} legislature.

6000|$|... "That's why I {{want to go}} back," [...] Doctor Prance replied, {{with her}} flat, limited manner. He kept her a moment; he wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Verena. While he was hesitating how to form his {{question}} she remarked, evidently wishing to leave him a little memento of her sympathy, [...] "Well, I hope {{you will be able}} to follow up your views." ...|$|E
60|$|L. I {{know she}} needn't, Jessie, I shall <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> those dark plaits presently. (DORA looks round {{to see if}} there is any way open for retreat) But never mind, it was worth the time, {{whatever}} it was, and nobody will ever mistake that golden wreath for a chignon: but if you don't want it to be seen you had better wear a cap.|$|E
60|$|Stormfield, April 30, 1909. It {{seems the}} letter was not sent. I {{probably}} feared she might print it, and I couldn't {{find a way to}} say so without running a risk of hurting her. No one would hurt Jeannette Gilder purposely, and no one would want to run the risk of doing it unintentionally. She is my neighbor, six miles away, now, and I must <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> this ancient letter.|$|E
50|$|Often {{death has}} even {{been the subject of}} jokes, such as in the various {{versions}} of The Yellow Ribbon, in which a young girl wears a yellow ribbon around her neck and a young boy <b>asks</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> it, but she puts him off. The two grow up together and eventually marry with the boy/man often <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the ribbon, but she continues to disregard the subject as “not important” or “not the right time”. Finally when they are very old, she consents to have him untie the ribbon, and her head falls off.|$|R

60|$|Then for a {{time she}} roused herself to some control of their proceedings. The doctor came to Lady Harman to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the meals for the day, the hotel manager was in {{entanglements}} of tactful consideration, and then the nurse came for instructions upon some trivial matter. They had done what usage prescribes and now, {{in the absence of}} other direction, they appealed to her wishes. She remarked that everyone was going on tiptoe and speaking in undertones....|$|E
60|$|A deep sigh {{from his}} mother startled John, and {{recalled}} the grief of his childhood--the loss of two young sisters who had died during her absence on the continent. He crossed over and stood near her, between her and his aunt, who, in agitated haste to change the conversation, called out to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> some club-book. For once she did not attend; and while Theodora came forward and answered Mrs. Nesbit, she tremulously asked John if {{he had seen the}} child.|$|E
60|$|Such a {{possibility}} {{was enough to}} silence the Lady of Warwick on the score of witches, and the only time she spoke to Grisell was to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Sister Avice and her cures. She set herself to persuade her husband {{to let her go}} down to one of his mother's Wiltshire houses to consult the nun, but Warwick had business in the north, nor would he allow her to be separated from him, lest she might be detained as a hostage.|$|E
