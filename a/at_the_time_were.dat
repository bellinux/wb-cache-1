5|$|Early {{research}} into the element was somewhat limited {{because most of the}} nuclear physicists and chemists in the United States <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> focused on the massive effort to research the properties of plutonium as part of the Manhattan Project. Research into the element did continue as a minor part of the project and the first bulk sample of neptunium was isolated in 1944.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that, {{as in other}} {{polygynous}} animals (in which males compete for association with harems of females), Pteranodon lived primarily on offshore rookeries, where they could nest away from land-based predators and feed far from shore; most Pteranodon fossils are found in locations which <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>were</b> hundreds of kilometres from the coastline.|$|E
5|$|The first Snapdragon {{shipments}} {{were of the}} QSD8250 in November 2007. According to CNET, Snapdragon's {{claim to}} fame was having the first 1GHz mobile phone processor.

5|$|When first {{broadcast}} on June 14, 1990, the episode attracted a Nielsen rating of 13.6/24, meaning that 13.6% of American households watched the episode, and that 24% of all televisions in use <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> tuned into it. Several reviews {{at the time}} compared Seinfeld to It's Garry Shandling's Show, in which Garry Shandling, like Seinfeld, plays a fictionalized version of himself.|$|E

5|$|Although a professional—captains <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held {{meant that he}} was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey {{in the absence of}} Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E
5|$|An SOS was broadcast, {{which was}} {{answered}} by the Brazilian Navy, which sent three submarine chasers and three destroyers to the scene. The passengers {{were ordered to}} take to the lifeboats. Tenders and tugs also assisted in the rescue of all passengers from Magdalena without loss of life. The sea conditions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> smooth. At 19:00, the steam turbines had to be shut down, and power was then provided by her auxiliary diesel engines. At about 20:00, the submarine chaser Guaporé arrived and started to rescue the passengers. Other ships which assisted in the rescue were the tugs Comandante Triunfo, Dorat, Saturno and Trovão, and also the cargo ship Goiaz.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young boy}} in India, Mercury {{received}} formal piano training up {{to the age of}} nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his favourite artists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> The Who, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments and from the early 1980s began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlisted Fred Mandel (a Canadian musician who also worked for Pink Floyd, Elton John and Supertramp) for his first solo project, and from 1985 onward collaborated with Mike Moran (in the studio) and Spike Edney (in concert).|$|E

5|$|Because {{the most}} {{circulated}} coins in the United States <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> Spanish currency, Hamilton proposed that minting a United States dollar weighing {{almost as much}} as the Spanish peso would be the simplest way to introduce a national currency. Hamilton differed from European monetary policymakers in his desire to overprice gold relative to silver, {{on the grounds that the}} United States would always receive an influx of silver from the West Indies. Despite his own preference for a monometallic gold standard, he ultimately issued a bimetallic currency at a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 18th century and {{throughout}} most of the 19th, Albany was a center of trade and transportation. It is on {{the north end of the}} navigable Hudson River, was the original eastern terminus of the Erie Canal connecting to the Great Lakes, and was home to some of the earliest railroad systems in the world. Albany's main exports <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> beer, lumber, published works, and ironworks. Beginning in 1810, Albany was one of the ten most populous cities in the United States, a distinction it held until the 1860 census.|$|E
5|$|First {{broadcast}} in the United States on NBC on April 18, 1991, Nielsen Media Research {{estimated that the}} episode gained a Nielsen rating of 14.4 and an audience share of 24.

5|$|From {{the time}} the GPK was authorised, {{controversy}} raged about the route a railway to England might take. It was plain that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a direct route from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that {{became known as the}} Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost unpopulated territory. The locomotives available <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> not thought to be capable of climbing the steep inclines, and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfries—the Nithsdale line—would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing in additional traffic. Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build.|$|E
5|$|Henry II visited York Castle {{four times}} during his reign. The royal {{chambers}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> inside the keep for safety, and Henry paid £15 for repairs to the keep. During his 1175 visit, Henry used the castle {{as the base}} for receiving the homage of William the Lion of Scotland. Castle mills were built close by to support the garrison, and the military order of the Knights Templar was granted ownership of the mills in the mid-12th century. The mills proved to be vulnerable to the flooding of the two rivers {{and had to be}} repeatedly repaired.|$|E
5|$|In 1087, William was fatally injured {{during a}} {{campaign}} in the Vexin. Henry joined his dying father near Rouen in September, where the King partitioned his possessions among his sons. The rules of succession in western Europe <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> uncertain; {{in some parts of}} France, primogeniture, in which the eldest son would inherit a title, was growing in popularity. In other parts of Europe, including Normandy and England, the tradition was for lands to be divided up, with the eldest son taking patrimonial lands – usually considered to be the most valuable – and younger sons given smaller, or more recently acquired, partitions or estates.|$|E

5|$|In November 1941, Schnaufer {{was posted}} to the II. Gruppe of Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (II./NJG1—2nd {{group of the}} 1st Night Fighter Wing) at the time based at Stade near Hamburg. Here, Schnaufer was {{assigned}} to the 5. Staffel (5./NJG1—5th squadron of 1st Night Fighter Wing). The Bf 110's of II./NJG1 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> not equipped with airborne radar such as the Lichtenstein radar. Night fighter intercept tactics had matured since their early beginnings in July 1940, and II. Gruppe had already been credited with 397 victories. Missions against enemy bombers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> usually flown by means of ground-controlled interception, although the Luftwaffe was already experimenting with airborne radar. This air defence system, consisting of a series of radar stations with overlapping coverage, layered three deep, was conceived by Generalleutnant (lit. Lieutenant General; equivalent to Major General) Josef Kammhuber and was organised in the so-called Kammhuber Line. Conceptually, the system was based on a combination of ground-based radar stations, search lights and a Jägerleitoffizier (fighter pilot control officer). The Jägerleitoffizier had to vector the airborne night fighter by means of radio communication to a point of visual interception of the illuminated bomber. These interception tactics were referred to as the Himmelbett (canopy bed) procedure.|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 10 was renumbered to Route 5.

The new Route 6 would share the alignment of Route 5 from Paterson to west of Hackensack, where it would turn southeast onto a new alignment to Little Ferry, then run with Route 5 again to east of Ridgefield and split onto its own alignment to the George Washington Bridge.|$|E
