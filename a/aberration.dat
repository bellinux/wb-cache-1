5|$|The Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) {{system was}} {{designed}} to correct the spherical <b>aberration</b> for light focused at the FOC, FOS, and GHRS. It consists of two mirrors in the light path with one ground to correct the <b>aberration.</b> To fit the COSTAR system onto the telescope, {{one of the other}} instruments had to be removed, and astronomers selected the High Speed Photometer to be sacrificed. By 2002, all of the original instruments requiring COSTAR had been replaced by instruments with their own corrective optics. COSTAR was removed and returned to Earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum. The area previously used by COSTAR is now occupied by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} {{chromosome}} <b>aberrations</b> induced by 1 -Beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara C) and Adriamycin (AM) in the chromosomes of cultured human lymphocytes was made. There were {{significant increases in}} the frequency of <b>aberrations</b> with increasing concentrations of both Ara C (2. 5, 5. 0 and 10. 0 mug/ml) and AM (0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 10 and 0. 15 mug/ml). The frequency of <b>aberrations</b> induced by both drugs also showed a 'levelling off' above particular concentrations. For Ara C the effect of increasing treatment time was also studied. The frequency of <b>aberrations</b> increased significantly with increasing treatment times (2, 3 and 4 hrs) although no 'levelling off' in the number of <b>aberrations</b> was observed. The relationship between the frequency of the different types of <b>aberrations</b> induced by Ara C and AM was studied. AM allowed for a study of the relative frequency of chromosome versus chromatid <b>aberrations</b> and fragment versus exchange <b>aberrations.</b> There were always more fragments than exchanges, and always more chromatid <b>aberrations</b> than chromosome <b>aberrations.</b> <b>Aberrations</b> induced by Ara C were all of the chromatid fragment type. A study was made of the distribution of inter- and intra-chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> in relation to light and dark G banded chromosomes. Both drugs induced more <b>aberrations</b> in the light G bands than the dark G bands. Both drugs showed distinct clustering of <b>aberrations</b> in some regions of the chromosomes (hotspots), although the location of AM induced hotspots was different from the location of those induced by Ara C. The distribution of AM induced chromatid <b>aberrations</b> was different from the distribution of the chromosome <b>aberrations,</b> as were the distributions of the fragment and exchange <b>aberrations.</b> The different types of <b>aberrations</b> also differed in the number of AM induced <b>aberrations</b> per unit length between the p and q arms. There were more <b>aberrations</b> per unit length in the p arm than in the q arm for exchanges, whereas for fragments and chromosome <b>aberrations</b> the reverse was true. For chromatid <b>aberrations,</b> {{there was no significant difference}} in the number of <b>aberrations</b> per unit length between the p and q arms. Inter-individual differences {{in the frequency of}} AM induced <b>aberrations</b> were observed in the. AM dosage experiments. Also there was a suggestion that the distribution of Ara C induced <b>aberrations</b> was different for different donors. AM increased the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges. Comparable results were not sought for Ara C because after cells were exposed to Ara C they did not pass through an S phase of the cell cycle, as is the case for cells exposed to AM. The relevance of the present in vitro studies to cancer chemotherapy is briefly discussed...|$|R

To investigate whether centrosome <b>aberrations</b> do occur in B-CLL and correlate with cytogenetically defined prognostic subgroups, we examined a set of 64 B-CLL samples by immunofluorescent staining. B-CLL cases differed significantly from controls in the mean frequency of cells with centrosome <b>aberrations,</b> while no difference was found between subgroups with or without specific chromosome <b>aberrations.</b> Our results indicated that although centrosome <b>aberrations</b> were a common feature in B-CLL, they did not represent a reliable prognostic marker...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: Somatic {{copy number}} <b>aberrations</b> (SCNAs) are {{frequent}} in cancer genomes, {{but many of}} these are random, passenger events. A common strategy to distinguish functional <b>aberrations</b> from passen-gers is to identify those <b>aberrations</b> that are recurrent across multiple samples. However, the extensive variability in the length and position of SCNAs makes the problem of identifying recurrent <b>aberrations</b> no-toriously difficult. Results: We introduce a combinatorial approach to the problem of identifying independent and recurrent SCNAs, focusing on the key challenging of separating the overlaps in <b>aberrations</b> across individuals into independent events. We derive independent and recurrent SCNAs as maximal cliques in an interval graph constructed from over-laps between <b>aberrations.</b> We efficiently enumerate all such cliques, and derive a dynamic programming algorithm to find an optimal se-lection of non-overlapping cliques, resulting in a very fast algorithm, which we call RAIG (Recurrent <b>Aberrations</b> from Interval Graphs). We show that RAIG outperforms other methods on simulated data and also performs well on data from three cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In contrast to existing approaches that employ various heuristics to select independent <b>aberrations,</b> RAIG optimizes a well-defined objective function. We show that this allows RAIG to identify rare <b>aberrations</b> that are likely functional, but are obscured by overlaps with larger passenger <b>aberrations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of the partial aether-dragging hypothesis, another major problem arose with the Michelson–Morley experiment (1887). In Fresnel's theory, the aether is almost stationary, so the experiment should have given a positive result. However, the result of this experiment was negative. Thus from the viewpoint of the aether models at that time, the experimental situation was contradictory: On one hand, the <b>aberration</b> of light, the Fizeau experiment and the repetition by Michelson and Morley in 1886 appeared to support partial aether-dragging. On the other hand, the Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887 appeared to prove that the aether is at rest with respect to Earth, apparently supporting the idea of complete aether-dragging (see aether drag hypothesis). So the very success of Fresnel's hypothesis in explaining Fizeau's results helped lead to a theoretical crisis, which was not resolved until the development of the theory of special relativity.|$|E

For shots from high altitudes, the team started with helicopter footage from video, and then created computer models of the neighbourhoods with textures from photographs. Neon lights, reflections, and dark areas were consistently accentuated. Flickers were created through a mixture of motion blur, chromatic <b>aberration,</b> and focus effects. For scenes seen as through a fisheye lens, the team recreated the sets digitally and progressively increased the environments' reflection values along with the lens effect.|$|E
