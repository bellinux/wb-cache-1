5|$|Corea {{explains}} at {{his website}} {{how he was}} motivated to work on music inspired by To the Stars, commenting that he was inspired by <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> book in which Hubbard describes the Captain of the spaceship in the story playing a melody on a piano. He had read the book eight or nine times, and after writing down musical composition based on Hubbard's work the album was created as a tone poem piece.

The piece is Corea's first attempt at musical interpretation from one of Hubbard's works.|$|E

5|$|Mystery Science Theater 3000 had {{the design}} of its main setting, the {{starship}} Satellite of Love, based on the bone-shaped satellite featured in the match cut from prehistoria to the future.

5|$|Stroheim had met casually with Jean Hersholt {{to discuss}} the role of Marcus Schouler, but he was {{initially}} reluctant to cast him. However, after Hersholt adjusted his appearance and wardrobe to more closely resemble Schouler, Stroheim changed his mind on the spot. With the exception of Gowland, Stroheim shot extensive screen tests {{of all the other}} actors at Goldwyn with cinematographer Paul Ivano. <b>A</b> <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Goldwyn film Souls for Sale is thought to be behind-the-scenes footage of Stroheim directing Greed, but it actually depicts him directing Hersholt during one of these screen tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the main plot was {{inspired}} by <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> novel Sometimes a Great Notion. However, the rock prop used was unpopular with the cast and crew, and post-production effects were required. The episode {{was the first of}} an ongoing plot thread with Nog entering Starfleet, which initially concerned Eisenberg as he thought he was being written out of the show. The episode was the fourth most watched episode of the third series, with 8.3 million viewers. Critical response was mixed, with negative comments directed at the idea that the situation was created by the female Founder (Salome Jens).|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{is part of}} a cycle on the life of Saint Peter, and describes <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus directs Peter to find a coin in the mouth of a fish in order to pay the temple tax. It owes its importance in particular to its revolutionary use of perspective and chiaroscuro. The Tribute Money suffered great damage in the centuries after its creation, until the chapel went through a thorough restoration in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a brief {{sequence}} inside a dark room where water drips from an open window.

5|$|After the Deluge, {{also known}} as The Forty-First Day, is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by English artist George Frederic Watts, first exhibited as The Sun in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens {{the window of his}} Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting {{takes the form of a}} stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in The Genius of Greek Poetry in 1878, After the Deluge took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a monotheistic God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.|$|E
