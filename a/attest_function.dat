40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the Old Persian genitive case as a syncretism of the Indo-European dative and genitive. Indeed, a {{detailed}} examination of Old Persian textual data reveals that the genitive expresses a variety of syntactic functions and semantic roles, cross-linguistically typical {{not only of the}} genitive, but also of the dative. This scenario can be accounted for by considering the Old Persian genitive case as a polysemic radial category, the expression of the Possessor being the core <b>function</b> and other <b>attested</b> <b>functions</b> being metaphorical extensions. Evidence from a cross-linguistic perspective suggests that the semantic or functional overlapping of the genitive and dative cases was the main cause for such syncretism, particularly considering the tendency of languages to eliminate synonymous grammatical forms over time...|$|R

Singaporean managers seem to appreciate the presence of an IA department in their organization.

40|$|Old Persian {{does not}} have {{separate}} forms for genitive and dative, but formerly distinct grammatical categories merged into the genitive case. The aim of our paper is to analyse this change. To this effect, {{in the first part}} we investigate the syntactic functions and the semantic roles of the Old Persian genitive case. A careful analysis of textual data reveals that, when the genitive is an adnominal modifier, its functions and roles are those typical of this case in a cross-linguistic perspective. However, when the genitive is a clause constituent, its functional range includes a broad spectrum of other functions and roles, such as Recipient, Addressee or Benefactive. According to the results of our analysis this range of functions and roles can be accounted for if we consider the Old Persian genitive case as a polysemic category, having the expression of the Possessor as the core function. On the other hand, <b>attested</b> <b>functions</b> untypical of the genitive can best be interpreted as radial and metaphorical extensions from the nuclear meaning of the Possessor. Following on this analysis, {{the second part of the}} paper is devoted to diachronic considerations. The study of the Old Persian material makes it possible to demonstrate that the decay of the dative is not due to phonological changes or to the progressive silencing of post-tonal syllables. On the other hand, in a comparative perspective, we can observe that in Avestan as well, the productivity of the genitive as a verb argument gradually increases at the expense of the dative, causing non-productive dative constructions to fall into disuse in Young Avestan. These and other pieces of evidence suggest that the semantic or functional overlapping of whole argument structures is the cause of the Old Persian genitive-dative syncretism. It is well-known that languages have a tendency to eliminate synonymous grammatical forms over time: morphological case distinctions disappear - as we attempt here to show for Old Persian - with a subsequent merging of the argument structure constructions...|$|R

In spite of the number of changes that have taken place in the audit profession during the past twenty years which have changed the way external auditors operate and manage their activities in proving the statutory <b>attest</b> <b>function</b> on the financial statements, there is paucity of research focused on the way auditors’ carry out their <b>attest</b> <b>function</b> in the midst of dwindling investors’ confidence in Nigeria.

While significant differences were found in respondents’ perception of audit quality been a function of audit approach, it was otherwise on the effect of traditional audit impact on audit quality.

40|$|Auditing {{is often}} cited as playing an {{important}} role in managing agency-related costs and, accordingly, being integral to the sound functioning of capital markets. There may, however, be more to the <b>attest</b> <b>function</b> than a technical rational practice.

As the online {{systems and the}} hi-technology devices make accounting transactions more complicated and easier to manipulate, the use of data mining in the auditing profession has been increasing in recent years. Since auditing involves evaluation of massive data in the <b>attest</b> <b>function,</b> data mining allows this process {{to be done in}} an easier manner. Auditors use computer aided audit software (CAATs) to make the process more accurate and reliable.

These neural networks are used in the auditing profession in many different ways, such as risk assessment, finding errors and fraud, determining the going concern of a company, evaluating financial distress, and making bankruptcy predictions. The next approach to data mining is distance-based methods which uses clustering to put large sets of data into groups and classifications based on attributes. This method is commonly used in marketing but is also useful in auditing. The third approach to data mining is the logic-based approach which uses decision trees to organize data.

This paper reviews microeconomic tender theory and finds it to be of limited value in the audit context. Content analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted with the finance directors of 12 UK listed companies which had recently tendered and/or changed auditor are used to investigate the tender/change process. Contrary to popular belief, fee levels do not necessarily dominate the decision to change auditors, rather changes within the client company, audit staffing, and auditor’s professionalism and competency issues dominate. Nor is {{the selection of a}} tender “winner” generally based solely on price, as predicted by tender theory and as would be expected when the consequences of audit failure do not fall on the directors. However, consistent with economic theory, the winning bid appears frequently to be too low, resulting in attempts by auditors to subsequently increase fees and resentment by the finance director. Directors generally appear to view the audit tender as relating to not only the <b>attest</b> <b>function</b> per se, but to a larger package of services concerning the financial reporting function. The relative importance of price versus non-price competition in auditor choice is found to vary across companies.

40|$|An {{accountant}} {{is a good}} accountant if in practicing {{his craft}} he is superb in handling the numbers. But a good accountant in handling the numbers can use that skill to misstate earnings to cover a multitude of problems with a company's books while staying within the law. So, {{the notion of a}} moral or ethical accountant {{is not the same as}} the notion of a good accountant. Our general principle would be that to be ethical a person has a responsibility to fulfil one's role or roles, as long as that role or roles are in conformity with acceptable goals for human life. What we mean by acceptable goals for human life are those that lead to societies where there are goods fairly distributed, which contribute to the quality of life in a way that allows as many people as possible to live fulfilled, abundant and flourishing lives. Assuming that our economic system and the businesses within it lead to a society such as that described above, the accountant has a role to play in that system which will specify the accountant's responsibilities. If accounting is the language of business, it is the auditor's job to see the language is used properly so that relevant material is communicated properly. In the system, the role of the independent auditor is to be a watchdog, “to see whether the company's estimates are based on formulas that seem reasonable in the light of whatever evidence is available and that choice formulas are applied consistently from year to year. ” 1 The responsibility of the auditors derived from their function is clear. The ultimate responsibility of internal auditors is to develop statements that present the financial situation of the company in a fair way, meaning as much disclosure as necessary to give a reasonable picture of the financial situation to any user having a claim to that knowledge. The function of the external auditor is to affirm that has happened by issuing an opinion as to whether the financial statement fairly presents the financial position of the corporation. The fulfillment of those functions is what is required for an efficient financial market. Those functions set the standards, the spirit of which has been seriously violated in recent years. Too much attention to the question of whether the financial statements formally complied with principles, practices and conventions accepted at the time should not be permitted to blind us to the basic question of whether the financial statements performed the function of enlightenment, which is their primary reason for existence. 2 By virtue of their <b>attest</b> <b>function,</b> accountants/auditors belong to the class of gatekeeper intermediaries in the financial markets who have a “watchdog” responsibility. That responsibility requires the virtue of professional skepticism. “Due professional care requires the auditor to exercise professional skepticism. ” “An audit of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards should be planned and performed with an attitude of professional skepticism. ” We lay out the practical requirements of meeting the obligations of skepticism, as well as looking at difficulties in maintaining such an attitude toward long time clients. The paper concludes by examining the following question. What caused this lack of due care? Why did the accounting firms fall short? Is this skepticism a realistic expectation?

We meet this challenge by exploiting well-established semantic composition rules for deriving meaning from the form of the multimodal action. So, while the existing grammars (HPSG, LFG, CCG) produce semantic representations for unimodal input, we argue that any formalisation of language should fit into the multimodal perspective of synchronising language and co-verbal gesture. The temporal performance of the gesture, its dimension(s) and ambiguous form do not uniquely determine the synchronous linguistic phrase. This raises the distinction between synchrony and simultaneity, thereby allowing for a gesture to attach to more than one constituent without causing ungrammaticality or incoherence.

40|$|Accountancy {{education}} in South Africa {{has been very}} controversial {{during the last few}} years and this controversy has led to objective self-examination by academics. It is acknowledged {{that there has been a}} substantial growth in the body of knowledge generally and that the accountancy profession has also been faced not only with a certain growth in the body of knowledge but also with a growth in society's expectations of the profession. These expectations could possibly include the expression of opinions on the fairness of profit forecasts and projected financial statements, including the underlying assumptions and opinions on management effectiveness. Possibly in order to accept greater responsibilities for the detection of fraud and the anticipated growth of society's expectations and greater utilisation of the computer, the future chartered accountant will be expected to be more proficient. This leads to the premise that a broader and less technique-oriented education is required for the future chartered accountant in South Africa. Developments overseas indicate that the profession in certain countries, plays a very active role in the final year of the accountancy education of its trainee accountants. In Australia the "Professional Year" is organised by The Australian Institute of Chartered Accountants. The candidates are evaluated on their performance during the "Professional Year" in assignments as well as their participation in classes, their attendance at the sessions and their successful completion of the final examination which is not regarded as a hurdle. In countries such as Canada and Scotland the institutes play an active role in promoting their own block-release courses. In Scotland the institute has its own lecturing staff, whereas in Canada in the province of Ontario, the Ontario Institute uses staff of the larger firms. In certain countries the final qualifying examination is intended to be difficult and case studies are used in the examination. In certain countries where the universities playa greater role in the educational process, the accountancy institutes are phasing out their own examinations. In other countries multiple-choice questions are set as a matter of expediency, where very large numbers of candidates are involved. In other countries, where the number of candidates is not too large, candidates do oral examinations and write theses as well. Complaints have been made about the length of the courses in South Africa, but in some countries accountants qualify between the age of 30 and 35 years. It is submitted that accountancy {{education in}} South Africa has been too technique-oriented and a happy medium between a conceptual and technique-oriented approach is required. University academics should play a more active role in research, and it is suggested that the Public Accountants' and Auditors' Board should give serious consideration to the possibility of reducing the number of contracting universities that are entitled to educate students for a Certificate in the Theory of Accountancy. The ultimate requirement for the profession is graduate entry, but in the interim entry standards must be improved and it is suggested that the profession create a trust fund utilising the Accounting Development Foundation, which could make bursaries available and thus make the profession more attractive to bright scholars. It is not envisaged that a detailed common body of knowledge should be prescribed, but more stringent conditions for the approval of contracting universities, should lead them to define the details themselves. This should not be stultifying, but should encourage research, which in the long run is in the interests of the profession. Communication between members of the profession and academics is essential to promote research and ensure the cross-fertilisation of ideas. It is also submitted that the final qualifying examination has had an undesirable effect on the teaching. This is because the proficiency of lecturers is generally measured by the success of the candidates in the final qualifying examination. A change in the format of the final qualifying examination is therefore imperative. A more case-study oriented examination is proposed. The value of the practical-experience requirement (articles) is questioned. It is submitted that for the practical ¬experience requirement to be meaningful, greater and more effective control of the quality of experience, to which the trainee accountant is exposed, is required. It is recommended that articles of clerkship or service contracts be dispensed with and that the training quotas of firms be more flexible, depending on circumstances. For the trainee accountant's experience to be meaningful it is necessary that his principal be kept up to date continuously with the latest developments which will result in greater emphasis being placed on required continuing education. The introduction of a quality review programme by the profession to improve the performance standards of its members is recommended. The abovementioned requirements, namely more effective control of practical-experience requirements, the introduction of a quality review programme and required continuing education as well as the fact that the decision making process in the accountancy profession is cumbersome and time-consuming necessitates a rationalisation of the controlling bodies in the profession. A questionnaire was designed to test the opinion of the respondents with regard to various controversial issues surrounding accountancy education. It appears that the profession does not want to accept greater responsibility for the possible extensions of the <b>attest</b> <b>function</b> and it can be stated that it favours the retention of the audits of private companies. It is thus obvious that certain changes are urgently required and the profession as well as academics will have to define its priorities very carefully. In the final analysis it must be borne in mind, that the profession must not overlook the public interest. Thesis (DCom) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. AccountingDComUnrestricte...|$|E

Some such constraints, active during infancy and childhood, have been proposed {{to account for the}} apparent ease with which typically developing children acquire language. In a series of experiments, we investigated the role of developmental constraints on learning artificial grammars with a distinction between shorter and relatively frequent words (‘function words,’ F-words) and longer and less frequent words (‘content words,’ C-words). We constructed 4 finite-state grammars, in which the order of F-words, relative to C-words, was either fixed (F-words always occupied the same positions in a string), flexible (every F-word always followed a C-word), or free. We exposed adults (N = 84) and kindergarten children (N = 100) to strings from each of these artificial grammars, and we assessed their ability to recognize strings with the same structure, but a different vocabulary. Adults were better at recognizing strings when regularities were available (i. e., fixed and flexible order grammars), while children were better at recognizing strings from the grammars consistent with the <b>attested</b> distribution of <b>function</b> and content words in natural languages (i. e., flexible and free order grammars).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} {{two aspects of}} expressive affixes: their morphological/typological properties and their semantics. With regard to the former, {{it shows that the}} expressive morphology of many languages (including Bantu, West Atlantic, Walman, Sanskrit, English, Romance, Slavic, and others), has the following properties: 1) it is systematically anomalous when compared to plain morphology, or the ordinary processes of word-formation and inflection. From this, it follows that many familiar morphological arguments that adduce the data of expressive morphology ought to be reconsidered; and 2) it is far more pervasive than has been traditionally thought. For example, the Sanskrit preverb, and the Indo-European aspectual prefix/particle generally, are shown to have systematically expressive functions. With respect to the semantics of expressive affixes, it develops a novel multidimensional account, in the sense of Potts (2005, 2007), of Spanish "connotative affixes," which can simultaneously convey descriptive and expressive meaning. It shows that their descriptive meaning is that of a gradable adjective, viewed as a degree relation which includes a measure function, in the sense of Kennedy (1997). The expressive meanings of connotative affixes, and expressives generally, arise as they manipulate the middle coordinate, I, of expressive indices which, it is proposed, is inherently specified on all lexical items and canonically set to "neutral. " It introduces a new mechanism, AFF, which is an algebraic operation for manipulating I, and which accounts for the well-known, and seemingly "contradictory," range of meanings that expressive affixes can express. Whereas prior work assumes that expressive affixes are inherently polysemous, this approach derives their many <b>attested</b> meanings and <b>functions</b> (e. g., "small," "young," "bad," deprecation, appreciation, hypocorism, intensification/exactness, and attenuation/approximation, as well as pragmatic effects like illocutionary mitigation) compositionally, from the interactions of their multidimensionality with the meanings of the roots to which they attach. </p...|$|R

Biber & Barbieri, 2007), discourse markers (e. g. Crawford Camiciottoli, 2004) and evaluative language (e. g. Swales & Burke, 2003). Discourse organisation (e. g. Nesi & Basturkmen, 2006; Thompson, 2003) and the oral-literate characteristics of lectures (e. g. Csomay, 2006) have also been relatively well explored. However, notwithstanding these significant contributions to EAP and the more comprehensive descriptions by Biber (2006) and Crawford Camiciottoli (2007) much remains to be done to obtain a more detailed linguistic picture of lectures. This paper uses data from 12 BASE lectures from various disciplines to provide an overview of <b>attested</b> language <b>functions</b> (e. g. informing, interacting, organising discourse, class management) used in achieving some of the main purposes of lectures (i. e. knowledge transfer, facilitating learning and the socialisation of students into disciplinary communities). Informed by insights from both linguistic and pedagogic research, this functional framework derives from a careful study of whole texts from which larger stretches of speech are assigned to particular functional categories on the basis of lexico-grammatical features, an understanding of the text and generic knowledge (Dudley-Evans, 1994).

40|$|ENGLISH: A {{systematic}} {{project of}} field survey, carried out from 1996 to 2004 in the Basentello valley {{on the border}} between Apulia and Lucania, provides evidence for the fluctuating trends in rural settlement and land use in this area. After the Roman conquest the number of settlements in the survey area was drastically reduced, and in the 1 st century AD at least two imperial estates were founded, including the one in which the Roman village near the modern masseria Vagnari was located. In the 4 th century AD, however, there was a remarkable increase in settlement. This phenomenon, which bears little relation to what happened in most of the Italian peninsula, was probably a consequence of the conversion of vast territories of South-East Italy to cereal growing {{to meet the needs of}} the annona. The archaeological excavation of the site at Vagnari was started in 2000 with the aim of testing, through stratigraphical research in a sample site, the hypotheses advanced on the basis of the field surface concerning the settlement dynamics in the Basentello valley between the Roman period and the Early Middle Ages. A geophysical survey of the site carried out before the excavation began produced evidence for wall alignments which required to be checked by excavation. Most of the trenches were laid out for this purpose. The combined evidence of the excavation and intensive field survey of the site provide important data on the origins and development of the settlement, and on its economic function. The first settlement at Vagnari in the Roman Period has yielded remains of several buildings with productive function (tile kilns and an iron smithy) datable between the end of the 1 st century BC and the end of the 1 st century AD. In this period the village was the main settlement in a wide saltus consisting of natural forest and rough pastures which was acquired by the emperor and formed part of the imperial patrimonium in the 1 st century AD. The industrial component of the settlement was strengthened in the 2 nd century AD with the construction of more kilns, some of which remained in use until the 4 th century AD. Various other changes were made in the 2 nd century AD in the design, function and location of the buildings. The excavation has confirmed the expansion of building activity in the late antique period already noted in the field survey. In the southern part of the settlement – in an area previously occupied by kilns – two large buildings have been excavated. Some of their features show the continuation of local industries, but others <b>attest</b> a residential <b>function</b> and agricultural-pastoral activity, consistent with the hypothesis that the surrounding territory had been converted to cereal production. These two buildings were occupied until the 6 th or 7 th century, during which period they underwent a series of transformations. The foundation of a hut in one of the ruined buildings suggests that in the latest phase of the site, at the beginning of the Early Middle Ages, the vicus structure of the settlement at Vagnari had declined, and a profound change in land use had taken place in the Basentello valley...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the acquisition of}} restrictive and appositive interpretations of relative clauses in German-speaking children between the age of 3 and 6 in three experiments. The theoretical background shows that restrictive relative clauses are semantically less complex than appositive ones. This assumption is supported by observations from a typological overview on the semantic <b>functions</b> <b>attested</b> across languages. It is shown {{that the existence of}} appositive relative clauses implies the availability of restrictive readings in a given language. Furthermore, restrictive readings may be favored due to the functioning of general processing principles. Previous research on the acquisition of relative clauses demonstrates that the acquisition of the semantic functions of relative clauses is an understudied area. In contrast, the acquisition of syntactic aspects of relative clauses is well documented. Relative clauses start to be produced in the third year of life and can be interpreted target-like between the age of 4 and 8 depending on their structure. Which semantic interpretation children assign to relative clauses at this age, however, is still an open question. Based on the formal background and insights from previous studies, three experiments were designed: two picture selection tasks and one acceptability task. The crucial aspect of the experimental design constitutes the interaction of an ordinal number word and the interpretation of the relative clause in sentences like “Take the third car(,) that/which is red”. The scope of the ordinal number reveals whether the relative clause had been attached restrictively at the NP-level or whether it had been attached higher up at the DP shell resulting in an appositive interpretation. The results of the experiments demonstrate that 4 - to 6 -year-old German-speaking children and adults prefer restrictive readings over appositive ones. This preference is found within the group data and is mirrored by the results of an individual analysis. In addition, while the majority of children has acquired restrictive readings at the age of 4, appositive interpretations are mastered only by about half of the children between age 4 and 6. Interestingly, 3 -year-old children show a different pattern than their older peers. Appositive but not restrictive interpretations seem to be available to these children. Although the results may be taken as evidence that appositivity is acquired before restrictivity in relative clauses by German-speaking children, I propose the contrary. Based on assumptions about the complexity of restrictive and appositive derivations, I argue that the appositive interpretations observed at the age of 3 do not result from a target-like syntactic and semantic representation. I propose that 3 -year-old children do not yet identify relative clauses as nominal modifiers. Instead, they are derived from an incorrect attachment of the relative clause higher up in the syntactic tree. The results of the three experiments are the first to show that neither a prototypical unintegrated prosodic contour nor the presence of a lexical marker, the discourse particle “ja”, or a visual context biasing for appositivity led to an increase of appositive interpretations in the children’s groups. Adults, in contrast, were sensitive to the presence of the discourse particle and the cues from the visual context. As for children, the prosodic format of the relative clauses did not systematically change the interpretation preferences of adults. The proposed acquisition path may not be specific to German. Instead, it is predicted to hold cross-linguistically and may also be transferred to the interpretation of adjectives. Moreover, the assumptions on how children integrate relative clauses during comprehension may be generalized to other types of subordinate clauses...|$|R
