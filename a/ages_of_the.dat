5|$|Since Ankylosaurus {{and other}} Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids grouped with Asian genera (in a tribe the authors named Ankylosaurini), Arbour and Currie {{suggested}} that earlier North American ankylosaurids had gone extinct {{by the late}} Albian or Cenomanian <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Cretaceous. Ankylosaurids thereafter recolonised North America from Asia during the Campanian or Turonian <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Late Cretaceous, and diversified there again, leading to genera such as Ankylosaurus, Anodontosaurus, and Euoplocephalus. This explains a 30 million year gap in the fossil record of North American ankylosaurids between these ages.|$|E

25|$|A notable {{exception}} to normative medieval eschatology {{is found in}} Joachim of Fiore (c. 1135–1202), a Cistercian monk, who to an extent, stressed premillennial themes.

5|$|Activity at Incapillo {{commenced}} {{shortly after}} the end of the Maricunga Belt volcanism and occurred first at Monte Pissis between 6.5 and 3.5mya. Later volcanism occurred south of Incapillo 4.7±0.5mya, at Sierra de Veladero 5.6±1–3.6±0.5mya, and in the region of Cerro Bonete Chico 5.2±0.6–3.5±0.1mya. Some of the 32mya Pircas Negras mafic andesites appear to be associated with the Incapillo volcanic complex. These rocks form the last pulse of the Pircas Negras volcanism. Specific <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pircas Negras flows in the Incapillo region include 4.7±0.5mya, 3.2±0.3mya and 1.9±0.2mya.

5|$|Heterodontosaurus {{is known}} from fossils found in {{formations}} of the Karoo Supergroup, including the Upper Elliot Formation and the Clarens Formation, which {{date to the}} Hettangian and Sinemurian <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lower Jurassic, around 200-190million years ago. Originally, Heterodontosaurus {{was thought to be}} from the Upper Triassic period. The Upper Elliot Formation consists of red/purple mudstone and red/white sandstone, whereas the slightly younger Clarens Formation consists of white/cream-coloured sandstone. The Clarens Formation is less rich in fossils than the Upper Elliot Formation; its sediments also often form cliffs, restricting accessibility for fossil hunters. The Upper Elliot Formation is characterised by animals that appear to be more lightly built than those of the Lower Elliot Formation, which may have been an adaptation to the drier climate at this time in southern Africa. Both formations are famous for their abundant vertebrate fossils, including temnospondyl amphibians, turtles, lepidosaurs, aetosaurs, crocodylomorphs, and non-mammal cynodonts.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} argued that all the {{specimens}} belong to the same species, A. lithographica. Differences do exist among the specimens, and while some researchers regard these as due to the different <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specimens, some may be related to actual species diversity. In particular, the Munich, Eichstätt, Solnhofen, and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. Due to these differences, most individual specimens have been given their own species name at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as Archaeornis siemensii, the Eichstätt specimen as Jurapteryx recurva, the Munich specimen as Archaeopteryx bavarica, and the Solnhofen specimen as Wellnhoferia grandis.|$|E
5|$|Nigersaurus {{is known}} from the Elrhaz Formation of the Tegama Group in an area called Gadoufaoua, located in Niger. It {{is one of the}} most {{commonly}} found vertebrates in the formation.

Nigersaurus lived in what is now Niger about 115 to 105 million years ago, during the Aptian and Albian <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mid-Cretaceous.

In addition to Dromaeosauroides and a possible titanosaur, remains of hybodont sharks, fish such as Lepidotes and Pleuropholis, turtles, lizards, the crocodile Pholidosaurus and thin bone fragments from birds or pterosaurs have been found in the deposit. The bivalve Neomiodon is found in abundance in the sediments below (the Neomiodon Bed), indicating mass mortality, perhaps due to dinoflagellate toxins.|$|E
5|$|Pele {{was born}} to the female spirit Haumea, or Hina, who, like all Hawaiian gods and goddesses, descended from the supreme beings, Papa, or Earth Mother, and Wakea, or Sky Father. According to the myth, Pele {{originally}} lived on Kauai, when her older sister Nāmaka, the Goddess of the Sea, attacked her for seducing her husband. Pele fled southeast to the island of Oahu. When forced by Nāmaka to flee again, Pele moved southeast to Maui and finally to Hawaii, where she {{still lives in the}} Halemaumau Crater at the summit of Kīlauea. There she was safe, because the slopes of the volcano are so high that even Nāmaka's mighty waves could not reach her. Pele's mythical flight, which alludes to an eternal struggle between volcanic islands and ocean waves, is consistent with geologic evidence about the <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> islands decreasing to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Records {{from the}} Pool Adit copper mine at Trevenson (the most {{successful}} {{of the early}} copper mines) show in 1729, 25 bal maidens and three males worked as 'pickers' sorting high quality from poor quality ore, earning a flat rate of 4d per day and typically working 20 days per month.

In 1730 Pool Adit employed 30 female and four male pickers, and by 1731 the figures had risen to 55 female and five male, typically working 22 to 26 days per month. The number of bal maidens employed in the industry rose dramatically, and by the early 1770s Dolcoath, by then the most significant of the Cornish copper mines, employed around 220 bal maidens on the copper dressing floors alone.|$|E
