5|$|Some B-class bracteates showing three godly {{figures have}} been {{interpreted}} as depicting Baldr's death, {{the best known}} of these is the Fakse bracteate. Two of the figures are understood to be Baldr and Odin while both Loki and Hel have been proposed as candidates for the third figure. If it is Hel she is presumably greeting the dying Baldr <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to her realm.|$|E
5|$|Dante {{has become}} one of the most popular {{characters}} in gaming, having been recognized for his role in the Devil May Cry series and various characteristics that have attracted gamers such as his cocky attitude. However, Dante's redesign and characterization in the reboot was the subject of controversy amongst gamers <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> across unlikable in comparison to original one as well as other characters. Nevertheless, video game publications have defended this version of Dante.|$|E
5|$|During a Friday night performance, Tony is drunk <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> {{backstage}} {{during the}} interim between {{his part in}} Acts IV and V. Felicity is angry that Tony, a recovering alcoholic, got drunk again; she has had to issue several refunds because of his drunken behaviour on stage. She sends him into the shower to sober up, and summons Jim. He is unsure whether he knows the lines well enough to go onstage in Tony's place, but Laura encourages {{him to take the}} chance. As she hands him a prop dagger, he sees blood all over the dagger and her hands. Tony comes out of the shower and wants to finish the performance, so Jim allows him to go. Laura berates Jim for his lack of ambition. She is left alone in the dressing room and hears noises coming from the shower; but when she goes to look, it is empty. A scream is then heard from the stage.|$|E

60|$|And <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{in with a}} pleased exclamation, {{his voice}} had no longer the thin, worn sound, as if only {{resolute}} resignation prevented peevishness; there was a cheerfulness and solidity in the tone, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> fondly to her side, regretted having missed her first appearance, and feared she had been long alone.|$|R
25|$|Shortly after {{a period}} of heavy rain {{followed}} by strong sun, there are signs of distress on the island: fishing boats do not put out to sea, carts do not go to market, people are ascending to the mountains. Then a storm causes a shipwreck and a survivor seeks refuge in Dan’s hut. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> in and out of consciousness, the man tells Dan the story of how he is a priest from Ireland come to help stop the “sweating sickness” which grips the island. Before the priest dies, Dan promises that he will take the priest's place and go to the Bishop's to instruct the people how to halt the sickness.|$|E
25|$|In Copenhagen {{he comes}} {{into contact with}} the Modern as a revolutionary force {{in the form of the}} natural {{sciences}} and technology, but also the cosmopolitan and intellectual circles of the wealthy Jewish milieu in Copenhagen. He becomes a friend of the banker Philip Salomon and has a brief relationship with his daughter Jakobe. Jakobe is young a passionate and not inhibited by Per's Protestant sense of guilt at indulging in the pleasures of life - but Per is unable to set his own passions free. Per also meets the charismatic Dr. Nathan, a fictionalized version of the intellectual Georg Brandes, who influences Per with his progressive ideals of bringing the future to Denmark. Although sympathetic, Per eventually rejects Dr. Nathan's influence, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to see him as a representative of a purely humanistic intellectualism with no interest in science and technological progress.|$|E
25|$|Part One (Chapters 1 to 15): Gilbert Markham narrates how {{a mysterious}} widow, Mrs Helen Graham, arrives at Wildfell Hall, a nearby mansion. A source of curiosity {{for the small}} community, the reticent Mrs Graham and her young son, Arthur, are slowly drawn into the social circles of the village. Initially Gilbert Markham casually courts Eliza Millward, despite his mother's belief {{that he can do}} better. His {{interest}} in Eliza wanes <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to know Mrs Graham. In retribution, Eliza spreads (and perhaps creates) scandalous rumours about Helen. With gossip flying, Gilbert is led to believe that his friend Mr Lawrence is courting Mrs Graham. At a chance meeting on a road Gilbert strikes the mounted Lawrence with a whip handle, causing him to fall from his horse. Though she is unaware of this confrontation, Helen Graham still refuses to marry Gilbert, but when he accuses her of loving Lawrence she gives him her diaries.|$|E

500|$|Quantum Break is {{a science}} fiction action-adventure third-person shooter video game {{developed}} by Remedy Entertainment and published by Microsoft Studios. The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One in April 2016. The game centers on Jack Joyce, granted time manipulation powers after a failed time-machine experiment, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> into conflict with former friend Paul Serene over {{how to deal with}} an apocalyptic [...] "End of Time". In addition, the game includes platform game elements in less action-oriented segments. There are also [...] "junction points" [...] that affect the game's outcome. The game features episodes of an integrated live-action television show, featuring the actors of the characters. The characters interact with the player's choices, displaying the results of the decisions made.|$|E
500|$|Carnivàle {{relies on}} other {{religious}} symbols and parallels for its mythology. The National Shrine of the Little Flower, funded by Father Coughlin in the 1930s, was {{an inspiration for}} the temple in Brother Justin's vision in the episode [...] "Los Moscos". This vision foreshadows the world that Justin will potentially build <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to power as a radio preacher. The producers planned to use radio towers instead of regular steeples for the temple; the design also incorporated Eastern European domes and Western European cathedrals. In the same vision, the Tattooed Man appears near a tree that resembles the iconic Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and implies that Justin is the Usher. According to Knauf, the Usher represents a [...] "timeless character who shows up in all different cultures", and who is [...] "there to usher in the Armageddon" [...] as [...] "the harbinger of End times".|$|E
500|$|In season four, Matt Saracen {{struggles with}} staying in Dillon and {{living as a}} townie. He turned down an art school in Chicago and is instead {{studying}} art at the local technical college. After returning from a hunting trip with Tim Riggins, he finds out {{that his father was}} killed in Iraq. The episode [...] "The Son" [...] shows Matt going through the five stages of grief <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to accept the death of his father, a man he claims to hate. This episode garnered much buzz online and resulted in a failed campaign for Zach Gilford to get an Emmy nomination in the guest actor category; however, the episode did get an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. After this emotionally charged episode, Matt abruptly moves to Chicago without saying goodbye to his girlfriend or best friend. He returns briefly in the finale and makes amends with both Julie and Landry, who ends up flying back to Chicago with Matt.|$|E

500|$|In Mark, John baptizes Jesus, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> out of {{the water}} he sees the Holy Spirit {{descending}} to him like a dove and he hears a voice from heaven declaring him to be God's Son (...) [...] This is one of two events described in the gospels where a voice from Heaven calls Jesus [...] "Son", the other being the Transfiguration. The spirit then drives him into the wilderness where he is tempted by Satan (...) [...] Jesus then begins his ministry after John's arrest (...) [...] Jesus' baptism in Matthew is similar. Here, before Jesus' baptism, John protests, saying, [...] "I need to be baptized by you" [...] (...) [...] Jesus instructs him to carry on with the baptism [...] "to fulfill all righteousness" [...] (...) [...] Matthew also details the three temptations that Satan offers Jesus in the wilderness (...) [...] In Luke, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove after everyone has been baptized and Jesus is praying (...) [...] John implicitly recognizes Jesus from prison after sending his followers to ask about him [...] ). Jesus' baptism and temptation serve as preparation for his public ministry.|$|E
500|$|In {{describing}} {{the premise of}} the novel, Le Guin stated [...] "the hero of the book, the protagonist, he has a different gift, it isn’t magic at all, in fact, it’s another kind of talent. And his problem is to realize that he doesn’t have the kind he’s supposed to have, he has this other one. Which is a problem, actually, {{a lot of young people}} face: What is my gift?" [...] Reviewers have described Orrec's search for his own identity, in contrast to the identity that has been thrust upon him, as one of the major themes of the novel. This theme is related to the other major theme of the novel, that of power and responsibility. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to terms with his identity, Orrec questions whether he is betraying his power by refusing to try to use it. Gry, too, is unwilling to use her gift to call animals to be hunted, and wonders whether [...] "all the gifts are backward.... They could have been healing, to begin with." [...] The novel ends with the two protagonists realizing that they are unwilling to remain in the cycle of violence and retribution in the Uplands, and leaving to keep their integrity; but they are also running toward a place where they can use their gifts as they please, rather than simply running away. A part of Orrec and Gry's process of growing up is to see beyond the binary choices they are presented with by society. Orrec is faced with a choice of whether to use his power, or to be blindfolded; Gry has to use her power to hunt, or not. Gry realizes that all of the upland powers can be used in two ways: for control and dominion, or for healing and nurturing. This recognition allows them to take a third choice, and leave. This wrestling with choice has been compared to the choices the characters are forced to make in Le Guin's novella The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aesthetic}} of the bishōnen {{was recorded in}} Lady Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji, written in about the year 1000 A.D. Genji concerns the exploits and romances of a young prince, {{the son of an}} emperor and beloved concubine, who is not in line to inherit the throne, and follows his intrigues through the court <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> of age. The novel typifies the Heian age of Japanese history, a period of highly stylized romance. Prince Genji's beauty is described as transcendental, so much so that [...] "one could have wished him a woman", with a bewitching attraction that is acknowledged by men and women alike.|$|E
2500|$|The studio felt Kurt Russell was an up-and-coming star. Russell was {{initially}} not interested {{because he felt}} there were [...] "a number of different ways to approach Jack, but I didn't know {{if there was a}} way that would be interesting enough for this movie". After talking to Carpenter and reading the script a couple [...] of more times, he gained insight into the character and liked the notion of playing [...] "a hero who has so many faults. Jack is and isn't the hero. He falls on his ass as much <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> through. This guy is a real blowhard. He's a lot of hot air, very self-assured, a screw-up". Furthermore, the actor felt that [...] "at heart he thinks he's Indiana Jones but the circumstances are always too much for him". Russell felt that the film would be a hard one to market. [...] "This is a difficult picture to sell because it's hard to explain. It's a mixture of the real history of Chinatown in San Francisco blended with Chinese legend and lore. It's bizarre stuff. There are only a handful of non-Asian actors in the cast".|$|E
2500|$|Frankel {{thinks that}} Joshua ben Hananiah, {{who lived in}} the {{beginning}} of the second century C.E., was the first hakham, but he does not sufficiently support this assertion. The office seems to have existed in Palestine as long as the academy of the nasi. An amora of the fourth century recounts the following rule of etiquette, still observed in his time: [...] "When the hakham appears in the academy everyone present must rise as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> within four ells of him, and must remain standing until he has gone four ells beyond". It is hardly possible that the office of hakham existed in Babylonia, where the relation of the exilarch to the heads of the academy was entirely different from that existing in Palestine between the latter and the nasi. Here [...] "hakham" [...] was merely the term for a Jewish scholar who studied chiefly oral traditions, while the terms sofer and qara were applied to Bible scholars. In the Seder Olam Zutta, every exilarch is accompanied by a hakham, who probably had charge of the religious affairs of the exilarchate; but as this work originated in Palestine, the author probably applied Palestinian conditions to Babylon. The Syrian Aphrahat, who had met only Babylonian Jews, mentions a man [...] "who is called the 'hakkima' of the Jews" [...] (Homilies, xxiv), but this too may mean [...] "the wise man" [...] of the Jews.|$|E

2500|$|A stage {{adaptation}} {{of the same name}} by Philip Himberg, with new music by Nigel Lilley and Ben and Max Ringham (as well as songs used by the original Paper Dolls in their act), played at the Tricycle Theatre in London from 28 February 2013 to 13 April 2013. The play was directed by the theatre's artistic director, Indhu Rubasingham, with choreography by Alistair David. The cast included New York-based actor Francis Jue as Sally. [...] Himberg said that he adapted the documentary for the stage, responding [...] "to the story about immigration, about crossing borders, both literal and metaphorical. ... Also the clashing of cultures. ... And the generational thing, that these younger Asian men were caring in a very beautiful way for these older men who had been, frankly, abandoned by their families." [...] Himberg met Rubasingham at the Sundance Theatre Programme. Himberg changed the story told in the documentary by creating a character, Yossi, partly based on Tomer Heymann, a filmmaker who grows in his perspective <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to know the Dolls. The Dolls [...] "dream of hitting the big time, and are convinced that allowing [...] to make a documentary of their lives is the route to fame and fortune." [...] The relationship between the brothers Chiqui and Giorgio is made more antagonistic (Giorgio is depicted as a troublemaker). Another new character is Chaim’s daughter Adina. Songs in the piece include numbers that the original Dolls chose for their lip-synching act, but the stage performers sing live.|$|E
