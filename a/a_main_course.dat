25|$|The most {{frequently}} used meat is pork, followed by beef, lamb, chicken, rabbit, duck and goose; for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or dusted with breadcrumbs and sauteed, in a dish similar to schnitzel. For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared. The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include brining, salting, drying and smoking. There are many varieties of smoked pork, including ham and a soft sausage with a large-grained filling; these are served as <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>course</b> or thinly sliced in sandwiches.|$|E
25|$|Caledonian {{sought to}} {{differentiate}} {{itself from the}} other UK independent airlines and US supplemental carriers with which it competed in the transatlantic closed group charter market by providing a personalised, high quality full-scheduled-service style inflight service that exceeded most contemporary scheduled transatlantic operators' economy class service standards by a wide margin. On a typical transatlantic 707 charter, there were individually printed menus. The inflight service began with tartan-clad cabin staff serving each passenger free cocktails from the drinks trolley at each seat row {{as soon as the}} seat belt signs were turned off. This was followed by the main meal, starting with a separately served hors d'œuvre before serving <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>course</b> of fillet of beef, Tournedos, lamb or a chicken dish, accompanied by a selection of complimentary wines. Thereafter, a dessert course was served, followed by a choice from a cheese tray and a basket of fresh fruit. The inflight service concluded with tea or coffee being served with complimentary brandies and liqueurs, as well as free cigarettes for those who smoked.|$|E

500|$|Victor Lewis-Smith {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Guardian in 2005, {{thought that a}} spring onion risotto accompaniment to a pan fried seabass tasted so good {{that it would have}} been sufficient as <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>course</b> itself and was also quite pleased that crêpe suzette was served on a trolley for table side service. Claire Ogden visited the restaurant for the Metro newspaper shortly after it was first awarded a Michelin star in 2007. She thought that a John Dory main course was [...] "pristine", and overall thought that the star was well deserved. The only negative thing she had to say about the experience was a toffee foam served on top of a pear granita which she described as [...] "flimsy-flavoured". It was named the best restaurant in Britain by Les Routiers later that year. The critic from the Western Mail stated in 2008 that [...] "the menu is short and to the point, with around five choices for each course. The wine list is huge, an insurmountable challenge for me but another's utopia." [...] However, he remarked that the main course was [...] "genuinely brilliant food" [...] and deserving of its Michelin star.|$|E
500|$|Michael Winner {{visited the}} {{restaurant}} {{a couple of}} days after opening for The Times while dining with Michael Caine. Winner found that the hotel's entrance to the restaurant was still under refurbishment, and that the service was sub par with items being dropped by their waiter. Once the food began to arrive, his opinion changed immediately with a dish of vichyssoise with oysters and caviar showing that White was [...] "on brilliant form". He called his main course of pot roasted pork accompanied by a cuvée vegetables and potatoes with parsley, [...] "as good <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>course</b> as I have ever eaten, and I had the sense to be born to extremely rich parents, who kept me gloriously fed from childhood." [...] He called the desserts [...] "to die for", and stole Caine's dessert to eat in addition to his own. John Lanchester dined there for The Guardian, on the second night following the opening, but complained of the cost of the meal which he thought at £60 for three courses including cover charge and VAT made it the most expensive in London. He said that the starter of ravioli of seafood with sauce vierge was [...] "good but not dumbfounding", while the lobster salad suffered from the lobster being slightly chewy. He called both main courses [...] "the business"; they were a saddle of rabbit served with a herb risotto, leeks, asparagus and a rosemary au jus; the other course was ham wrapped sweetbreads, he added were [...] "stupendously good", served with braised lettuice and cep confit. He referred to the desserts as [...] "red-fruit heaven".|$|E

50|$|In formal dining, <b>a</b> well-planned <b>main</b> <b>course</b> can {{function}} {{as a sort of}} gastronomic apex or climax.

2500|$|Justice Gray, citing several Supreme Court cases (Brown v. Piper, , , and Jones v. U.S., 137 U.S. 202, 216) {{stated that}} when words have {{acquired}} no special meaning in trade or commerce, the ordinary meaning {{must be used}} by the court. In this case dictionaries cannot be admitted as evidence, but only as aids to the memory and understanding of the court. Gray acknowledged that botanically, tomatoes are classified as a [...] "fruit of the vine"; nevertheless, they are seen as vegetables because they were usually eaten as <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>course</b> instead of being eaten as a dessert. In making his decision, Justice Gray mentioned another case where it had been claimed that beans were seeds [...] Justice Bradley, in Robertson v. Salomon, 130 U.S. 412, 414, similarly found that though a bean is botanically a seed, in common parlance a bean is seen as a vegetable. While on the subject, Gray clarified the status of the cucumber, squash, pea, and bean.|$|E
2500|$|Swanson's {{concept was}} not original. In 1944, William L. Maxson's frozen dinners were being served on airplanes. Other {{prepackaged}} meals were also marketed before Swanson's TV Dinner. In 1948, plain frozen {{fruits and vegetables}} were joined by what were then called 'dinner plates' with <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>course,</b> potato, and vegetable. In 1952 the first frozen dinners on oven-ready aluminum trays were introduced by Quaker States Foods under the One-Eye Eskimo label. Quaker States Foods was joined by other companies including Frigi-Dinner, which offered such fare as beef stew with corn and peas, veal goulash with peas and potatoes, and chicken chow mein with egg rolls and fried rice. Swanson, a large producer of canned and frozen poultry in Omaha, Nebraska, was able to promote the widespread sales and adaptation of frozen dinner by using its nationally recognized brand name with an extensive national marketing campaign nicknamed [...] "Operation Smash" [...] and the clever advertising name of [...] "TV Dinner," [...] which tapped into the public's excitement around the new device.|$|E

2500|$|The final Beefheart record, Ice Cream for Crow (1982), was {{recorded}} with Gary Lucas (who was also Van Vliet's manager), Jeff Moris Tepper, Richard Snyder and Cliff Martinez. This line-up made a video {{to promote the}} title track, directed by Van Vliet and Ken Schreiber, with cinematography by Daniel Pearl, which was rejected by MTV for being [...] "too weird". However, the video {{was included in the}} Letterman broadcast on NBC-TV, and was also accepted into the Museum of Modern Art. Van Vliet announced [...] "I don't want my MTV if they don't want my video" [...] during his interview with Letterman, in reference to MTV's [...] "I want my MTV" [...] marketing campaign of the time. Ice Cream for Crow, along with songs such as its title track, features instrumental performances by the Magic Band with performance poetry readings by Van Vliet. Raggett of Allmusic called the album a [...] "last entertaining blast of wigginess from one of the few truly independent artists in late 20th century pop music, with humor, skill, and style all still intact"; with the Magic Band [...] "...turning out more choppy rhythms, unexpected guitar lines, and outré arrangements, Captain Beefheart lets everything run wild as always, with successful results." [...] Barnes writes that, [...] "The most original and vital tracks (on the album) are the newer ones," [...] saying that it, [...] "...feels like an hors-d'oeuvre for <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>course</b> that never came." [...] Michael Galucci of Goldmine praised the album, describing it as [...] "the single, most bizarre entry in Van Vliet's long, odd career." [...] Promotional work proposed to Beefheart by Virgin Records was as unorthodox as him making an appearance in the 1987 film [...] Soon after, Van Vliet retired from music and began a new career as a painter. Gary Lucas tried to convince him to record one more album, but to no avail.|$|E
60|$|It {{was in the}} {{latitude}} of 27 degrees 5 minutes N., on the 19th day of March 1694-95, when we spied a sail, our course SE. and by S. We soon perceived {{it was a large}} vessel, and that she bore up to us, but could not at first {{know what to make of}} her, till, after coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her main-topmast, fore-mast, and bowsprit; and presently she fired a gun as a signal of distress. The weather was pretty good, wind at NNW. a fresh gale, and we soon came to speak with her. We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the road at Barbadoes a few days before she was ready to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate were both gone on shore; so that, besides the terror of the storm, they were in an indifferent case for good mariners to bring the ship home. They had been already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible storm, after the hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the westward, and in which they lost their masts. They told us they expected to have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then driven away again to the south-east, by a strong gale of wind at NNW., the same that blew now: and having no sails to work the ship with but <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>course,</b> and a kind of square sail upon a jury fore-mast, which they had set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring to stand away for the Canaries.|$|E
