40|$|Outdoor {{mobile robot}} motion {{planning}} and navigation is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. The search space density and dimensionality, system dynamics and environmental interaction complexity, and the perceptual horizon limitation {{all contribute to}} the difficultly of this problem. It is hard to generate a motion plan between arbitrary boundary states that considers sophisticated vehicle dynamics and all feasible actions for nontrivial mobile robot systems. Accomplishing these goals in real time is even more challenging because of dynamic environments and updating perception information. This thesis develops effective search spaces for mobile robot trajectory generation, motion planning, and navigation in complex environments. Complex environments are defined as worlds where locally optimal motion plans are numerous and where {{the sensitivity of the}} cost function is highly dependent on state and motion model fidelity. Examples include domains where obstacles are prevalent, terrain shape is varied, and the consideration of terramechanical effects is important. Three specific contributions are accomplished. First, a model-predictive trajectory generation technique is developed that numerically linearizes and inverts general predictive motion models to determine parameterized actions that satisfy the two-point boundary value problem. Applications on a number of mobile robot platforms (including skidsteered field robots, planetary rovers with actively <b>articulating</b> <b>chassis,</b> mobile manipulators, and autonomous automobiles...|$|R

50|$|The Volvo B5LH (initially {{known as}} the Volvo B5L Hybrid, also {{known as the}} Volvo BRLH) is a low-floor hybrid {{electric}} bus chassis for both single-decker buses and double-decker buses manufactured by Volvo since 2008. It is the basis for Volvo's integral 7700 Hybrid full low floor city bus and its successor, the 7900 Hybrid from 2011. In 2008, pre-production batches of both types of chassis were manufactured. Serial production started in June 2010. From 2013 it is also available as an <b>articulated</b> bus <b>chassis.</b> First entering service in London, the B5LH is the only current double decker type in service in the United Kingdom that uses a parallel hybrid drive system.|$|R
50|$|After {{all these}} {{projects}} failed by June 1915, ideas of grandiose landships were abandoned, and {{a decision was}} taken to make an attempt with US Bullock Creeping Grip caterpillar tracks, by connecting {{two of them together}} to obtain an <b>articulated</b> <b>chassis</b> deemed necessary for manoeuvring. Experiments failed in tests made in July 1915.|$|E
50|$|Leyland, being a mainly British manufacturer, {{also had}} an {{overseas}} manufacturing interest in the Danish manufacturer Danish Automobile Building (DAB) since 1953, which used a number of Leyland parts in its own bus models.

Van Hool have a series of [...] "side-engine mid-drive" [...] buses that puts the engine off to one side of the cabin longitudinally between the first and the second axle, to maximize usable cabin space.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the static {{structural}} analysis of an <b>articulated</b> urban bus <b>chassis,</b> carried out with the Finite Elements Method. The purpose of this work is to simulate and forecast the structural response of the chassis, in terms of stress, strain and displacement, under several loading and constraining conditions, which aim at reflecting the actual duty cycle of the bus. A thorough interaction with the customer company allowed the authors to adequately define the loading scheme and to constrain the structure properly. Sensitivity analyses about FEM parameters have been run, {{in order to achieve}} an adequate trade off between computational time and results accuracy. Obtained results have been double checked by employing both solid (3 D) and shell (2 D) elements for each simulation. Eventually, the customer has been notified of critical issues and the related suggested improvements...|$|R

40|$|The {{transport}} sector contributes significantly to global energy use and emissions {{due to its}} traditional dependency on fossil fuels. Climate change, {{security of energy supply}} and increasing mobility demand is mobilising governments around the challenges of sustainable transport. Immediate opportunities to reduce emissions exist through the adoption of new bus technologies, e. g. advanced powertrains. This thesis analysed energy use and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions of conventional, hybrid-electric, and plug-in hybrid-electric city buses including two-axle, <b>articulated,</b> and biarticulated <b>chassis</b> types (A total of 6 bus types) for the operation phase (Tank-to-Wheel) in Curitiba, Brazil. The systems analysis tool – Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR) and a carbon balance method were applied. Seven bus routes and six operation times for each (i. e. 42 driving cycles) are considered based on real-world data. The results show that hybrid-electric and plug-in hybrid-electric two-axle city buses consume 30 % and 58 % less energy per distance (MJ/km) compared to a conventional two-axle city bus (i. e. 17. 46 MJ/km). Additionally, the energy use per passenger-distance (MJ/pkm) of a conventional biarticulated city bus amounts to 0. 22 MJ/pkm, which is 41 % and 24 % lower compared to conventional and hybrid-electric two-axle city buses, respectively. This is mainly due to the former’s large passenger carrying capacity. Large passenger carrying capacities can reduce energy use (MJ/pkm) if the occupancy rate of the city bus is sufficient high. Bus routes with fewer stops decrease energy use by 10 - 26 % depending on the city bus, because of reductions in losses from acceleration and braking. The CO 2 emissions are linearly proportional to the estimated energy use following from the carbon balance method, e. g. CO 2 emissions for a conventional two-axle city bus amount to 1299 g/km. Further results show that energy use of city bus operation depends on the operation time due to different traffic conditions and driving cycle characteristics. An additional analysis shows that energy use estimations can vary strongly between considered driving cycles from real-world data. The study concludes that advanced powertrains with electric drive capabilities, large passenger carrying capacities and bus routes with a fewer number of bus stops are beneficial in terms of reducing energy use and CO 2 emissions of city bus operation in Curitiba...|$|R
50|$|The E.626 {{series was}} built in 448 units and three series, each with only slight electro-mechanic differences: unadvanced but reliable, it {{subsequently}} constituted the mainstay of the new FS lines at 3,000 V DC, which gradually spread to the whole peninsula. The firsts tests occurred on the Foggia-Benevento line in the September 1927, using three prototypes built at Savigliano, with the electric part provided by the Metropolitan-Vickers of Manchester. The first 14 prototypes (eight E.625 with shorter gear ratio, for cargo services, and six E.626) proved powerful and reliable, and entered service the following year. The only teething problem encountered was with the six 32R motors mounting on the axles, hanging laterally over transverse beams, a system devised to avoid the complicate side rods of the contemporary steam and three-phase locomotives: {{after a series of}} breakdowns, it was decided to limit the speed to 95 km/h. Traction control was provided by three different configurations of the motors' coupling (series, series-parallel, parallel) through banks of resistor-based rheostats. The transmission was rather noisy, but at the time the crew's comfort was not an important issue. The carbody was in a single steel piece, mounting on an <b>articulated</b> <b>chassis.</b> The large bonnets at the front limited the visibility of the rails, and were reduced in size from the 3rd series.|$|E
