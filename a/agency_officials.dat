All residents of this village were evacuated after the government designated it a no-entry zone. According to a Japanese government panel, authorities had shown no respect for the lives and dignity of village people. One NISA official apologized for the failure and added that the panel had stressed the importance of disclosure; however, the mayor said that the information would have prevented the evacuation into highly polluted areas, and that apologies a year too late had no meaning.|$|E

The procurement official was nearly hired by the U.S. Department of Energy before that department learned of the findings against her at the VA. Miller said that [...] "If any current laws or regulations are impeding the (VA)’s ability to swiftly hold employees accountable, VA leaders must work with Congress so those laws and regulations can be changed", and “VA appears to be giving failing executives an opportunity to quit, retire or find new jobs without consequence."

500|$|The American Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) {{criticized the}} CIA's {{intelligence}} on Al-Shifa and bin Laden in an August 6 memo; as James Risen reported, INR analysts concluded that [...] "the evidence linking Al Shifa to bin Laden {{and chemical weapons}} was weak." [...] According to Risen, some dissenting officials doubted {{the basis for the}} strike, but senior principals believed that [...] "the risks of hitting the wrong target were far outweighed by the possibility that the plant was making chemical weapons for a terrorist eager to use them." [...] Senior NSC intelligence official Mary McCarthy had stated that better intelligence was needed before planning a strike, while Reno, concerned about the lack of conclusive evidence, had pressed for delaying the strikes until the U.S. obtained better intelligence. According to CIA officer Paul R. Pillar, senior <b>Agency</b> <b>officials</b> met with Tenet before he briefed the White House on bin Laden and Al-Shifa, and the majority of them opposed attacking the plant. Barletta notes that [...] "It is unclear precisely when U.S. officials decided to destroy the Shifa plant." [...] ABC News reported that Al-Shifa was designated as a target just hours in advance; Newsweek stated that the plant was targeted on August 15–16; U.S. officials asserted that the plant was added as a target months in advance; and a U.S. News & World Report article contended that Al-Shifa had been considered as a target for years. Clinton ordered an investigation into the evidence used to justify the Al-Shifa strike, while as of July 1999, the House and Senate intelligence committees were also investigating the target-selection process, the evidence cited, and whether intelligence officials recommended attacking the plant.|$|E

He added that experts were analyzing minute traces of graphite and stainless steel found at and near the site, but said that it was too early to relate them to nuclear activity. The report noted Syria's refusal to allow agency inspectors to make follow-up visits to sites suspected of harboring a secret nuclear program despite repeated requests from top <b>agency</b> <b>officials.</b> Syria disputed these claims. According to Syria's IAEA representative Othman, {{there would have been a}} large amount of graphite had the building been a nuclear reactor.
