25|$|Mussolini {{was very}} {{unsure of what}} date to invade, as {{he changed his mind}} many times, even five times in one segment of fifteen minutes. Eventually he decided on 28 October, the anniversary of the March on Rome, though staff {{headquarters}} was not aware until they heard the date on London radio. In about two weeks, the Italian army was already retreating back into Albania, for conditions {{at this time of year}} were very detrimental to mountain warfare and general organization problems continued throughout the military. Franco of the recently victorious Fascist side in the Spanish Civil War was pondering entrance into World War II, but Italy's failure in Greece put him off of the idea. Hitler then came in to rescue Mussolini's troops, gaining him the upper hand in <b>all</b> <b>politics</b> and military operations for the rest of the war.|$|E
500|$|Some {{suggest that}} Meyer is likely a Republican, while others feel {{she is a}} Democrat. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes that Meyer's party {{affiliation}} is unknown because the show focuses on bullying and ego rather than ideology. James Poniewozik of Time explains the ambiguity as follows: Veep is [...] "almost <b>all</b> <b>politics</b> and almost no political issues". Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times explains the lack of need for party affiliations, or even political ideology in a similar manner, saying that Veep is [...] "less a show about politics than about politicking." [...] In an interview with The New Yorker Radio Hour, Julia Louis-Dreyfus suggested that Meyer's associated political party is intentionally left unknown to the audience. Louis-Dreyfus later elaborated: [...] " [...] politics are all about her and staying alive ... she will hold any position if it keeps her in office." [...] In the episode Election Night, CNN represents states won by Meyer as blue. In the same episode, she also comments winning the 'blue wall' states of Connecticut and Vermont with [...] "A bowl of hair could win those states".|$|E

2500|$|In 1937, Nationalism and Culture, {{which he}} had started work on around 1925, was finally {{published}} {{with the help of}} anarchists from Chicago Rocker had met in 1933. A Spanish edition was released in three volumes in Barcelona, the stronghold of the Spanish anarchists. It would be his best-known work. In the book, Rocker traces the origins of the state back to religion claiming [...] "that <b>all</b> <b>politics</b> is in the last instance religion": both enslave their very creator, man; both claim to be the source of cultural progress. He aims to prove the claim that culture and power are essentially antagonistic concepts. He applies this model to human history, analyzing the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and modern capitalist society, and to the history of the socialist movement. He concludes by advocating a [...] "new humanitarian socialism".|$|E

2500|$|Savarkar as {{president}} of the Hindu Mahasabha, during the Second World War, advanced the slogan [...] "Hinduize <b>all</b> <b>Politics</b> and Militarize Hindudom", he decided to support the British war effort in India seeking military training for the Hindus. When the Congress launched the Quit India movement in 1942, Savarkar criticised it and asked Hindus to stay active in the war effort and not disobey the government, he urged the Hindus to enlist in the armed forces to learn the [...] "arts of war". Hindu Mahasabha activists protested Gandhi's initiative to hold talks with Jinnah in 1944, which Savarkar denounced as [...] "appeasement." [...] He assailed the British proposals for transfer of power, attacking both the Congress and the British for making concessions to Muslim separatists. Soon after Independence, Dr Shyama Prasad Mookerjee resigned as Vice-President of the Hindu Mahasabha dissociating himself from its Akhand Hindustan plank, which implied undoing partition.|$|E
2500|$|After that he {{realized}} {{that there is not}} much [...] "symmetry between a cancer cell and a normal one. Yet our state is similar to a cancer cell â€“ with its messianism and expansionism, its totalitarian suppression of dissent, the authoritarian structure of power, with a total absence of public control in the most important decisions in domestic and foreign policy, a closed society that does not inform its citizens of anything substantial, closed to the outside world, without freedom of travel or the exchange of information." [...] Sakharov's ideas on social development led him to put forward the principle of human rights as a new basis of <b>all</b> <b>politics.</b> In his works he declared that [...] "the principle 'what is not prohibited is allowed' should be understood literally", defying the unwritten ideological rules imposed by the Communist ruling elite on the society in spite of the seemingly democratic (1936) USSR Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Pete lasted {{in the show}} for eight years, and was eventually written out in 1993 when the writers felt that the character {{had come to a}} natural end. There was initially talk of Pete getting back together with his ex-wife Kathy, but it was felt {{that it would have been}} a retrogressive step, and it was dismissed. The character was killed off-screen in December 1993 and brought back to Walford to be buried. The press reported at the time that Pete was killed-off because he spoke negatively about EastEnders in the press following his axing. There was also speculation that he had not got along with Gillian Taylforth, who played his ex-wife Kathy. Dean commented, [...] "When they wrote me out of EastEnders, they said they had run out of storylines. I was a naughty boy and said if the wheel falls off the cart, get rid of the cart. But they got rid of me, not the scriptwriters [...] What gets me is the way it was done. It's <b>all</b> <b>politics</b> and backstabbing." ...|$|E

6000|$|Next in {{importance}} to these red-hot [...] "forwards" [...] came the phalanx of old-fashioned {{people who voted}} Liberal because their fathers had voted Liberal before them. Then there were the electors {{who used to be}} Conservative but, being honestly dissatisfied with the Government on account of its foreign policy, or for other reasons, had made up their minds to transfer their allegiance. Also there were the dissenters, who set hatred of the Church above <b>all</b> <b>politics,</b> and made its disendowment and humiliation their watchword. In Dunchester these were active and numerous, a very tower of strength to me, for Stephen Strong was the wealthiest and most important of them.|$|E

I want to turn our coronet into a ducal one, and to get your grandmother's barony called out of abeyance in your favour. It is impossible that Peel can refuse me. I have already purchased an ample estate with the view of entailing it on you and your issue. You will make a considerable alliance; you may marry, if you please, Lady Theresa Sydney. I hear the report with pleasure. Count on my at once entering into any arrangement conducive to your happiness.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>politics</b> {{are governed}} by human desires. The materialist theory of history, in the last analysis, {{requires}} the assumption that every politically conscious person is governed by one single desire--the desire to increase his own share of commodities; and, further, that his method of achieving this desire will usually be to seek to increase the share of his class, not only his own individual share. But this assumption is very far from the truth. Men desire power, they desire satisfactions for their pride and their self-respect. They desire victory over rivals so profoundly that they will invent a rivalry for the unconscious purpose of making a victory possible. All these motives cut across the pure economic motive {{in ways that are}} practically important.|$|E

50|$|Despite these changes, all fifteen councils {{confirmed}} {{their respective}} political administrations.

6000|$|... "The {{middle of}} the sixties was a {{stirring}} time out in Japan. That was just after the Simonosaki bombardment, and before the Daimio affair. There was a Tory party {{and there was a}} Liberal party among the natives, and the question that they were wrangling over was whether the throats of the foreigners should be cut or not. I tell you <b>all,</b> <b>politics</b> have been tame to me since then. If you lived in a treaty port, you were bound to wake up and take an interest in them. And to make it better, the outsider {{had no way of knowing}} how the game was going. If the opposition won it would not be a newspaper paragraph that would tell him of it, but a good old Tory in a suit of chain mail, with a sword in each hand, would drop in and let him know all about it in a single upper cut.|$|E
60|$|Internationalism is in {{any case}} hostile to democracy. I do not say it is {{incompatible}} with it; but any {{combination of the two}} will be a compromise between the two. The only purely popular government is local, and founded on local knowledge. The citizens can rule the city because they know the city; but it will always be an exceptional sort of citizen who has or claims the right to rule over ten cities, and these remote and altogether alien cities. All Irishmen may know roughly the same sort of things about Ireland; but it is absurd to say they all know the same things about Iceland, when they may include a scholar steeped in Icelandic sagas or a sailor who has been to Iceland. To make <b>all</b> <b>politics</b> cosmopolitan is to create an aristocracy of globe-trotters. If your political outlook really takes in the Cannibal Islands, you depend of necessity upon a superior and picked minority {{of the people who have}} been to the Cannibal Islands; or rather of the still smaller and more select minority who have come back.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, when morning came I resumed the interminable {{discussions of}} the materialistic {{conception}} {{of history and the}} merits of a truly popular government. Those with whom I discussed had not seen the sleeping wanderers, and would not have been interested if they had seen them, since they were not material for propaganda. But something of that patient silence had communicated itself to me, something lonely and unspoken remained in my heart throughout all the comfortable familiar intellectual talk. And at last I began to feel that <b>all</b> <b>politics</b> are inspired by a grinning devil, teaching the energetic and quickwitted to torture submissive populations for the profit of pocket or power or theory. As we journeyed on, fed by food extracted from the peasants, protected by an army recruited from among their sons, I wondered what we had to give them in return. But I found no answer. From time to time I heard their sad songs or the haunting music of the balalaika; but the sound mingled with the great silence of the steppes, and left me with a terrible questioning pain in which Occidental hopefulness grew pale.|$|E
