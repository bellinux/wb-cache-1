Molecular diagnostics tests such as microarray comparative genomic hybridisation test a sample of DNA instead, and because of cell-free DNA in plasma, could be less invasive, but as of 2013 it is still an <b>adjunct</b> to the conventional tests.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims at {{investigating}} {{the manner of}} expression of <b>adjuncts</b> in English and Persian based on (Halliday, 2004). Halliday's categorization of <b>adjuncts</b> into “interpersonal, textual, and experiential” was adopted to classify the collected examples of <b>adjuncts.</b> Some English novels and their Persian translations were investigated and more than 220 <b>adjuncts</b> were identified in the two languages. Based on (Halliday, 2004), these <b>adjuncts</b> were categorized into “interpersonal, experiential and textual”. By employing descriptive and inferential statistics, the results were analyzed. The findings obtained by running statistical operations revealed that English and Persian use almost the similar tools (adverbial, prepositional phrase, and clause) to express experiential <b>adjuncts.</b> However, {{it was found that}} the two contrasted languages do not use the same linguistic tools to express interpersonal and textual <b>adjuncts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Comment <b>adjuncts</b> are a {{means for}} the speaker/ writer to convey his/ her {{attitude}} towards part or the whole of a proposition. The academic text {{is the place where}} the writer expresses his/ her points of view. This paper adopts the system of comment <b>adjuncts</b> proposed by Halliday and Matthiessen,and analyzes,by the use of Kconcordance,the comment <b>adjuncts</b> in a corpus of English academic texts. The findings show that the corpus is rich in the resource of comment <b>adjuncts.</b> When using comment <b>adjuncts</b> to express his/ [...] . 评论附加语体现了说话人/作者对于整个或部分命题的态度。学术语篇是作者表达和阐述观点的场所。本文采用Halliday和Matthiessen的评论附加语系统,通过Kconcordance检索软件对英语学术语篇语料库中的评论附加语进行分析。结果表明,英语学术语篇库使用了丰富的评论附加语资源,学术语篇的作者在使用评论附加语来表示自己的个人观点和判断时,首先关注的是命题的事实、自然程度、有效性和明显程度。国家社科基金项目:“基于语篇的英汉情态系统研究”的部分成果,批准号: 06 BYY 003...|$|R

50|$|<b>Adjuncts</b> {{are always}} constituents. Each of the <b>adjuncts</b> in the {{examples}} throughout {{this article is}} a constituent.|$|R
50|$|Solid <b>adjuncts</b> {{are either}} starchy <b>adjuncts</b> which {{need to be}} {{converted}} to simpler sugars, or solid sugar <b>adjuncts</b> which can be added after conversion. Solid starchy <b>adjuncts</b> are normally produced from cereals and {{are used in the}} form of flakes, grits, flour or purified starch and must be added before the mash tun to convert the starch into simple sugars which the yeast can use during fermentation. Cereals with a higher gelatinisation temperature than the standard mashing temperatures must be cooked in a cereal cooker to gelatinise the starch before adding to the mash. Solid sugar <b>adjuncts</b> include granulated sugar and glucose chips.|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the acquisition of <b>adjuncts</b> by students in selected tertiary institutions in Southwestern, Nigeria {{with a view to}} examining the problems encountered by students in the usage of these structural components and its effects on their mastery of English. The data for the study were drawn from an essay writing assignment given to selected 675 first year students across nine tertiary institutions in Southwestern Nigeria. Stratified random sampling technique was adopted in selecting the participants. Seventy-five students were drawn from each institution using purposive random sampling procedure. The findings revealed that out of the 12, 573 instances of <b>adjuncts,</b> process <b>adjuncts</b> accounted for 6, 844 (54. 43 %), place <b>adjuncts</b> 4, 066 (32. 34 %) and time <b>adjuncts</b> 1, 663 (13. 23 %). In spite of the high frequency rate of process <b>adjuncts,</b> there were deviant usages such as inappropriate choice of process <b>adjuncts,</b> semantic and orthographic errors and some instances of the influence of Nigerian languages on their usage of place and time <b>adjuncts.</b> The study concluded that the students’ poor mastery of <b>adjuncts</b> has a lot of influence on their communicative repertoire. The study is therefore, a focus for the teachers of English and curriculum designers of the use of English course in Nigerian tertiary institutions...|$|R

50|$|Verbal <b>adjuncts</b> are <b>adjuncts</b> {{that work}} in {{conjunction}} with verbal formatives {{to provide information about}} the latter's valence, level, phase, sanction, illocution, modality, aspect, and bias.

40|$|This article {{gives an}} account of {{oriented}} <b>adjuncts</b> in English and Swedish. After a presentation {{of a number of}} properties of oriented <b>adjuncts</b> and a discussion of what distinguishes them from other types of <b>adjuncts,</b> we focus on a number of central and peripheral subtypes that have been delineated, starting from a general typology of oriented <b>adjuncts.</b> Each subtype is described in detail in terms of lexical meanings, possible paraphrases and particular syntactic features. It is shown that, in spite of clear similarities, the oriented <b>adjuncts</b> discussed also display a number of subtle differences between English and Swedish, most clearly in terms of morphosyntax...|$|R

50|$|<b>Adjuncts</b> are, {{compared}} with tenure-track faculty, inexpensive and flexible, acting as additional teaching resources {{to be called}} up as necessary. <b>Adjuncts</b> cannot count on employment: classes can be transferred from <b>adjuncts</b> to full-time professors, classes with low enrollment can be summarily canceled; and the teaching schedule from one semester to the next can be unpredictable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Adjuncts</b> are {{constituents}} {{which are}} not required by the main verb, and can be removed without leaving behind something ungrammatical. <b>Adjuncts</b> are usually adverbs or adverbial phrases or clauses.|$|R
50|$|Most {{work on the}} {{distinction}} between arguments and <b>adjuncts</b> has been conducted at the clause level and has focused on arguments and <b>adjuncts</b> to verbal predicates. The distinction is crucial {{for the analysis of}} noun phrases as well, however. If it is altered somewhat, the relative clause diagnostic {{can also be used to}} distinguish arguments from <b>adjuncts</b> in noun phrases, e.g.|$|R
