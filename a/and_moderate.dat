40|$|Although {{theoretical}} perspectives suggest self-esteem level (i. e., high/low) {{should have}} main <b>and</b> <b>moderating</b> effects on job performance, empirical and narrative {{reviews of the}} literature suggest such effects are either nonexistent or highly variable. To account for these mixed findings, we hypothesized that self-esteem level should only have main <b>and</b> <b>moderating</b> effects on job performance when one 2 ̆ 7 s self-esteem is not contingent upon workplace performance. Using multisource ratings across 2 samples of working adults, {{we found that the}} importance of performance to self-esteem (IPSE) moderated the effect of self-esteem level on job performance <b>and</b> <b>moderated</b> the buffering interaction between self-esteem level and role conflict in the prediction of job performance. Our results thus support IPSE as an important moderator of both main <b>and</b> <b>moderating</b> effects of self-esteem level...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} mediating variables <b>and</b> <b>moderating</b> variables <b>and</b> provide reasons for integrating them in outcome studies. Separate sections describe examples of <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> mediating variables and the simplest statistical model for investigating each variable. The strengths and limitations of incorporating mediating <b>and</b> <b>moderating</b> variables in a research study are discussed as well as approaches to routinely including these variables in outcome research. The routine inclusion of mediating <b>and</b> <b>moderating</b> variables holds the promise of increasing the amount of information from outcome studies by generating practical information about interventions as well as testing theory. The primary focus is on mediating <b>and</b> <b>moderating</b> variables for intervention research but many issues apply to nonintervention research as well. Keywords methodology; methodological article; intervention; outcome It is sufficiently obvious that both analysis and synthesis is necessary in classification and that both splitting and lumping have a place, or, to the extent that the terms involve antithesis, that neither one is correct.
