5|$|The Royal Hotel in {{the area}} of Woodhill was {{designed}} and built to serve Brunel's railway line which finished <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> from the Hotel. The original building survives as The Royal Inn pub. It was built in 1830 by the Corporation of Bristol (now known as Bristol City Council) in order to provide a hotel supporting the development of the seaside resort. It is thought to be the only seaside hotel to be built by a public authority during the nineteenth century. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

Rockefeller won 22% of the primary vote, 75% of which came from California. The favorite son candidates and unofficial candidates won 40% of the vote - more than either of the two leading candidates and a sign that the Republican faithful was remarkably dissatisfied with their choices.|$|R

50|$|When Walker Memorial opened {{later in}} 1948, it {{attracted}} a small clientele, who paid $9 {{a day for}} a room, meals and a daily hydrotherapy treatment. The hospital after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years <b>stepped</b> <b>away</b> from its resort-style beginning and began expanding its services. Various changes were made to the main building and to outlying buildings and grounds. It was said that by 1973 renovations were so extensive, that it was difficult to recognize features of the original hotel. Also, a number of physician offices and various health clinics sprouted in the area south of the hospital. A child care center for hospital employees was constructed three blocks south of Walker Memorial.|$|R
25|$|An {{unveiling}} {{ceremony was}} held on Tuesday, July 1, 1890. Three of the association's executive committee members Edward Hawkins, Noble C. Butler, and John A. Holman, served as the Committee of Arrangements; a General Reception Committee was named and consisted of approximately one hundred Indianapolis citizens and two or more from each Indiana county. Indianapolis streets and buildings were decorated with lavish display of flags and bunting. A large, canvas-covered amphitheater with a stage, five hundred chairs and a raised pavilion for a large chorus of school children and other spectators was erected across Tennessee Street. The structure was elaborately decorated with bunting; the monument, which stood <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>steps</b> <b>away,</b> was covered in flags. Benches {{in front of the}} amphitheater supplied ticket-holder seating. Special invitations were sent to President Benjamin Harrison and ex-President Grover Cleveland and their cabinets, senators and congressmen, federal judges, and governors of other states. Governors from New York, Ohio, Missouri, and Indiana attended the event. The ceremonies began with a parade, followed by a program of activities: a call to order by Alvin P. Hovey, governor of Indiana; an invocation by Rev. Joseph S. Jenckes, of St. Paul’s Church, Indianapolis; music; a historical statement by Frederick Rand, president of the monument association; unveiling of the monument by Eliza C. Hendricks; a nine-round salute from Indianapolis Light Artillery; a dedicatory poem by James Whitcomb Riley of Indiana, read by Rev. Dr. D. W. Fisher, president of Hanover College; and address by David Turpie, U. S. Senator from Indiana; and a benediction from Reverend Francis Silas Chatard, Bishop of Vincennes.|$|E
500|$|Now {{considered}} part of the Mao family, Luo lived with Mao Yichang and Wen Qimei at their home, but was publicly humiliated by her husband's disappearance; some locals considered her to be Yichang's concubine. Luo Yixiu died of dysentery on 11 February 1910, the day after Chinese New Year. Mao Zedong returned home; his father forgave him for his disobedience, and in the autumn of 1910 agreed to finance his son's studies at the Dongshan Higher Primary School, and so Mao left Shaoshanchong. When in 1936 Mao told Snow [...] "I do not consider her my wife", he made no mention of her death. Luo Yixiu's grave is located on the mountain facing Mao Zedong's former residence in Shaoshanchong, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> from the tomb of his parents.|$|E

Ryan wrote; [...] "...I state most emphatically that I am not guilty of murder." ...|$|E
500|$|The film, however, was {{not without}} its criticisms. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice was more {{critical}} of the film. While praising Ejiofor's work, she stated: [...] "It's a picture that stays more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> safe <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> from anything so dangerous as raw feeling. Even when it depicts inhuman cruelty, as it often does, it never compromises its aesthetic purity." [...] Peter Malamud Smith of Slate criticized the story, saying, [...] "12 Years a Slave is constructed as {{a story of a}} man trying to return to his family, offering every viewer a way into empathizing with its protagonist. Maybe we need a story framed on that individual scale in order to understand it. But it has a distorting effect all the same. We're more invested in one hero than in millions of victims; if we're forced to imagine ourselves enslaved, we want to imagine ourselves as Northup, a special person who miraculously escaped the system that attempted to crush him." [...] Describing this as [...] "the hero problem", Malamud Smith concluded his review explaining, [...] "We can handle 12 Years a Slave. But don't expect 60 Years a Slave any time soon. And 200 Years, Millions of Slaves? Forget about it." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club opined that McQueen is [...] "essentially tone-deaf when it comes to performance, and skirts by on casting". The film [...] "lacks a necessary emotional continuity. I don't think it's something the movie is denying in the way it intentionally denies so many other conventions; it's still structured around an ending that's supposed to function as a release, but because it can’t organize that sense of catharsis it so badly needs, it just feels as though McQueen is scurrying for an exit. Also: The cast is wildly uneven." [...] At The Guardian, black Canadian author Orville Lloyd Douglas said he would not be seeing 12 Years a Slave, explaining: [...] "I'm convinced these black race films are created for a white, liberal film audience to engender white guilt and make them feel bad about themselves. Regardless of your race, these films are unlikely to teach you anything you don't already know." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{background}} and framework for this thesis {{are based on}} organisational challenges due to digitalisation of information and communication experienced by organisations constituting the value chain of Norwegian offshore development and construction projects. In spite of their considerable investments in information technology and organisational measures undertaken to improve their performance, they still experience challenges with releasing pent-up potential and combating new challenges {{as a consequence of}} the new information technology. These projects are normally large and complex, involving a large number of organisational entities, a large number of interorganisational interfaces, and have to handle a large amount of information in a short time span. This backcloth inspired this thesis to take <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>steps</b> back, <b>away</b> from the challenges expressed by the organisations, and to take a closer look at one of the fundamental elements in all organisational activities, namely information and how it is created. Information and communication of this information are recognised as two of the most fundamental and crucial elements in all organisations, which most organisational processes and activities depend upon. The cornerstone of this thesis is the assumption that organisations and information systems depend upon high quality information products, and that this dependency will influence collaborative performance and collective competitiveness. As a result, the main purpose of this thesis is to take a closer look at how information is produced in the first place and how organisations ensure that each information product has the highest possible quality. The problem addressed by this thesis turned out to take two different, but closely related paths, as the problem had both a scientific and a practical facet. As a result, it was decided to present the overview of the thesis and its main findings in two summaries, a scientific summary and an executive summary. The main reason for doing so is to present the research and the findings in a comprehensible manner for the two different target groups of this thesis. This summary will present the perspectives of this thesis with scientific relevance. The scientific ambitions of this thesis were to describe the processes involved in information production and to establish a better understanding of how these processes influence information quality. The main reason for doing so was that the initial investigation revealed that this topic has had little or no attention in published knowledge within management theory, and that information quality actually unconsciously seems to be taken for granted. This research has been based on case studies of four Norwegian offshore development and construction projects, of which one project was used for an in-depth study. The research has been exploratory and descriptive in nature, and both qualitative and quantitative methods have been combined in a case study approach to collect and analyse data. It has not been the principal intentions for this thesis to provide results with generic or external validity, but rather to gain better insight into a phenomenon observed in a small and demarcated sample that could later prove to be of generic interest. The main scientific contribution of this thesis has been to enlighten the importance of information quality and information production in view of interorganisational collaboration in general, and in view of performance of complex value chains in specific. It is the intention of this thesis to inspire other scientists within management theory and organisational studies to develop more knowledge on the topics of information production and information quality in the future. In addition, other important scientific contributions of this thesis should be mentioned. This thesis has: Confirmed that published knowledge within management theory has little or no focus on information production and information quality. Developed a methodical framework to be used to analyse communicative situations in complex projects. Improved the understanding of how organisational interaction is carried out in practice through individual employees. Established and described the fundamental elements in an information production perspective.  Developed an information product process model to better understand how information products are created and maintained throughout the life cycle of an information product. Substantiated that information quality has impact on collaborative performance and described how information production processes will impact information quality. Described how role-oriented information production could help to improve information production and information quality in complex project environments. Identified a set of factors that influence information quality, and categorised them as core factors, supporting factors, and external factors. This thesis has substantiated that information production and information quality should be taken into consideration when complex organisational environments are analysed. Further, the thesis has substantiated that more research should be carried out to investigate the importance of information quality on organisational performance and collaboration, as well as to investigate how information production should be carried out to ensure production and distribution of high quality information products. The theoretical foundation for the elements of information production should be strengthened and developed further by further research.   PhD i produksjons- og kvalitetsteknikkPhD in Production and Quality Engineerin...|$|R
