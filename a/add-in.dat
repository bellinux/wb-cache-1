2500|$|Chromatic Research Inc. was {{a company}} based in Mountain View, California that {{developed}} a multifunction multimedia device for PCs called the MPACT! The company was formerly known as Xenon Microsystems Corporation. Chromatic Research, Inc. was founded in 1993. The founders came from Kubota, Showgraphics, Convex and RAMBUS. [...] The hardware technology for the MPACT! was a programmable VLIW and SIMD media processor that implemented a video, audio and modem device.

[...] The MPACT briefly sold as a fully functioning add in card and as a DVD decoder solution.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Search {{builds a}} full-text index of files on a computer. (An <b>add-in</b> for 32-bit Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista allows network shares {{to be added}} to the index.) The time {{required}} for the initial creation of this index depends on the amount and type of data to be indexed, and can take up to several hours, but this is a one-time event. Once a file’s contents have been added to this index, Windows Search is able to use the index to search results more rapidly than it would take to search through all the files on the computer. Searches are performed not only on file names, but also on the contents of the file (provided a proper handler for the file type is installed) as well as the keywords, comments and all other forms of metadata that Windows Search recognizes. For instance, searching the computer for [...] "The Beatles" [...] returns a list of music files on the computer which have [...] "The Beatles" [...] in their song titles, artists or album names, as well as any e-mails and documents that include the phrase [...] "The Beatles" [...] in their titles or contents.|$|E

2500|$|A further {{advancement}} which [...] "overcomes {{the limitations}} of sensitivity and scenario analyses by examining the effects of all possible combinations of variables and their realizations" [...] is to construct stochastic or probabilistic financial models – {{as opposed to the}} traditional static and deterministic models as above. For this purpose, the most common method is to use Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the project's NPV. This method was introduced to finance by David B. Hertz in 1964, although it has only recently become common: today analysts are even able to run simulations in spreadsheet based DCF models, typically using a risk-analysis <b>add-in,</b> such as @Risk or Crystal Ball. Here, the cash flow components that are (heavily) impacted by uncertainty are simulated, mathematically reflecting their [...] "random characteristics". In contrast to the scenario approach above, the simulation produces several thousand random but possible outcomes, or trials, [...] "covering all conceivable real world contingencies in proportion to their likelihood;" [...] see Monte Carlo Simulation versus [...] "What If" [...] Scenarios. The output is then a histogram of project NPV, and the average NPV of the potential investment – as well as its volatility and other sensitivities – is then observed. This histogram provides information not visible from the static DCF: for example, it allows for an estimate of the probability that a project has a net present value greater than zero (or any other value).|$|E
