25|$|Fillings in {{pastries}} {{are sometimes}} made of finely ground poppy seeds mixed with butter or milk and sugar. The ground filling {{is used in}} poppy seed rolls and some croissants and may be flavored with lemon or orange zest, rum and vanilla with raisins, heavy cream, cinnamon, and chopped blanched almonds or walnuts added. For sweet baked goods, sometimes instead of sugar a tablespoon of jam, or other sweet binding agent, like syrup is substituted. The poppy seed for fillings are best when they are finely <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> because this will {{make a big difference}} in the pastry filling's texture and taste. Some recipes for Mohnstriezel use poppy seed soaked in water for two hours or boiled in milk. A recipe for Ukrainian poppyseed cake recommends preparing the seeds by immersing in boiling water, straining and soaking in milk overnight.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{test whether}} or not dentin desensitizing or sealing methods {{influence}} the bond strength of universal resin cements. Materials and Methods: The bond strength of two universal resin cements (RelyXUnicem, Self-adhesive Prototype Cement) to human dentin was assessed after different dentin surface treatments (test). A conventional resin cement (Panavia 21) served as control. The influence of the following pretreatment methods was tested <b>and</b> compared to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin: dentin desensitizing by means of glutaraldehyde-containing primers (Gluma Desensitizer, Syntac Primer/Adhesive), or dentin sealing by means of bonding agents (Heliobond, ClearfilSE Bond). Additionally, the influence of provisional cement (Freegenol) was analyzed after its application and subsequent mechanical removal. Bond strength after thermocycling was measured in a shear test (n = 10). Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Results: Both test cements exhibited significantly lower bond strength to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin than the control cement. The desensitization methods {{did not affect the}} bond strength of the test cements. Furthermore, the sealing methods significantly increased the bond strength of both test cements as compared to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin. The application and subsequent removal of the provisional cement only had a minor influence on the bond strength of the test cements. The contamination with provisional cement, however, significantly affected the bond strength of the control cement compared to the values achieved on <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin. Conclusion: Desensitization or sealing of dentin have a beneficial effect on the bond strength of universal resin cements. The application of a provisional cement prior to adhesive cementation exhibits no significant influence on the bond strength of the universal resin cements...|$|R
50|$|Inhalation of <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz, when {{compared}} to inhalation of aged quartz, results in {{a significant increase in}} animal lung injury. <b>Freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz has increased reactive silicon-based oxygen radicals, and animals that are exposed to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz have been found to have decreased concentrations of antioxidant enzymes. Activated quartz particles decay with age in ambient air. Quartz dusts containing surface iron as an impurity have been shown to deplete cellular glutathione, contributing to the oxidative damage that is caused by particle and cell-derived ROS. Castranova et al. suggest that <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz dust that is contaminated with trace levels of iron may be more pathogenic than quartz dust alone.|$|R

50|$|Khaman is a food {{common in}} the Gujarat state of India made from soaked <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> channa dal or channa flour (also called gram flour or besan). Generally eaten as a snack, it is mostly served with sev, fried {{chillies}} and chutney. In some shops it is also served traditionally in a large green leaf. Sometimes it is also garnished with scraped coconut. Khaman, often part of the Gujarati Thali (traditional dish containing various components of a full meal) {{is very similar to}} dhokla, in which the batter is made with a mixture of rice and lentil flour, resulting in a distinct texture and taste. Nonetheless, Khaman, Khaman-Dhokla and Dhokla are often used interchangeably and are synonymous with a steamed snack made with a batter composed of lentil flour or a mixture of lentil and rice flours. Although a Gujarati snack, it has become increasingly popular across India, as well as in other regions with a sizable Gujarati community.|$|E

40|$|This project {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} using ground corn stalks as the substrate to cultivate marigold (Tagetes erecta L.). Five treatments including peat moss, composted corn stalks <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> corn stalks were tested for their effects on marigold seedling growth. Seedling quality was described by several morphological and physiological parameters. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and GGE biplot analysis. There were significant differences among the treatments for several growth parameters, such as seedling biomass, root biomass, stem diameter, leaf area, seedling vigor, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, root activity, stomatal conductance, and intercellular CO 2 concentration. Treatment T 3, which contained composted ground corn stalks, had the best effect on marigold seedling growth. The results showed that corn stalk was a good substrate for marigold seedlings. GGE biplot demonstrated the substrate effects on marigold seedling quality, and graphically displayed the interrelationships among morphological and physiological parameters. T 3 treatment was the best because four morphological parameters, including seedling biomass, roots biomass, stem diameter and seedling vigor, along with six physiological parameters fall into this sector. These results {{were consistent with the}} results analyzed by Statistical Analysis Software. For morphological parameters, the correlations are complicated. For physiological parameters, they were all positively correlated between each of two parameters...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Who {{would think}} of cooking a potato in boiling rosin? The origin and {{rationale}} for this interesting cooking behavior is lost in ethno-botanical lore but directions for the practice persisted until recent editions of The Joy of Cooking (Rombauer and Becker 1975). Indeed, the dish can still be obtained at Sweetie Pies Restaurant (Decatur, TX) one day a week. We obtained rosin (Pinerez 1277), produced by Hexion Specialty Chemicals, to duplicate the cooking recipe and to investigate the gustatory effects. The basic recipe involves heating the rosin to 275 0 F and carefully lowering the spud into the pot (see Figure 1). The potato initially sinks in the rosin, but after about 45 minutes, floats to the surface (Rombauer and Becker 1975). The potato is simmered a further 30 minutes, removed from the rosin, and wrapped in heavy brown paper with the ends twisted tightly. The rosin baked potato is cooled for 10 minutes and then slit and served with butter, salt, <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> pepper. The cooking process must be done outside and the skin must not be eaten. The cooking in rosin provides a baked potato with an exceptional texture that is distinctively flaky. Figure 1.

30|$|Based on Figure  6 and the OSEE results displayed, we {{infer that}} OSEE {{investigations}} allow for differentiating {{two types of}} steel and their respective surface states since as-received or <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> SAE 1008 / 1010 steel shows different OSEE signals than as-received or <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> steel 1.4301. In detail, in both of the investigated surface states the steel SAE 1008 / 1010 shows a higher signal than the steel 1.4301. And for both types of steel we observe a clearly increased electron emission {{as a consequence of}} the grinding process. These findings may be related to the SEM, EDX and XPS results presented in Figure  4 and in Tables  1 and 2, respectively. These investigations show that the grinding process results in strong changes of the structure and the composition of the substrate surface, and the XPS investigations indicate that exposure of <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> substrates of steel 1.4301 results in changes of the surface composition and, especially, in an increased thickness of the reaction layer on top of the surface. Consequently, we applied OSEE to characterize the surface state of <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> steel substrates during continued exposure in dry air. The obtained results are displayed in Figure  7 for the steel samples of type SAE 1008 / 1010 and 1.4301, respectively. Coarsely speaking, the OSEE signal significantly decreases during at least one hour for both types of steel, according to a first regime of substrate behaviour. After this phase - in a second regime of substrate behaviour - for two hours no significant change of the OSEE signals is detected. A graphical evaluation determining the intersection of both of these regimes for both types of steels reveals that the OSEE signal of steel 1.4301 reaches the second regime significantly earlier than the OSEE signal of SAE 1008 / 1010 steel. This observation indicates that the time span for reaching the intersection is material-dependent.|$|R
