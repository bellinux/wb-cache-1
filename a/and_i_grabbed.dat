50|$|The Naval Research Laboratory {{has been}} a crucial piece of the United States space program.

Vanguard II was the first satellite to observe the Earth's cloud cover and therefore the first meteorological satellite. NRL pioneered {{the study of the}} sun Ultraviolet and X-Ray spectrum. Along with Project Vanguard, NRL also designed the first satellite tracking system, Minitrack, which became the prototype for future satellite tracking networks. NRL's recently declassified Galactic Radiation <b>and</b> Background <b>I</b> (<b>GRAB</b> <b>I)</b> was the first U.S. intelligence satellite, intercepting Soviet radio communications from space.
