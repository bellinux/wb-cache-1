25|$|The {{trail that}} splits from the {{snowmobile}} route {{a mile from}} the Platte Clove trailhead curves back another mile or so to Huckleberry Point, a steep and ledgy area which, due to past fires, offers many places to sit back <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> into the clove. Since the route is mostly level, and the roundtrip considerably shorter than that required for the whole mountain, it is popular with those who hike only occasionally. Care must be taken at the Point, however, since some of the ledges also sit above sharp drops.|$|E

All living things possess their own Gate of Truth, and per the Gaea hypothesis heavenly bodies like planets also have their own Gates of Truth. It is possible to bypass the Law of Equivalent Exchange (to an extent) using a Philosopher's Stone, a red, enigmatic substance. Philosopher's Stones {{can be used to}} create Homunculi, artificial humans of proud nature. Homunculi have numerous superhuman abilities unique amongst each other <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> upon all humanity. With the exception of one, they do not age and can only be killed via the destruction of their Philosopher's Stones.|$|E
25|$|Back in 1919, Jo asks Louisa to {{help her}} find the {{container}} {{so that they can}} move it, to prevent the later disastrous events happening in 1995. The well is located in the yard of a neighbouring house which is rented by a British visitor to the area, Sir Ivor Creevy-Thorne. Jo and Louisa enter the yard <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> the well, but are disturbed in their actions by Sir Ivor Creevy-Thorne. Their activities are watched by a teenage boy, Nicholas, whom Sir Ivor had brought from Russia to New Zealand, under the guise of caring for the boy until the dangerous situation in Russia abated. Although Nicholas is grateful to Sir Ivor for his help, he is extremely worried about his family, whom he has not heard about for a long time - and he is worried about the lack of information he receives whenever he asks Sir Ivor about them. Nicholas is also upset that Sir Ivor refuses to allow him to leave the house, or to have any friends of his own age.|$|E

Davies announced RRP as the scheme architects on 16 October 1998. Richard Rogers said [...] "The idea was that steps rise {{out of the water}} and there is a whole public domain where people meet each other <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> on the Assembly Members." [...] Richard Rogers had previously designed the Lloyd's building in London and the Pompidou Centre in Paris with Renzo Piano. 11 days later, Davies resigned as Secretary of State for Wales.|$|E

2500|$|Again, these {{divisions}} are general, and specific rulership of each nation is modified by location and observed cultural distinctions. For example, in Europe, only those regions that {{lie to the}} north-west extremes are fully attributed to Jupiter and Mars, since those that lie towards {{the centre of the}} inhabited area incline towards the influence of opposing regions. [...] In this way, the [...] "inhabited region" [...] experiences a drift of astrological correspondence rather than sharp divisions within its quarters, and independent nations are variously affiliated with the signs of each triplicity and the planets that rule them. Ptolemy names Britain and Spain as two nations appropriately placed in the north-west quarter to accept the rulership of Jupiter and Mars. Such nations are described as [...] "independent, liberty-loving, fond of arms, industrious", based on characteristics attributed to those planets. Being predominantly governed by masculine planets they are also [...] "without passion for women <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> upon the pleasures of love". [...] Observed characteristics influence his categorisation of Britain as having a closer affinity with Aries and Mars (by which [...] "for the most part its inhabitants are fiercer, more headstrong and bestial"), whilst Spain is reported to be more subject to Sagittarius and Jupiter, (from which is evidenced [...] "their independence, simplicity and love of cleanliness").|$|E
2500|$|Multi-mode radar, a 3D radar is a HAL {{project with}} DRDO's LRDE as a {{subsystem}} provider. This project {{to develop an}} advanced, lightweight Multi-mode fire control radar for the LCA Tejas fighter had faced challenges and was delayed and finally superseded by a program called the Uttam to develop an AESA FCR for the Tejas LCA. The MMR program was finally completed with Elta's (Israel) assistance and became a hybrid system incorporating the original DRDO antenna, gimbal stabilization and Israeli backend. The multi-mode radar has range (for detection of a small fighter target) around 100km, can track 10 targets, can engage 2 targets and uses lightweight system. Originally, DRDO developed an all new combined signal and data processor had been developed, replacing the original separate units. The new unit is much more powerful and makes use of contemporary ADSP processors. The radar's critical hardware was also developed and validated. The software for the air-to-air mode has been developed considerably (including search and track while scan in both look up <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> modes) but air-to-ground modes were still being worked upon and proved problematic. The radar development was shown to be considerably more mature than previously thought but still faced significant delay and challenges. At Aero India 2009, {{it was revealed that}} the 3D MMR project has been superseded by the new 3D AESA FCR project led by LRDE. The MMR has been completed with Elta Israel's assistance and now involved Elta EL/M-2032 technology for Air-to-Ground mapping and targeting â€“ in order to simplify testing, the Hybrid MMR basically became an Indian variant of the EL/M-2032 with an Indian antenna and gimbal system as Elta pointed out mixing and matching Indian hardware with Israeli software would in essence mean a new design with a significant time impact. The [...] "hybrid" [...] MMR has been tested, validated and will be supplied for the initial LCA Tejas fighters.|$|E
