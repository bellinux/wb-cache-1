500|$|According to {{the park}} and Twitter posts {{selected}} by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive; Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults. On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E

60|$|I climbed {{high and}} fast from small beginnings. I had {{the mind of}} my party. I {{do not know where}} I might not have ended, but for this red blaze that came out of my {{unguarded}} nature <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> career for ever.|$|E

60|$|There {{was another}} long silence {{and it seemed}} to me that Mr. Marx was very deep in thought. I was {{beginning}} to feel sleepy <b>and,</b> <b>closing</b> <b>my</b> eyes, I leaned right back among the soft, yielding cushions.|$|R
50|$|The wind rises... we {{must try}} to live. The immense air opens <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> <b>my</b> book. The wave, pulverised, dares to gush and spatter from the rocks. Fly away, dazzled, blinded pages. Break, waves. Break with joyful waters...|$|R
60|$|I {{sat down}} in the chair <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes. The barber soaped my face, and then took his razor and gave me a rake that well nigh threw me into convulsions. I jumped out of the chair: Dan and the doctor were both wiping blood off their faces and laughing.|$|E
60|$|What {{manner of}} thing was upon me I did not know, {{but that it}} was large and heavy and many-legged I could feel. My hands were at its throat before the fangs had a chance to bury {{themselves}} in my neck, and slowly I forced the hairy face from me <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> fingers, vise-like, upon its windpipe.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{development}} {{worthy of}} Darwin!", the lady exclaimed enthusiastically. [...] "Only you reverse his theory. Instead {{of developing a}} mouse into an elephant, you would develop an elephant into a mouse!" [...] But here we plunged into a tunnel, and I leaned back <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes for a moment, trying to recall {{a few of the}} incidents of my recent dream.|$|E
6000|$|Deane smiled. [...] "There {{is nothing}} in the world," [...] he answered, [...] "which I want to do so much as to lie up there in the heather <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes, <b>and</b> feel the sun and the wind." ...|$|R
5000|$|Even now, I {{can sit in}} the subway, {{and look}} up at the ads, <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes, <b>and</b> there's Miss Subways", he said. [...] "She wasn't the most {{beautiful}} girl in the world but she was ours. She was our own Miss America." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you must}} be reasonable," [...] she begged, with a little break in her voice. [...] "You {{know very well that}} I ought not to listen to you. I ought not to welcome you here. I ought to be strong <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> ears." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{all turned}} round. The {{door of the}} room was {{suddenly}} opened <b>and</b> <b>closed.</b> <b>My</b> host of a few hours ago stood upon the threshold, smiling suavely upon us. He wore a low black hat, and a coat somewhat thicker than the season of the year seemed to demand. Every article of attire was different, but his face seemed to defy disguise. I should have known Mr. Grooten anywhere.|$|E
6000|$|I {{knelt down}} by the tomb. I laid my hands, I laid {{my head on the}} broad white stone, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> weary eyes on the earth around, on the light above. I let her come back to me. Oh, my love! my love! my heart may speak to you NOW! It is {{yesterday}} again since we parted--yesterday, since your dear hand lay in mine--yesterday, since my eyes looked their last on you. My love! my love! ...|$|E
60|$|I rather enjoy {{a bit of}} noise, as {{a general}} rule. I {{remember}} Cats-meat Potter-Pirbright bringing a police rattle into the Drones one night and loosing it off behind my chair, and I just lay back <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes with a pleasant smile, like someone in a box at the opera. And {{the same applies to}} the time when my Aunt Agatha's son, young Thos., put a match to the parcel of Guy Fawkes Day fireworks to see what would happen.|$|E
60|$|To me {{it seems}} only {{yesterday}} that {{my whole life}} ended with my new hope, and that truly I began a new record. So it shall be until the Great Recorder sums me up <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> <b>my</b> ledger account with a balance to profit or loss.|$|R

60|$|De Cartienne and Cecil seated {{themselves}} {{at a small}} round table and began to play almost immediately. I drew an easy chair up to the fire, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes as though I intended going to sleep. As a matter of fact, I meant to watch the game, and closely, too. But Fate decided otherwise. I was really very sleepy, and, though I struggled against it, I was obliged to yield in the end. I fell asleep, and {{it must have been}} nearly two hours before I was awakened by a touch on my arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "As I {{felt the}} sickening {{sweep of the}} descent, I had instinctively {{tightened}} my hold upon the barrel, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes. For some seconds I dared not open them--while I expected instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water. But moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling had ceased; and {{the motion of the}} vessel seemed much as it had been before, while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more along. I took courage, and looked once again upon the scene.|$|E
60|$|But I {{could not}} sleep. I took more cream of tartar. It {{must be the}} heat of the bed-clothes, I decided, that excited my hives. And yet, {{whenever}} I ceased struggling for sleep, and lighted the lamp and read, my skin irritation decreased. But as soon as I turned out the lamp <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes I was troubled again. So hour after hour passed, through which, between vain attempts to sleep, I managed to wade through many pages of Rosny's Le Termite--a not very cheerful proceeding, I must say, concerned as it is with the microscopic and over-elaborate recital of Noel Servaise's tortured nerves, bodily pains, and intellectual phantasma. At last I tossed the novel aside, damned all analytical Frenchmen, and found some measure of relief in the more genial and cynical Stendhal.|$|E

60|$|But the {{photographer}} {{had ceased to}} listen. He came over and took my {{head in his hands}} and twisted it sideways. I thought he meant to kiss me, <b>and</b> I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned on}} my side, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, seeking to sleep; and then quite {{suddenly}} I {{heard a sound}} of unutterable sweetness--a melody so faint and subtle that it had none of the form and rhythm of earthly music. I sat up, my breath almost arrested, and listened more intently. I could still hear it, but very faint and distant. It was as a sound of silver bells, {{and yet it was}} not quite that. I remembered the stories I had heard that day in the tavern at Pojetta, and the talk of the mystic melodies by which travellers had been drawn to the anchorite's abode. I noted the direction of the sound, and I determined to be guided by it, and to cast myself at the feet of that holy man, to implore of him who could heal bodies the miracle of my soul's healing and my mind's purging from its torment.|$|E
6000|$|... "At Holyhead I {{tried to}} get into a {{carriage}} with people that looked all right, but in a queer way there seemed always to be a crowd round me shoving and pushing me just the way I didn't want to go. There was something uncanny and frightening about it. In the end I found myself in a carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after all. I went out into the corridor, but all the other carriages were full, so I had to go back and sit down. I consoled myself with the thought that there were other people in the carriage--there was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting just opposite. So I felt almost happy about it until just outside London. I had leaned back <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes. I guess they thought I was asleep, but my eyes weren't quite shut, and suddenly I saw the nice-looking man get something out of his bag and hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer, and as he did so he WINKED....|$|E
60|$|Never did a pilgrim {{approach}} Niagara with deeper enthusiasm than mine. I had lingered {{away from}} it, and wandered to other scenes, because my treasury of anticipated enjoyments, comprising all {{the wonders of}} the world, had nothing else so magnificent, and I was loath to exchange the pleasures of hope for those of memory so soon. At length the day came. The stage-coach, with a Frenchman and myself on the back seat, had already left Lewiston, and {{in less than an hour}} would set us down in Manchester. I began to listen for the roar of the cataract, and trembled with a sensation like dread, as the moment drew nigh, when its voice of ages must roll, for the first time, on my ear. The French gentleman stretched himself from the window, and expressed loud admiration, while, by a sudden impulse, I threw myself back <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes. When the scene shut in, I was glad to think, that for me the whole burst of Niagara was yet in futurity. We rolled on, and entered the village of Manchester, bordering on the falls.|$|E
5000|$|Irons {{was born}} and raised in Tacoma, while Harris-White {{was born and}} raised in Hawaii and Seattle. The duo met in 2008 while {{attending}} the University of Washington. Irons, the rapper of the duo, frequented Harris-White's open mic performances. Irons recalls, [...] "I was attracted to Cat's voice, I would go to the open mic <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes <b>and</b> zone out whenever she sang. I finally had the courage to speak to her… it took a while." ...|$|R
60|$|My interrogations {{were cut}} short; I heard a little {{rustling}} behind me, <b>and</b> <b>close</b> at <b>my</b> back was the directress, professing to be examining {{the interior of}} a desk.|$|R
60|$|She tripped a step as {{we turned}} the corner, <b>and</b> came <b>closer</b> to <b>my</b> side.|$|R
6000|$|Yet, {{we enjoyed}} {{intervals}} of unalloyed contentment. When the twilight toned down the hard {{outlines of the}} oaks, and made shadowy clumps and formless masses of other bushes, it was quite romantic to sit by the window and inhale the faint, sad odor of the fennel in the walks below. Perhaps this economical pleasure was much enhanced by a picture in my memory, whose faded colors the odor of this humble plant never failed to restore. So I often sat there of evenings <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes until the forms and benches of a country schoolroom came back to me, redolent with the incense of fennel covertly stowed away in my desk, and gazed again in silent rapture on the round, red cheeks and long black braids of that peerless creature whose glance had often caused my cheeks to glow over the preternatural collar, which at that period of my boyhood it was my pride and privilege to wear. As I fear I may be often thought hypercritical and censorious in these articles, I am willing to record this {{as one of the}} advantages of our new house, not mentioned in the advertisement, nor chargeable in the rent. May the present tenant, who is a stock-broker, and who impresses me with the idea of having always been called [...] "Mr." [...] from his cradle up, enjoy this advantage, and try sometimes to remember he was a boy! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{house was}} very quiet. The leaves of a catalpa, across the roadway, hung motionless. Somebody yawned {{on the veranda}} below. I threw away my half-finished cigar, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes. I think I had not lost {{consciousness}} {{for more than a}} few seconds before I was awakened by the shaking and thrilling of the whole building. As I staggered to my feet, I saw the four pictures hanging against the wall swing outwardly from it on their cords, and my door swing back against the wall. At the same moment, acted upon by the same potential impulse, the door of the end room in the hall, opposite the stairs, also swung open. In that brief moment I had a glimpse of the interior of the room, of two figures, a man and a woman, the latter clinging to her companion in abject terror. It was only for an instant, for a second thrill passed through the house, the pictures clattered back against the wall, the door of the end room closed violently on its strange revelation, and my own door swung back also. Apprehensive of what might happen, I sprang toward it, but only to arrest it an inch or two before it should shut, when, as my experience had taught me, it might stick by the subsidence of the walls. But it did stick ajar, and remained firmly fixed in that position. From the clattering of the knob of the other door, and the sound of hurried voices behind it, I knew that the same thing had happened there when that door had fully closed.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was during}} that melancholy November when {{the death of}} the Princess Charlotte had {{diffused}} throughout Great Britain a more general sorrow than had ever before been known in these kingdoms; I was sitting alone at evening in my library, and my thoughts had wandered from the book before me to the circumstances which made this national calamity be felt almost like a private affliction. While I was thus musing the post-woman arrived. My letters told me there was nothing exaggerated in the public accounts of the impression which this sudden loss had produced; that wherever you went you found the women of the family weeping, and that men could scarcely speak of the event without tears; that in all the better parts of the metropolis there was a sort of palsied feeling which seemed to affect the whole current of active life; and that for several days there prevailed in the streets a stillness like that of the Sabbath, but without its repose. I opened the newspaper; it was still bordered with broad mourning lines, and was filled with details concerning the deceased Princess. Her coffin and the ceremonies at her funeral were described as minutely as the order of her nuptials and her bridal dress had been, in the same journal, scarce eighteen months before. [...] "Man," [...] says Sir Thomas Brown, [...] "is a noble animal, splendid in ashes, and pompous in the grave; solemnising nativities and deaths with equal lustre, nor omitting ceremonies of bravery in the infamy of his nature." [...] These things led me in spirit to the vault, and I thought of the memorable dead among whom her mortal remains were now deposited. Possessed with such imaginations I leaned back upon the sofa <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes.|$|E
6000|$|And {{when it was}} day {{the young}} Fisherman rose up and said to his Soul, 'I will bind my hands that I may not do thy bidding, <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> lips that I may not speak thy words, and I {{will return to the}} place where she whom I love has her dwelling. Even to the sea will I return, and to the little bay where she is wont to sing, and I will call to her and tell her the evil I have done and the evil thou hast wrought on me.' ...|$|R
