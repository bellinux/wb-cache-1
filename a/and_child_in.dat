5|$|During this visit, Parry and {{his friends}} who had {{accompanied}} him to Wales travelled the country giving concerts of Parry's own works. They were well received throughout the land. Parry was offered the opportunity to study for a year under Dr Davies of Swansea, followed by a one-year scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music. He had to refuse both offers since he had a wife <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>in</b> the United States dependent on him for support. By 1865, Parry's musical ability had become well known in Wales and in the United States. A fund was established to support Parry and his family while he studied music; donations were received from both countries. Parry aided his own cause by giving concerts in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio.|$|E

5|$|The tomb monument's design {{included}} {{figures of}} the three Virtues in niches, Cossa's family arms, a gilded bronze recumbent effigy laid out above an inscription-bearing sarcophagus supported on corbel brackets, and above it a Madonna <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> <b>in</b> a half-lunette, with a canopy over all. At {{the time of its}} completion, the monument was the tallest sculpture in Florence, and one of very few tombs within the Baptistry or the neighboring Duomo. The tomb monument was the first of several collaborations between Donatello and Michelozzo, and the attribution of its various elements to each of them has been debated by art historians, as have the interpretations of its design and iconography.|$|E
5|$|Crane later becomes {{suspicious}} when {{he realizes}} the diagram made by Katrina he thought summoned the Horseman is {{really one of}} protection, and also that the corpse of Lady Van Tassel has a wound {{that seems to have}} been caused post-mortem. The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, <b>and</b> <b>child,</b> <b>in</b> {{order to be able to}} claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E
5|$|On {{the left}} side of the altar are also two retablos. The larger altar, which is a twin of the altar {{opposite}} it, houses an image of a unidentified saint on the topmost level, presumably Michael the Archangel, and the crucified Christ (originally Madonna <b>and</b> <b>Child)</b> <b>in</b> the center, Saint Anthony of Padua on the middle-left, and Saint Nicholas of Tolentino on the middle-right niches. The original images on the lowest level have been replaced. The smaller retablo, also of the same style, houses the images of Saint Joseph with the child Jesus, and St Isidore the Laborer on the lower and upper level, respectively. In the sacristy is another retablo, with a crucifix in its central niche. On the doorframes of the sacristy are two bas-reliefs depicting Saint Ignatius and the first Jesuits before Mary and the child Jesus and of St. Ignatius holding a book (in stucco).|$|E

5|$|Ares– The former God of War {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of God of War. Ares captured Kratos' brother Deimos {{and had him}} imprisoned and tortured due to a misinterpreted prophecy, and later chose Kratos as his champion during a successful wager with other Olympian Gods in the God of War comic series. Early on, Ares wanted to overthrow Zeus and entered into an alliance with the Furies to help him do so. Years later, as he deemed his own son Orkos unworthy, Ares saw an opportunity to create a warrior to help him. During a battle, Kratos called on the God of War, and pledged his life in servitude if Ares spared him from his foes and provided the power to destroy them. Ares granted Kratos' wish and empowered his new servant with the Blades of Chaos. A victorious Kratos eventually renounced his servitude to Ares when the god tricked Kratos into accidentally killing his own wife <b>and</b> <b>child.</b> <b>In</b> God of War, while Ares waged war on the city of Athens, Kratos was tasked by Athena to find Pandora's Box, an artifact capable of destroying Ares. Ultimately successful, Kratos ascended to Mount Olympus and replaced Ares as the new God of War. In Ascensions multiplayer mode, Ares {{is one of the}} four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to. The character was voiced by Steven Blum in God of War, Ghost of Sparta, and Ascension. Fred Tatasciore provided Ares' voice in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Suvorov {{announced}} {{the capture of}} Ismail in 1791 to the Tsarina Catherine in a doggerel couplet, after the assault had been pressed from house to house, room to room, and nearly every Muslim man, woman, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>in</b> the city {{had been killed in}} three days of uncontrolled massacre, 40,000 Turks dead, a few hundred taken into captivity.

25|$|Christian tradition, {{starting}} from the 8th century, states {{that he was the}} first icon painter. He is said to have painted pictures of the Virgin Mary <b>and</b> <b>Child,</b> <b>in</b> particular the Hodegetria image in Constantinople (now lost). Starting from the 11th century a number of painted images were venerated as his autograph works, including for example, the Black Madonna of Częstochowa and Our Lady of Vladimir. He was also said to have painted Saints Peter and Paul, and to have illustrated a gospel book with a full cycle of miniatures.|$|E
25|$|Many {{works by}} van Heemskerck survive. Adam and Eve and St. Luke {{painting}} the Likeness of the Virgin <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> <b>in</b> {{presence of a}} poet crowned with ivy leaves, and a parrot in a cage – an altar-piece in the gallery of Haarlem, and the Ecce Homo in the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent, are characteristic works of the period preceding van Heemskerck's visit to Italy. An altar-piece executed for the St. Laurence Church of Alkmaar in 1539–1543, composed {{of at least a}} dozen large panels, which including portraits of historical figures, preserved in Linköping Cathedral, Sweden since the Reformation, shows his style after his return from Italy.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} of {{the victims}} of World War II with the names of victims is situated in a new park. The tables on deportation in 1947 are on the statue of Mother <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> <b>in</b> the park of the Health Center. On the wall next to the entrance gate to the former cemetery there is a diploma by the sculptor Klára Pataki. The statue of a girl with a bucket situated {{in the area of the}} Slovak Primary School is the work of the sculptor J. V. Huck. The houses made from extruded bricks with a walled gable under the thatched roof date back to 19th century. Several of these houses have been preserved today.|$|E

25|$|On {{the day of}} the bombing, {{they drove}} the car across the Irish border and at about 14:19 parked the vehicle outside S.D. Kells' clothes shop in Omagh's Lower Market Street, on the {{southern}} side of the town centre, near the crossroads with Dublin Road. They could not find a parking space near the intended target, the Omagh courthouse. The car had arrived from an easterly direction. The two male occupants then armed the bomb and upon exiting the car, walked east down Market Street towards Campsie Road. Two Spanish tourists stopped beside the car, and were photographed. The photographer died in the bombing, but the man <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>in</b> the photograph survived.|$|E
25|$|One {{well-known}} {{example of}} this process is Kane's painting Flathead woman <b>and</b> <b>child,</b> <b>in</b> which he combined a sketch of a Chinookan baby having its head flattened by being strapped to a cradle board with a later field portrait of a Cowlitz woman living in a different region. Another example of how Kane elaborated his sketches can be seen in his painting Indian encampment on Lake Huron, which is based on a sketch taken in summer 1845 during his first trip to Sault Ste. Marie. The painting has a distinct romantic flair accentuated by the lighting and the dramatic clouds, while the scene of the camp life depicted is reminiscent of a European idealized rural peasant scene.|$|E
