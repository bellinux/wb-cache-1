5000|$|These {{financial}} {{products have}} been criticized on various grounds, including inflated prices for tax preparation, <b>account</b> <b>fees,</b> RAL interest rates, {{as well as the}} practice of third-party debt collection (this used to be called [...] "cross-collection" [...] which hinted at the practice, but tax prep companies now to seem more vaguely refer to the practice merely as [...] "previous debt"). [...] This practice occurs when one RAL- or RAC-issuing bank collects for another. That is, such lenders may take all or part of a client's current year tax refund for purposes of third-party debt collection, and it is unclear how broad are the types of debts for which the banks collect. [...] This contrasts with the more limited types of debt collected for by the IRS. This practice of one bank collecting debt for another may not be adequately disclosed to the tax preparation client; on the other hand, some clients may fail to disclose obligations that result a governmental seizure of their refunds. [...] With both RALs and RACs, the client grants the bank first rights to their tax refund, and both carry the same risk of third-party bank collection.|$|E

40|$|We {{test whether}} firms use {{incompatibility}} strategically, {{using data from}} ATM markets. High ATM fees degrade the value of competitors ’ deposit accounts, and can in principle serve as a mechanism for siphoning depositors away from competitors or for creating deposit account differentiation. Our empirical framework can empirically distinguish surcharging motivated by this strategic concern from surcharging that simply maximizes ATM profit considered as a standalone operation. The {{results are consistent with}} such behavior by large banks, but not by small banks. For large banks, the effect of incompatibility seems to operate through higher deposit <b>account</b> <b>fees</b> rather than increased deposit account base...|$|E

Surcharging raises the price (foreign fee plus surcharge) of a withdrawal above the joint profit-maximizing level. Banks with more depositors earn less revenue from surcharging and would prefer a no-surcharging agreement, but nonbanks would always surcharge. The effects of depositor lock-in are contrasted with the strategic use of surcharges to attract depositors...|$|E
