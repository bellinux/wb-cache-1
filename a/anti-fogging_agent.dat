50|$|One {{method to}} prevent fogging {{is to apply}} a thin film of detergent, but this method is criticized because {{detergents}} {{are designed to be}} water-soluble and they cause smearing. Divers often use saliva, which is a commonly known and effective <b>anti-fogging</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Valsalva device {{has also}} been used for other purposes. On 25 May 2011, NASA {{reported}} that during the second spacewalk of Space Shuttle mission STS-134, Feustel was able to clear tears from his eye by wiggling down far enough in his Extravehicular Mobility Unit to make use the Valsalva device in his suit as a sponge to clear up tears caused because <b>anti-fogging</b> <b>agent</b> (liquid soap) came free {{from the inside of}} the helmet and floated into his eye.|$|E
40|$|Background The {{essential}} {{factor for}} {{diagnosis and treatment}} of diseases in head and neck endoscopy is the visibility of the image. An <b>anti-fogging</b> <b>agent</b> can reduce this problem by minimizing surface tension to prevent the condensation of water in the form of small droplets on a surface. There is no report on the use of hibiscrub 速 or baby shampoo to reduce fogging in the literature. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy between commercial <b>anti-fogging</b> <b>agent,</b> hibiscrub 速 and baby shampoo to reduce fogging for the use in head and neck endoscopy. Methods The study was conducted at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University in August 2010. Commercial <b>anti-fogging</b> <b>agent,</b> baby shampoo and hibiscrub 速 were applied on rigid endoscope lens before putting them into a mist generator. The images were taken at baseline, 15 seconds, 30 seconds and 1 minute. The images' identifiers were removed before they were sent to two evaluators. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to rate the image quality from 0 to 10. Results The difference in mean VAS score between <b>anti-fogging</b> <b>agent,</b> baby shampoo and hibiscrub 速 versus no agent were 5. 46, 4. 45 and 2. 1 respectively. The commercial <b>anti-fogging</b> <b>agent</b> and baby shampoo had most protective benefit and performed significantly better than no agent (P < 0. 05). Conclusions Baby shampoo is an effective agent to prevent fogging during head and neck endoscopy and compares favourably with commercial <b>anti-fogging</b> <b>agent...</b>|$|E
50|$|Anti-fog agents, {{also known}} as <b>anti-fogging</b> <b>agents</b> and treatments, are {{chemicals}} that prevent the condensation {{of water in the}} form of small droplets on a surface which resemble fog. Anti-fog treatments were first developed by NASA during Project Gemini, and are now often used on transparent glass or plastic surfaces used in optical applications, such as the lenses and mirrors found in glasses, goggles, camera lenses, and binoculars. The treatments work by minimizing surface tension, resulting in a non-scattering film of water instead of single droplets. This works by altering the degree of wetting. Anti-fog treatments usually work either by application of a surfactant film, or by creating a hydrophilic surface.|$|R
