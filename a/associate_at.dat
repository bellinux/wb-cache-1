50|$|The {{discovery}} of 2,4-D {{as well as}} the similar hormone herbicides 2,4,5-T, and MCPA occurred during WWII and was a case of multiple discovery by four groups working independently under wartime secrecy in the United Kingdom and the United States: William G. Templeman and <b>associates</b> <b>at</b> Imperial Chemical Industries in the UK; Philip S. Nutman and <b>associates</b> <b>at</b> Rothamsted Research in the UK; Franklin D. Jones and <b>associates</b> <b>at</b> the American Chemical Paint Company; and Ezra Kraus, John W. Mitchell, and <b>associates</b> <b>at</b> the University of Chicago and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. All four groups were subject to wartime secrecy laws and did not follow the usual procedures of publication and patent disclosure. The first scientific publications about these herbicides were by other workers who were not the original discovers, so the exact order of discovery is a matter of some debate.|$|R

5|$|Before the Suez Canal {{was opened}} in 1869, the Indonesian {{archipelago}} was reached via the Sunda Strait from Africa. From the Suez Canal, {{the route to}} Indonesia is shorter via the Malacca Strait. Due to its natural harbour with relatively deep and well sheltered water, the Dutch East Indies government decided to open Sabang as a quay. In 1883, Sabang quay was opened for ships to dock by the Atjeh <b>Associate.</b> <b>At</b> first, the harbour {{was intended as a}} coal station for the Dutch navy, but later also served merchant vessels and for the transfer of export goods from northern Sumatra.|$|E

Questioned during the campaign about her {{work on behalf of}} Philip Morris, Gillibrand stated that she had voted in favor of all three anti-tobacco bills in that session of Congress. She said that she never hid her work for Philip Morris, and she added that as an <b>associate</b> <b>at</b> her law firm, she had had no control over which clients she worked for. The New York Times, reporting on this issue, said that Davis Polk's official policy was that associates were allowed to withdraw from representing clients about whom they had moral qualms.|$|E

5|$|The Miller House is a Mid-Century modern home {{designed}} by Eero Saarinen and located in Columbus, Indiana. The residence {{was commissioned by}} American industrialist, philanthropist, and architecture patron J. Irwin Miller and his wife Xenia Simons Miller in 1953. Design and construction on the Miller House took four years and was completed in 1957. The home was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2000. In 2009, the home and gardens, along {{with many of the}} original furnishings, were donated to the Indianapolis Museum of Art by the Miller family.

5|$|Because of Peter's {{imprisonment}} Alicia, {{a lawyer}} herself, is {{working as a}} junior <b>associate</b> <b>at</b> a law firm. Alicia serves as second chair for senior partner Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) in a murder trial. Their client, Brad Broussard (Tom Degnan), is charged with shooting Miles Wagner. Wagner was an unpopular mutual fund manager who defrauded Broussard and many other out of their life savings by assisting in Bernard Madoff's investment scandal. Broussard was found covered in blood next to Wagner's body, but insists on his innocence. Diane consults ballistics expert Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole), a mustachioed country man with a strict principle {{that he will not}} work if the client is guilty. Kurt testifies that Wagner was shot inside a car despite being found on the floor. Wagner's partner, Martin Knox (Kevin O'Rourke), had a strong financial motive to kill Wagner. Knox's wife, Rachel (Geraldine Hughes), strongly dislikes her husband and is willing to implicate him, but is bound by spousal privilege laws. Alicia discovers a conspiracy tactic that will allow Rachel to testify, and Broussard is vindicated and set free. The firm's investigator Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi) visits FBI agent Lana Delaney (Jill Flint) inquiring about the investigation into Peter. Delaney asks Kalinda to feed her information about Peter, but Kalinda declines.|$|E
5|$|Charlesworth's {{control of}} air {{operations}} during the North-Western Area Campaign {{led to his}} appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire {{following the end of}} World WarII. Retaining his wartime rank, he took charge of the newly formed School of Land/Air Warfare from 1947 until 1949, when he assumed command of RAAF Station Williamtown, New South Wales. He was posted to Japan later that year as Chief of Staff, British Commonwealth Occupation Force, and organised support for RAAF units involved in the Korean War. Returning to Australia in 1951, he was raised to acting air vice marshal and became AOC Southern Area. Charlesworth's final appointment before retiring from the Air Force was commanding RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, in 1954–55. After leaving the military he served as Director of Recruiting in the late 1950s, and later as a judge's <b>associate</b> <b>at</b> the Supreme Court of Victoria. He died at his home in Glen Iris, Victoria, in 1978.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{they moved}} to St. Louis, Missouri, as Washington University offered both Carl and Gerty positions, {{although}} Gerty's rank and salary were much lower than her husband's. Despite her research background, Gerty was only offered a position as a research <b>associate</b> <b>at</b> a salary one tenth of that received by her husband; she was warned that she might harm her husband's career. Washington University's Chancellor, Arthur Holley Compton made a special allowance for Gerty {{to hold a position}} there, going against the university's nepotism rules. Gerty had to wait thirteen years before she attained the same rank as her husband. In 1943, she was made an associate professor of Research Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology. Months before she won the Nobel Prize, she was promoted to full professor, a post she held until her death in 1957.|$|E

Assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at several group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date. They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992. The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born on July 4, 1998, followed by a second daughter, Natasha ("Sasha"), on June 10, 2001. The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School. The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, {{was a gift from}} Senator Ted Kennedy. In August 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.|$|E

Following Clinton's inauguration, Mathews, with Robert Rubin, helped set up the National Economic Council (NEC). She served as Staff Director of the NEC from 1993 to 1995. While Mathews was at NEC, the White House pushed for healthcare reform. Mathews was among those in the administration who advocated for finding ways, apart from legislation, to curb healthcare costs. When Rubin became Secretary of the Treasury in 1995, Mathews became his Chief of Staff. She testified before a Senate Committee during the Whitewater investigations regarding her search of Vince Foster's garbage {{and the fate of}} the documents she discovered. Mathews told the committee she had been looking for an indication as to why Foster had committed suicide and denied ordering any documents destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Obama entered Harvard Law School in {{the fall}} of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts. He was {{selected}} as an editor of the Harvard Law Review {{at the end of his}} first year, president of the journal in his second year, and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years. During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as an <b>associate</b> <b>at</b> the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990. After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago. Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.|$|E
