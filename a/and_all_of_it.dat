25|$|Compared {{with the}} future devastating Boeing B-29 Superfortress attacks against Japan, the Doolittle raid did little {{material}} damage, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was easily repaired. Preliminary reports stated 12 were killed and more than 100 were wounded. Eight primary and five secondary targets were struck. In Tokyo, the targets included an oil tank farm, a steel mill, and several power plants. In Yokosuka, at least one bomb from the B-25 piloted by 1st Lt. Edgar E. McElroy struck the nearly completed light carrier , delaying her launch until November. Six schools and an army hospital were also hit. Japanese officials reported the two aircraft whose crews were captured had struck their targets.|$|E
25|$|Most of Paolo's {{music was}} {{published}} in modern editions in the 1970s, making it easily available, {{and as a result}} he has received more than the usual amount of critical attention. His music had both progressive and conservative aspects. While most of his surviving music is secular, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> vocal, two sacred compositions (a Benedicamus Domino for two voices, and a Gaudeamus omnes in Domino for three) have also survived. How much is lost is impossible to guess, but the 14th century saw an explosion of interest in notated secular music in Italy, and the proportional survival of his secular to sacred work may well represent the actual trend.|$|E
25|$|By 1790, a {{rough track}} {{had been built}} between the colony's two {{settlements}} at Sydney Cove and Parramatta. This route later became the main artery of the expanding Greater Sydney and, as the northern boundary {{of what is now}} Ashfield, dictated early British settlement in the area. The first land grant in the area was made to Rev Richard Johnson in 1793 <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> had been granted by 1810. By the 1820s, all the grants had been amalgamated into two large estates: Ashfield Park (the northern half between Liverpool Rd and Parramatta Rd) and Canterbury Estate (the area south of Liverpool Rd). Ashfield Park was named by Robert Campbell, whose father was the laird of Ashfield in Scotland.|$|E

25|$|Sakha can {{be divided}} into three great {{vegetation}} belts. About 40% of Sakha lies above the Arctic circle <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is covered by permafrost which greatly influences the region's ecology and limits forests in the southern region. Arctic and subarctic tundra define the middle region, where lichen and moss grow as great green carpets and are favorite pastures for reindeer. In {{the southern part of the}} tundra belt, scattered stands of dwarf Siberian pine and larch grow along the rivers. Below the tundra is the vast taiga forest region. Larch trees dominate in the north and stands of fir and pine begin to appear in the south. Taiga forests cover about 47% of Sakha and almost 90% of the cover is larch.|$|E
25|$|Burnt Fen {{is located}} near the eastern borders of Cambridgeshire, {{although}} parts of it are also located in Suffolk and Norfolk. It {{is an area of}} prime agricultural land, which is mostly below sea level, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is below the normal flood levels of the rivers which surround it on three sides. These comprise the River Great Ouse (or Ten Mile River) on the north western edge, the River Little Ouse (or Brandon Creek) on the north eastern edge and the River Lark on the south western edge. The area is crossed by the A1101 Littleport to Mildenhall road, which runs broadly north west to south east, and the Ely to Norwich Railway, which runs from east to west. There are four hamlets within this area, Little Ouse, Shippea Hill, Sedge Fen and Mile End. Shippea Hill railway station was called Burnt Fen between 1885 and 1904.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Orr of The Atlantic called Fargo [...] "smart, thrilling, imaginative television, in {{addition}} to being wicked funny", in which Hawley assumes greater narrative dimension and assurance in his vision. Matthew Gilbert from The Boston Globe identified the dialog, acting, cinematography, music, set design and directing as its most satisfying attributes. So too did The Hollywood Reporter Tim Goodman, who believed that said qualities [...] "make a very riveting and entertaining dark comedy spectacle". Neil Genzlinger, writing for The New York Times, said that Fargo marries deadpan humor, violence, and [...] "observational oddity" [...] in a way unmatched by similar dramas. In his review for Variety, Brian Lowry believed that despite the show's brisk pace, Hawley nonetheless adds depth to his story. Dan Jardine of Slant Magazine agreed and thought that the narrative complexity is what distinguishes season two from Fargo freshman season. Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield felt that Fargo painted [...] "a fascinating portrait of America at the crossroads". Alan Sepinwall said in his review for HitFix that the series captures its namesake film's most redeeming qualities while assuming a distinct identity, and The A.V. Club website felt that the series was [...] "the rare cable drama that forgoes attenuated storytelling and moral ambiguity, and instead delivers episode after episode where a lot happens, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> matters".|$|E

[...] For the 1936 film version of Show Boat, Kern and Hammerstein wrote three new songs, including [...] "I Have The Room Above Her" [...] and [...] "Ah Still Suits Me". [...] High, Wide, and Handsome (1937) was intentionally similar in plot and style to Show Boat, but it was a box-office failure. [...] Kern songs were also used in the Cary Grant film, When You're in Love (1937), and the first Abbott and Costello feature, One Night in the Tropics (1940). [...] In 1940, Hammerstein wrote the lyric [...] "The Last Time I Saw Paris", in homage to the French capital, recently occupied by the Germans. [...] Kern set it, the only time he set a pre-written lyric, and his only hit song not written as part of a musical. Originally a hit for Tony Martin and later for NoÃ«l Coward, the song was used in the film Lady Be Good (1941) and won Kern another Oscar for best song.
