25|$|I deem it {{important}} to direct your attention to Article 2 of the Constitutional Amendments of the United States—'the {{right of the people}} to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.' This you should comply with immediately. Every (local) union should have a rifle club. I strongly <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> provide every member with the latest improved rifle, which can be obtained from the factory at a nominal price. I entreat you to take action on this important question, so that in two years we can hear the inspiring music of the martial tread of 25,000 armed men in the ranks of labor.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid bloodshed“, I <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> spare your {{soldiers}} not force us to fight, {{and go back to}} where you bad and evil strangers were and leave us alone: we will resolutely and fiercely defend this place and fight you to death for the land of our ancestors and for the welfare of our future generations. Have pity on people and cease to destroy them: we did not give life to anyone nor do {{we have the right to}} take it away from others: but because you shall not send your soldiers to a certain death, since we are not to surrender the fortress without a fierce and bitter resistance.|$|E
500|$|O'Brien {{claimed that}} all of the {{evidence}} given against him was false, and that as an American citizen he ought not to be facing trial in a UK court. He then went on at length to condemn the British government, the [...] "imbecile and tyrannical rulers" [...] of Ireland, until he was interrupted by the judge, who appealed to him to cease his remarks: [...] "The only effect of your observations must be to tell against you with those who have to consider the sentence. I <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> say nothing more of that sort. I do so entirely for your own sake." ...|$|E

[...] "You think it over now, March. You talk it over with Mrs. March; I know you will, anyway; and I might as well make a virtue of <b>advising</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do it.

500|$|The Boultons {{had three}} daughters {{in the early}} 1750s, but all died in infancy. [...] Mary Boulton's health deteriorated, and she died in August 1759. Not long after her death Boulton began to woo her sister Anne. [...] Marriage with a {{deceased}} wife's sister was forbidden by ecclesiastical law, though permitted by common law. Nonetheless, they married on 25 June 1760 at St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. [...] Eric Delieb, who wrote a book on Boulton's silver, with a biographical sketch, suggests that the marriage celebrant, Rev. James Penfold, an impoverished curate, was probably bribed. [...] Boulton later advised another man who was seeking to wed his late wife's sister: [...] "I <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> say nothing of your intentions but to go quickly and snugly to Scotland or some obscure corner of London, suppose Wapping, and there take lodgings to make yourself a parishioner. [...] When the month is expired and the Law fulfilled, live and be happy... I recommend silence, secrecy, and Scotland." ...|$|E

2500|$|Negroes made up {{half the}} population. Their Governor, Fielding Wright, told them: [...] "If any of you have become so deluded as to want to enter our white schools, patronize our hotels and cafes, enjoy social {{equality}} with the whites, then true kindness and sympathy requires me to <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> make your homes in some other state." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 30 April 2008, Ali Khamenei backed President Ahmadinejad's {{economic}} policy {{and said the}} West was struggling with more economic difficulties than Iran, with a [...] "crisis" [...] spreading from the United States to Europe, and inflation was a widespread problem. The Iranian leader said that the ongoing economic crisis which has crippled {{the world has been}} unprecedented in the past 60 years. [...] "This crisis has forced the UN to declare state of emergency for food shortages around the globe but foreign radios have focused on Iran to imply that the current price hikes and inflation in the country are the results of carelessness on the part of Iranian officials which of course is not true", he said. Khamenei emphasized that no one has the right to blame the Iranian government for Iran's economic problems. He also advised people and the government to be content and avoid waste in order to solve economic problems. [...] "I <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> keep in your mind that this great nation is never afraid of economic sanctions", he added.|$|E
2500|$|In The Journal of the American Medical Association, [...] Zimbardo's {{situational}} perspective received {{support from}} other social situational experiments that demonstrated {{the same idea}} and concept. Almost ten {{years prior to the}} Stanford Prison Experiment (1971), Stanley Milgram conducted research on obedient behavior in 1965 that embraced situational forces. Milgram had [...] "teachers" [...] that delivered mock electric shocks to the [...] "learner" [...] for every wrong answer that was given in a multiple choice test. The teachers, however, did not know that the electric shocks were not real, and still delivered them to the learners. At the end of the experiment, 65% of men ages 20–50 complied fully up to the very last voltage. In the same room as the teacher, there was a [...] "confederate" [...] that kept tabs on the teacher and if they were delivering the shocks to each wrong answer. In the beginning of the study, participants signed a waiver that clearly explained the ability to opt out of the experiment and not deliver the shocks. But with the surprising result rate of teachers who did continue to shock the learners, there was a situational force. The situational force that influenced the teachers to continue was the voice of the confederate egging them on by phrases such as, [...] "I <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> continue with this experiment" [...] or [...] "I am telling you to continue delivering the shocks" [...] and the one that caught most teachers was [...] "You must continue with the shocks." [...] Although the teachers knew that they could leave the experiment at any point in time, they still continued when they felt uncomfortable because of the confederate's voice demanding they proceed.|$|E
