40|$|International audienceAn {{integrated}} {{solution for}} the development of multilayer <b>antenna</b> <b>modules</b> for fifth-generation (5 G) communications, based on low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC), is presented. The design exploits the 3 -D integration capabilities of the LTCC process, enabling the realization of a full-corporate feed network (CFN) in vertical configuration. A novel implementation of the CFN employing dielectric-embedded parallel plate waveguides (PPWs) is proposed. The PPW lines are delimited by via-rows. As opposed to standard substrate-integrated waveguide feed networks, guided fields are orthogonal to the via-rows and propagate along the vertical axis of the structure. The CFN feeds four long slots, without any coupling structure, and provides broadband operation. The final prototype comprises 18 LTCC tapes, with a total thickness of 3. 4 mm. The measured - 10 -dB impedance bandwidth spans from 51. 2 to 66 GHz (> 25. 2 %). The module generates a fixed broadside beam, but multibeam operation in H-plane can be easily achieved. In the 50 - 66 -GHz band, the peak gain is 14. 25 dBi and the average first side-lobe level in H-plane is - 20. 6 dB.
