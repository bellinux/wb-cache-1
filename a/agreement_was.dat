40|$|Abstract. We {{identify}} the inefficiencies that arise when negotiation between two parties {{takes place in}} the presence of transaction costs. First, for some values of these costs it is efficient to reach an agreement but the unique equilibrium outcome is one in which <b>agreement</b> <b>is</b> never reached. Secondly, even when there are equilibria in which an <b>agreement</b> <b>is</b> reached, we find that the model always has an equilibrium in which <b>agreement</b> <b>is</b> never reached, as well as equilibria in which <b>agreement</b> <b>is</b> delayed for an arbitrary length of time. Finally, the only way in which the parties can reach an <b>agreement</b> in equilib-rium <b>is</b> by using inefficient punishments for (some of) the opponent’s deviations. We argue that this implies that, when the parties are given the opportunity to renegotiate out of these inefficiencies, the only equilibrium outcome which survives is the one in which <b>agreement</b> <b>is</b> never reached, regardless {{of the value of the}} transaction costs...|$|R
