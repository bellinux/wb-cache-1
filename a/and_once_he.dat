5|$|A mutant {{criminal}} {{recruited by}} the Brotherhood in a prison truck, Juggernaut is incredibly strong, fast <b>and,</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> gains momentum, he is nearly unstoppable. The film's version of Juggernaut is depicted as a mutant and his relation to Charles Xavier was never mentioned. Matthew Vaughn cast Jones, who he met producing the Guy Ritchie gangster movies where Jones begun his acting career. The actor {{had to go through}} a four-hour make-up process to portray Juggernaut, which included a muscle suit and a prostethic chin. The costume tried to retain the bullet-shaped helmet of the comics without going excessively over the top.|$|E
5|$|Florence Harding became deeply {{involved}} in her husband's career, both at the Star <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> entered politics. Exhibiting her father's determination and business sense, she helped turn the Star into a profitable enterprise through her tight management of the paper's circulation department. She has been credited with helping Harding achieve more than he might have alone; {{some have suggested that}} she pushed him {{all the way to the}} White House.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Pullin married Alice Ramsden. The {{couple had}} four sons. He {{did not have}} many friends, {{but he was very}} close to the ones he had. His early {{association}} with churches, through his father, gave him an interest in ecclesiastical music; he often played the harmonium to entertain himself and his family. He had strong views on organ music, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> had formed an opinion he rarely changed his mind.|$|E

5|$|An injury {{sustained}} on 25 August 1990 kept Gibbs out for two months, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> had regained full fitness, {{his team}} were {{bottom of the}} table. His return coincided with a winless run of seven league matches, leaving Watford seven points from safety with nearly half the season gone. Nonetheless, Watford managed to climb to 20th place, and despite missing 14 games, Gibbs was once again shortlisted for the club's end of season award. In 1991–92 Gibbs finally became Player of the Season. Missing only three matches, he rounded off a good season by scoring his first goal in four years in Watford's last league game, cementing a top-ten finish in the Second Division.|$|E
5|$|Intended to be Galveston follow-up, Pizzolatto felt True Detective {{was more}} {{suitable}} on-screen once the project took definite form. Pizzolatto shopped the novel to two TV executives, <b>and,</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> secured {{a deal in}} May 2010, drafted six screenplays, including the pilot episode script for True Detective, which ran 90 pages. He devoted another script for the series shortly after his departure from The Killings writing staff in 2011, thanks to the support of Anonymous Content. The final copy, amounting to 500 pages, was written {{without the aid of}} a writing staff. By this time, Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO, and by April 2012, the network commissioned True Detective on an order of eight episodes. Set up as an anthology series, each season will feature a different cast of characters and self-contained narratives in various time periods and locations.|$|E
5|$|Drought {{conditions}} between 1175 and 1180 {{prompted the}} Crusaders {{to sign a}} two-year truce with the Muslims, but without Tripoli included in the terms. During the 1180s, raids by Christians and Muslims into each other's territory became more frequent. In 1180, Saladin ventured into the County of Tripoli, ravaging the area. Unwilling to meet him in open battle, the Crusaders retreated to the relative safety of their fortifications. Without capturing the castles, Saladin could not secure control of the area, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> retreated the Hospitallers were able to revitalize their damaged lands. The Battle of Hattin in 1187 was a disastrous defeat for the Crusaders: Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, was captured, as was the True Cross, a relic discovered during the First Crusade. Afterwards Saladin ordered {{the execution of the}} captured Templar and Hospitaller knights, such was the importance of the two orders in defending the Crusader states. After the battle, the Hospitaller castles of Belmont, Belvoir, and Bethgibelin fell to Muslim armies. Following these losses, the Order focused its attention on its castles in Tripoli. In May 1188 Saladin led an army to attack Krak des Chevaliers, but on seeing the castle decided it was too well defended and instead marched on the Hospitaller castle of Margat, which he also failed to capture.|$|E

25|$|England's {{reply was}} subdued in {{comparison}} with the jubilant scenes they had just witnessed. Stewart and Ramprakash both got starts, but fell to Kenny Benjamin before they could progress. Atherton and Smith provided the English fans with a partnership of their own to celebrate, adding 303 for the third wicket in just short of seven hours. Smith (175) was the dominant partner, striking 16 fours and three sixes, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> was out a flurry of wickets fell, the tourists going from 372/2 to 417/6, Atherton finally being dismissed after nine hours for a dogged 135. Russell (62) and Lewis (75*) added a century partnership as well, bringing England level with the West Indies total.|$|E
25|$|Post {{punishment}} {{would become}} the symbol of this detention. The principle was simple: the prisoner was attached to a post, a tree or against a wall, hands behind his back, and had to remain in this position, which prevented him from moving, for {{a certain amount of}} time, without eating or drinking. Several variations on this punishment were invented, such as one where the prisoner was raised onto bricks while being attached <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> was solidly attached, the bricks were removed, rendering the punishment even more painful. The Hague Convention specified that “Prisoners of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations, and orders in force in the army of the State in whose power they are. Any act of insubordination justifies the adoption towards them of such measures of severity as may be considered necessary”. Post punishment was applied in the German Army until its abolition on 18 May 1917; for prisoners, abolition came at the end of 1916 after a complaint by France.|$|E

25|$|Foote edited The Pica, {{the student}} {{newspaper}} of Greenville High School, and frequently used {{the paper to}} lampoon the school's principal. In 1935, Foote applied to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, hoping to join with the older Percy boys, but was denied admission because of an unfavorable recommendation from his high school principal. He presented himself for admission anyway, and as result of a battery of admissions tests, he was accepted. In 1936 he was initiated in the Alpha Delta chapter of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Interested more {{in the process of}} learning than in earning a degree, Foote was not a model student. He often skipped class to explore the library, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> even spent the night among the shelves. He also began contributing pieces of fiction to Carolina Magazine, UNC's award-winning literary journal. Foote returned to Greenville in 1937, where he worked in construction and for a local newspaper, The Delta Democrat Times. Around this time, he began to work on his first novel.|$|E
25|$|Liberia's former {{president}} Charles Taylor was indicted as a diamond-embezzling warlord who aided and abetted African rebels who committed heinous atrocities against millions of African people. After seizing power from President Samuel Doe by a rebellion, Taylor won elections in 1997. His {{critics say that}} he bullied and bought his way to power, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> obtained it he established himself {{as one of the}} most brutal and murderous warlords in Africa. During his term of office Taylor was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity as a result of his involvement in the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991–2002). His close friends included the late Col. Muammar Gaddafi of Libya; the conservative former ruler of Ivory Coast, Felix Houphouet-Boigny; the President of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore; and a plethora of businessmen, local and foreign, who were bent on making money in Liberia and disregarded UN disapproval. Taylor was detained by the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone in 2006 after a period of enforced exile in Nigeria. He was found guilty in April 2012 of all 11 charges levied by the Special Court, including terror, murder and rape. In May 2012 he was sentenced to 50 years in prison.|$|E
25|$|Animosity {{between the}} Watts and Mitchell {{families}} escalates. Sam {{is left in}} charge of the Mitchell empire when her brother, Phil, goes on the run after escaping prison for an armed robbery — for which he has been set up for by Den. Sam persuades her cousin Billy (Perry Fenwick) to torch Phil's snooker club in an insurance scam, an act that results in Den's club burning down and his daughter Vicki (Scarlett Johnson) nearly perishing in the fire. Dennis vows revenge and he is only warned off when gangster Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) begins a relationship with Sam. Andy marries Sam in September 2004, despite Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi)'s attempt to stop the event — he has fallen in love with Sam and knows Andy is using her to gain control of the Mitchell assets. Andy fools Sam into signing over control of Phil's house, and she is then conned out of all the Mitchell businesses by family lawyer Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett) and Den. Marcus tells Sam that Phil wants her to sell everything and give the cash to him. She does so, selling her mother's pub, The Vic, for a vastly reduced price to Den. Marcus is lying, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> has the Mitchells' money, he flees, leaving Sam with nothing. Andy, realising Sam is no use to him, throws her out of their house, leaving her penniless.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{acknowledged}} {{the influence of}} other pianists, Flanagan stated that, [...] "I like to play like a horn player, like I'm blowing into the piano.

[...] In concerts, Flanagan typically played a range of composers' works <b>and,</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> had become established as a small-group leader, he often played songs by Tadd Dameron, Duke Ellington, Benny Golson, Thad Jones, Tom McIntosh, and Thelonious Monk.|$|E

They are two very different things. It's not that he's intrinsically racist or homophobic or sexist, he just doesn't have a frame of reference. He's not capable of understanding. <b>And</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> does glean some understanding he misinterprets it into something altogether. But I think at least the way I feel about the character is he's a decent heart, a decent person and he's just trying his best." ...|$|E
