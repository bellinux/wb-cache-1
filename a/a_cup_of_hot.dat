5|$|Tremo gained Poniatowski's trust as {{the cook}} able to satisfy both his palate and his dietary requirements. The teetotal king {{suffered}} from gastric ailments {{from an early}} age. He usually started his day with <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate or bouillon. His favourite dish was roast or stewed mutton, which he washed down with spring water. Tremo often consulted royal menus with the court physician and occasionally prepared separate dishes specifically for the king to accommodate his sensitive stomach. Tomatoes, for example, were considered detrimental to the monarch's health and were never used in Tremo's recipes.|$|E
5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer {{than any of his}} English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|Detective J.D. LaRue (Kiel Martin) {{attempts}} to woo Davenport using {{less and less}} ethical means, eventually calling {{her back to the}} precinct to pick up her lost client even though he was never found. When she realizes his ruse, she pours <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee in his lap. Undercover officer Belker (Bruce Weitz) arrests a bald-headed pickpocket at the hostage situation and processes him at the precinct. Belker's proclivity for biting the ankles of perpetrators redeems itself in this episode. Desk Sergeant Phil Esterhaus (Michael Conrad) confides in Fay about his teen-age sweetheart, Cindy. When officers Hill (Michael Warren) and Renko (Charles Haid) respond to a domestic situation, their police car is stolen, and they are shot after walking into a rundown building while trying to find a phone to call in the theft.|$|E

50|$|Another genitive-like construction, the quantitative, {{is used to}} {{describe}} quantities of objects: אַ פֿול גלאָז הייסע טיי a ful gloz heyse tey (<b>a</b> full <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> tea); אַ גרופּע יונגע מענטשן a grupe yunge mentshn (a group of young people).

5|$|Reluctant to give Rupert back to Stewie, Stanford Cordray (the buyer, {{voiced by}} Rob Lowe) {{and his family}} {{organize}} a skiing race down the mountain, so if Stewie is the first down, {{they are allowed to}} take Rupert away with them and if Stanford wins, he can have Brian. Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to watch his progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that maybe this means he should give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> tea on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear. The two make a run for it before the child's parents notice, then realize they still {{need to get back to}} Quahog (which, by looking at a highway sign at the end, is 2112 miles away, a reference to the Rush 1976 album), so they carjack a passing driver in the city and drive home.|$|E
25|$|In Goscinny and Uderzo's 1965 comic Asterix in Britain, Caesar has {{successfully}} conquered Britain because the Britons stop fighting every afternoon for <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> water with milk, tea not yet having {{been brought to}} Europe.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days prior}} to the execution, a letter written by Saddam {{appeared}} on the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party website. In the letter, he urged the Iraqi people to unite, and not to hate the people of countries that invaded Iraq, like the United States, but instead the decision-makers. He said {{he was ready to}} die as a martyr and he said that this is his death sentence. In the hours before the execution, Saddam ate his last meal of chicken and rice with <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> water and honey.|$|E
6000|$|The land-steward started--this {{time with}} genuine astonishment. [...] "For me!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Mademoiselle Rose has troubled herself to keep <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee <b>hot</b> for me?" [...] The old servant stared; Trudaine {{stopped and looked}} back.|$|R

500|$|Almost immediately, the Daddies emerged a {{controversial}} presence within Eugene's actively political atmosphere. Feminist groups condemned the band's performances as pornographic, accusing their band name and sexually charged lyricism as promotion of sexism and misogyny, claims which Perry boldly disputed, defending the controversial elements as misinterpreted satire. In what Eugene Weekly called [...] "the most hotly discussed {{topic in the}} local music scene" [...] and [...] "the Eugene flash point for the growing national debate on censorship [...] free speech", the Daddies endured a storm of controversy which nearly ended their burgeoning career. Vigilante protest groups habitually tore down or defaced the band's posters and led boycotts against venues that would book the group and even newspapers which gave them a positive review. The Daddies' concerts regularly became sites of organized picketing and, on one occasion, a bomb threat. The band members themselves were frequent recipients of hate mail, threats and physical harassment: once, Perry claimed, an irate protester threw <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee in {{his face as he}} was walking down the street.|$|E
500|$|Hiram B. Shaw {{had just}} {{returned}} to the beach when this casualty occurred. After supplying his small rescue boat with more rope lines, he and Edward DeCourcy removed their outer clothing and prepared to embark. The men on the Cobb, who had just witnessed Waterhouse's drowning, prompted {{the captain of the}} schooner to give an impassioned address in which he said, [...] "They have sacrificed one man in their efforts to save us; now I'll risk my life in an attempt to get ashore." [...] The captain tied a rope around his waist and jumped into the water, just as the rescue boat had set out from shore. After battling against the current and waves, he was met by Shaw's rescue boat and clung to its stern until they reached land. Making use of the captain's line, the men on shore tied a life preserver to it. One at a time, the five stranded crewmen pulled the flotation device out to the schooner, fastened it to their bodies and were pulled to safety by the people on the shore. [...] After receiving <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee, a drink of whiskey and a blanket, the Cobb's crew were taken to Coquina, Ormond Beach's area hospital.|$|E
50|$|For {{dramatic}} effect, {{the film}} presents two meetings between the queens, although they never met in life. Moreover, the film depicts Mary as enjoying <b>a</b> late-morning <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate in bed (and even requesting {{it when she}} is a prisoner) when {{this was not a}} popular drink in the British Isles until well into the 18th century.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Mary, no doctoring! <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> {{your good}} <b>hot</b> tea, {{and some of}} our good home living, is what I want. It's a {{tiresome}} business, this legislating!" ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Dick Martin had fallen, as {{the saying}} is, upon his feet. He was carried into a neatly {{furnished}} cabin, put between warm blankets in a comfortable berth, and had <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> steaming <b>hot</b> coffee urged upon him by a pleasant-voiced sailor, who, while he inquired earnestly as to how he felt, {{at the same time}} thanked the Lord fervently that they had been the means of saving his life.|$|R
2500|$|Horse Feathers (1932), {{in which}} the {{brothers}} satirized the American college system and Prohibition, was their most popular film yet, and won them the cover of Time magazine. It included a running gag from their stage work, in which Harpo produces a ludicrous array of props from inside his coat, including a wooden mallet, a fish, a coiled rope, a tie, a poster {{of a woman in}} her underwear, <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee, a sword; and, just after Groucho warns him that he [...] "can't burn the candle at both ends," [...] a candle burning at both ends.|$|E

50|$|The guests arrive {{a little}} before the {{appointed}} time and enter an interior waiting room, where they store unneeded items such as coats, and put on fresh tabi. Ideally, the waiting room has a tatami floor and an alcove (tokonoma), in which is displayed a hanging scroll which may allude to the season, {{the theme of the}} chaji, or some other appropriate theme. The guests are served <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hot</b> water, kombu tea, roasted barley tea, or sakurayu. When all the guests have arrived and finished their preparations, they proceed to the outdoor waiting bench in the roji, where they remain until summoned by the host.|$|R
60|$|The pain she was in, {{and state}} of {{exhaustion}} after the violent emotions and the rough handling she had experienced, prevented her from thinking {{much of her}} miserable forlorn condition.

By-and-by the woman came back with the change and <b>a</b> very big <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> tea.|$|R
50|$|On Christmas Eve (Noche Buena), the {{extended}} family join together for a dinner of roast turkey, and white rice seasoned with garlic. Roast potatoes and uncooked sweetened apple puree are often served as well. The main dessert is panettone. It is usually accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> thick <b>hot</b> chocolate. Less common desserts include a special marzipan made out of Brazil Nuts (due to the scarcity and expense of almonds in Peru) and assorted bowls with raisins, peanuts. At midnight, a toast is made, and good wishes and hugs are exchanged. A designated person runs to put Child Jesus in the Nativity scene. Then, the family members take their seat {{on the dining room}} while singing Christmas Carols.|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{chocolate}} first made its way to Germany, after the ladies of the upper classes in Spain, Italy and France had long been used to <b>a</b> daily <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate. When the Dutchman Coenraad Johannes van Houten managed to press out the cocoa mass, the additional ingredients cocoa butter and cocoa powder were created. The chocolate thinned with cocoa butter was used to pour a variety of figures, and painting cakes with cocoa powder became popular. The trade of the “Chocolatier”, a Konditor specialised in working with chocolate, was born. Chocolate now {{played a major role in}} the Konditorei. A good example is the chocolate cake created by Franz Sacher, who was the chocolate cook for Klemens von Metternich in Vienna in 1832.|$|R
50|$|The infuser {{is placed}} in <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> or pot <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> or boiling water, {{allowing}} the tea to brew without loose tea leaves spilling into the pot or <b>cup.</b> <b>A</b> rod or chain is commonly attached to the container of the infuser to simplify retrieval from the pot or cup. Infusers with large holes may not catch all the leaves, requiring {{the use of a}} tea strainer to remove the remaining pieces.|$|R
5000|$|Kinkade {{was also}} criticized for {{the extent to}} which he had commercialized his art, for example, by selling his prints on the QVC home {{shopping}} network. Some academics expressed concerns about the implications of Kinkade's success in relation to Western perceptions of visual art: in 2009, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "To his detractors, he represents the triumph of sub-mediocrity and the commercialization and homogenization of painting ... perhaps no other painter has been as shameless or as successful at transforming himself into a corporation as Kinkade." [...] Among these circles, he is known more today as a [...] "mall artist" [...] or a chocolate box artist than as a merited painter. Rabin went on to collectively describe Kinkade's paintings as [...] "a maudlin, sickeningly sentimental vision of a world where everything is as soothing as <b>a</b> warm <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate with marshmallows on a cold December day." ...|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Fudd {{prepares a}} steak with {{numerous}} <b>hot</b> spices and <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> boiling <b>hot</b> coffee, but sets {{it on the}} table when he realizes he forgot the bread. The lion leaves the stuffed head slot to eat the steak (unaware it is coated with hot sauce), and when he tries to wash it down with the drink, he gets even hotter and blows fire, screaming. Going back to his hiding spot, Fudd wonders what happened to his steak, but is interrupted by a phone call saying that hunting season is cancelled and that he has to take the hunting signs down. Upon hearing this, the lion leaves his stuffed head slot and runs outside. Other animals, apparently not dead, leave their slots as well. Fudd explains to the audience that he set a new record this year for quickest time that the animals ran out on him, and does his trademark laugh as the short ends.|$|R

5000|$|Carr's term as Foreign Minister {{coincided with}} {{the final stages of}} Australia's {{campaign}} for a UN Security Council seat. The campaign, initiated in 2009, placed Australia in the ballot for a seat in the [...] "Western Europe & Other" [...] category, against European nations Luxembourg and Finland. In the context of the bid, Carr supported Security Council reform including permanent membership for Japan, Brazil and India and two permanent seats for Africa. Carr credited Australia's successful campaign to promotion of Australia's diplomatic links with African nations and environmental and cultural links with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific. In October 2012 Australia was elected to the Security Council, winning an absolute majority of votes {{in the first round of}} balloting - the first time Australia had held a seat since 1985-86. Known for his fastidious eating habits, Bob Carr responded to the suggestion he would celebrate this success with champagne by saying [...] "I’ll be having, as soon as I can, <b>a</b> generous <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> water, boiling water, with a slice of lemon".|$|R
