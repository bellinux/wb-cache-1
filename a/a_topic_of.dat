5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1997 general election, polls {{suggested}} that Eurosceptic sentiment was running high in the UK, and the question of the country's ongoing membership of the EU was <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> <b>of</b> regular discussion in the media. Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times promoting Eurosceptic sentiment. Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming possibility that the country would adopt the euro currency.|$|E

5|$|It {{had been}} also conjectured that the double bond between carbons 4 and 5 of the imidazolium ring backbone, which gave {{aromatic}} character to that system, {{was important for}} the carbene's stability.

Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.|$|E

In February 1967, Tarkovsky and Alexei Romanov complained that the film was not yet approved for a wide release and refused to cut further scenes from the film. Tarkovsky's refusal resulted in Andrei Rublev not being released for years, despite being <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> <b>of</b> discussion at the top level of Mosfilm, Goskino and even during {{a meeting of the}} Central Committee of the Communist Party.|$|E
5|$|The genus {{was named}} in 1825 by English {{geologist}} Gideon Mantell, based on fossil specimens {{that are now}} assigned to Therosaurus and Mantellodon.

Together with Megalosaurus and Hylaeosaurus, {{it was one of the}} three genera originally used to define Dinosauria. The genus Iguanodon belongs to the larger group Iguanodontia, along with the duck-billed hadrosaurs.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad {{as they made their way}} further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> <b>of</b> much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E
5|$|Following Sévérine's first {{appearances}} in promotional materials for Skyfall, film critics {{noted that the}} character was {{a return to the}} classic elements of the James Bond films, specifically Bond meeting a beautiful and mysterious woman. Critics had a mixed response to Sévérine, comparing her to previous Bond girls. The response to Bond's treatment of Sévérine was largely negative; commentators panned Bond's seduction of the character after discovering that she was a sex slave, and his cold response to her death. However, some critics defended Sévérine's story arc as appropriate for Bond's character development. The character has also been <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> <b>of</b> racial criticism, receiving comparisons to previous Bond girls Aki, Kissy Suzuki, and Wai Lin.|$|E
