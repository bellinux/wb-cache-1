40|$|This paper {{develops}} a Fourier transform method with an asymptotic expansion <b>approach</b> <b>for</b> <b>option</b> pricing. The method {{is applied to}} European currency options with a libor market model of interest rates and jump-diffusion stochastic volatility models of spot exchange rates. In particular, we derive closed-form approximation formulas of the characteristic functions of log-prices of the underlying assets and the prices of currency options based on a third order asymptotic expansion scheme; we use a jump- diffusion model with a mean-reverting stochastic variance process such as in Heston [1993] / Bates [1996] and log-normal market models for domestic and foreign interest rates. Finally, the validity of our method is confirmed through numerical examples. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the {{following}} paper we provide a review {{and development of}} sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods <b>for</b> <b>option</b> pricing. SMC are a class of Monte Carlo-based algorithms, {{that are designed to}} approximate expectations w. r. t a sequence of related probability measures. These approaches have been used, successfully, for a wide class of applications in engineering, statistics, physics and operations research. SMC methods are highly suited to many option pricing problems and sensitivity/Greek calculations {{due to the nature of}} the sequential simulation. However, it is seldom the case that such ideas are explicitly used in the option pricing literature. This article provides an up-to date review of SMC methods, which are appropriate <b>for</b> <b>option</b> pricing. In addition, it is illustrated how a number of existing <b>approaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>option</b> pricing can be enhanced via SMC. Specifically, when pricing the arithmetic Asian option w. r. t a complex stochastic volatility model, it is shown that SMC methods provide additional strategies to improve estimation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop an {{efficient}} tree <b>approach</b> <b>for</b> <b>option</b> pricing when the underlying asset price follows a regime-switching model. The tree grows only linearly {{as the number}} of time steps increases. Thus it enables us to use large number of time steps to compute accurate prices for both European and American options. We present conditions that guarantee the positivity of branch probabilities. We numerically test the sensitivity of option prices to the choice of a key parameter for tree construction. As an interesting application, we develop a regime-switching model to approximate the Heston's stochastic volatility model and then employ the tree approach to approximate the option prices. Numerical results are provided and compared. Regime-switching model, recombining tree, option pricing, stochastic volatility...|$|R
40|$|Asset returns have {{traditionally}} been modeled in the literature as following continuous-time Markov processes, {{and in many cases}} diffusions. Can discretely sampled financial rate data help us decide which continuous-time models are sensible? Diffusion processes are characterized by the continuity of their sample paths. This cannot be verified from the discrete sample path: by nature, even if the underlying sample path were continuous, the discretely sampled data will always appear as a sequence of discrete jumps. Instead, this paper relies on a characterization of the transition density of the discrete data to determine whether the discontinuities observed in the discrete data are the result of the discreteness of sampling, or rather evidence of genuine jump dynamics for the underlying continuous-time process.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{commonly}} used numerical algorithms <b>for</b> <b>option</b> pricing under Levy process via Fast Fourier transform (FFT) calculations. By treating option price analogous to a probability density function, option prices {{across the whole}} spectrum of strikes can be obtained via FFT calculations. We also show how {{the property of the}} Fourier transform of a convolution product can be used to value various types of option pricing models. In particular, we show how one can price the Bermudan style options under Levy processes using FFT techniques in an efficient manner by reformulating the risk neutral valuation formulation as a convolution. By extending the finite state Markov chain approach in option pricing, we illustrate an innovative FFT-based network tree <b>approach</b> <b>for</b> <b>option</b> pricing under Levy process. Similar to the forward shooting grid technique in the usual lattice tree algorithms, the approach can be adapted to valuation of options with exotic path dependence. We also show how to apply the Fourier space time stepping techniques that solve the partial differential-integral equation <b>for</b> <b>option</b> pricing under Levy process. This versatile approach can handle various forms of path dependence of the asset price process and embedded features in the option models. Sampling errors and truncation errors in numerical implementation of the FFT calculations in option pricing are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Can {{discretely}} sampled {{financial data}} help us decide which continuous-time models are sensible? Diffusion processes {{are characterized by}} the continuity of their sample paths. This cannot be verified from the discrete sample path: Even if the underlying path were continuous, data sampled at discrete times will always appear as a succession of jumps.

I then focus on the implications of this <b>approach</b> <b>for</b> <b>option</b> pricing models. IN MANY INSTANCES IN FINANCIAL ECONOMETRICS, we make inference about a postulated continuous-time model on the basis of discretely sampled observations. Among potential continuous-time models, most specifications adopted have been diffusions, although the literature is more and more frequently allowing for jumps ~see Merton ~ 1976 !, Ahn and Thompson ~ 1988 !, Bates ~ 1991 !, Das and Foresi ~ 1996 !, Duffie, Pan, and Singleton ~ 2000 !, Aït...|$|R

Our method extends the log-transformed approach proposed by Trigeorgis [31] to several state variables and improves other known lattice algorithms (Boyle, Evnine and Gibbs [7] and Kamrad and Ritchken [19]). The method we propose is consistent, stable and efficient. We present some applications of our method both to financial and real option pricing problems...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we present a finite element <b>approach</b> <b>for</b> <b>option</b> pricing in the {{framework}} of a well-known stochastic volatility model with jumps, the Bates model. In this model the asset log-returns are assumed to follow a jump-diffusion model where the jump component consists of a Levy process of compound Poisson type, while the volatility behavior is described by a stochastic differential equation of CIR type, with a mean-reverting drift term and a diffusion component correlated with that of the log-returns. Like in all the Levy models, the option pricing problem can be formulated in terms of an integro-differential equation: for the Bates model the unknown F(S, V, t) (the option price) of the pricing equation depends on three independent variables and the differential operator part turns out to be of parabolic kind, while the nonlocal integral operator is calculated with respect to the Levy measure of the jumps. In this paper we will present a variational formulation of the problem suitable for a finite element approach. The numerical results obtained <b>for</b> european <b>options</b> will be compared with those obtained with different methods. ...|$|R

We derive a pricing formula <b>for</b> European <b>options</b> which gives the option price {{in the form of an}} inverse Fourier transform and propose two methods for numerically implementing this formula. As an application of this pricing approach, we introduce the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and the square-root dividend yield models in which we explicitly solve the pricing problem <b>for</b> European <b>options.</b> Finally we highlight the main effects of a stochastic dividend yield on option prices.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays in financial engineering. In particular we study problems in option pricing, stochastic control and risk management. In the first essay, we develop an accurate and efficient pricing <b>approach</b> <b>for</b> <b>options</b> on leveraged ETFs (LETFs). Our approach allows us to price these options quickly and {{in a manner that}} is consistent with the underlying ETF price dynamics. The numerical results also demonstrate that LETF option prices have model-dependency particularly in high-volatility environments. In the second essay, we extend a linear programming (LP) technique for approximately solving high-dimensional control problems in a diffusion setting. The original LP technique applies to finite horizon problems with an exponentially-distributed horizon, T. We extend the approach to fixed horizon problems. We then apply these techniques to dynamic portfolio optimization problems and evaluate their performance using convex duality methods. The numerical results suggest that the LP approach is a very promising one for tackling high-dimensional control problems. In the final essay, we propose a factor model-based <b>approach</b> <b>for</b> performing scenario analysis in a risk management context. We argue that our approach addresses some important drawbacks to a standard scenario analysis and, in a preliminary numerical investigation with option portfolios, we show that it produces superior results as well...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{alternatives to}} two project management techniques, the earned value <b>approach</b> <b>for</b> project performance reporting and the deterministic {{discounted cash flow}} analysis in decision making. Both are criticised in the literature due to their inherent deficiencies and inapplicability in practice. Earned value, a popular tool for forecasting project cost and schedules, has been criticised for its problematic formulation and implementation. These deficiencies are implicit in the method. The first section of the thesis presents {{a substitute for the}} earned value approach. The thesis argues that the state- space analysis is a viable alternative to the earned value approach by demonstrating the connection and the differences between the state space and the earned value methods. An example is taken to illustrate how the state space method works in practice. The second section of this thesis presents a new method, the second order moment <b>approach,</b> <b>for</b> <b>option</b> valuation at the investment decision stage. For the purpose of demonstrating the validity of the proposed method <b>for</b> valuing real <b>options,</b> a comparison in both formulation and calculation supports the equivalence between the second order moment and the Black-Sholes approach. Numerical testing then displays this equivalence. Finally, a mathematical method is proposed based on the second order moment approach and the project evaluation and review technique to support infrastructure investment decision making under climate change...|$|R

40|$|Because {{volatility}} {{of the underlying}} asset price is a critical factor affecting option prices and hedge ratios, the modeling of volatility and its dynamics is of vital interest to traders, investors, and risk managers. This modeling is a difficult task because the path of volatility during {{the life of an}} option is highly unpredictable. There has been a proliferation of volatility specifications since the original, simple constant-volatility assumption of the famous Black and Scholes option pricing model. This article gives an overview of different specifications of asset price volatility that are widely used in option pricing models.; While the authors cite evidence that some stochastic-volatility option pricing models provide better market prices and hedges than the Black-Scholes model, they acknowledge that for both academic researchers and market practitioners, no consensus exists regarding the best specification of volatility <b>for</b> <b>option</b> pricing.

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a new <b>approach</b> <b>for</b> {{implementing}} <b>option</b> pricing models in finance.

The approach is able to call upon powerful scientific libraries, uses only open source tools, and is free of any licensing costs. We provide examples where Cython speeds up a prototype version by over 500 times. These performance gains in conjunction with vast savings in programmer time make the approach very promising. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} marketed asset {{disclaimer}} <b>approach</b> <b>for</b> real <b>option</b> valuation. In {{sharp contrast to}} the dominant real option valuation that assumes a stochastic process for an investment’s capital value, this paper demonstrates the valuation of a real option assuming that cash flow follows a stochastic process.

40|$|The {{valuation}} of Asian, or a average price, options and of European options on portfolios in a "Black-Scholes" environment has given researchers trouble. The difficulty {{with these problems}} is that the probability distribution of the variable which determines the option payoff at expiration, a sum of correlated lognormal random variables, has no closed-form representation. For the Asian case the approach generally taken has been to approximate {{the distribution of the}} arithmetic average price, while <b>for</b> the portfolio <b>option</b> case, attempts have focused on discretizing the joint distribution of the terminal prices of the assets comprising the portfolio and approximating the expected risk-neutral option payoff with a discrete sum. These approaches are not entirely satisfactory. The distribution-approximating procedures <b>for</b> Asian <b>options</b> are not very accurate for some cases, while the computational requirements for obtaining a reasonably accurate estimate using the discretizing or multinomial <b>approaches</b> <b>for</b> portfolio <b>options</b> become excessive as the number of assets rises above four or five, because the computation time is exponential in the number of assets.
