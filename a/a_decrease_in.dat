5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing {{the collapse of a}} large part of the heavy industry sector. This collapse led to <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the consumption of electricity and thus <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the need for the oil shale that was mined to produce it. Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} respiratory depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane causes <b>a</b> dose-dependent <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> respiratory rate and <b>a</b> marked <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> respiratory minute volume, with <b>a</b> relatively mild <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> tidal volume. In humans, methoxyflurane causes <b>a</b> dose-dependent <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant. The net effect of these changes is profound respiratory depression, as evidenced by CO2 retention with <b>a</b> concomitant <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a respiratory acidosis) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} changes can occur to {{mitochondria}} during the aging process. Tissues from elderly patients show <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> enzymatic {{activity of the}} proteins of the respiratory chain. However, mutated mtDNA can only be found in about 0.2% of very old cells. Large deletions in the mitochondrial genome have been hypothesized to lead {{to high levels of}} oxidative stress and neuronal death in Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} a position about 240mi (385km) {{northeast of the}} Turks and Caicos Islands, the depression turned toward the north after a trough created a weakness in the ridge. After <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> wind shear, deep convection redeveloped over the center, and Olga re-intensified into a tropical storm on December2.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Communist rule in China, the social status of women {{improved}} greatly. Women were empowered to work outside the home. Communist rule also brought {{about the end of}} practices such as foot binding, child marriages, prostitution, and arranged marriages. China has seen <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> domestic violence due to government-supported grassroots programs to counter these practices. Women in rural areas remain largely uneducated.|$|E

50|$|Healthcare {{providers}} {{can substitute}} three-month for one-month supplies of medicines. A three-month supply represented <b>a</b> 29% <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> out-of-pocket costs and <b>an</b> 18% <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> total prescription costs in one study.|$|R
5|$|But {{not all the}} SNPs have a {{detrimental}} effect on TG levels. A recent report, showed that, in Sardinian population, the missense mutation Arg282Ser in APOA5 gene, correlates with <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> TG levels. The authors believe that this point mutation is a mayor modulatory of TG values in this population.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{reservoirs}} for Liverpool Corporation in {{the mid-19th}} century led to <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the population when farms were cleared, the valley flooded and property {{in the western part}} of the village demolished. William Lever bought the Rivington Hall estate at the turn of the 20th century and used his wealth to renovate the old barns and create a large public park.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the cost of using that resource when {{measured in terms of}} what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E
50|$|Phonetically, {{both of the}} tonal accents are falling; {{the falling}} accent is {{realized}} as <b>an</b> even <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> intensity and pitch, whereas the broken accent is realized as <b>a</b> sudden <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> intensity and pitch.|$|R
50|$|The {{operating}} conditions' optimization of {{this system}} is the main problem, because there are two opposing trends {{of the performance of}} the two sub-systems: by way of example, <b>a</b> <b>decreasing</b> of the evaporation temperature of the working fluid generates an increasing of the thermal efficiency of the solar panel but <b>a</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>in</b> the performance of the heat pump, with <b>a</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>in</b> the COP. The target for the optimization is normally the minimization of the electrical consumption of the heat pump, or primary energy required by an auxiliary boiler which supplies the load not covered by renewable source.|$|R
50|$|Passenger use and {{aircraft}} movements have increased each year since 1990 {{with the exception}} of 2006, which saw <b>a</b> sharp <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> both. Total cargo has trended upwards since 1990 but also experienced <b>a</b> significant <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> 2006.|$|R
5|$|Emulsions are {{a type of}} colloid {{in which}} surface tension plays a role. Tiny {{fragments}} of oil suspended in pure water will spontaneously assemble themselves into much larger masses. But {{the presence of a}} surfactant provides <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> surface tension, which permits stability of minute droplets of oil in the bulk of water (or vice versa).|$|E
5|$|Growth hormone (GH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> muscle mass, central obesity (increase in body fat around the waist) and impaired attention and memory. Children experience growth retardation and short stature.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Briarcliff Manor's racial {{composition}} has {{not changed}} significantly. The village has seen <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> its non-Hispanic white population to 86percent in 2010, down from 92percent in 1990.

5|$|On January 9, 2012, Puerto Rican Governor Luis Fortuño {{signed the}} project for a Legislative Reform that would {{reduce the number of}} legislators. According to Fortuño, this would result in <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the {{expenses}} associated with the operation of the Legislative Assembly. To achieve this, the constitution has to be amended, which would require a referendum to the people.|$|E
5|$|One {{study of}} 118 exocrine {{pancreatic}} cancer (EPC) patients and 399 hospital controls in eastern Spain found high selenium concentrations to be inversely {{associated with the}} risk of EPC. However, in randomized, blinded, controlled prospective trials in humans, selenium supplementation has not succeeded in reducing the incidence of any disease, nor has a meta-analysis of such selenium supplementation studies detected <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> overall mortality.|$|E
5|$|Python uses {{whitespace}} indentation {{to delimit}} blocks – rather than curly braces or keywords.
