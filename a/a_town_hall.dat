The steep gradient of the Rath was at this time constructed, and in 1939 <b>a</b> <b>Town</b> <b>Hall</b> was opened on Hamilton Terrace, at that time possessing an inbuilt fire station. 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath.|$|E

Despite the budget crisis having ended and the workers receiving their salaries as promised, the garbage builds up underground and eventually erupts, pouring trash all over the town.

5|$|In May 2009, Moran {{introduced}} {{a bill that would}} restrict broadcast advertisements for erectile dysfunction or male enhancement medication. He said that such ads were indecent and should be prohibited on radio and television between the hours of 6am and 10pm, in accordance with Federal Communications Commission policy. Later that year, Moran and former presidential candidate and former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean held <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>hall</b> meeting on the issue of health care at South Lakes High School in Reston, Virginia. The meeting was interrupted several times by protesters, most notably pro-life activist Randall Terry, who, along with about half a dozen supporters, caused such a commotion that he had to be escorted out by police. The incident was replayed several times {{over the next few weeks}} on television as an example of the tension at town halls that fall.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the County of Portugal around 1095, Varzim was an administrative and military unit that stretched from the sea to Cividade de Terroso and São Félix Hills. Póvoa de Varzim was established as a municipality in 1308 with the election of <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>hall</b> judge and boundary exemption. As the town achieved broad self-government in the 16th century, restricted borders were created, which split the town itself and since disputed by the town hall. Over time, these were expanded to approach the medieval lordship boundaries. However, Caxinas and Poça da Barca, south expansion areas of Póvoa de Varzim in the 18th and 19th centuries with fisher populations from Póvoa, are administrated by Vila do Conde, in spite of the centuries-old requests of Póvoa de Varzim for these to be incorporated in its municipality. Inland, the parishes of Rio Mau, Touginhó, and Arcos are also historically disputed.|$|E
5|$|The {{area had}} been the lands of the Pallittorre Aboriginal Tasmanians for {{thousands}} of years. European settlement and disease drove them from the lands and decimated their population. Chudleigh was first settled by Europeans in the 1830s for agriculture and lime production. The town was laid out, probably prior to 1835, to have up to 5000 residents though the population never became large. An early resident, John Badcock Gardiner, named Chudleigh, probably after Chudleigh in Devon, England. During the 19th century <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>hall,</b> four churches, a school, an inn, post office, police station and telegraph office were built. Over time the churches, school, inn and post office have closed. A rail line from Deloraine to Mole Creek served the town from 1890 till its closure in 1985.|$|E

5|$|The {{diversity}} of Runcorn's buildings increased during the Industrial Revolution. Structures such as Bridgewater House {{were associated with}} industry, while large domestic buildings such as Halton Grange were financed by the new wealth created. The enlarged town required new civic buildings such as the Old Police Station (originally <b>a</b> <b>Town</b> <b>Hall)</b> and transport infrastructure such as the railway bridge and the tide dock, while {{the needs of the}} growing population were met by structures such as Norton Water Tower. All of the listed churches were built in the 19thcentury; architects include John Douglas, Anthony Salvin, Sir George Gilbert Scott, and Edmund Sharpe. The most recent listed structure is the Silver Jubilee Bridge, constructed in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{system of}} county courts in England and Wales {{dates from the}} County Courts Act 1846, which {{received}} Royal Assent on 28 August 1846 and was brought into force on 15 March 1847. England and Wales (with {{the exception of the}} City of London, which was outside the scope of the Act) were divided into 60 circuits, with a total of 491 courts. Four of these circuits were wholly in Wales, as were 46 of these courts. A further seven courts were located in Monmouthshire (which had at the time an ambiguous status and was sometimes treated as being part of England) and these seven courts were part of a circuit for Monmouthshire and Herefordshire. One county court judge was appointed to each circuit, assisted by one or more registrars with some limited judicial powers, and would travel between the courts in his area as necessary, sitting in each court at least once a month. Few permanent courts were needed initially, given the infrequency of court hearings, and temporary accommodation such as <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>hall</b> would often be used where there was no existing courthouse for use.|$|E
