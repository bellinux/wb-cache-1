The game went on to sell more than 300,000 copies by 1997, and more than 780,000 by 2002. According to Constantine von Hoffman of the Boston Herald, Flight Unlimited successfully competed with Microsoft Flight Simulator. PC Gamers Lee Buchanan wrote that it [...] "soars above the pack of flight simulations", and he considered it to be [...] "the most fun [...] had in a computerized cockpit". Frank Vizard of Popular Mechanics hailed it as [...] "the new top gun of flight simulators", and Doug Bailey of The Boston Globe considered {{it to be the}} [...] "first real serious challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the genre". The Records David Noack believed that the game's physics and stereoscopic terrain set [...] "a new standard in flight simulation". Writing for Computer Gaming World, Bob and John Nolan stated, [...] "If anything, you should at least take <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> product, because you'll be looking at the future of simulations." ...|$|E

Hayden said, [...] "There are those out there who can take <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this...</b> and maybe even attempt to turn it to their own purposes". In the same report, Sean McGurk, a former cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland Security noted that the Stuxnet source code could now be downloaded online and modified to be directed at new target systems. Speaking of the Stuxnet creators, he said, [...] "They opened the box. They demonstrated the capability... It's not {{something that can be}} put back." ...|$|E
