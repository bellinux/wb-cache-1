5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) {{within the family}} Abelisauridae are confused. Several cladistic {{studies have indicated that}} Majungasaurus shares <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Carnotaurus from South America, while others were unable to firmly place it in the phylogeny. The most recent analysis, using the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility of separate clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E

Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover {{from the consequences of}} the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E
