50|$|There were {{generally}} two reasons that builders {{of the period}} hewed the exterior and/or {{the interior of the}} timbers into a flat surface. One reason was to remove the bark and sapwood layers which, over time, promoted rotting, and the second reason was to apply weatherboard siding on the exterior or <b>wall</b> <b>boards</b> on the interior. The cabin likely had both interior <b>wall</b> <b>boards</b> and exterior weather strip siding.|$|R
50|$|Another large non-food starch {{application}} {{is in the}} construction industry, where starch {{is used in the}} gypsum <b>wall</b> <b>board</b> manufacturing process. Chemically modified or unmodified starches are added to the stucco containing primarily gypsum. Top and bottom heavyweight sheets of paper are applied to the formulation, and the process is allowed to heat and cure to form the eventual rigid <b>wall</b> <b>board.</b> The starches act as a glue for the cured gypsum rock with the paper covering, and also provide rigidity to the board.|$|R
50|$|Lath {{and plaster}} has been mostly {{replaced}} with solid drywall or plasterboard (also {{a type of}} gypsum <b>wall</b> <b>board,</b> although a bit thicker), since it is faster and less expensive to install.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "stave church" [...] {{is unknown}} in Old Norse, presumably {{because there were}} no other types of wooden churches. When Norway's churches after the Reformation were {{constructed}} in log, there was a need for a separate word for the older churches. In written sources from the Middle Ages, there is a clearl distinction between [...] "stafr" [...] (posts) and [...] "þili" [...] or [...] "vægþili" [...] (<b>wall</b> <b>boards).</b> However, in documents from the 1600-1700s, [...] "stave" [...] was also used for <b>wall</b> <b>boards</b> or panels. Emil Eckhoff in his Svenska stavkyrkor (1914-1916) also included wood frame church buildings without posts.|$|R

5000|$|Eventually {{the wood}} laths became less common, and were {{replaced}} with rock lath (also known as [...] "button board"), {{which is a}} type of gypsum <b>wall</b> <b>board</b> with holes spaced regularly across it, usually in sheets sized 2 ft by 4 ft (60 cm by 120 cm). The purpose of the four-foot length is so that the sheet of lath reaches exactly across three wall studs, which are spaced 16 in apart on center (United States building code standard measurements). The holes serve the same purpose as the spaces between the wood lath strips, allowing plaster to ooze through the board when the plaster is applied, making the keys to hold the plaster to the <b>wall</b> <b>board.</b>|$|R

50|$|Another {{carpentry}} method {{which is}} sometimes called plank <b>wall,</b> <b>board</b> <b>wall,</b> plank-on-plank, horizontal plank frame is the stacking of horizontal planks or boards to form a wall of solid lumber. Sometimes the planks were staggered or spaced apart to form keys for a coat of plaster. This method was recommended by Orson Squire Fowler for octagon houses in his book The Octagon House: A Home for All in 1848. Fowler mentions he had seen this wall type being built in central New York state while traveling in 1842.|$|R

50|$|Shortlines {{generally}} {{exist for}} one of three reasons: to link two industries requiring rail freight together (for example, a gypsum mine and a <b>wall</b> <b>board</b> factory, or a coal mine and a power plant); to interchange revenue traffic with other, usually larger, railroads; or to operate a tourist passenger train service.

40|$|Fire {{resistance}} of light-gauge steel frame (LSF) walls {{can be enhanced}} by lining them with single or multiple layers of <b>wall</b> <b>boards.</b> This research {{is focused on the}} thermal per-formance of Magnesium Oxide (MgO) <b>wall</b> <b>boards</b> in comparison to the conventional gypsum plasterboards exposed to standard fire on one side. Thermal properties of MgO board and gypsum plasterboard were measured first and then used in the finite element heat transfer models of the two types of panels. The measured thermal property results show that MgO board will perform better than the gypsum plasterboards due to its higher specific heat values at elevated temperatures. However, MgO board loses 50 % of its ini-tial mass at about 500 °C compared to 16 % for gypsum plasterboard. The developed finite element models were validated using the fire test results of gypsum plasterboards and then used to study the thermal performance of MgO board panels. Finite element analysis re-sults show that when MgO board panels are exposed to standard fire on one side the rate of temperature rise on the ambient side is significantly reduced compared to gypsum plas-terboard. This has the potential to improve the overall thermal performance of MgO <b>board</b> lined LSF <b>walls</b> and their fire resistance levels (FRL). However, full scale fire tests are needed to confirm this. This paper presents the details of this investigation and the results...|$|R
