50|$|Tomatoes have a rich flavor, high liquid content, {{very soft}} flesh which breaks down easily, {{and the right}} {{composition}} to thicken into a sauce when they are cooked (without the need of thickeners such as roux). All of these qualities make them ideal for simple and appealing sauces. The simplest tomato sauces consist just of chopped tomato flesh cooked in {{a little olive oil}} <b>and</b> <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> it loses its raw flavor, and seasoned with salt.|$|R

It is most often prepared in a cazuela (...) or a thick heavy clay cauldron and stirred almost constantly to prevent burning. The thickness of the sauce has prompted some, such as Mexican-food authority Patricia Quintana, to claim it is too substantial {{to be called a}} sauce. However, like a sauce, it is always served over something and never eaten alone. Mole poblano is most traditionally served with turkey, but it and many others are also served with chicken, pork, or other meats (such as lamb).|$|R

Adding potatoes to curry sauce was introduced by William S. Clark of the Sapporo Agricultural College, due to rice shortages at the time.|$|R
50|$|Indian cuisine has a {{large amount}} of {{regional}} variation, with many variations on the basic chicken curry recipe. Indian chicken curry typically starts with whole spices, heated in oil. A sauce is then made with onions, ginger, garlic, and tomatoes, and powdered spices. Bone-in pieces of chicken are then added to the sauce, <b>and</b> <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> cooked through. In South India, coconut and curry leaves are also popular ingredients. Chicken curry is usually garnished with coriander leaves, and served with rice or roti. Even within the country, there are variations among regions. In Northern India, there the delicacy may be extra cooked with extra spice. Additionally, one can find the dish in several small shops as well as five-star restaurants. Depending on the style of preparation, some versions may be sweeter while others will have a more creamier taste to them due to the ample use of butter and cashewnut paste.|$|R

2500|$|As observant Jews do not cook on Shabbat, various {{techniques}} {{were developed to}} provide for a hot meal on Shabbat day. One such dish is [...] "cholent" [...] or [...] "chamin," [...] a slow-cooked stew of meat, potatoes, beans and barley (although {{there are many other}} variations). The ingredients are placed in a pot and put up to boil before lighting the candles on Friday night.

Metal trade workers began a large strike and great tensions were created between employers and workers in Los Angeles as a result. [...] The Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employees {{took advantage of}} the discourse and organized the Los Angeles trainmen and created Carmen's Local No. 410. The organization lobbied the state to create a ten-hour workday for local and interurban railway workers. The movement failed because employers threatened to fire anyone found participating in the movement. From 1913 to 1915, the amalgamated workers fought for lower work shifts and higher wages but found themselves blocked off by powerful enemies of labor.|$|R
50|$|Fets y Cybydd, or the Miser’s Feast, was a {{very popular}} dish in Carmarthenshire 100 years ago. It was made in a saucepan, but can also be made in a casserole. The bottom of the dish is covered in peeled potatoes, and a sliced onion, with a little salt, covered with water and then brought to the boil. When the water is boiling, a few slices of bacon or apiece of ham are placed on top. The lid is {{replaced}} <b>and</b> the whole <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> the potatoes are cooked, and the water absorbed. The miser was supposed to eat the potatoes one day, mashed up in the liquid, keeping the slices of bacon to be eaten {{the next day with}} plain boiled potatoes.|$|R
50|$|A {{quick way}} to make casein {{painting}} medium is to take some skim milk cottage cheese and first wash off any of the milky fluids. The lumps of casein left behind are then dissolved by adding, in a pot, water and some ammonia. The ammonia should be preferably {{in the form of}} ammonium carbonate. As the mixture is stirred while it warms it begins to froth and the lumps dissolve. It is not boiled but kept <b>simmering</b> <b>and</b> stirred <b>until</b> the frothing stops. After the syrup is cooled, that is the medium. It looks like white school glue or heavy cream. It keeps in a refrigerator for about four days.|$|R
50|$|Rice {{and peas}} is the {{mainstay}} of the cuisines of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and many other English-speaking Caribbean islands. Rice and peas is traditionally, but not exclusively, eaten with the Sunday meal. The dish is made with rice and any available legume, such as kidney beans, pigeon peas (known as gungo peas), or cowpeas, the combination of grain and a legume forming a complete protein; compare rice and beans. Gungo peas are particularly associated with Christmas. The peas are boiled with pimento seeds (allspice) and garlic until tender. Salt, pepper, scotch bonnet, thyme, onion (usually spring onion), grated ginger and coconut milk are then added along with the rice <b>and</b> left to <b>simmer</b> <b>until</b> cooked. Variations of the recipe {{include the use of}} salt pork or beef instead of salt. This flavors the dish well and reduces the need for additional protein. Rice and peas, the classic Sunday lunch dish, is usually served with a stewed meat, such as chicken, beef, lamb or pork, or fish or seafood such as shrimp, crab or king fish.|$|R

5000|$|Clashes between {{organized}} labor <b>and</b> Pacific Electric <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> labor efforts were renewed in 1910. Metal trade workers began a large strike and great tensions were created between employers and workers in Los Angeles as a result.

The movement failed because employers threatened to fire anyone found participating in the movement. From 1913 to 1915, the amalgamated workers fought for lower work shifts and higher wages but found themselves blocked off by powerful enemies of labor. Pacific Electric found a new tactic of subduing the labor movement by adopting a company union in 1917. Huntington chose General Manager George Kuhrts as the group's president, and the other officers were elected by the workers. The union established a board selected by workers to air employee grievances and make. Although it made employee desires known to management, the union had no administrative authority, and it served in a purely advisory capacity.|$|R
5000|$|Writing Without Teachers was Elbow's {{first book}} about writing, {{and the one}} that has made his freewriting {{technique}} so popular as a pedagogical practice. In this book, Elbow uses two main metaphors. These are metaphors that reflect Elbow's interest in letting one's ideas develop and change throughout the writing process. The first is to see writing as growing. It must move through stages. The first stage is to generate words before a writer can continue to [...] "grow" [...] a piece of writing and move through the subsequent stages. In this section Elbow stresses that it is crucial to write as much as possible because the more a writer writes, not only does he have more to work with, but he also has more to throw away, allowing him to keep moving through the growing stages of writing. The second metaphor is to see writing as cooking, letting ideas <b>simmer</b> <b>and</b> bubble <b>until</b> they are ready to be used. In this metaphor, Elbow emphasizes interaction, particularly between writing and reiteration. According to Elbow, growing is transformation at the macro level, cooking is transformation at the micro level. Essentially, the writing lets his ideas <b>simmer</b> <b>until</b> he can use them to interact with his writing. Elbow suggests that writers spend sufficient time writing as well as stopping completely and reflecting on what the larger picture is meant to present.|$|R
