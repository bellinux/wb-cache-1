5|$|Just before migration, the ruff {{increases}} {{its body}} mass <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 1% a day, much {{slower than the}} bar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times that rate. This {{is thought to be}} because the godwit cannot use refuelling areas to feed on its trans-Pacific flight, whereas the ruff is able to make regular stops and take in food during overland migration. For the same reason, the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.|$|E

Municipally, the network is used by city inspectors and employees, with plans in place for the police and fire departments to use it in the future. In 2007, when the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapsed, the wireless system helped coordinate rescuers and emergency services. The city and USI Wireless have won praise for the network, which has been singled out for being one of the few successful municipal wireless ventures nationwide among a number of stalled or failed projects.|$|E
5|$|To {{address this}} concern, a {{considerable}} amount of LIFE's effort was put into the development of simplified target designs and automated construction that would lower their cost. Working with General Atomics, the LIFE team developed a concept using on-site fuel factories that would mass-produce pellets <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> a million a day. It was expected that this would reduce their price to about 25 cents per target, although other references suggest the target price was closer to 50 cents, and LLNL's own estimates range from 20 to 30 cents.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, {{paramagnetic}} metal. Its {{chemistry is}} typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 watts per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's decay to berkelium-249 and then californium-249 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 (half-life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk. Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.|$|E
