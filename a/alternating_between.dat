5|$|The film {{starts with}} the Polaroid {{photograph}} of a dead man.

5|$|A {{loud and}} active bird, the red wattlebird {{is found in}} pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the {{breeding}} season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. It flies straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, <b>alternating</b> <b>between</b> gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at or slightly above {{the level of the}} tree canopy. The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.|$|E

5|$|All four ships {{spent the}} {{majority}} of their time in service with the main Italian fleet, <b>alternating</b> <b>between</b> active duty for training exercises and reserve status. In 1897, Goito was converted into a minelayer and Montebello became a training ship for engine room personnel. Monzambano and Confienza were simply sold for scrap in 1901. Goito laid defensive minefields after Italy entered World War I in 1915, but otherwise did not see action during the war. The two surviving vessels remained in the Italian fleet until 1920, when they too were broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Carnot {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her active career <b>alternating</b> <b>between</b> the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons.

The Northern Squadron conducted annual training exercises in June 1901; the following month, they joined the Mediterranean Squadron for combined fleet maneuvers.|$|E

5|$|Red wattlebirds utter {{two types}} of alarm calls, <b>alternating</b> <b>between</b> them while mobbing other animals. One is a harsh call over a wide {{frequency}} (1.3 to 5.9kHz) that is louder at lower frequencies. The other a lower-pitched staccato call with a frequency of 1.1–2.2kHz. They give a harsh call when trying to distract intruders from {{the vicinity of the}} nest or when picked up, often trying to flap or peck the handler.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} scenes is {{heightened}} by <b>alternating</b> <b>between</b> objective and subjective perspectives, the warm {{face of the}} Earth and the depths of dark space, the chaos and unpredictability of the debris field, and silence in the vacuum of space with the background score giving the desired effect. The film uses very long, uninterrupted shots throughout to draw the audience into the action, but contrasts these with claustrophobic shots within space suits and capsules.|$|E
5|$|The ten events require {{knowledge}} in many academic disciplines. Students must take seven multiple choice tests in art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and social science. These topics, {{with the exception}} of math, are thematically linked each year. One of the multiple choice events, <b>alternating</b> <b>between</b> science or social science, is chosen for the Super Quiz. In addition to the seven objective events, there are three subjective events graded by judges: essay, interview and speech.|$|E

5|$|Both Wacht and Jagd {{served with}} the German fleet in home waters; Wacht in the Maneuver Squadron from 1889 and Jagd in the Training Squadron from 1891. Wacht {{and the rest of}} the Maneuver Squadron went on a major cruise in the Mediterranean Sea in 188990. In 1893, Jagd joined Wacht in the Maneuver Squadron, and both ships served there, <b>alternating</b> <b>between</b> the I and II Divisions for the rest of the decade. Their {{activities}} consisted of periodic divisional and squadron training maneuvers, which culminated in the annual autumn fleet maneuvers in late August and early September.|$|E
5|$|Bouvet {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her career <b>alternating</b> <b>between</b> the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons. At the outbreak of World War I, she escorted troop convoys from North Africa to France. She then joined the naval operations off the Dardanelles, where she participated in a major attack on the Turkish fortresses in the straits on 18 March 1915. During the attack, she was hit approximately eight times by shellfire, though did not suffer fatal damage. She struck a mine at around 3:15, and sank within two minutes; only some 50 men were rescued from a complement of 710. Two British battleships were also sunk by mines that day, and the disaster convinced the Allies to abandon the naval campaign {{in favor of an}} amphibious assault on Gallipoli.|$|E

5|$|HB1001 {{made its}} first flight on 1December1977 {{at the hands of}} Lockheed test pilot, Bill Park. He would fly the next four sorties, all chased by a T-38 piloted by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Ken Dyson. Dyson, an F-15 Eagle pilot, was {{previously}} approached by United States Air Force personnel about the project in 1976. He made his first flight on HB1001 on 17January1978, chased by Park. In fact, the two would be the only test pilots of Have Blue, <b>alternating</b> <b>between</b> the demonstrator and the chase plane. Flight test results allowed engineers to refine the FBW system. At the same time, they verified predictions made earlier by aerodynamic engineers on the aircraft's behavior.|$|E
5|$|In {{reproducing}} the album's {{recorded music}} onstage, he performed with his eight-piece band, which included bass player Calvin Turner, drummers Lemar Carter and Charles Jones, guitarists Rob Bacon and Josh Smith, and backing singers Erika Jerry and BJ Kemp. In {{contrast to his}} touring for The Way I See It, Saadiq {{did not include a}} horn section for certain shows and played on guitar for a more rock-oriented sound. While travelling between concert dates, Saadiq and his bandmates watched music documentaries for inspiration, including a documentary on Bob Marley & The Wailers and the 1973 film Wattstax. He expanded his touring in promotion of the album into August 2011, with concerts <b>alternating</b> <b>between</b> North American headlining dates and European music festivals.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} battles of Ginchy and Morval, the 1/10th {{was engaged in}} a purely supporting role: trench networks were constructed and improved near Delville Wood, and the dead collected and buried. A party of two officers and 100 other ranks {{was attached to the}} Third West Lancashire Field Ambulance during the Battle of Morval. After bivouacking at Pont Rémy, the battalion transferred with its division to the relatively quiet Ypres Salient in October. The routine of <b>alternating</b> <b>between</b> the front line, being in support, and in reserve preoccupied the battalion until the Third Battle of Ypres in July 1917. Casualties were nevertheless sustained by the battalion during this period, invariably as a result of shelling and sniping.|$|E
