5|$|After several disappointing seasons, Coughlin {{retired after}} the end of the 2015 season as head coach and {{replaced}} with previous offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo. McAdoo brought the Giants to an 11-5 record and their first playoff berth since 2011 with a much improved defense (despite a mediocre offense). He was the first Giants coach since Jim Fassel in 1997 to bring them to the playoffs in his first year as head coach. On December 11, 2016, during <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>Night</b> Football game against the Dallas Cowboys, McAdoo was fined $200,000 for illegally using a walkie talkie on the field.|$|E

25|$|The New York Times, however, {{reported}} that {{it was unlikely that}} NBC would get baseball, as the network would have to preempt up to three weeks of NFL coverage on Sunday nights. However, the NFL used to not schedule <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>night</b> game on the second night of the World Series, which meant that NBC gaining the rights was not completely out of the question (however, the following Sunday, in which a possible World Series Game 7 is scheduled, <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>night</b> NFL game is also scheduled). In addition to this, other Sunday playoff games, such as the ALCS and NLCS could be pushed to the afternoon. This might not be appetizing to league officials, as major playoff games would go up head-to-head against highly rated afternoon NFL games (as opposed to today's system, in which only one game out of two for the day would go up against network NFL broadcasts).|$|E

25|$|The Patriots {{traveled}} to Indianapolis for <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>night</b> {{game with the}} Colts in Lucas Oil Stadium. Both teams went three-and-out to start the game, setting up a Colts possession that began from their own 9-yard line. The Colts then went 91 yards on a 15-play drive that lasted over nine minutes, included six first downs, and culminated in a 12-yard Anthony Gonzalez touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to give the Colts a 7–0 lead. The Patriots responded with a 13-play, 56-yard drive of their own that brought the game into the second quarter.|$|E

25|$|In September 1996 Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum and Case Western Reserve University cohosted Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Woody Guthrie, a 10-day {{conference of}} panel sessions, lectures, and concerts. The conference {{became the first}} in {{what would become the}} museum's annual American Music Masters Series conference. Highlights {{included}} Arlo Guthrie's keynote address, a Saturday night musical jamboree at Cleveland's Odeon Theater, and <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>night</b> concert at Severance Hall, the home of the Cleveland Orchestra. Musicians performing {{over the course of the}} conference included Arlo Guthrie, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, Pete Seeger, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, the Indigo Girls, Ellis Paul, Jimmy LaFave, Ani DiFranco, and others. In 1999, Wesleyan University Press published a collection of essays from the conference and DiFranco's record label, Righteous Babe, released a compilation of the Severance Hall concert, Til We Outnumber 'Em, in 2000.|$|E
25|$|In {{an unusual}} coincidence, both games {{which had the}} New York Jets as a home team at New Meadowlands Stadium (now MetLife Stadium) were delayed because of heavy rain and {{lightning}} in the area. In the first instance, the September 13 game against the Baltimore Ravens, it was delayed 25 minutes; the second delay, prior to the October 11 contest against the Minnesota Vikings, lasted for 40 minutes. Prior to the September 13 game, the last ESPN telecast to encounter weather problems was on October 4, 1998 (<b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>night)</b> when lightning halted a game between the Seattle Seahawks and Kansas City Chiefs during the second quarter. The first delay forced ESPN to use ESPN2 for a game telecast, this time for the Chiefs' home opener against the San Diego Chargers. As in 2007, the broadcast was shifted to ESPN once the first game was over.|$|E
25|$|To {{start the}} 2011 season the Cowboys played the New York Jets on <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>night</b> primetime game in New York, on September 11, 2011. The Cowboys held the lead {{through most of}} the game, until a fumble, blocked punt, and {{interception}} led to the Jets coming back to win the game. In week 2 Dallas traveled to San Francisco to play the 49ers. In the middle of the 2nd quarter, while the Cowboys trailed 10–7, Tony Romo suffered a rib injury and was replaced by Jon Kitna. Kitna threw 1 Touchdown and 2 interceptions until Romo returned in the 3rd quarter as Dallas trailed 17–7. Romo then threw 3 touchdown passes to Miles Austin as the Cowboys rallied to send the game into overtime. On the Cowboys opening possession after 49ers punt, Romo found WR Jesse Holley on a 78-yard pass, which set up the game-winning field goal by rookie kicker Dan Bailey.|$|E

25|$|Meridian also geared a {{large amount}} of its network output towards younger viewers, with {{independent}} commissions including Wizadora for pre-school children, plus ZZZap!, The Ruth Rendell Mysteries, It's a Mystery, The Vanishing Man, Jane Austen's Emma, William and Mary and Eye of the Storm for older children. Drama became a successful genre for the station, with Peter Kosminsky's No Child of Mine, tackling the emotionally difficult subject of child abuse, winning Meridian a BAFTA award. Meridian presents Mary Wesley's two novels: Harnessing Peacocks and The Vacillations of Poppy Carew. Later, the same production team tackled vicious childhood bullying in Walking on the Moon. Meridian's two-part production In the Name of Love in 1999 starred Tara Fitzgerald, Tim Dutton and Mark Strong, and was written by Sarah-Louise Hawkins and directed by Ferdinand Fairfax. Hornblower was <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>night</b> success for the ITV network while another Sunday night favourite, Where the Heart Is, transferred production from Anglia Television to Meridian in 2002 - the station's last major contribution at a network level.|$|E
25|$|The Bears {{returned}} home to play <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>night</b> match with the Dallas Cowboys. The game was close early as the Bears' Robbie Gould and the Cowboys' Nick Folk each hit field goals {{to make it a}} 3–3 tie at halftime. The Cowboys took the opening drive of the third quarter and ended it with a Tony Romo to Jason Witten touchdown pass. The Bears responded on the ensuing drive with a Cedric Benson goal line plunge. The Cowboys struck again {{before the end of the}} third quarter, Romo connecting on his second touchdown pass, this time to running back Marion Barber. Folk converted a 44-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter, and on the next play from scrimmage, Bears quarterback Rex Grossman threw an interception to Cowboys cornerback Anthony Henry, who ran it back for the score. With the lead in hand, the Cowboys proceeded to kill the clock, which they did effectively with Barber, who capped the scoring with a one-yard touchdown run. Barber ended the night with over 100 yards rushing, and Cowboys wide receiver Terrell Owens caught eight passes for 145 yards. The Cowboys improved to 3–0, while the Bears dropped to 1–2.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{their second}} West Coast game {{in as many}} weeks, the Patriots elected to {{practice}} at San José State University and to stay in Santa Clara, California in advance of flying to San Diego to face the Chargers in <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>night</b> game at Qualcomm Stadium. On the first play of the game, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers completed a 48-yard pass to wide receiver Vincent Jackson that brought the Chargers to the Patriots' 32-yard line. Three incomplete passes by Rivers from the Patriots' 7-yard line set up a 25-yard Nate Kaeding field goal that gave the Chargers a 3–0 lead. On their first possession, the Patriots reached the Chargers' 31-yard line, where Gostkowski missed a 48-yard field goal, his first such miss of the season. Four plays later, Rivers hit wide receiver Malcom Floyd on a 49-yard touchdown catch that extended the Chargers' lead to 10–0. The Patriots punted on their ensuing possession; the Chargers' Darren Sproles returned the punt 28 yards to start the Chargers' next drive from the Patriots' 45-yard line. A failed third-down conversion by the Chargers set up a missed 44-yard field goal attempt by Kaeding.|$|E
