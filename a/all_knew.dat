25|$|The Allies {{were closing}} in on Germany proper and <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> {{the end of the}} European war was in sight. However, {{it would have been a}} mistake to think the {{fighting}} was over in the English Channel. The Germans still held the Channel Islands. The Germans remained fighting to the bitter end; with the Germans, it was not over until it was over. A suspected enemy submarine was detected and attacked in January 1945; a raid was launched by the Germans in February which almost resulted in the sinking of a sister patrol craft, the USS PC-564, a fate narrowly missed by PC-552. President Roosevelt died that Spring.|$|E

He noted there were some former B Specials in the room and observed they did not initially associate with the others – not on the grounds of religion but because the former TA soldiers <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> each other socially and sat together on canteen breaks whereas the former specials kept to their group of comrades, but within a week both had melded together.|$|E
25|$|Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen, {{treasurer}} of Oslo AUF from 1992 to 1994, had at first denied {{to testify in}} the case, after advice from his defense attorney, but chose to change his mind. He told the court that the Oslo Labour Party pressured the Oslo AUF to maintain high membership numbers, {{in order to maintain}} their strong influence within AUF. He also told the court that the four accused members tried to keep the money advancements a secret, because they <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> that the practice was illegal. He also admitted that the leadership of AUF in the years between 1992 and 1994 conspired to inflate membership numbers in order to receive higher government subsidies. The leadership regularly paid membership fees for those members who did not pay their fees. In 1993, they also decided to pay membership fees for people who had never expressed any desire to be members of AUF. He also admitted that the four of them met at Hornslien's parliament office to discuss the situation after Verdens Gang broke the story.|$|E

You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

25|$|On May 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress {{convened in}} Philadelphia. When war seemed inevitable, Wythe was elected as Virginia's {{delegate}} to replace George Washington, who took {{command of the}} continental forces. George and Elizabeth Wythe moved to Philadelphia by September, and were inoculated against smallpox, as were fellow delegate Francis Lightfoot Lee and his lady and others. By October, Thomas Jefferson had rejoined the Congress to work with his former teacher and the other delegates, although personal tragedy forced him to leave for five months {{in the winter and}} spring. Wythe accepted many assignments relating to military, currency and other matters. He, John Dickinson and John Jay also went to New Jersey that winter and convinced that colony's assembly to maintain a united front. When petitions and other attempts failed to resolve the crisis by the following summer, all while Dunmore's raiders harassed Virginia settlements from its waterways, Wythe moved and then voted in favor of the resolution for independence that Jefferson had drafted upon his return. His fellow Virginia delegates in Philadelphia held Wythe in such esteem, that they left the first space open for Wythe when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Moreover, John Adams, who did not like many Virginians, thought so highly of Wythe that he wrote 'Thoughts on Government' concerning establishing constitutions for state governments after the war. Earlier in the session, Wythe also exchanged humorous verses with his friend delegate William Ellery of Rhode Island despite their political differences. Wythe thus signed the Declaration of Independence upon his (and his wife's) return to Philadelphia in September. The signers' names were not made public until the following January, for <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> the declaration was an act of treason, punishable by death should their rebellion fail.|$|E

Williams explained that the game [...] "just made us all feel icky. It was all about the violence, and it was realistic violence.

[...] "Surrounded by the parasitic presence", as journalist John Harris puts it, [...] "it was no wonder that as he slid into addiction and torpor, no-one raised the alarm: to them, Elvis was the bank, and it had to remain open." [...] Tony Brown, who played piano for Presley regularly in the last two years of the singer's life, observed his rapidly declining health and the urgent need to address it: [...] "But we <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> it was hopeless because Elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people... all those so-called friends". In the Memphis Mafia's defense, Marty Lacker has said, [...] " [...] was his own man.... If we hadn't been around, he would have been dead a lot earlier." ...|$|E

The couple did not live together until {{the final years of}} Tracy's life, when they shared a cottage on George Cukor's estate in Beverly Hills. In Hollywood, however, the intimate nature of the Tracy-Hepburn partnership was an open secret. Angela Lansbury, who worked with the pair on State of the Union, later said: [...] "We <b>all</b> <b>knew,</b> but nobody ever said anything. In those days it wasn't discussed." [...] Tracy was not someone to express his emotions, but friend Betsy Drake believed he [...] "was utterly dependent upon Hepburn." [...] Tracy's infidelity apparently continued, however, and he is reported to have had an affair with Gene Tierney during the making of Plymouth Adventure in 1952.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, Alex Shoumatoff, {{writing in}} The New Yorker, makes Bates's Naturalist his choice {{if he were}} allowed only one book for a {{tropical}} journey. In his view, it is [...] "the basic text" [...] and a monument of scientific travel writing. Shoumatoff had in fact spent eight months in Bates's [...] "glorious forest" [...] (he quotes) with a copy in his backpack; he thus admires Bates's acceptance of the inevitable discomfort and homesickness from personal knowledge, noting that Bates only complained when all the following had occurred together: he had been robbed, he had gone barefoot having worn out his shoes, he had received no parcels from England, {{and worst of all}} he had nothing left to read. But otherwise Bates was [...] "lost in wonder" [...] at the astonishing diversity of the natural history of the Amazons. He was, writes Shoumatoff, one of the four largely self-educated geniuses who pioneered tropical biology, and who <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> each other: Darwin, Wallace, Bates, and the botanist Richard Spruce.|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} {{identities of}} the Pankhurst children began to emerge {{around the time of}} their father's death. Before long they were all involved in the struggle for women's suffrage. Christabel enjoyed a privileged status among the daughters, as Sylvia noted in 1931: [...] "She was our mother's favourite; we <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> it, and I, for one, never resented the fact." [...] Christabel did not share her mother's fervour for political work, however, until she befriended the suffrage activists Esther Roper and Eva Gore-Booth. She soon became involved with the suffrage movement and joined her mother at speaking events. Sylvia took lessons from a respected local artist, and soon received a scholarship to the Manchester School of Art. She went on to study art in Florence and Venice. The younger children, Adela and Harry, had difficulty finding a path for their studies. Adela was sent to a local boarding school, where she was cut off from her friends and contracted head lice. Harry also had difficulty at school; he suffered from measles and vision problems.|$|E

The God Squad, however, was not well received: Canning described it as [...] "conveniently arriving for the sake of one storyline in this episode" [...] and debating [...] "a forced issue that we <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> would result in acceptance", and VanDerWerff pointed out that as [...] "we already know how the other three kids are going to shake out", it was [...] "surprisingly undramatic" [...] and its sole purpose to [...] "watch a new character decide if he's okay with gay people". Futterman, on the other hand, felt that the sequence [...] "tastefully incorporated religion's views into the show's ongoing look at gay relationships".|$|E
500|$|The next session, {{according}} to John Payne, occurred {{early in the}} morning, {{but it did not}} work and nothing from this session worked for the final album.

[...] Jay Berliner was not available, so Barry Kornfeld was recruited [...] to play lead guitar in his place. According to Merenstein, there was tension at this second session and it was stopped after about three hours. [...] Morrison was quoted by Ritchie Yorke as saying the album was recorded in [...] "two eight-hour sessions, plus two overdub sessions. That was the whole album." [...] In his biography, Clinton Heylin gives the date for the second session as [...] 1 October and states that [...] "Only 'As Young Lovers Do' from this session would make the album" [...] contending that this is the reason for the different [...] "lounge-jazz sound" [...] on this track.
