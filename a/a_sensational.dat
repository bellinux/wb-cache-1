5|$|When Lounsberry {{learned that}} a {{military}} column (including the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment commanded by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer) would soon leave Fort Abraham Lincoln for the Montana Territory, he agreed to accompany Custer and provide news coverage. However, {{at the last minute}} Lounsberry's wife fell ill, so the editor asked Kellogg to take his place. Lounsberry expected Kellogg would cover nothing more than <b>a</b> <b>sensational</b> military victory.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Evans {{moved the}} Klan's {{national}} headquarters to Washington, D.C., where {{the murder of}} Simmon's lawyer had received less publicity. To Evans' consternation, Stephenson also formed a women's auxiliary group. Evans and Stephenson subsequently exchanged allegations of sexual impropriety. Police charged Stephenson with the kidnapping, {{rape and murder of}} a young woman; he maintained that the charges were orchestrated by Evans. After <b>a</b> <b>sensational</b> trial, Stephenson was convicted of second degree murder and given a life sentence; the publicity about the leader's behavior caused thousands of members to abandon the Klan.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Holly Compton (September 10, 1892– March 15, 1962) was an American {{physicist}} {{who won the}} Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for his 1923 {{discovery of}} the Compton effect, which demonstrated the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation. It was <b>a</b> <b>sensational</b> discovery at the time: the wave nature of light had been well-demonstrated, {{but the idea that}} light had both wave and particle properties was not easily accepted. He is also known for his leadership of the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, and served as Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis from 1945 to 1953.|$|E

5|$|On 22 September 2013, Balotelli {{missed a}} penalty in a {{competitive}} match {{for the first time}} in 22 attempts as a professional; the kick was saved by Pepe Reina as Milan lost 2–1 to Napoli. During a match against Catania on 1 December, Balotelli accused opponent Nicolás Spolli of racially abusing him, but there was insufficient evidence for any action to be taken. The following week, Balotelli scored two goals in a 2–2 draw with Livorno, including <b>a</b> <b>sensational</b> 30-yard direct free kick that was clocked at a speed of 109km/h.|$|E
5|$|Anderson's {{return to}} Germany {{generated}} press interest, and drew more {{members of the}} German aristocracy to her cause. She again lived itinerantly as a guest of her well-wishers. In 1932, the British tabloid News of the World published <b>a</b> <b>sensational</b> story accusing her of being a Romanian actress who was perpetrating a fraud. Her lawyer, Fallows, filed suit for libel, but the lengthy case continued until the outbreak of World War II, at which time the case was dismissed because Anderson was living in Germany, and German residents could not sue in enemy countries. From 1938, lawyers acting for Anderson in Germany contested {{the distribution of the}} Tsar's estate to his recognized relations, and they in turn contested her identity. The litigation continued intermittently without resolution for decades; Lord Mountbatten footed some of his German relations' legal bills against Anderson. The protracted proceedings became the longest-running lawsuit in German history.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the case}} did not quickly fade. The play Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn existed in various {{anonymous}} versions; it was <b>a</b> <b>sensational</b> hit throughout the mid 19th century {{and may have been}} the most performed play of the time. Victorian fairground peep shows were forced to add extra apertures for their viewers when exhibiting their shows of the murder. The plays of the Victorian era tended to portray Corder as a cold-blooded monster and Maria as the innocent whom he preyed upon; her reputation and her children by other fathers were airbrushed out, and Corder was made into an older man. Charles Dickens published an account of the murder in his magazine All the Year Round after initially rejecting it because he felt the story to be too well known and the account of the stepmother's dreams rather far-fetched.|$|E

5|$|Upon its release, Gone {{with the}} Wind broke {{attendance}} records everywhere. At the Capitol Theatre in New York alone, it was averaging eleven thousand admissions {{per day in}} late December, and within four years of its release had sold an estimated sixty million tickets across the United States—sales equivalent to just under half the population at the time. It repeated its success overseas, and was <b>a</b> <b>sensational</b> hit during the Blitz in London, opening in April 1940 and playing for four years. By the time MGM withdrew it from circulation {{at the end of}} 1943 its worldwide distribution had returned a gross rental (the studio's share of the box office gross) of $32 million, making it the most profitable film ever made up to that point.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, Spring Fest bore {{witness to}} a never before seen concept of unified music from around the Globe. With musical {{performances}} {{from all around the}} world, the Global Music Festival was a huge success. Performances by the post-rock band Paint the Sky Red from Singapore; the indie pop band Pleasantry from Singapore; the Irish folk music duo Fasta Duo; the Israeli rock band Ouzo Bazooka; and the seven piece contemporary folk music band Skipper's Alley from Ireland, all coupled with <b>a</b> <b>sensational</b> star night featuring Dead By April from Sweden, escalated the first Global Music festival to produce <b>a</b> <b>sensational</b> boom.

25|$|The Patriots drafted Curtis Martin in {{the third}} round of the 1995 NFL Draft, giving the team its best running back in decades.

25|$|Ventures {{into the}} genre by writers {{who were not}} devoted {{exclusively}} to science fiction also added respectability.

5000|$|Paradoxically, another {{property}} commonly {{attributed to}} news is sensationalism, the disproportionate focus on, and exaggeration of, emotive stories for public consumption.

25|$|The {{projection}} of Sanders {{into the national}} public spotlight resulted from <b>a</b> <b>sensational</b> newspaper article in 1969 {{which led to the}} romanticised biography, King of the Witches, by June Johns in 1969, and the film Legend of the Witches (1970).

40|$|In Rossano di Vaglio (Calabria, Italy) {{the goddess}} Metis is called “Utiana”, and Lejeune {{said that the}} {{adjective}} “n’est porteur d’aucune observation sur les attribut de la déesse”. <b>As</b> <b>sensational</b> as it may be, this assertion has never been conveniently grasped nor discussed. On the basis of Lejeune’s authoritative suggestions, scholars have accepted this interpretation despite its back of pertinent reconstructive evidence, and have taken his hypothesis of a *touto utianomholding the patronage of the sanctuary as reliable. But our starting question is: in which onomastic category is a form such as Utianaincluded? Infact, when referring to Metis Utiana’s name, there is evidence for the insistence, {{in the area of}} Rossano di Vaglio, of outcomes referring to an Indo-European (hydronymic) onomastic system (Utiana, Utilia, Vaglio), as well as contextual outcomes referring to an onomastic, yet hydronymic condition (Rossano, Ursano) which appears to be at least alternative to the other...|$|R
