40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern all over the world about {{contamination}} of ground water with Arsenic. One of the major repercussions of arsenic contamination is degradation of <b>animal</b> <b>hygiene</b> that ultimately affects sustainable livestock production. The reports suggest that concentration of Arsenic in ground water of twenty one countries is well above the guideline values. Use of such contaminated water for animal husbandry and livestock production compromises with the hygienic value of animal products. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop low cost treatment technologies for reducing the level of arsenic in ground water to maintain the hygiene and sustainability of livestock production. Most of the traditional treatment technologies are costly and less effective in reducing arsenic concentration to safer limits. Therefore, during present study, an attempt was made to design a low-cost algal adsorbent based filtration unit consisting of polyurethane columns with entrapped algal adsorbents. The column was made of adsorbents of algal origin like agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium alginate and Spirulina platensis biomass entrapped in polyurethane foam matrix. The performance of the column was assessed in terms of removal efficiency and the quantity of metal sequestered in unit time interval. The results from the study the show that algal biosorbents and S. platensis biomass combination has a capacity to adsorbed arsenic from aqueous solution. The simple design, easy fabrication and no energy requirement for the operation of the filtration unit developed under the present study is suitable to rural areas where arsenic contamination of ground water is adversely affecting the <b>animal</b> <b>hygiene</b> and sustained livestock production...|$|E
40|$|Sand, {{compost and}} {{recycled}} manure solids are used on some commercial farms as bedding material in cubicles {{as an alternative}} to conventional straw mattresses or soft rubber mats. The aim of the present studies was to evaluate these bedding materials in dairy-cow cubicles in terms of process engineering, <b>animal</b> welfare, <b>hygiene,</b> work economics and farm management. From an animal welfare and hygienic point of view, these mentioned materials are recognized as safe. Where sand is used as bedding, the working-time requirement for cubicle maintenance is comparable to that for soft rubber mats; where compost and recycled manure solids are used, it is comparable to that for straw mattresses. The material costs for sand are high, whilst those for compost are low. Investment in a liquid manure separator is only worthwhile for relatively large farms or for use in farming collectives...|$|R
40|$|Risk-based meat {{examination}} is a {{new scientific}} and practical approach to improve the tradi-tional veterinarian meat inspection procedures at the abattoir {{within the scope of}} the overall food chain-orientated concept of meat production. The objective of the concept is {{to ensure the safety of}} meat as a food along the entire production and distribution chain by introducing suitable measures, such as <b>animal</b> housing <b>hygiene,</b> livestock health monitoring at the farm, hygienic transport and slaughtering conditions etc. With risk-based meat inspection, there is no obligation any more to cut the tonsils and larynx of the animal carcase. This is because the currently significant risks for human health cannot be recognized with the classical ana-tomical-pathological incision method. The infection or colonization of livestock or contamina-tion of animal carcases with certain zoonotic pathogens relevant to humans, such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and other bacteria, cannot be recognized by incision. Nor can risks caused by contaminants in feeds or residues of veterinary medicinal products identified by cutting certain lymphnodes...|$|R

These village schools however received much less funding than the privileged European schools, thus the quality of education provided is often lacking.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Haemophilus parasuis is {{a common}} {{epiphyte}} of the upper respiratory tract of pigs. The factors of H. parasuis pathogenicity that enable some strains to be virulent and consequently cause a clinical disease have not been established yet. Fifteen serovars of H. parasuis have been described at present. Individual serovars differ in virulence, and considerable differences in virulence also exist within each serovar. Virulent strains can particularly participate as microorganisms secondary to pneumonia, cause septicaemia without polyserositis or Glässer’s disease characterized by polyserositis, pericarditis, arthritis and meningitis. Clinical symptoms of this disease are highly variable. Therefore, culture detection of causative agent, particularly from the brain, joints and polyserositis is an essential diagnostic tool. The disease caused by H. parasuis can be treated with antibiotics; however, oral or parenteral administration of very high doses of antibiotics is necessary. The level of <b>animal</b> <b>hygiene</b> and animal husbandry are important factors for prevention of this disease. Commercial or autogenous vaccines {{can be used in}} the immunoprophylaxis of pre-parturient sows and their progeny after weaning. For the production of auto-genous vaccines, it is most effective to use isolates from animals with lesions present in CNS.

40|$|In this study, we {{conducted}} an investigation {{to determine the}} true prevalence of bovine and ovine brucellosis incentral-eastern Tunisia. A total of 1134 veterinary samples taken from 130 ruminant herds were screened for brucellosis using IS 711 -based real-time PCR assay. Sera collected from the ruminants were tested using the Rose Bengal test and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Based on serological and molecular results, the true adjusted animal population level prevalence was 23. 5 % in cattle, against 13. 5 % in sheep. In addition, the true adjusted herd level prevalence of brucellosis was 55. 6 % in cattle and 21. 8 % in sheep. A statistically significant association was found between vaginal and milk shedding for ruminants. In addition, our results showed that Brucella abortus could be responsible for bovine and ovine brucellosis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis at the animal population level indicated that age and origin variables were important risk factors for cattle. However, age and abortion variables {{were found to be}} associated with ovine brucellosis. At the herd level, risk factors for Brucella positivity were as follows: abortion and herd composition for cattle against herd composition, mortality rates, and hygiene for sheep. <b>Animal</b> <b>hygiene,</b> food quality, and sanitary practices on the farm should be applied as strategies to control brucellosisin herds...|$|E

40|$|The welfare, {{health and}} {{management}} of farm animals as well as environmental concerns are relevant issues that impact {{the success of the}} producer in the market and need to be considered to increase public and consumer acceptance. Criteria for the assessment of housing and management systems have been proposed by several groups and minimal standards for <b>animal</b> welfare, <b>hygiene</b> and environmental stewardship are already implemented in the legislation of most European countries. Issues of animal welfare, health and environmental care are often dealt with separately. As it can be foreseen that housing and management conditions will be increasingly regulated in future, a documentation and certification process that safeguards all requirements is needed. Concepts for the assessment of animal housing and management according to welfare and environmental criteria are proposed as part of a quality assurance scheme according to international standards. Based on these concepts, critical control points (CCP) and critical management points (CMP) have been developed for the categories health, behaviour, management and environmental impact. These criteria were first established to be used primarily by the farmer as an internal on-farm assessment scheme. However, they can als...|$|R
