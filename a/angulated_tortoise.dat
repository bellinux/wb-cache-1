40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhD (Biodiversity and Conservation Biology) Nearly {{one-third of}} the world’s {{tortoises}} live in South Africa, but {{little is known about}} their habitat requirements and feeding ecology. Chersina angulata, the <b>angulate</b> <b>tortoise,</b> is endemic to southern Africa, with a wide distribution along the western and southern coasts. Because this tortoise occupies a number of different habitat types, it has always been considered a generalist herbivore, although little is known about its diet and other needs. This study evaluates the habitat characteristics and feeding ecology of C. angulata at two study sites in the southwestern Cape, the West Coast National Park (WCNP) and Dassen Island (DI). The WCNP is a large conserved area in the Fynbos biome, along the southwestern coast of South Africa, whereas DI is a small offshore island with low floral and faunal diversity, just south of the WCNP. The efficacy of three methods used to study the feeding ecology of herbivores, focal observations, macroscopic faecal analysis and histological analysis of scats, was evaluated. Plant cover, species diversity, and the variety of growth forms were substantially larger at the WCNP than on DI. In the WCNP, shrubs and grasses were the dominant growth forms but the vegetation also included herbs, succulents, restios, sedges and parasitic plants. A few perennial species such as the grass Ehrharta villosa, shrubs such as Helichrysum niveum, Nylandtia spinosa and Rhus spp., and succulents such as Carpobrotus edulis and Ruschia spp., provided most of the plant cover. DI had a depauperate flora, consisting of succulents and herbs, and ephemeral plants contributed more than perennials did to plant cover throughout the year. The succulents Mesembryanthemum crystallinum and Tetragonia fruticosa provided most of the cover on DI. <b>Angulate</b> <b>tortoises</b> are herbivores and 72 diet plants in 32 plant families were identified to the species or genus level. Several diet species, however, could not be identified. In addition to angiosperms, the tortoises’ diet included mosses, mushrooms, insects,snails and animal faeces. The most important growth forms in the diet were herbs and grasses. The diet of the WCNP tortoises was more diverse than the diet of DI tortoises, but the number of principal food items in the diet did not differ between the two sites. Over an annual cycle, WCNP tortoises had four principal food plants while DI tortoises had five principal food plants. At both sites, principal food plants changed with the season and few plants remained principal food items in more than one season. Cynodon dactylon was a principal food item in three of the four seasons in the WCNP, whereas Trachyandra divaricata was a principal food plant each season on DI. Most principal food plants were grass or herb species but the sedge Ficinia nigrescens, and a succulent that could be identified only to the family level (Aizoaceae), featured strongly in the spring diets of DI and WCNP tortoises, respectively. The three study methods did not provide the same type or quality of information about the feeding ecology of <b>angulate</b> <b>tortoises.</b> The small size and wary nature of <b>angulate</b> <b>tortoises</b> compromised focal studies because it was often not possible to see what the tortoises ate. This method, however, provided the interesting observation that rabbit faecal pellets contributed nearly 30 % to summer and autumn diets on DI when food was scarce. Rabbit faeces may not only provide a source of nutrients but may also supplement the microflora, required to digest cellulose, in the tortoises’ guts. Macroscopic evaluation of the tortoises’ scats appeared to be an ineffective method to identify diet plants, and the bulk of the scat mass could not be identified. This indicates that <b>angulate</b> <b>tortoises</b> either selected food low in fibrous content or that the digestive system of the tortoises dealt efficiently with tough plant material. The macroscopic method was the only method that highlighted the large contribution of fruits / seeds to the diet of <b>angulate</b> <b>tortoises.</b> Since the tortoises digested many seeds only partially, or not at all, C. angulata is potentially an important agent of seed dispersal in the southwestern Cape. The macroscopic study showed that on DI, sand made up 28 % of the scat mass in spring, whereas sand never made a substantial contribution to the scat composition of WCNP tortoises. Lithophagy may be an important strategy in a depauperate habitat, such as DI, because the abrasive action of sand may help with the digestion of tough plants, or the sand may provide the tortoises with important minerals that are deficient in their food plants. The histological analysis of scats provided the most comprehensive diet list for C. angulata. Selection indices based on data from the histological analysis indicated that <b>angulate</b> <b>tortoises</b> were highly selective in their food choice. Most of the principal food items were selected out of proportion to their availability and the tortoises avoided the most abundant plants in their habitats. Several factors, such as palatability, accessibility and profitability, may have influenced their food choice. The proportional similarity indices for WCNP and DI tortoises, respectively, were 0. 31 and 0. 16, confirming that C. angulata is a food specialist and not a food generalist as was previously thought. This factor should be considered in the management of this species and in future conservation planning of its habitat. South Afric...|$|R

40|$|Fencing, {{particularly}} electric fencing, {{is widely}} used across South Africa for livestock and game ranching practices. Recent studies found that leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) {{are more prone to}} dying from electrocution along electric fences than any other taxa. However, no studies have quantified tortoise mortality along non-electric fences or assessed the impact of fence structure. With South Africa being home to more tortoise species {{than anywhere else in the}} world, thus is a conservation concern. This study quantifies tortoise mortalities associated with electrified and non-electrified fences and relates these rates to fence structure (mesh or strand). Open veld transects are used as controls to estimate background mortality. This study also reports the distribution and abundance of different fence types along 2200 km of roads in the southeastern Karoo, allowing the cumulative impacts of different fence types to be estimated. All fence types had significantly higher tortoise mortalities than open veld transects. Leopard tortoise mortalities were significantly higher along electric fences than non-electric fences. Despite forming only approximately 4 % of all roadside fencing, electric fences account for 56 % of leopard tortoise mortalities. This study validates concern for increased electric fence use in the future and the potential impacts on leopard tortoises. When considering the current abundance of fence types and their associated mortalities, the total number of leopard tortoise mortalities along electric and non-electric fences are similar. <b>Angulate</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Chersina angulata) mortalities were significantly higher along mesh fences than strand fences, but did not differ between electric and non-electric fences. <b>Angulate</b> <b>tortoises</b> appear to wedge themselves in mesh fences and are unable to escape. This study highlights the current threat of non-electric fencing on tortoises as no similar findings have been reported. These additional tortoise mortalities should be considered alongside other emerging threats when questioning the longevity of these tortoise populations, not only in the Karoo, but globally. The implementation and practicality of previously suggested mitigation strategies are discussed and alternative mitigation strategies are suggested. This study concludes that raising of the electric strands is impractical and the implementation of rock aprons are ineffective. Live tortoises displayed active behavior when temperature was above 20 °C, thus thermostatic switches for electric fences could potentially reduce tortoise mortalities without compromising fences function...|$|R

40|$|The phylogeographic {{structure}} of the monotypic endemic southern African <b>angulate</b> <b>tortoise</b> Chersina angulata was investigated throughout its distribution {{with the use of}} partial sequences from three mtDNA loci (COI, cyt b and ND 4). Phylogeographic and phylogenetic structuring obtained for the three mtDNA markers were highly congruent and suggested the presence of two genetically distinct, reciprocally monophyletic evolutionary lineages. Group one contained two subclades with haplotypes from the north-western Cape and south-western Cape, respectively, while haplotypes from the southern Cape comprised group two. The two major clades were separated by nine and eight mutational steps for COI and ND 4, respectively. Of the three mtDNA gene regions examined, the ND 4 partial sequence contained the most phylogenetic signal. Haplotype diversity was generally low and we recovered 34 haplotypes for the 125 animals sequenced for the ND 4 subunit. Nested clade analyses performed on the variable ND 4 partial sequences suggested the presence of two major refugial areas for this species. The demographic history of the taxon was characterised by range expansion and prolonged historical fragmentation. Divergence time estimates suggest that the temporal and spatial distribution of the taxon was sculpted by changes in temperature and rainfall patterns since the late Miocene. Corroborative evidence from other reptiles is also suggestive of a late Miocene divergence, indicating that this was a major epoch for cladogenesis in southern Africa. Apart from the genetic differences between the two major clades, we also note morphometric and behavioural differences, alluding to the presence of two putative taxa nested within C. angulata. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Tortoises {{are one of}} {{the most}} common faunal {{components}} at many Palaeolithic archaeological sites across the Old World. They provide protein, fat, and other 2 ̆ 7 animal 2 ̆ 7 resources in a 2 ̆ 7 collectable 2 ̆ 7 package. However, for most sites their interpretation as human food debris is based only on association, rather than demonstrated through taphonomic analysis. Because of their very different anatomical configuration compared to mammals, it is difficult to conduct such analyses by directly applying the taphonomic methods used to interpret large mammal assemblages. Tortoise-specific taphonomic analysis is presented here for the Still Bay layers at the important Middle Stone Age (MSA) site of Blombos Cave (BBC), Western Cape, South Africa. Research on MSA subsistence systems at sites such as BBC has almost exclusively relied on analysis of large ungulate remains, in spite of the fact that many of these key sites contain equal or greater numbers of tortoise fragments. In this analysis we show that human modification is common on the BBC tortoises, and that there are consistent patterns of fragmentation and burning that indicate set processing sequences including cooking while in the shell, hammerstone percussion, and human chewing of limbs. The almost exclusive dominance of the <b>angulate</b> <b>tortoise,</b> Chersina angulata, is confirmed by full skeletal element analyses rather than only counts of single elements such as humeri. The sex distribution can be reconstructed for this species, and is female-biased. For all tortoise assemblages, taxonomic and skeletal element abundance data should be calculated from a sample of complete elements, or at minimum the entoplastron and humerus. A sample of shell and limb/girdle elements should also be subjected to microscopic bone surface modification analysis, as modifications are often rare or subtle but highly informative. Using this approach, analysis of breakage patterns, bone surface modification, and burning patterns can be understood together to specifically reconstruct tortoise collection, processing, and human dietary significance across a range of archaeological sites...|$|R
5000|$|In South Africa, the commonest foods were (in {{descending}} order of preference): Cape hyrax, Smith's red rock hare (Pronolagus rupertris), meerkat, mountain reedbuck (Redunca fulvorufula), goats and sheep, scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis), Cape francolin (Francolinus capensis), helmeted guineafowl(Numida meleagris), yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata) and <b>Angulate</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Chersina angulata). In “poor food areas” of the Matobo Hills, three nests included 53.6% hyrax, 10.7% cane-rats, 7.1% monkeys, 7.1% mongoose and 3.6% antelope. [...] From 1997 to 2005 {{in the same}} area, non-hyrax prey (each representing less than 10 out of 1550 prey items at nests) included white-tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda), steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), domestic goat, vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), Jameson's red rock hare (Pronolagus randensis), helmeted guineafowl, Swainson's francolin (Pternistis swainsonii), Natal francolin (Pternistis natalensis), southern red-billed hornbill (Tockus rufirostris), rock pigeon (Columba livia), white-necked raven (Corvus albicollis), leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) and giant plated lizard (Gerrhosaurus validus). In the Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden of South Africa, the primary prey found around nests after a perceptible hyrax decline has become helmeted guineafowl and francolins, followed by cane rats, rabbits and dikdiks (Rhynchotragus ssp.).

[...] A study of the taking of domestic lambs in the Karoo found only two cases of lambs being eaten by Verreaux's eagle and these were already dead when carried off. This contrasts with the golden eagle, which in some areas may eat many dead lambs and occasionally hunt lives ones. Although any prey weighing over 4.5 kg is rarely taken, some ungulates hunted by Verreaux's eagles can be considerably larger. Klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) lambs brought to the nest have weighed up to 12 kg. A Verreaux's eagle was observed to hunt and kill a mountain reedbuck lamb estimated to weigh 15 kg.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references.. The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to study human {{adaptation}} in a desert environment during the Later Stone Age. Nine open-air sites from the coastal desert of Namaqualand, South Africa were excavated and analysed with the focus on identifying settlement patterns and subsistence strategies {{within the context of}} a desert environment. Using radiocarbon dates and palaeoenvironmental indices, it was noted that most occupation of the region is linked to periods that were cooler and wetter than today. There is more evidence for occupation after the mid-Holocene warm phase, although there is a notable dearth of sites dating to the Medieval Warm Epoch, and a significant increase during the Little Ice Age. Using faunal and stable isotope analysis, it was found that people ate mixed diets that included both marine and terrestrial species; there is little evidence of heavy reliance on marine food as documented elsewhere along the South African coastline in the late Holocene. The overwhelming dominance of short-stay sites with limited ranges of artefacts suggest that settlement patterns were very mobile, with the paucity of water as a potential catalyst. While people from other areas dealt with increasing population pressure in recent millennia by becoming more sedentary and perhaps utilising delayed-returns strategies, there is little evidence to suggest that the carrying capacity of Namaqualand was being tested. In addition, this region has been suggested as one of the points of entry for pastoralism and pottery into South Africa. There is, however, no evidence for substantial changes in economy or material culture in the last 2000 years, so these items probably arrived at the Namaqualand coast through diffusion rather than migration. In addition, this research has, for the first time, identified special-purpose sites where people mass harvested springbok (Antidorcas marsupia/is), African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) and <b>angulate</b> <b>tortoises</b> (Chersina angulata). There is also evidence for intentional human hunting/collecting of micromammals, so that humans should be included in the classification system developed by Andrews (1990) as a category 5 predator.

40|$|Many {{species in}} a wide variety of taxonomic groups have shown shifts in their {{distribution}} ranges in recent decades. Rapidly changing distributions may lead to novel biotic interactions between species that have not historically interacted. As generalist predators, corvids are a potential threat to other species in areas where they have recently colonized or where their numbers have increased. Tortoise species appear to be one taxonomic group that may potentially suffer serious negative effects from increased corvid abundance. One species of corvid which has shown a significant range increase in the last two decades in western South Africa is the Pied Crow (Corvus albus). In conjunction with this expansion have come observed accounts of large numbers of tortoises being found depredated under Pied Crow nests, raising concerns over their impact on tortoises in these areas. Southern Africa has the richest biodiversity of tortoises in the world and a high rate of endemism. The endemic species are mainly restricted to the Cape region, where the genera Chersina, Homopus and Psammobates have their evolutionary centre. In this thesis, I explore how widespread tortoise predation by Pied Crows was during the crow's breeding season. I aimed to quantify the proportion of Pied Crow pairs that provision tortoise to their chicks and the numbers being depredated, as well as the species of tortoises involved. During the 2016 breeding season, I monitored 125 active Pied Crow nests in western South Africa. For the majority of these nests (n= 93) there was no evidence for any tortoise predation. For the 32 pairs, where predation was recorded, I found that 15 pairs depredated ≤ 1 tortoise – week, five pairs depredated depredated between 1 and 2 tortoise–week, and 12 pairs depredated > 2 tortoises–week. The tortoises prey remains found depredated depredated under Pied Crow nests had an average straight carapace length of 5. 57 cm (range 3. 5 cm - 9. 8 cm) and 91 % of them were <b>Angulate</b> <b>Tortoises.</b> Crows favour smaller tortoises with impacts for smaller species, or younger age classes. I also explored whether any environmental variables explained probability of tortoise predation or predation rates. Environmental variables examined included weather variables, land cover types, distances to roads and primary productivity values, and for a subset of nests the abundance of tortoises counted from transects. Although predation rate showed spatial variation among the study areas with most predation occurring in arid areas with high mean temperatures and low rainfall, no single environmental variable successfully predicted the variation in spatial predation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} utility of stable light {{isotopes}} in Chersina angulata (<b>angulate</b> or bowsprit <b>tortoise)</b> bone collagen as a paleoenvironmental proxy, to augment the limited range of proxies preserved in Southern Africa. δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N were measured in 76 archaeological tortoises from Elands Bay Cave and nearby Tortoise Cave. The samples {{range in age from}} the late Holocene to the terminal Pleistocene. δ¹⁵N values are not strongly correlated with δ¹³C, indicating different drivers of variation in the two isotopes. δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values are lower between 154 - 487 cal. BP, which spans the Little Ice Age, compared with 744 - 1 042 cal. BP, which is the period of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). This implies that conditions were cool and wet during the LIA, and hot and dry during the early MCA. δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values were higher during {{the early stages of the}} MCA (744 - 1 042 cal. BP), indicating drier conditions than in the late MCA (547 - 669 cal. BP). In the period prior to the MCA (1180 - 1357 cal. BP), lower δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values indicate cooler, moister conditions. Higher δ 13 C values also indicate a temperature increase at the beginning of the Middle Holocene (4005 - 5 720 cal. BP). These findings are generally consistent with existing paleoenvironmental records from the Cederberg and Elands Bay region. The paleoenvironmental record generated from the tortoise carapace and plastron bone provides the first evidence from the terrestrial archaeological record for the LIA and MCA at Elands Bay. Hence, the tortoise record is able to provide a more detailed climate record than the charcoal and faunal record at EBC.
