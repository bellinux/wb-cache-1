In 1926 the gasworks closed and was replaced by an electrical generator elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor grounds, and the track of the spur was removed.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{determination}} of <b>a</b> <b>shortest</b> addition chain is hard: no efficient optimal methods are currently known for arbitrary exponents, and the related problem of finding <b>a</b> <b>shortest</b> addition chain for a given set of exponents has been proven NP-complete. Even given <b>a</b> <b>shortest</b> chain, addition-chain exponentiation requires more memory than the binary method, because it must potentially store many previous exponents from the chain. So in practice, shortest addition-chain exponentiation is primarily used for small fixed exponents for which <b>a</b> <b>shortest</b> chain can be precomputed and is not too large.|$|R
5|$|Alabama {{started their}} second drive with <b>a</b> <b>short</b> gain and an incompletion, and then McCarron then threw a 19-yard pass to Maze {{for a first}} down. The Crimson Tide gained another pair of first downs with a Maze {{reception}} and three runs each from Richardson and Eddie Lacy before the drive stalled at the LSU 33. Again Foster missed a field goal, this time from 50-yards, and the game remained tied at zero. On the next LSU possession, Ware had <b>a</b> <b>short</b> gain and Lee completed <b>a</b> <b>short</b> pass to Russell Shepard before he threw an interception to Robert Lester at the Alabama 47-yard line. The Crimson Tide then began their third offensive series with a 19-yard completion from McCarron to Darius Hanks {{before the end of}} the first quarter.|$|E

5|$|NY5 {{enters the}} city of Utica on a {{concurrency}} with NY12 heading in a northeast direction. It shortly picks up NY8, and all three cross the city together. NY5 also intersects with the terminus of NY840 at this point. Just south of the New York State Thruway, I-790 begins as <b>a</b> <b>short</b> expressway, also including NY5, NY8, and NY12. After crossing out of the city, they meet the Thruway, with NY8 and12 continuing northeast, while I-790 and NY5 turn to the east-south-east, picking up the tail-end of NY49. These three, still as an expressway, straddle {{each side of the}} Thruway for <b>a</b> <b>short</b> way, with I-790 technically ending at the ramps for I-90. NY5 continues {{to the end of the}} expressway, only a few hundred feet later, dropping to Leland Avenue. A few hundred feet to the north of the Thruway, NY5 turns eastward again to continue down Herkimer Road. It closely parallels the Thruway all the way to Herkimer, where NY5 moves slightly northward through the center of the village, becoming State Street, while I-90 crosses the Erie Canal and goes south for <b>a</b> <b>short</b> distance. There is <b>a</b> <b>short</b> concurrency with NY28 in the village.|$|E
5|$|Now in the Erie County town of Wales, NY78 changes monikers from Main Street to Strykersville Road, {{paralleling}} Buffalo Creek northwest {{through the}} rural section of Wales. <b>A</b> <b>short</b> distance northwest, NY78 intersects with CR175 (Center Line Road), which {{connects to the}} Wyoming County line <b>a</b> <b>short</b> distance east. For <b>a</b> <b>short</b> distance after the intersection, the two routes parallel, with NY78 bypassing the hamlet of Wales Hollow and intersecting with the northern terminus of CR387 (East Creek Road). Still known as Strykersville Road, NY78 parallels Buffalo Creek into the southern terminus of CR385 (Schang Road). The two-lane rural roadway remains the same for several miles to the northwest, crossing an intersection with CR382 (Hunters Creek Road).|$|E
