The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show would give me so much exposure. It's great because people have grown with me, even with that damn song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible like that. Because of that song, it actually inspired me to do my own musical animated artist because <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> I was Kim Possible." [...] Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E

They went, 'Oh! This seems like the best one so far.'" [...] The song peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 18 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. Although the album's follow-up singles would find more success on the rock charts, [...] "Alive" [...] was nevertheless important in bringing attention to the band.

And I didn't want {{to be one of those}} guys, but <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> that it was the right time -- and it did turn out to be that.

2500|$|Dog Man Star was {{released}} in the UK 10 October 1994, and entered the UK Albums Chart at no. 3. In response to the lower charting than the previous album, Anderson said: [...] "I felt that it didn't get the commercial success it deserved, it got the critical success. I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> the band had split up because Bernard had left." [...] Lead single [...] "We Are the Pigs", peaked at 18, plunging to 38 the following week. The choice of lead single had been a subject of debate, with Sony wanting to release [...] "New Generation" [...] first for commercial reasons. However, Anderson disagreed as he felt that it lacked the drama that represented the album. Second single, [...] "The Wild Ones" [...] also peaked at no. 18. The third single [...] "New Generation" [...] charted at no. 21. [...] "The Power", the proposed fourth single, set for release May of 1995 never materialised.|$|E

I still feel good, and I think because of all that I’ll never be complacent. I feel like I want to prove myself even more, and prove a lot of people wrong. Everything happens for a reason, though." [...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can tell by the cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He can tell when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E
