5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, baby carrots or mini-carrots (carrots {{that have been}} peeled <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> uniform cylinders) have been a popular ready-to-eat snack food {{available}} in many supermarkets. Carrots are puréed and used as baby food, dehydrated to make chips, flakes, and powder, and thinly sliced and deep-fried, like potato chips.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{have been}} raised in the Llŷn Peninsula for over a {{thousand}} years, and Aberdaron has produced and exported wool for many years. The main product locally was felt, produced by soaking the cloth in water and beating it with large wooden paddles until the wool formed a thick mat which could be flattened, dried <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> lengths. There were two fulling mills on the Afon Daron, in addition to three corn mills, and lichen was gathered around Y Rhiw, from which a grey dye was extracted. Arable crops consisted mainly of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. The field boundaries date back several centuries and are marked by walls, cloddiau and hedgerows; important habitats {{for a variety of}} wildlife.|$|E
5|$|The central {{window of}} the North Aisle is a World War II {{memorial}} and a World War I memorial {{is on the other}} side. The Moores Chantry Chapel (or Moor Hayes Chapel) occupying the easternmost bay of the North Aisle, was built by the Moor (alias Moore) family, long resident at Moor Hayes within the parish, and contains some original box pews. At the rear (western end) of the church are two large pieces of oak which make up a Golgotha which once rested on top of the Rood Screen. They are carved with rocks, skulls and bones. They were probably removed from the church in 1549 <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> 2 pieces. For many years they remained in the graveyard.|$|E

5|$|The {{demolition}} of the arcades of Freedom Square began in October 2010. Excavation {{works for the}} foundations of the Parliament House began soon after demolition was complete. In early 2011, the original plan was modified with the relocation of a staircase, the extension of one of the blocks, and changes {{in the design of the}} louvers on the facade. Construction started later that year, and the steel frame of the structure was complete by early 2012. At this point, it began to be covered in limestone which had been quarried in Gozo, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> specific shapes in Italy, before being sent back to Malta. Between 120 and 150 workers were on the construction site every day, and it cost more than €90 million to build.|$|E
5|$|Totti's {{years under}} Zdeněk Zeman {{represented}} {{a period of}} both physical and mental maturation as a player. From a technical and tactical standpoint, he proved to be compatible on the left wing in the rigid formations of the Bohemian coach, as his new role gave him more space to take on defenders in one on one situations, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> the centre to shoot on goal with his stronger foot; he also became physically more powerful, fit, hard-working, and complete. He displayed a greater responsibility for the team, and was presented with the number 10 jersey. His first season under Zeman started well, with Totti {{taking advantage of a}} 4–3–3 formation and making his breakthrough with the club. He finished the league season reaching double figures in goals scored {{for the first time in}} his career; including a goal in the club's 2–0 away win against Napoli on 22 February 1998, Totti scored 13 goals in Serie A in total, and contributed to Roma's fourth place league finish that year. Although he was not called up for the 1998 FIFA World Cup by Italy manager Cesare Maldini, his consistent performances, creativity and goalscoring throughout the course of the previous Serie A season saw him being awarded the Guerin d'Oro for the 1997–98 season, given to him for having achieved the highest average rating of any Serie A player. The following season, he began to gain recognition as a club symbol and as a leader, and on 31 October 1998, Totti became the official team captain, and the youngest Serie A club captain ever at the age of 22, inheriting the armband from Aldair. On 29 November 1998, Totti scored the equalising goal in a 3–3 draw against cross-city rivals Lazio; this was his first ever goal in the Rome Derby. Overall, he scored 30 goals and provided 26 assists during Zeman's two-year managerial stint. For his performances, he was named the Serie A Young Footballer of the Year for the 1998–99 season.|$|E

25|$|The first {{methods for}} finding out {{genetics}} used for DNA profiling involved RFLP analysis. DNA is collected from cells, {{such as a}} blood sample, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> small pieces using a restriction enzyme (a restriction digest). This generates thousands of DNA fragments of differing sizes {{as a consequence of}} variations between DNA sequences of different individuals. The fragments are then separated on the basis of size using gel electrophoresis.|$|E
25|$|After the {{insulation}} period, the soap is firm {{enough to be}} removed from the mold <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> bars. At this time, it is safe to use the soap, since saponification is in essence complete. However, cold-process soaps are typically cured and hardened on a drying rack for 2–6 weeks before use. During this cure period, trace amounts of residual lye are consumed by saponification and excess water evaporates.|$|E

25|$|A graham cracker is cookie or {{digestive}} biscuit {{made with}} graham flour, {{a combination of}} fine-ground white flour and coarse-ground wheat bran and germ. Graham crackers are often used for making s'mores and pie crusts. Graham bread was invented by a Presbyterian minister, Reverend Sylvester Graham in 1829, for his vegetarian diet. The Graham bread was high in fiber, made with non-sifted whole wheat flour <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> little squares now known as graham crackers.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} process of TV dinners is highly automated and undergoes three major steps. Those steps are food preparation, tray loading, and freezing. During food preparation, {{vegetables and fruits}} are usually placed on a movable belt and washed, then are placed into a container to be steamed or boiled for 1–3 minutes. This process {{is referred to as}} blanching, and is used as a method to destroy enzymes in the food that can cause chemical changes negatively affecting overall flavor and color of the fruit and vegetables. As for meats, prior to cooking, they are trimmed of fat <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> proper sizes. The fish is usually cleaned <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> fillets, and poultry is usually washed thoroughly and dressed. Meats are then seasoned, placed on trays, and are cooked in an oven for a predetermined amount of time. After all the food is ready to be packaged, it is sent to the filling lines. The food is placed in its compartments as the trays pass under numerous filling machines; to ensure that every packaged dinner gets an equal amount of food, the filling devices are strictly regulated.|$|E
25|$|While the {{denominations}} from 1c to 1-dollar {{were printed}} with plates of 400 subjects <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> sheets of 100 stamps {{for sale at}} the post office, the 2 and 5-dollars issues were printed with plates of 100 subjects, did not require cutting into separate sheets and were issued as is. Consequently there are no 2 and 5-dollar stamps with straight edges. By contrast, all the lower- denomination stamps are found in straight edged examples, produced when the sheets were cut in quarters.|$|E

25|$|Solifugae are {{carnivorous}} or omnivorous, {{with most}} species feeding on termites, darkling beetles, {{and other small}} arthropods; however, solifugae have been videotaped consuming larger prey, such as lizards. Prey is located with the pedipalps and killed <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> pieces by the chelicerae. The prey is then liquefied and the liquid ingested through the pharynx. Reproduction can involve direct or indirect sperm transfer; when indirect, the male emits a spermatophore {{on the ground and}} then inserts it with his chelicerae in the female's genital pore.|$|E
25|$|Solifugae are {{carnivorous}} or omnivorous, {{with most}} species feeding on termites, darkling beetles, and other small, ground-dwelling arthropods.

25|$|The {{price of}} energy inputs and the {{environmental}} costs of every nuclear power plant continue long after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Both nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities must be decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses. After a cooling-off period that may {{last as long as}} a century, reactors must be dismantled <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> small pieces to be packed in containers for final disposal. The process is very expensive, time-consuming, dangerous for workers, hazardous to the natural environment, and presents new opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.|$|E
