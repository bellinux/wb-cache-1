Due to this slow process the mitigation of climate change does not take the most effective path. In the literature general models for diffusion are given, but specific factors affecting the adoption of new technologies <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>studied</b> <b>enough.</b> Since the affecting factors are not explored, the technological substitution cannot be triggered purposefully. Therefore the aim of our research is to propose the model of technological substitution. The methodology used combines a white-box and black-box modelling approaches. As white-box model the system dynamics is used, and as the black-box artificial neural networks. Since each of these methodologies have got specific strength and weakness, by combining those methods comprehensive modelling tool is obtained. Due to our knowledge {{this is the first}} attempt to model the technological substitution process by hybrid modelling, which includes system dynamics and artificial neural networks. The obtained results show that the model can explain 89 % of the systems behaviour. Although the model was based on the one specific technological substitution process, its general application to other products and services is possible, since the developed model is fully outlined and can be used for further research of other processe...|$|E

These series are obtained by means of separation of variables, which differs from a classic method of separation of variables and is especially convenient for solving various inverse thermo-physical problems.

Determination of heat transfer rule between a solid and its surroundings or environment is one of the inverse thermo-physical problems. Heat transfer rule can be determined much easier if average temperature of a solid and its rate of change are known. There is a way how average temperature of a solid can be found is described. When discussing inverse thermal conductivity problems, temperature measurements at the simplest possible temperature field mathematically in laboratory conditions are used as input data Therefore, a one-dimensional symmetric temperature field is described.

40|$|Purpose. Graphitized steels are alloys, {{in which}} carbon is partly {{in form of}} {{graphite}} inclusions. Due to this such steels possess good antifriction properties, wear resistance, heat conductivity {{and a variety of}} other mechanical properties, which decently distinguish them from cast irons. However, such steels <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>studied</b> <b>enough</b> and practically are not used in mechanical engineering. Purpose of the work is the research of the possibility of wear resistance increase for graphitized steels in the conditions of metal-to-metal dry friction sliding to use them in the railway systems. Methodology. Graphitized hypoeutectoid, eutectoid and hypereutectoid steels have been used as a research material. Experimental alloys have been studied in the condition after thermal hardening. Hardness of alloys has been determined by the Vickers method. Wear resistance of steels has been studied in the conditions of metal-to-metal dry friction sliding with the use of МI- 1 friction machine (disk to disk). Findings. Data, which allow assessing the wear resistance of experimental graphitized steels depending on carbon, silicon and copper content have been obtained in this work. The regression dependence obtained as a result of statistical processing of the experimental data allowed determining an optimal chemical content of the steel, which is characterized by high wear resistance. Originality. A dependence describing carbon, silicon and copper content on the specimen's weight loss during metal-to-metal dry friction tests has been obtained in the work. Practical value. The optimized content of the graphitized steel can be used for production of products working in the conditions of wear such as brake blocks of rolling stock, separators of high-speed bearings, dies and others...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of greenhouse culture in Japan is outstanding. In 1992 the total greenhouse area reached to 58, 300 ha. Consumptive use of water inside the greenhouses <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>studied</b> <b>enough</b> inspite of the {{development of}} greenhouse culture. In this paper, we discussed about the characteristic features of meterological conditions related to evapotranspiration, refering to the data observed in closed and partly opened greenhouses. Regression coefficients were calculated on humidity, temperature, solar radiation and windspeed between the inside and the outside of greenhouse. The meteorological factors in the partly opened greenhouse showed higher regression than the factors in the closed condition. Solar radiation showed the highest regression with the pan evaporationin both closed and partly opened conditions. The applicability of Penman method was examined on estimating potential evapotranspiration in greenhouse. In the closed condition, pan evaporation data showed good agreement with Penman method but the data was 2 times higher than Penman method in the partly opened condition. These results shows that potential evapotranspiration is able to be estimated by Penman method, when windspeed is extremely low as in closed greenhouse. When convective conditions are affected by outside wind, Penman method has some difficulties in application, as wind term in the Penman equation include empirical constant derived from open field observation. The observed results shows pan evaporation is a good indicator on potential evapotranspiration, although it is affected by diameter, color, height, place and so on. ハウス内の水消費環境について, 密閉状態, 側面開放状態の条件で実験を行った. その結果次の事項が明かとなった. 1. ハウス内外の水消費環境因子相互の相関を調査した結果, 密閉状態は側面開放状態に比べ, 日射量以外の環境因子はいずれも相関が低下する傾向が得られた. 2. ハウス内における水消費環境因子と計器蒸発量との相関の高さは日射量, 湿度, 温度, 風速の順であった. とくに計器蒸発量と日射量の相関が極めて高くなることが明かとなった. 3. 密閉状態では計器蒸発量はペンマン法とは相関が高く, またほぼ 1 : 1 の対応を示した. 微風条件ではペンマン式第 2 項の重みは小きく, ハウス内に風速関数を適用することの誤差は無視できるので, ペンマン式はポテンシャル蒸発散量を与えることになる. したがって, 今回用いた直径 20 cmの計器蒸発量によってハウス内のポテンシャル蒸発散量をよく推定できることが明かとなった...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The paper {{deals with}} the problem of basic generalizations of Hadamard {{matrices}} associated with maximum determinant matrices or not optimal by determinant matrices with orthogonal columns (weighing matrices, Mersenne and Euler matrices, ets.); calculation methods for the quasi-orthogonal local maximum determinant Mersenne matrices <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>studied</b> <b>enough</b> sufficiently. The goal {{of this paper is to}} develop the theory of Mersenne and Hadamard matrices on the base of generalized Scarpis method research. Methods. Extreme solutions are found in general by minimization of maximum for absolute values of the elements of studied matrices followed by their subsequent classification according to the quantity of levels and their values depending on orders. Less universal but more effective methods are based on structural invariants of quasi-orthogonal matrices (Silvester, Paley, Scarpis methods, ets.). Results. Generalizations of Hadamard and Belevitch matrices as a family of quasi-orthogonal matrices of odd orders are observed; they include, in particular, two-level Mersenne matrices. Definitions of section and layer on the set of generalized matrices are proposed. Calculation algorithms for matrices of adjacent layers and sections by matrices of lower orders are described. Approximation examples of the Belevitch matrix structures up to 22 -nd critical order by Mersenne matrix of the third order are given. New formulation of the modified Scarpis method to approximate Hadamard matrices of high orders by lower order Mersenne matrices is proposed. Williamson method is described by example of one modular level matrices approximation by matrices with a small number of levels. Practical relevance. The efficiency of developing direction for the band-pass filters creation is justified. Algorithms for Mersenne matrices design by Scarpis method are used in developing software of the research program complex. Mersenne filters are based on the suboptimal by determinant matrices and are used for image masking and compression...|$|E

The severity of the disease varies from patient to patient. For many patients the disease has a huge impact on the quality of life, and in some cases it can be fatal. Aim: To present an overview of cold urticaria, including epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. Methods: Search for literature was performed in the PubMed database and Cochrane Library, using the words (cold urticaria) OR (cold-induced urticaria). Articles were chosen through an assessment of relevance in titles and abstracts. Some articles were also found by going through reference lists in relevant articles. Results: Cold urticaria is a condition where wheals develop after skin is exposed to cold air, water or objects. Angioedema in the oro-pharyngeal region and even shock-like reactions can also develop. The disease is either acquired (Acquired cold urticaria =ACU) or familial. The most common presentation is primary ACU, where no underlying condition can be identified. The diagnosis can in most cases be confirmed by applying an ice cube to the skin {{for a few minutes and}} observe the skin reaction. The first-line treatment is second generation antihistamines. Several other medications are also reported to be effective, but <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>studied</b> <b>enough.</b> Tolerance-induction with cold baths is a possibility for severely affected patients. Risk factors for possible life-threatening reactions are earlier shock-like reaction, earlier oro-pharyngeal edema, and wheal-developing after less than 3 minutes of ice cube application. These high risk patients must avoid triggering situations, especially aquatic activities, and always carry with them an emergency adrenaline kit. In most cases the disease burns out after some years, with a mean duration of about 5 to 9 years. Discussion: There is a need for further research on causes and treatment of cold urticaria...|$|E
