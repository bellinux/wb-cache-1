Therefore, their digestive system was made to work best with a small but steady flow of food that does not change much from day to day.|$|E

5|$|Jerry still {{worries about}} Elaine, but Harold and Manny inform him {{that someone else}} has bid higher than Elaine and will get the {{apartment}} unless Elaine is able to pay $5,000. Elaine is very disappointed when she hears the news. However, Kramer convinces Jerry to lend Elaine the money. When Elaine, Jerry and George {{go to a party}} of a friend of Elaine, Elaine asks Jerry if it would be uncomfortable for them to live so close to each other, but Jerry says he does not worry. George's wedding ring plan backfires, as he discovers that wearing the ring is actually causing women who would otherwise date him to reject him. Jerry feels stupid for not telling Elaine the truth, but, the following day, Kramer informs him that he found somebody who is willing to pay $10,000 for the apartment. However, Kramer's friend, a musician, plays loud music <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>long,</b> and Jerry regrets not letting Elaine rent the apartment.|$|E

5|$|On 21 May 1809, Napoleon {{crossed the}} Danube {{not far from}} Vienna and {{attacked}} Archduke Charles's Austrian army, situated on the northern bank of the river, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The French were nonetheless critically outnumbered and it soon became obvious that they would have a hard time just holding out. Nansouty could only get one of his brigades, Saint-Germain's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers, across the Danube for the action on 21 May. He found the heroic cuirassiers of General Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne charging, as they had done <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>long,</b> in a desperate attempt to stop Austrian attacks on the thin French battle line. Espagne had just been killed in action and his exhausted and depleted squadrons needed to be relieved. Nansouty at once brought forward Saint-Germain's squadrons and charged the enemy infantry, allowing the army to maintain itself on the position.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} day of the battle the Persian fleet was ready to attack the Allied lines in full force. Seeing the Persian fleet assemble, the Allies {{attempted}} to block the Straits of Artemisium as best they could, and waited for the Persians to attack. The Persians formed their ships into a semicircle and tried to enclose the Allied fleet, upon which the Allies rowed forward and joined battle. The battle raged <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>long,</b> with the Allies hard put to defend their line. When the fleets finally disengaged at nightfall, both sides had suffered roughly equal losses. However, the smaller Allied fleet could scarcely afford such losses; half the Athenian ships (the largest contingent in the fleet) were damaged or lost.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on {{the second}} day, the {{defenders}} on the bridge saw a small convoy of trucks approaching at some speed from the south, which at first they misidentified as the British XXX Corps. That they were enemy trucks did not become apparent until {{they were on the}} bridge whereupon the defenders opened fire and destroyed the convoy. Soon afterwards, German infantry and armour approached the bridge from the east. One tank reached the space under the bridge before it was destroyed by one of the 6pounder anti-tank guns. At 09:00, thirty armoured cars, half-tracks and trucks from the 9th SS Panzer Division attempted to rush the bridge from the south. The first five armoured cars, using the wrecks of the dawn convoy as cover and with the element of surprise, managed to cross unscathed. The rest of the force was engaged and twelve of their vehicles destroyed with the survivors returning to the southern bank. <b>All</b> <b>day</b> <b>long,</b> the force at the bridge came under fire from mortars and anti-aircraft guns positioned south of the river and were subject to probing infantry and armour attacks.|$|E

There were only five good fieldsmen in the group of twelve chosen. These were Harvey, Miller, Morris, Loxton and Archer, and Archer was the supernumerary.|$|E

In 1969, he met Linda Mencin, the daughter of a retired Naval Commander and World War II ace, through a mutual friend. The two soon moved into a house in Fayetteville's Mt.
