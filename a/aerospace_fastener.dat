40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to {{investigate}} the ductility and application of titanium alloys, like titanium 6 Al- 4 V, when used in <b>aerospace</b> <b>fasteners</b> compared to more conventional stainless steel <b>aerospace</b> <b>fasteners</b> such as A 286. There have been concerns raised about the safe usability of titanium 6 - 4 in the aerospace industry due to its lack of strain hardening. However, {{there is a lack}} of data pertaining to this concern of safe usage which this thesis aims to address. Tensile tests were conducted to find the ductility indexes of these fasteners which quantify the amount of plastic to elastic elongation. From the tests conducted it was found that the two materials yield and tensile strengths were very similar, though the ductility index of A 286 is on average ten times greater than that of titanium 6 - 4. This thesis includes joint diagram examples that analyze typical joints using both materials. It was found from joint diagram examples that the lower ductility index of the titanium alloy will only be detrimental to use at higher preloads. However, the titanium alloy can be used safely in place of A 286 in most loading situations just with narrower safety margins in these controlled examples...|$|R
40|$|This work {{follows the}} design, {{prototyping}} {{and implementation of}} an automatic part loading and unloading system for use in thread rolling of <b>aerospace</b> <b>fasteners.</b> The thread rolling automation system is designed to function {{as part of a}} multi-process workcell, which emphasizes adaptability and ease of implementation. Design of the thread rolling automation facilitates the development of a universal gripping system, which is designed to grasp a large variety of fastener styles and sizes with a minimum of tooling changeover. A novel grasping model is developed to predict the error tolerance of the proposed gripping system design, which is validated experimentally.

40|$|A {{family of}} high {{performance}} <b>aerospace</b> <b>fasteners</b> made from corrosion resistant alloys {{for use in}} applications where corrosion and stress-corrosion cracking are of major concern are discussed. The materials discussed are mainly A- 286, Inconel 718, MP 35 N and MP 159. Most of the fasteners utilize cold worked and aged materials to achieve the desired properties. The fasteners are unique in that they provide a combination of high strength and immunity to stress corrosion cracking not previously attainable. A discussion of fastener stress corrosion failures is presented including {{a review of the}} history and a description of the mechanism. Case histories are presented to illustrate the problems which can arise when material selection is made without proper regard for the environmental conditions. Mechanical properties and chemical compositions are included for the fasteners discussed.

40|$|Titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) {{has been}} {{extensively}} used in aircraft turbine-engine components, aircraft structural components, <b>aerospace</b> <b>fasteners,</b> high performance automotive parts, marine applications, medical devices and sports equipment. However, wide-spread use of this alloy has limits because of difficulty to machine it. One of the major difficulties found during machining is development of poor quality of surface {{in the form of}} higher surface roughness. The present investigation has been concentrated on studying the effects of cutting parameters of cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut on surface roughness of the product during turning of titanium alloy. Box-Behnken experimental design was used to collect data for surface roughness. ANOVA was used to determine the significance of the cutting parameters. The model equation is also formulated to predict surface roughness. Optimal values of cutting parameters were determined through response surface methodology. A 100 % desirability level in the turning process for economy was indicated by the optimized model. Also, the predicted values that were obtained through regression equation were found to be in close agreement to the experimental values...|$|R

40|$|In {{aerospace}} design, where minimizing {{weight is}} always a priority, achieving the full capacity from fasteners is essential. To do so, the initial bolt preload must be maximized. The benefits of high preload are well documented and include improved fatigue resistance, a stiffer joint, and resistance to loosening. But many factors like elastic interactions and embedment tend to lower the initial preload placed on the bolt. These factors provide additional motivation to maximize the initial preload. But, to maximize bolt preload, you must determine what torque to apply. Determining this torque is greatly complicated by the large preload scatter generally seen with torque control. This paper presents a detailed methodology for generating limit torques for threaded fasteners. This methodology accounts for the large scatter in preload found with torque control, and therefore, addresses the statistical nature of the problem. It also addresses prevailing torque, a feature common in <b>aerospace</b> <b>fasteners.</b> Although prevailing torque provides a desired locking feature, it can also increase preload scatter. In addition, it can {{limit the amount of}} preload that can be generated due to the torsion it creates in the bolt. This paper discusses the complications of prevailing torque and how best to handle it. A wide range of torque-tension bolt testing was conducted in support of this research. The results from this research will benefit the design engineer as well as analyst involved in the design of bolted joints, leading to better, more optimized structural designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} heat {{treatment}} on microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti- 5553 alloy was investigated by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that when the alloy is treated in α+β phase zone, tensile strength decreases with raising solution temperature due to decreasing the content of primary α-phase and increasing the size and volume fraction of β phase. A lot of secondary α-phase precipitates from grain boundary and intragranular with β phase transformation during aging treatment. The size of secondary α-phase has significant influence on tensile strength, secondary α-phase coarsens gradually {{with the increase of}} aging temperature, resulting in the decrease of tensile strength. It is suggested that for 1240 MPa <b>aerospace</b> <b>fasteners</b> the solution temperature of Ti- 5553 should be under T β, thus adequate β phase, where a lot of secondary α phase precipitates from, is good for the required high strength. Meanwhile, a certain percentage of primary α-phase is kept for acquiring good ductility and toughness. After solution treatment at 810 - 820 ℃ for 1. 5 h, water quenching plus aging at 510 ℃ for 10 h, Ti- 5553 shows a better mechanical property with tensile strength 1500 MPa, elongation 14. 8 % and reduction of cross-section area 38. 6 %. Lots of dimples can be found in tensile fracture after solution treatment and solution+aging treatment, which demonstrate Ti- 5553 with good ductility and toughness...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Cadmium coatings are currently applied to steel <b>fasteners</b> used in <b>aerospace</b> applications. At present there are growing concerns, based on cadmium's toxicity and carcinogenicity, which may lead to its eventual banning. The aim of this research, therefore, {{was to find a}} possible replacement to electrodeposited cadmium for use on <b>aerospace</b> <b>fasteners.</b> Any replacement coating system should have all of the relevant properties that make cadmium so attractive, but without its obvious shortcomings. These beneficial properties include excellent corrosion resistance in chloride containing media (such as seawater), the ability to offer sacrificial protection to steel, excellent galvanic compatibility with most aluminium alloys and an inherent lubricity. Alternatives proposed and produced in this research are electrodeposited composite coatings containing PTFE particles, based on zinc or zinc alloys. Extensive analysis was carried out in order to characterise the coatings. Composition was determined by a number of methods; gravimetric analysis was used to determine the percentage of codeposited PTFE, while X-ray and X-ray wavelength energy dispersive analysis were used to determine the percentage of alloy element present in these coatings. Coating morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The sacrificial corrosion performance of each coating in relation to steel was studied using neutral salt-spray tests, while linear polarisation resistance tests gave an indication of their barrier corrosion properties. Galvanic compatibility of the coatings with aerospace grade aluminium alloys was investigated using a zero resistance ammeter. Two different tribological tests, an inclined plane test and a reciprocating wear test, were used to determine the coefficient of friction for the coatings. Finally, linear sweep voltammetry was used to compare the kinetics of electrodeposition from dilute solutions and corrosion in aqueous media for each of the coating systems. The composite coatings were found to offer either similar or slightly reduced corrosion performance to conventional zinc and zinc alloy coatings, but were inferior to commercially electrodeposited cadmium. However, the tribological properties of these coatings demonstrated a marked improvement over cadmium...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} project was to determine experimentally the fatigue and fracture toughness characteristic, from a fracture mechanics perspective, of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy manufactured by Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Three build orientations are considered where a fatigue crack is grown parallel and two are grown perpendicular to the build orientation. The project then endeavours to generate a fracture mechanics based Paris equation from the fatigue crack growth rate results and together with the fracture toughness, fatigue life predictions may be determined based on crack propagation lifetimes. SLM is an Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique whereby an object is fabricated in a layerwise manner via the use of lasers, directly from a 3 D CAD model. This process allows for the manufacture of complex designs in its net or near net shape form, which is not possible with conventional manufacturing techniques. There are minimal amounts of material wastage and it potentially eliminates post manufacture machining and processing costs. Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is used in many applications where high strength at low density is required at moderate temperatures. Corrosion resistance qualities of the alloy are also considered for many applications. Some of the applications where this alloy is used include turbine engine components, aircraft structural components, <b>aerospace</b> <b>fasteners,</b> high-performance automotive parts, marine applications, medical implant devices and sports equipment. Due to the large use of the alloy in industry and with {{the potential benefits of}} manufacturing by SLM, there is a great need for investigating SLM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V as a viable alternative to conventional casting, forging and machining. There is limited literature covering the fatigue crack growth rate and fracture toughness of SLM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and the effect of build orientation on these characteristics. However, it is clear, from the limited available literature that fatigue crack growth rate behaviour is affected by build orientation, and so this project investigates the effect of these orientations, and aims to contribute to understanding why these orientation effects occur. Since there is even less literature available on the fracture toughness of SLM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V with respect to build orientation, this project also endeavours to characterise orientation effects on fracture toughness, if any, and compares these with those of conventionally manufacture Ti- 6 Al- 4 V...|$|R
50|$|The fluted {{countersink}} cutter {{is used to}} provide a heavy chamfer in {{the entrance to a}} drilled hole.

Countersink cutters are manufactured with six common angles, which are 60°, 82°, 90°, 100°, 110°, or 120°, with the two most common of those being 82° and 90°. Countersunk-head screws that follow the Unified Thread Standard very often have an 82° angle, and screws that follow the ISO standard very often have a 90° angle. Throughout the <b>aerospace</b> industry, countersunk <b>fasteners</b> typically have an angle of 100°.|$|R
40|$|Leaks from {{aircraft}} {{fuel tanks}} have always represented {{a problem for}} aircraft manufacturers, airline operators and maintenance crews. The integral fuel tanks within aircraft structures are typically located within the wings and they rely upon sealant materials to prevent leakage past joints and fasteners. However, the wing is designed as a structural member first and as a fuel tank second and there exist many potential leak paths for the fuel from these complex, highly loaded structures. Fuel leaks result in direct loss offuel which may be dangerous, eause a loss in revenue due to aircraft being withdravvn from service and be difficult and expensive to repair. On top ofthis there arc important health and safety issues involved in the repair of fuel tanks, for example,the Royal Australian Air Force's, F-lll Deseal Reseal Programme 1979 to 2000, where {{it was found that}} a significant number of RAAF personnel involved in the Deseal Reseal Programme were suffering from a variety ofhealth problems. Current approaches to fuel tank sealant evaluation embrace immersion in a range of different fluids at different temperatures, ofboth bulk sealant samples and sealed joints. However, nearly all such tests are ofa 'static' nature and yet it is acknowledged that joint movement leads to leaks. Thus the missing component oftesting is movement coupled with the other key variables. The aircraft industry has been searching for a relatively simpllYtest method {{that can be used to}} evaluate sealed joint systems using realistic combinations of materials, joint geometries, imposed stresses and environmental conditions. The aim ofthis project was to do exactly this. A practieal but realistic dynamic test, the Model Sealed System (MSS), was designed, made and evaluated. This unique mechanism consists ofan axial stress machine into which fatigue, high and low temperatures and pressures can be programmed for automatic operation. A novel circular lap joint lies at the heart ofthe MSS in which test sealant is sandwiched between the circular coupons that are then assembled with <b>aerospace</b> <b>fasteners</b> and sealed. This joint configuration is representative ofa wing skin butt-strap joint in a real aircraft. The MSS is easy to run, it accurately simulates real world dynamics and conditioning, and it provides results to qualify sealants in a more realistic manner than current testing methods provide. The MSS enables evaluation and comparative testing of sealant systems when used for interfay, fillet and overcoat applications. The information provided is complementary to that obtained from conventional small scale coupon testing; it is not seen as a substitute. Further work is require to refine the test variables and further data arc required to provide confidence in the utility ofthe MSS. Development ofthe MSS was undertaken with the support ofAirbus UK to ensure that the design, materials and all other variables met the overall requirements of a commercial aircraft manufacturer. AirbuÃ‚Â·s UK have a duplicate MSS oftheir own, installed by the author, from which they can obtain patterns ofdata for different combinations of materials and experimental variables.

40|$|In the <b>aerospace</b> industry, the <b>fastener</b> {{holes are}} widely present because various {{mechanical}} parts {{need to be}} connected by rivets or bolts. These holes experience external forces which cause a tensile stress on the surface resulting in fatigue cracks and eventually fatigue failure of the structure. To alleviate this problem, cold expansion method {{has been used to}} improve the fatigue behavior of structures by inducing compressive residual stresses around the holes by forcing a tapered mandrel through the fastener hole that is slightly smaller than the mandrel. In this study, finite element simulations had been carried out for cold expansion process {{in order to determine the}} residual stress fields around two cold-expanded holes by varying the centre distance between two holes and also the thickness of the material. Moreover, the effect of through thickness position has also been investigated by considering the residual stresses distribution at different positions such as at the entrance face, at the middle of the thickness and at the exit face of the material. Aluminium alloy 7075 -T 6 was used as the material for the model simulated in ANSYS. The results showed that as the distance between the adjacent holes increased, the residual stresses decreased. Moreover, the simulation also highlighted the effect of the plate thickness and the through thickness position on the residual stresses distribution. The compressive residual stresses increased as the plate thickness increased. Meanwhile, the results at the mid-thickness were higher than the results at the entrance and exit faces...|$|R
