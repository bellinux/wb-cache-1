40|$|TR-COSC 03 / 90 The world-wide use {{of digital}} storage and {{communications}} devices is increasing {{the need to}} make texts available in multiple languages. To minimise the cost of storing and transmitting multiple <b>translations</b> <b>of</b> a text, one could store the text in just one language, from which other translations can be created. Unfortunately, the quality <b>of</b> machine <b>translation</b> techniques is not good enough for this to be feasible. An alternative is to store a compressed form of translated versions of a text, taking advantage of the availability of the original text. The original text provides some of the semantic content of the text that is to be compressed, and therefore makes it possible for compression to be more efficient than if that information were not available. This paper reports investigations into the use of a parallel text to represent its translated version compactly. We begin with an experiment to evaluate the information content of a text when a parallel translation is available. This is achieved by having human subjects guess texts letter by letter, with and without a parallel translation. The perceived information content of a text can be determined from the way subjects make their guesses. The design and results of this experiment are described. The main conclusion is that while the text is considerably more predictable with the <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> a parallel <b>translation,</b> there is a surprising amount of information introduced by the translation. Insights obtained from this experiment are then applied in the design of a mechanical system for compressing parallel texts. The system stores one <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> a text intact, and then compresses further <b>translations</b> <b>of</b> the text with the <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> the original. The method described is able to compress texts significantly better than is possible without the <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> a parallel text. Aspects of the design are also applicable to future compressors that might take advantage of the semantic content of a text to obtain better compression...|$|R

Formation of a closed loop structure comprised of mRNA, a number of eukaryotic initiation factors and ribosomal proteins has been proposed to <b>aid</b> re-initiation <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> and therefore increase global translational efficiency. We have determined mRNA and protein levels of the key components of the closed loop; eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF 3 a, eIF 3 b, eIF 3 c, eIF 3 h, eIF 3 i and eIF 4 G 1), poly(A) binding protein (PABP) 1 and PABP interacting protein 1 (PAIP 1) across a panel of 30 recombinant mAb-producing GS-CHOK 1 SV cell lines with a broad range of growth characteristics and production levels of a model recombinant mAb. We have used a multi-level statistical approach to investigate the relationship between key performance indicators (cell growth and recombinant antibody productivity) and the intracellular amounts <b>of</b> target <b>translation</b> initiation factor proteins and the mRNAs encoding them. We show that high-producing cell lines maintain amounts <b>of</b> the <b>translation</b> initiation factors involved {{in the formation of the}} closed loop mRNA, maintaining these proteins at appropriate levels to deliver enhanced recombinant protein production.

Chaucer‘s Tale of Sir Thopas has been explained as an acidly sarcastic satire of the romances‘ supposedly clichéd formulas and poetically unskilled authors. Yet such assumptions require investigation of how Chaucer and his ostensible audience might have viewed romance as a genre. Chaucer‘s likely use of the Auchinleck manuscript forms a convenient basis for examination of the romances listed in Thopas. With the <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> a modern <b>translation,</b> the poems turn out to form a rich interplay of symbolical, theological, and historical meanings. Viewed in a more sensitive light, the Middle English romances in turn give Thopas new meaning as a poem written affectionately to parody romance but chiefly to effect a humorous contrast. Rather than condemning romances, Chaucer uses their best examples to heighten Thopas‘ comic impotence as a knight and to provide self-deprecating carnival laughter at Chaucer the narrator‘s failed stor...|$|R
