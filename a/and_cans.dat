5|$|Beer is {{distributed}} in bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans</b> {{and is also}} commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (abv), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% abv and above. Beer forms {{part of the culture}} of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games such as bar billiards.|$|E

5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans.</b> However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment {{at the bottom of}} the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.|$|E
5|$|Worthington's Creamflow (3.6% ABV) is {{the twelfth}} highest selling {{beer in the}} United Kingdom, with an {{estimated}} 640,000 hectolitres sold in 2012. It is the third highest selling ale brand in the United Kingdom after John Smith's and Tetley's. It is the highest selling ale in Wales, where it has a 20 per cent volume share, and has held pole position since at least 1999. Most of the sales consist of the nitrogenated and pasteurised Creamflow, which was launched in 1995 and is available in kegs <b>and</b> <b>cans.</b> Cask conditioned Worthington's Cask is made from Northdown and Challenger hops, brewing sugar and pale malt. Modest amounts of a 4% keg bitter known as Worthington's Ale continue to be brewed for the Teesside market.|$|E

25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} are flammable or highly flammable, {{depending on}} their volatility. Exceptions are some chlorinated solvents like dichloromethane and chloroform. Mixtures of solvent vapors and air can explode. Solvent vapors are heavier than air; they will sink {{to the bottom and}} can travel large distances nearly undiluted. Solvent vapors can also be found in supposedly empty drums <b>and</b> <b>cans,</b> posing a flash fire hazard; hence empty containers of volatile solvents should be stored open and upside down.|$|E
25|$|World War II brought rationing, and {{the company}} briefly had to drop cans {{altogether}} and resort to using green glass in its bottles, rather than the standard amber color which offered better protection from light. Sale of beer in bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans</b> had become dominant over draft sales in drinking establishments, so the brewer experimented {{with all sorts of}} packaging innovations, expanding the line after the war ended. A premium beer, called Grain Belt Premium, entered production in 1947. Conetop cans sealed with caps disappeared in the 1950s in favor of flat-top steel cans.|$|E

500|$|The nitrogenated and {{pasteurised}} {{variant of}} the beer available in kegs <b>and</b> <b>cans.</b> It is brewed in Samlesbury. The canned variant, launched in 1991, contains a widget to give the beer a creamy white head. The beer's ABV was reduced from 3.8% to 3.5% in late 2008. On draught in the United Kingdom it is typically served at 5 to 7 degrees Celsius, although an Extra Cold variant served at 3 to 5 degrees Celsius has been available since 2006. Its taste, or perceived lack of it, has been criticised by some, with Andrew Jefford describing it as a [...] "blandly foamy nitrokeg travesty of the original [...] ".|$|E

Eating became extremely difficult as unburied corpses became bloated and putrid. The precarious Allied lodgements were poorly situated, which caused supply and shelter problems.

500|$|The Coca-Cola Company {{collaborated with}} Fox {{to launch a}} {{worldwide}} marketing campaign to promote the film. The highlight of the campaign was the website AVTR.com. Specially marked bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans</b> of Coca-Cola Zero, when held {{in front of a}} webcam, enabled users to interact with the website's 3-D features using augmented reality (AR) technology. The film was heavily promoted in an episode of the Fox Network series Bones in the episode [...] "The Gamer In The Grease" [...] (Season 5, Episode 9). Avatar star Joel David Moore has a recurring role on the program, and is seen in the episode anxiously awaiting the release of the film. A week prior to the American release, Zoe Saldana promoted the film on Adult Swim when she was interviewed by an animated Space Ghost. McDonald's had a promotion mentioned in television commercials in Europe called [...] "Avatarize yourself", which encouraged people to go to the website set up by Oddcast, and use a photograph of themselves to change into a Na'vi.|$|E

When a cage went on display in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2012, Coca-Cola demanded that SodaStream remove its products from the cages and threatened to sue SodaStream. SodaStream responded by dismissing the threats and announcing that it would display the cage outside Coca-Cola's headquarters in Atlanta.|$|E
