5000|$|The {{programme}} {{was originally}} based on letters from <b>Any</b> <b>Questions?</b> listeners, but has subsequently followed the trend {{to the less}} laborious and more immediate [...] "phone-in" [...] format. Currently, in Any Answers?, listeners can submit their responses to the views expressed in <b>Any</b> <b>Questions?</b> by email or by telephone. A chairperson hosts the programme, ensuring that sufficient time is devoted to responses to each issue covered in the previous edition of <b>Any</b> <b>Questions?.</b>|$|R
50|$|The show is {{a parody}} of <b>Any</b> <b>Questions?,</b> where {{audience}} members pose questions to an assembled panel. The questions and answers are played for laughs (in contrast to the serious political debate in <b>Any</b> <b>Questions?),</b> with the panellists improvising witty answers.|$|R

5|$|The Constitution {{provides}} that the President may {{refer to a}} tribunal consisting of not less than three judges of the Supreme Court for its opinion <b>any</b> <b>question</b> as {{to the effect of}} any provision of the Constitution that has arisen or appears likely to arise. Where a Constitutional Tribunal has given an opinion, no court has jurisdiction to question the opinion, or the validity of any law the bill for which {{was the subject of a}} reference to the Tribunal.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{argued that}} the {{sections}} of the Act dealing with disputation by petition encompassed <b>any</b> <b>question</b> {{about the validity of}} an election, including the eligibility of a candidate, and that the sections should be interpreted broadly. Sue made a similar argument, saying that the sections allowing disputes by petition and the sections allowing disputes by the relevant house of Parliament were not mutually exclusive and that elections could be disputed by either the Parliament or the people.|$|E
5|$|In September 1919, Quisling {{departed}} Norway {{to become}} an intelligence officer with the Norwegian delegation in Helsinki, a post that combined diplomacy and politics. In the autumn of 1921, Quisling left Norway once again, this time {{at the request of}} explorer and humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen, and in January 1922 arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kharkov to help with the League of Nations humanitarian relief effort there. Highlighting the massive mismanagement of the area and the death toll of approximately ten thousand a day, Quisling produced a report that attracted aid and demonstrated his administrative skills, as well as his dogged determination to get what he wanted. On 21August, he married the Russian Alexandra Andreevna ("Asja") Voronina, the daughter of a peddler. Alexandra wrote in her memoirs that Quisling declared his love for her, but based on his letters home and investigations undertaken by his cousins, it appears that there was never <b>any</b> <b>question</b> of romantic involvement between the two. Quisling merely seemed to have wanted to lift the girl out of poverty by providing her with a Norwegian passport and financial security.|$|E

5|$|Section 8B(2) {{contained}} an ouster clause that restricted {{the scope of}} judicial review to <b>any</b> <b>question</b> relating to compliance with any procedural requirements of the ISA governing acts or decisions by the President or the Home Affairs Minister. The amendments to the ISA were made retrospective by section 8D, which meant that they applied to judicial review proceedings that had been started before the amendment Act came into force. In addition, the Constitution was amended through the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 to prevent the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 from being challenged as unconstitutional. Article 149(3) was inserted into the Constitution, with the effect that {{if the issue of}} whether any executive decision made pursuant to the ISA came before a court (whether before or after this constitutional amendment came into force on 27 January 1989), the court had to decide this issue according to the new provisions introduced by the 1989 ISA amendments. Article 149(1) was amended to add Articles 11 and 12 to the list of fundamental liberties that the ISA cannot be challenged against, and to extend its immunizing effect to the 1989 ISA amendments.|$|E
