5|$|On 22January 1942, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>headquarters</b> of the 1st Krajina Detachment in {{the village}} of Majkić Japra, Stojanović presided over a conference of the {{detachment}} staff and political activists of Grmeč. He criticised the detachment headquarters because it had no division of functions and there was no personal accountability among its members. He also stated the headquarters had no communication with the companies of the detachment, did not act as a military-political leadership, and there were no designated couriers available at all times <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>headquarters.</b> Stojanović was generally pleased with the Grmeč Partisans, describing them as courageous, enthusiastic, firm, and trustworthy but somewhat inexperienced. However, he said that the platoons of the detachment were dispersed in villages and had no contact with each other. In this way, according to Stojanović, the Partisans were losing their soldierly characteristics and becoming more like peasants. Stojanović criticised the views of some Partisans that political commissars should be abolished. He warned that the Partisans who wore emblems other than the red star would be punished for indiscipline.|$|E

5|$|In Kingdom Hearts II, Sora {{and friends}} awaken from their sleep and resume {{their search for}} Riku and King Mickey, {{learning}} of the Nobodies and becoming re-familiarized with Organization XIII. Sora once again travels to many Disney-themed worlds and resolves issues caused by the Heartless and Nobodies, and Maleficent's servant Pete. They reunite with King Mickey and encounter Xemnas, the leader of Organization XIII and Nobody of Xehanort, revealed to be the human form of the Heartless Ansem. The Organization's plan is also revealed: they seek to regain their lost hearts by creating {{their own version of}} Kingdom Hearts from the sum of all the hearts released from the Heartless slain by Sora's Keyblade. The three arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>headquarters</b> of Organization XIII and team up with their friends. Ansem the Wise uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts' power, but it self-destructs, engulfing Ansem. At the top of the Castle that Never Was, Sora and his friends battle Xemnas. After Sora and Riku defeat Xemnas, they get trapped in the realm of darkness, but a letter from Kairi summons a gateway for them, and the two are reunited with their friends at their home.|$|E
5|$|On March 12, all South Vietnamese {{soldiers}} who had survived the North Vietnamese assault gathered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>headquarters</b> of the 23rd Infantry Division and Hoa Binh airfield. Unfortunately, those soldiers were without their leaders, because both Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang were captured by the North Vietnamese {{in the early hours}} of the day. From Saigon, President Nguyen Van Thieu ordered Phu to hold all South Vietnamese positions at the eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, where they could stage a counter-attack. Phu drew up a plan to retake Ban Me Thuot that would involve the last two remaining regiments (44th and 45th Infantry Regiments) of the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and the {{soldiers who}} had gathered at the 23rd Infantry Division headquarters and Hoa Binh airfield. Thieu approved the plan at dawn, and authorised Phu to make full use of three Republic of Vietnam Air Force units (6th Air Force Division belonging to the ARVN 2nd Brigade, 1st Air Force Division at Da Nang Air Base, and the 4th Air Force Division at Cần Thơ).|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Peace Bell <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>headquarters</b> of the United Nations in New York was {{donated by}} Japan in 1954 {{as a symbol}} of world peace. It was created using metal {{reclaimed}} from coins and medals provided by donors from around the globe. Similar bells representing a commitment to the cause of world peace can be found in many civic areas, including Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park. In 1995, the city of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, erected a four-ton peace bell– a replica of one of the Hiroshima bells– in the city centre as part of its fiftieth-anniversary celebrations, and to strengthen ties with Japan. The Oak Ridge Friendship Bell is decorated with dates relating to Oak Ridge's connection to Japan (the uranium used in the Hiroshima atomic bomb was produced in Oak Ridge). In 1998, a local citizen sued the city over the bell, claiming that it was a Buddhist symbol and violated local laws and the US Constitution. The case was ruled in favour of the City of Oak Ridge.|$|E
