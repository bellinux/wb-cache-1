50|$|On the {{vaudeville}} circuit, Frosini met {{and became}} friends with another great accordionist, Guido Deiro.

Each of the members enjoyed a flourishing solo career at the time Relativity was formed.|$|E
50|$|Uhlig {{produced}} {{his first}} concertina in 1834, being {{dissatisfied with the}} early <b>accordion</b> <b>keyboard</b> developed by Cyrill Demian. Uhlig took the right-handed keyboard of Demian, and split it between the two hands, resulting in an instrument which had two separate keyboards producing individual notes. While Uhlig's development of the concertina is very parallel to that of Charles Wheatstone, {{the founder of the}} English family of concertinas, there is no definite indication they were aware of each other's work.|$|E

His father was also a musician and played in bands when Sawchuck was young, and he has cited that musical exposure as an influence on his later showmanship. Sawchuck began learning <b>accordion,</b> <b>keyboard</b> and saxophone at age five. He learned Ukrainian dancing at age five as well, and at age seven began taking dance lessons in a variety of genres. He was also active in sports.|$|E
