5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th century, Ceredigion had more {{industry}} {{than it does}} today; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county; lead, silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour. The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market. During the last century, livestock farming has become less profitable, and the population of Cardiganshire has been in decline as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated to other countries. More recently, the population has started rising again as elderly people move into the county for retirement, and various government and European Union initiatives have encouraged tourism and other <b>alternative</b> <b>sources</b> of income.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Wolf Klaphake and {{his wife}} Maria emigrated to Australia. The Klaphakes' {{decision}} to emigrate was probably primarily the result of Maria's encounters with Nazi authorities; their decision to settle in Australia (rather than, say, in Britain) was influenced by Wolf's desire to develop a dew condenser. As a dry continent, Australia was likely to need <b>alternative</b> <b>sources</b> of fresh water, and the Premier of South Australia, whom he had met in London, had expressed an interest. Klaphake made a specific proposal for a condenser at {{the small town of}} Cook, where there was no supply of potable water. At Cook, the railway company had previously installed a large coal-powered active condenser, but it was prohibitively expensive to run, and it was cheaper to simply transport water. However, the Australian government turned down Klaphake's proposal, and he lost interest in the project.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, the B-52 {{became one}} of the first US {{military}} aircraft to fly using alternative fuel. It took off from Edwards Air Force Base with a 50/50 blend of Fischer-Tropsch process (FT) synthetic fuel and conventional JP-8 jet fuel, which burned in two of the eight engines. On 15 December 2006, a B-52 took off from Edwards with the synthetic fuel powering all eight engines, the first time an air force aircraft was entirely powered by the blend. The seven-hour flight was considered a success. This program is part of the Department of Defense Assured Fuel Initiative, which aims to reduce crude oil usage and obtain half of its aviation fuel from <b>alternative</b> <b>sources</b> by 2016. On 8 August 2007, Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne certified the B-52H as fully approved to use the FT blend.|$|E
5|$|The Gorkha {{aristocracy}} had led Nepal into disaster on {{the international}} front but preserved the political unity of the country, which {{at the end of}} the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as jagir to the armed services and as birta to court favorites and retired servicemen. The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference. From the standpoint of the average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share. For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and <b>alternative</b> <b>sources</b> of employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.|$|E

40|$|A {{goal in the}} {{forensic}} interpretation of scientific evidence is to make an inference about {{the source of a}} trace of unknown origin. The evidence is composed of the following three elements: (a) the trace of unknown origin, (b) a sample from a specific source, and (c) a collection of samples from the <b>alternative</b> <b>source</b> population. The inference process usually considers two propositions. The first proposition is usually referred to as the prosecution hypothesis and states that a given specific source is the actual source of the trace of unknown origin. The second, usually referred to as the defense hypothesis, states that the actual source of the trace of unknown origin is another source from a relevant <b>alternative</b> <b>source</b> population. One approach is to calculate a Bayes Factor for deciding between the two competing hypotheses. This approach commonly assumes that the <b>alternative</b> <b>source</b> population is completely known or uses point estimates for its parameters. Contrary to this common approach, we propose a development that incorporates the uncertainty on the <b>alternative</b> <b>source</b> population parameters in a reasonable and coherent manner into the Bayes Factor. We will illustrate the resulting effects on the calculation of several Bayes Factors for different situations with a well-studied collection of samples of glass fragments...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{increasing}} {{the variability of}} rainfall, and thus the availability of water supplies {{in many areas of}} the world. These impacts are already being felt in the state of Victoria, Australia where a 12 year drought period was recently experienced. Restrictions to water use have been implemented, as one component of a broad policy approach to manage the drought. While anecdotal evidence suggests that the substitution of centralised water supplies is occurring, this has not been proven empirically. This paper reports results from a survey of households in Victoria regarding their use of <b>alternative</b> water <b>sources.</b> The study found that substitution is occurring. Garden watering is the purpose which has the highest rate of <b>alternative</b> water <b>source</b> use. In total 41. 6 % of respondents always, and 33. 2 % sometimes use an <b>alternative</b> water <b>source</b> for garden watering. The most commonly used <b>alternative</b> <b>source</b> of water for garden watering is water previously used in the laundry (30. 7 %). The <b>alternative</b> <b>source</b> of water used was found to vary depending on the purpose of the water use. High levels of satisfaction were found for all <b>alternative</b> water <b>sources</b> used. Several barriers were found to the use of <b>alternative</b> water <b>sources,</b> the main of which were: inflexibility of existing infrastructure, cost, policy, and housing status. The results have implications for water retailers, policy makers and governments in locations facing water shortage. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
