40|$|This is a {{conceptual}} paper about design of cognitive systems. The design of cooperative dynamic human-machine systems, such as driver assistance systems within a vehicle {{being part of}} the traffic, is a challenging task. The result has to be easily comprehensible for the user, although the overall system complexity might be rather high. Firstly, the driver assistance systems are able to perform a complex but partially hidden behavior. An Adaptive Cruise Control system (ACC), for example, can perceive relevant aspects of the current traffic situation and can decide autonomously about the longitudinal maneuver, such as approaching or maintaining speed. In parallel, it performs singular actions, such as deceleration to avoid collisions. However, the matching of technical and design constraints of the machine behavior and natural human behavior can be difficult, particularly in time- and safety-critical situations, for instance during emergency braking or evading. And secondly, the overall system complexity increases caused by the high number of different assistance systems already on the market. In some cases they are not well integrated and the driver has to interact with each of them separately. To design well usable cooperative dynamic human-machine systems and interaction, a usability improving and system integrating approach is required. In this paper, we describe such an approach based on the use of human-compatible reference values. The main reference value that we use in the design of driver assistance systems is named ‘action tension’. We show exemplary how such a value can be derived from well-known and accepted scientific concepts, how it can be operationalized and evaluated within a usability assessment and how it can be used in the design of an integrated driver assistance system in case of an <b>approach,</b> <b>brake</b> and evade driving scenario...|$|R

40|$|Braking of road {{vehicles}} {{can be characterized}} as an active – either wanted or unwanted reduction of the force necessary for maintaining the required speed, decreasing the speed, stopping or keeping the vehicle at a standstill. During braking the vehicle loses the acquired motion energy which is most frequently transformed (in case of wanted braking) in the brake system of the vehicle into useless heat released to the environment. Brake force can be defined as the force acting against the motion of a vehicle which is, in case of wanted braking, produced by the vehicle braking system. In case of wanted braking we usually begin with the equilibrium equation of vehicle forces. The paper deals with objective findings and assessment of possible causes leading to the braking system failure paying special attention to the brake lining.

40|$|Purpose: Discussion {{on use of}} {{frictional}} coupling of {{wheel with}} a rail for detection of surface condition of track ways in coal mine undergrounds is the paper objective. Design/methodology/approach: The method for detection of surface condition of track ways is based on using of dedicated converter installed on the locomotive chassis with active part in a form of “tracking wheel” that moves on the rail surface together with the locomotive. The converter {{is equipped with a}} system for torque load and a sensor measuring its rotational speed. Change of track surface is determined by momentary changes in rotational speed of “tracking wheel” due to its slippage. Findings: The described method for detection of track ways surface condition enables to generate information signal which transferred to master braking control system of the locomotive eliminates excessive slippage during braking. Research limitations/implications: The presented results confirm rightness of accepted method for detection of track ways surface condition indicating for necessity of modification of developed test rig to get repeatable information about current track surface.

This article {{considers}} two <b>approaches</b> {{to reducing}} <b>braking</b> losses in regional diesel trains: efficient driving strategies and regenerative braking.

Computational models of conventional and hybrid diesel-hydrodynamic regional trains have been developed using real route data to generate a simple control algorithm and investigate the effect of driving strategy on fuel consumption and journey time. The current modelling predicts fuel savings of up to 40 per cent for the hybrid train when an aggressive control strategy is used. This fuel saving is halved when an efficient driving strategy is employed, which also reduces the required energy storage capacity. The model provides a tool for identifying effective control strategies which should be implemented {{to reduce fuel consumption}} for both conventional and hybrid trains...|$|R

Indeed, the impact of unstable oscillations can be catastrophic. It can cause vehicle control problems and component degradation. Accordingly, complex stability analysis is required. This paper outlines stability analysis and centre manifold approach for studying instability problems. To put it more precisely, one considers brake vibrations and more specifically heavy trucks judder where the dynamic characteristics of the whole front axle assembly is concerned, even if the source of judder is located in the brake system. The modelling introduces the sprag-slip mechanism based on dynamic coupling due to buttressing. The non-linearity is expressed as a polynomial with quadratic and cubic terms. This model does not require the use of brake negative coefficient, in order to predict the instability phenomena. Finally, the centre manifold approach is used to obtain equations for the limit cycle amplitudes. The centre manifold theory allows the reduction of the number of equations of the original system in order to obtain a simplified system, without loosing the dynamics of the original system as well as the contributions of non-linear terms. The goal is the study of the stability analysis and the validation of the centre manifold approach for a complex non-linear model by comparing results obtained by solving the full system and by using the centre manifold <b>approach.</b> The <b>brake</b> friction coefficient is used as an unfolding parameter of the fundamental Hopf bifurcation point...|$|R

This report is the third report on the California PATH IDS research, and it focuses on two human factors studies which used the PATH instrumented Ford Taurus research vehicle to study driver behavior while making left turns. The goal of the first study was to observe drivers? intersection approaches and left-turn maneuvers in a mostly naturalistic setting. Twenty-three drivers (both male and female and younger and older) were recruited to drive the instrumented vehicle 10 times around an 8 -block course {{in the city of}} Berkeley, CA, making a total of 40 left turns per driver.

Second, the study introduced drivers to the concept of a left-turn Driver Infrastructure Interface (DII), a dynamic, no-left-turn sign, warning sign. Twenty drivers (both male and female and younger and older) were recruited to drive the instrumented vehicle through the RFS intersection 54 times with a single oncoming vehicle approaching.

40|$|Recently, a test-based {{assessment}} method for forward-looking crash avoidance and mitigation systems (pre-crash systems) was developed within the EU project ASSESS. In this method, injury outcome is {{correlated with the}} change of velocity (Delta-V) during the crash {{and the effect of}} the pre-crash system on this quantity is investigated. Delta-V may be related to relative impact speed (i. e., the speed difference between the vehicles at the moment of collision) by certain assumptions. It is therefore a central question in the ASSESS {{assessment method}} to determine the relative impact speed in all rear-end test scenarios in the test protocol. This is most challenging in the scenario when the vehicle under test (striking vehicle) is <b>approaching</b> a <b>braking</b> lead vehicle. In this paper, the corresponding question is addressed in a much more general setting. In particular, instead of the fixed values used in the test protocol for the ASSESS method, all possible values for the initial speeds and decelerations of the vehicles and the initial headway of the lead vehicle are considered in the important case when the two vehicles have equal initial speeds and decelerations. The question addressed here is the following: given arbitrary values of all these parameters, is it possible to determine the speed difference between the two vehicles at the time of collision from the impact speed of the vehicle under test using mathematically rigorous methods? The results show that under simplifying assumptions, the relative impact speed may be expressed {{as a function of the}} impact speed of the vehicle under test. The set of valid test results is characterized for all possible parameter values together with the requirements on how early braking needs to be performed in order to avoid the crash. Possible generalizations of the method (including the feasibility of removing some of the theoretical assumptions) are also discussed. The results may be of use in the design of future test protocols for radar-based braking systems as well as in the development of such systems. </p...|$|R

The net output speed {{is a combination of}} the two input speeds and is governed by the transmission ratio of the planetary gear train. This new approach eliminates the use of a torque converter which is otherwise an indispensable part of all available automatic transmissions, thereby reducing the power loss that occurs in the box during the fluid coupling.

Complex eigenvalue analysis (CEA) has been widely used to predict unstable frequencies in brake systems models. The finite element model is correlated with experimental modal test. The ‘input-output’ relationship between the brake squeal and the brake pad geometry is constructed for possible prediction of the squeal using various geometrical configurations of the disc brake. Influences of the various factors namely; Young’s modulus of back plate, back plate thickness, chamfer, distance between two slots, slot width and angle of slot are investigated using design of experiments (DOE) technique. A mathematical prediction model has been developed based on the most influencing factors and the validation simulation experiments proved its adequacy.

Results from 160 simulation runs showed that system performance, measured by fuel usage and landing accuracy, was predicted to be optimized if the human performs decisio...|$|R
