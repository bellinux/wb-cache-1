5|$|By {{the time}} of the Punic wars of the 2nd century BC, this form of {{organisation}} was found to be inefficient. In a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the principes being older veterans with <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> of experience. Their equipment and role was very similar to the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each princeps also carried two pila, heavy javelins that bent on impact to prevent them being removed from the victim or thrown back.|$|E
5|$|F. rubiginosa is {{exclusively}} pollinated in {{a symbiotic}} relationship with Pleistodontes imperialis, a species of fig wasp. Biologist Eleanor Haine and colleagues analysed the DNA of the wasp across the fig's range and determined four cryptic lineages forming what they term the P. imperialis species complex. They diverge to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> than some distinct wasp species, yet form a monophyletic group; this indicates that the wasp lineages have split without a change of host.|$|E
5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> of asymmetry {{than any other}} vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis {{during the course of}} their development, with one eye migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E

5|$|For {{people who}} are {{unwilling or unable to}} take {{medication}} regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics may be used to achieve control.

When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment. The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, less {{concerned}} with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away from}} the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E
5|$|A {{cause and}} effect {{methodology}} led to a relatively value-free approach to economic science, in which Cantillon was uninterested in the merit of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships. This led Cantillon to separate economic science from politics and ethics to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> than previous mercantilist writers. This has led to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly be considered a mercantilist {{or one of the}} first anti-mercantilists, given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade surpluses and specie accumulation as positive economic stimuli. Others argue that in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, he actually provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.|$|E

In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> of standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E
5|$|After Stuart Urban {{left the}} {{production}} and the decision {{had been made to}} re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten. Flannery took the opportunity to completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt that the story could be expanded to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> for television.|$|E
5|$|At E3 2006, Origins was {{announced}} as in development by Climax Studios, instead of by Konami's Team Silent who had developed previous installments.

In the previews, Travis had six weapons, divided equally between melee weapons and firearms. Additional changes included a laser sight for his pistol and an option for the player to barricade areas. At the time, the game was expected to be released in late 2006.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Agnew's legacy was {{perceived}} largely in negative terms. The circumstances of his fall, particularly in the light of his declared dedication to law and order, did much to engender cynicism and distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> of care in the selection of potential vice presidents; had Nixon researched Agnew's background before choosing him, a national crisis might have been averted. Most of the running mates selected by the major parties after 1972 were seasoned politicians – Walter Mondale, George H. W. Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Al Gore, Dick Cheney – some of whom themselves became their party's nominee for president.|$|E
5|$|Fischer and {{co-workers}} also studied {{the chemistry of}} iridocene, the third transition series analogue of rhodocene and cobaltocene, finding the chemistry of rhodocene and iridocene are generally similar. The synthesis of numerous iridocenium salts including the tribromide and hexafluorophosphate have been described. Just as with rhodocene, iridocene dimerises at room temperature but a monomer form can be detected at low temperatures and in gas phase and IR, NMR, and ESR measurements indicate a chemical equilibrium is present and confirm the sandwich structure of the iridocene monomer. The complex , the analogue of rhodocene derivative reported by Fischer, has also been studied and demonstrates properties consistent with <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> of π-backbonding in iridium(I) systems than {{is found in the}} analogous cobalt(I) or rhodium(I) cases.|$|E

He performed various duties, including translating an article by the Italian air power theorist Giulio Douhet into English. In 1934, he was involved with drafting legislation that granted the Air Corps <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> of independence. This legislation prompted the Army to create GHQ Air Force, a centralized, air force-level command headed by an aviator answering directly to the Army Chief of Staff. Lieutenant Colonel Frank M.

5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> of {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, {{but was unable}} to convince Bible scholars of her day to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of sexism in the Bible until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study of the status of women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's Bible, and subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between feminism and the Bible. Today, biblical scholarship by women has come into maturity, with women posing new questions about the Bible, and challenging the very basis of biblical studies.|$|E
5|$|Two French frigates {{were lost}} at Tamatave, taking {{the number of}} frigates lost by the French Navy during the {{campaign}} to ten. The defeat {{marked the end of}} the campaign and the end of French hopes of seriously disrupting British trade with India: the only remaining safe harbours in the region were a few Dutch colonies on Java, which became the next target of the Royal Navy forces in the region. The Mauritius campaign also had an effect on British post-war strategy in the Indian Ocean, demonstrated by the retention of Mauritius as a colony. Bourbon was returned to France in 1814 after Napoleon's abdication.
