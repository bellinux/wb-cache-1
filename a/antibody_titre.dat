Three donors had mumps <b>antibody</b> <b>titres</b> below the detection limit (titre < 230) and three had high <b>antibody</b> <b>titres</b> (range 5700 - 7300).

In this study, we examined the reactivity of sera from lepromatous and tuberculoid leprosy patients (LPs) against a panel of 12 recombinant Mycobacterium leprae proteins and found that six proteins were strongly recognised by multibacillary (MB) patients, while only three were consistently recognised by paucibacillary patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Enzyme-replacement {{therapy has}} been {{assessed}} {{as a treatment}} for patients who have mucopolysaccharidosis I (alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency). We aimed to investigate the humoral immune response to recombinant human alpha-L-iduronidase among these patients. METHODS: We characterised the <b>antibody</b> <b>titres</b> and specific linear sequence epitope reactivity of serum antibodies to alpha-L-iduronidase for ten patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I, at the start of treatment and after 6, 12, 26, 52, and 104 weeks. We compared the values for patients' samples with those for samples from normal human controls. FINDINGS: Before enzyme-replacement therapy, all patients had low serum <b>antibody</b> <b>titres</b> to recombinant human alpha-L-iduronidase that were within the control range. Five of the ten patients produced higher-than-normal <b>titres</b> of <b>antibody</b> to the replacement protein during the treatment course (serum <b>antibody</b> <b>titres</b> 130000 - 500000 and high-affinity epitope reactivity). However, by week 26, antibody reactivity was reduced, and by week 104 all patients had low <b>antibody</b> <b>titres</b> and only low-affinity epitope reactivity. Patients who had mucopolysaccharidosis I with <b>antibody</b> <b>titres</b> within the normal range at 6 - 12 weeks did not subsequently develop immune responses.

Slight (r=- 0. 224), but significant (p< 0. 02) correlation was observed between <b>antibody</b> <b>titre</b> and age, but not number of vaccine doses and interval since the last dose. The results show that the primary series of vaccine is protective for a long period (more than 10 years) and that measure of <b>antibody</b> <b>titre</b> is preferable to injection of no required booster doses (owing to the side effects) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Humoral immune {{parameters}} like total immunoglobulins {{and specific}} antibody levels in serum were studied in filarial chyluria patients. Mean serum IgG was significantly reduced {{in this group}} compared to normal controls, while IgA and IgM levels remained comparable to controls. Anti-filarial <b>antibody</b> <b>titre</b> as measured by enzyme-linked im-munosorbent assay also was significantly reduced. However, the total and specific IgE <b>antibody</b> <b>titre</b> {{was similar to that}} of controls. Specific IgE contents of the patients ' sera could be related to their microfilaraemic status...|$|E
40|$|Infusion of cultured human {{lymphoblastoid}} {{cells into}} ten patients with advanced malignancies {{resulted in a}} significant rise in <b>antibody</b> <b>titre</b> to Epstein-Barr virus in all ten. There was a significant rise in <b>antibody</b> <b>titre</b> to herpes simplex virus (HSV) in six of the ten patients. The four patients who did not respond in their antibody to HSV had no detectable HSV antibody before the cell infusion. In contrast, four patients had detectable <b>antibody</b> <b>titre</b> to cytomegalovirus (CMV) prior to the cell infusion; none of the ten showed a rise in CMV antibody after cell infusion. Observed antibody responses to EBV and HSV occurred regardless of {{the presence or absence}} of detectable herpesviruses in the lymphoblastoid cell lines infused. Six of the ten patients, negative for the heterophile antibody before cell infusion, developed a significant titre of the heterophile antibody after infusion...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 21 rubella {{seronegative}} children vaccinated subcutaneously with Wistar RA 27 / 3 strain live attenuated rubella vaccine {{in a family}} study of vaccine virus transmissibility were reviewed after 6 years. Haemagglutinating inhibiting (HAI) <b>antibody</b> <b>titres</b> of sera collected 46 days, 2 years and 6 years after vaccination were compared. <b>Antibody</b> <b>titres</b> in the vaccinated subjects were not significantly influenced by time, infection in susceptible siblings or revaccination...|$|R
40|$|Rubella {{haemagglutination}} inhibiting (HAI) <b>antibody</b> <b>titres</b> {{were determined}} in 54 seronegative women and 31 naturally immune women after vaccination and revaccination with Wistar RA 27 / 3 strain rubella vaccine {{administered by the}} intranasal or subcutaneous routes or revaccination with the Cendehill strain administered subcutaneously. In addition, HAI <b>antibody</b> <b>titres</b> were determined in 46 seronegative schoolgirls after vaccination with the Cendehill strain and revaccination with the RA 27 / 3 strain...|$|R
40|$|<b>Antibody</b> <b>titres</b> to whole ovary, theca cells, granulosa {{cells and}} {{endometrium}} {{were determined by}} passive haemagglutination and immunofluorescence assays in sera and in cervical and vaginal secretions from 13 patients with endometriosis. <b>Antibody</b> <b>titres</b> to endometrium (mean log 2 +/- s. e. m., 7. 08 +/- 0. 80; P less than 0. 0001), ovary (3. 58 +/- 0. 87; P = 0. 0092), theca cells (4. 42 +/- 0. 73; P less than 0. 0001) and granulosa cells (3. 33 +/- 0. 63; P = 0. 0024) were significantly higher in the patients' sera than in sera from 15 normal non-pregnant females. <b>Antibody</b> <b>titres</b> to granulosa cells were elevated (7. 97 +/- 1. 46; P = 0. 0424) in their cervical secretions. <b>Antibody</b> <b>titres</b> to all tissues tested were similar in vaginal secretions of patients and controls. Immunofluorescent antibody assay of biopsied endometrial tissue and sera from the patients revealed the antibodies to be primarily IgG and IgA. The results suggest that autoantibodies to endometrium and ovary are present in patients with endometriosis...|$|R
