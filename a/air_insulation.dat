40|$|Even {{with the}} {{increasing}} energy crisis, energy consumption for human thermal comfort is considered indispensable reflecting upon the energy utilization in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), which corresponds to 42. 3 % of energy consumption in buildings and homes in USA. This huge amount is economically equivalent to 27 billion dollars and converted into 0. 55 billion dollars worth per 1 ℃ in the room or the office. Moreover, additional expenditure is needed to manage environmental pollution {{to take into account}} greenhouse gas emission of 670 MT CO 2 produced from the same amount of energy generation. From a perspective of energy efficiency, warming up the whole building to fulfill the temperature range for thermal comfort is wasteful compared to locally heating and cooling individuals. Many thermal clothes such as active heating fabrics, cooling pads, and inner clothes have been developed for thermal comfort. However, these garments and tools can’t suggest the solution for the energy efficiency and thermal adaptive function. To overcome these problems, we focused on physiological response of human skin, which is a principal outer having adaptive thermoregulations. Skin has a regulatory mechanism for body temperature as a function of ambient thermal condition by controlling its resistance of heat and moisture transfer.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2005. This thesis {{documents}} {{a research}} study of High Voltage transmission line faults induced by fire. Conductor to conductor and conductor to ground flashovers have been experienced by electricity utilities {{around the world}} under conditions of veld and sugar cane fires. These types of faults are unpredictable and negatively impact line reliability and quality of supply. This is a crucial problem when the revenue of the industry is sensitive to voltage dips. Electricity utilities have taken a preventative approach, like clearing vegetation from the line servitude in order to decrease the frequency of line faults. There {{has also been a}} drive to collaborate with sugarcane farmers in order to have harvesting fires planned with utilities. Some success has been achieved with these initiatives however there still remains a large number of faults. The focus of this study is on the mechanism of fire-induced flashover. Previou s work has displayed the existence of two theories. The first theory suggests that flashover is due to the reduction in <b>air</b> <b>insulation</b> strength caused by a reduced air density that results from the thermal effect of the fire. The second theory suggests that small particles present in the fire cause electric field distortions that induce flashover. This study is focused on a theory, which indicates that flashover is induced due to an enhanced electric field which {{is a result of the}} conductive properties of the flames present in the air gap (the flame conductivity theory). The effects of particles and a reduced air density is said to support this mechanism that is the primary reason for flashover. This thesis present s a summary of the literature where firstly an understanding of <b>air</b> <b>insulation</b> behavior is displayed. Thereafter specific interest is given to the effect of fire and flames wherein the physics of flames are discussed. This then leads to the description of the flame conductivity theory. Chapter 4 deals with a simulative investigation into the effect a conducting flame has on the electric field distribution. This is looked at with a varying flame conductivity and gap length in mind. The simulations specifically cover the 275 kV and 400 kV line configurations. The simulative investigation results in a mapping of electric field enhancement against conductivity values and gap sizes. Thus a flashover probability is assessed by using the two factor flashover criteria when analyzing the electric field stresses. The objective of the experimental work in this study is to obtain insight on how the flame geometry and orientation affects flashover and the dependence of flashover on gap size. Tests involving a fire beneath a conductor were carried out for different gap sizes. Experimentation with particles above a flame was also conducted. It was concluded that flame structure does have an impact on flashover since a flame with sharp edges is more likely to cause flashover. Particles have a reducing effect on <b>air</b> <b>insulation</b> strength. This is mainly due to the fact that the particle reduces the effective air-gap size. No significant effect over and above this is noticed. For gaps spanned by clean Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) flames flashover voltage increases as gap-length increases with some degree of nonlinearity. Flame resistances and conductivity were approximated from measured currents and voltages...|$|E

30|$|Ablation in the {{musculoskeletal}} {{system can be}} quite painful and should be performed under some kind of anaesthesia, ranging from conscious sedation to general anaesthesia. All procedures are performed under extensive local sterility measures and prophylactic antibiotics. Whenever an intact bone cortex is noted the coaxial approach is required; the trocar is either drilled or hammered through the cortex {{depending on the type}} of cortical reaction (lytic vs. blastic). Once in position, the needle is removed from the trocar and the ablation instrument is inserted coaxially. It is recommended to pass through the lesion before placing the probe, as the sensitive tip of the ablation probe could be damaged by trying to force it through the lesion. Always remember to move the trocar away from the expected ablation zone in order to avoid having a conductor that will transmit heat from the lesion to the surface, with resultant skin and soft tissues burns. In addition, extreme care should be taken concerning the surrounding structures, especially those sensitive to heat or cold (e.g. nerves). Heating at 45 ˚C has been shown to be neurotoxic to spinal cord and peripheral nerves [12 – 14]. Cryoablation can also cause neural damage with temporary neuropraxia occurring at − 20 ˚C and permanent neurological damage at ≤− 40 ˚C [2].
