50|$|Ratification is a principal's {{approval}} {{of an act}} of its agent where the agent lacked <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> legally <b>bind</b> the principal. Ratification defines the international act whereby a state indicates its consent to be bound to a treaty if the parties intended to show their consent by such an act. In the case of bilateral treaties, ratification is usually accomplished by exchanging the requisite instruments, while {{in the case of}} multilateral treaties the usual procedure is for the depositary to collect the ratifications of all states, keeping all parties informed of the situation. The institution of ratification grants states the necessary time-frame to seek the required approval for the treaty on the domestic level and to enact the necessary legislation to give domestic effect to that treaty. The term applies to private contract law, international treaties, and constitutions in federations such as the United States and Canada. The term is also used in parliamentary procedure in deliberative assemblies.|$|R
40|$|This Note {{examines}} the split among the federal circuit courts regarding {{the application of}} agency principles to claims of foreign sovereign immunity. Specifically, a minority of courts have applied the doctrine of apparent authority in determining whether a sovereign is bound by the acts of its agents. The majority of courts have, however, declined to apply the doctrine, holding that only actual <b>authority</b> is sufficient <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> sovereigns <b>to</b> their agents’ acts. This Note {{examines the}} policy ramifications of the minority view {{through the lens of}} sovereign debt litigation, especially those conducted by so-called vulture funds, and ultimately concludes that the minority view should be explicitly disregarded via congressional revision of the statutory scheme governing claims of foreign sovereign immunity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The humanized {{antibody}} efalizumab {{is currently}} the only T-cell directed biologic approved {{for the treatment of}} moderate-to-severe psoriasis by both American and European <b>authorities.</b> <b>Binding</b> <b>to</b> and blocking the function of the adhesion molecule leukocyte function associated antigen 1 (LFA- 1), it is believed to interfere with T-cell activation in the lymph node, migration through the circulation into the skin, and re-activation in-loco, all of these representing central steps in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. A comprehensive clinical development program provided large and consistent evidence that efalizumab induces a major clinical benefit in psoriasis. Efalizumab rapidly and substantially improves psoriatic skin symptoms and leads to profound gain in quality of life. It allows safe and effective long-term control of psoriasis. Therefore, evidence-based treatment guidelines recommend its use in moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis...|$|R

50|$|The {{principles}} for resolving {{the issue as}} to whether an individual has the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> the company are not special to derivatives, they are derived from traditional agency law.

It is common for parties to exchange authorised signatory lists of persons who have authority to execute confirmations and refer to this in the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement. However, {{this does not mean that}} this is determinative of the authority issue, and a person not on one of these lists may have the authority to sign a confirmation.

50|$|When the {{partnership}} is being constituted, or {{the composition of}} the firm is changing, limited partnerships are generally required to file documents with the relevant state registration office. Limited partners must explicitly disclose their status when dealing with other parties, so that such parties are on notice that the individual negotiating with them carries limited liability. It is customary that the documentation and electronic materials issued to the public by the firm will carry a clear statement identifying the legal nature of the firm and listing the partners separately as general and limited. Hence, unlike the GPs, the limited partners do not have inherent agency <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> the firm unless they are subsequently held out as agents (and so create an agency by estoppel); or acts of ratification by the firm create ostensible authority.|$|E
