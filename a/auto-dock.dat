Protection of the enzyme {{acetylcholinesterase}} (AChE) from the toxic effects of organophosphate insecticides and chemical warfare agents (OPs) may {{be provided by}} inhibitors that bind at the peripheral binding site (P-site) {{near the mouth of}} the active-site gorge. Compounds that bind to this site may selectively block access to the acylation site (A-site) catalytic serine for OPs, but not ace-tylcholine itself. To identify such compounds, we employed a virtual screening approach using <b>AUTO-DOCK</b> 4. 2 and AutoDock Vina, confirmed using compounds experimentally known to bind specifi-cally to either the A-site or P-site. Both programs demonstrated the ability to correctly predict the binding site. Virtual screening of the NCI Diversity Set II was conducted using the apo form of the enzyme, and with acetylcholine bound at the crys-tallographic locations in the A-site only and in both and A- and P-sites. The docking identified 32 compounds that were obtained for testing, and one was demonstrated to bind specifically to the P-site in an inhibitor competition assay...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: NNScore is a neural-network-based scoring {{function}} {{designed to}} aid the computational identification of small-molecule ligands. While the test cases included in the original NNScore article demonstrated {{the utility of the}} program, the application examples were limited. The purpose of the current work is to further confirm that neural-network scoring functions are effective, even when compared to the scoring functions of state-of-the-art docking programs, such as AutoDock, the most commonly cited program, and <b>Auto-Dock</b> Vina, thought to be two orders of magnitude faster. Aside from providing additional validation of the original NNScore function, we here present a second neural-network scoring function, NNScore 2. 0. NNScore 2. 0 considers many more binding characteristics when predicting affinity than does the original NNScore. The network output of NNScore 2. 0 also differs from that of NNScore 1. 0; rather than a binary classification of ligand potency, NNScore 2. 0 provides a single estimate of the pKd. To facilitate use, NNScore 2. 0 has been implemented as an open-source python script. A copy can be obtained fro...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In-silico {{study was}} {{performed}} to find the pharmacodynamics, toxicity profiles and biological activities of three phytochemicals isolated from Limoniastrum feei (Plumbagenaceae). Online pharmacokinetic tools were used to estimate the potential of Quercetin, kaempferol- 3 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside (astragalin) and quercitin- 7 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside as specific drugs. Then the prediction of potential targets of these compounds were investigated using PharmMapper. <b>Auto-Dock</b> 4. 0 software was used to investigate the different interactions of these compounds with the targets predicted earlier. The permeability of quercetin was found within the range stated by Lipinski ׳s rule of five. Hematopoietic prostaglandin (PG) D synthase (HPGDS), farnesyl diphosphate synthetase (FPPS) and the deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) were potential targets for quercetin, astragalin and quercetin 7, respectively. Quercetin showed antiallergic and anti-inflammatory activity, while astragalin and quercetin 7 were predicted to have anticancer activities. The activity of Astragalin appeared to be mediated by FPPS inhibition. The inhibition of DCK was predicted as the anticancer mechanisms of quercetin 7. The compounds showed interesting interactions and satisfactory binding energies when docked into their targets. These compounds are proposed to have activities against a variety of human aliments such as allergy, tumors, muscular dystrophy, and diabetic cataracts...|$|E
40|$|Human telomeres are {{comprised}} of d(TTAGGG) repeats {{involved in the}} formation of G-quadruplex DNA structures. Ligands stabilizing these G-quadruplex DNA structures are potential inhibitors of the cancer cell-associated enzyme telomerase. In human cells, telomerase adds multiple copies of the 5 ' -GGTTAG- 3 ' motif {{to the end of the}} G-strand of the telomere and in the majority of tumor cells it results over-expressed. Several structural studies have revealed a diversity of topologies for telomeric quadruplexes, which are sensitive to the nature of the cations present, to the flanking sequences, and probably also to concentration, as confirmed by the different conformations deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The existence of different polymorphisms in the DNA quadruplex and the absence of a uniquely precise binding site prompted us to carefully compare the two different docking approaches: MOLINE and <b>Auto-Dock.</b> As target we have selected six different experimental models of the human telomeric sequence d[AG(3) (T(2) AG(3)) (3) ] based on three G-tetrads and as ligands the telomestatin isomers, whose the S enantomer is experimentally known to recognize the G-quadruplex better than the R one. In this communication we discuss the different binding modes of the well known strong telomestatin G-quadruplex binder form the thermodynamic and the geometrical points of view. With respect to this last issue we propose an easy approach to classify binding modes of G-quadruplex ligands based on a single angle descriptor as tool for the quick analysis of the binding modes...|$|E
40|$|Background: HIV- 1 has {{numerous}} proteins encoded {{within its}} genome, which acquaints {{it with the}} required arsenal to establish a favorable host cell environment suitable for viral replication and pathogenesis. Among these proteins, one protein that is indispensable and ambiguous is the Nef protein. Aim: Interaction of Nef protein with different host-cell protein was predicted and subsequently the down regulation of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD 4) was targeted through designing of inhibitors of Nef protein for either preventing or if not at least delaying pathogenesis. Materials and Methods: The interaction network of Nef protein with host-cell proteins were predicted by PIMRider. Analogue of Lopinavir were prepared and evaluated considering all factors affecting the drug stability and toxicity. Finally Docking simulation were performed using an <b>Auto-Dock</b> Tool 4. 0. Results: In the interaction network of Nef protein with different host-cell proteins it was found out that 22 host cell proteins {{are involved in the}} interaction and execution of different types of functions in host cell but these functions are altered with the interaction with the Nef protein. After extensive and controlled in silico analysis it has been observed that the analogue LOPI 1 binds to Nef protein (2 NEF) at CD 4 interacting site residues giving minimum binding energy of − 7. 68 Kcal/mole, low Ki value of 2. 34 μM, maximum number of hydrogen bonds (8), good absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties, and less toxicity in comparison with the standard Lopinavir against HIV 1 protease (1 HPV). Conclusion: The newly designed analogue (LOPI 1) is showing significant in silico interaction with Nef protein and protease and can be taken forward as a potent drug lead, which may finally emerge out to be even better than the standard Lopinavir...|$|E
