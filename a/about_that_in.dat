[...] {{need to talk}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> [...] songs", {{concluding}} that she needed [...] "escape". Durand was determined to create [...] "the best album yet", and set up dates and recording sessions with Chase and Schlesinger to work on what would become All Hours. The album explored new genres for Ivy, including EDM and electronic music, something Chase stated [...] "seem natural and ma sense".|$|E
500|$|The title Wildlife is not {{derived from}} lyrics from the album, but from themes that connect the songs. Dreyer regards {{wildlife}} as [...] "an all-encompassing word to sum everything up", {{and he has}} said that [...] "we all witness tragedy and change. It's the summation of our existence." [...] On the inside of the album cover the words [...] "To – for everything" [...] are written as a dedication with a word being crossed out. It has been speculated by some that the word is the name 'Helen'. Drummer Brad Vander Lugt when asked about the dedication replied [...] "That’s Jordan’s story to tell, and not mine. [...] It does have significance to a story he is telling. You will probably hear a little bit more <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> future work, Jordan has been known to continue stories or themes onto future albums." ...|$|E

2500|$|But I {{would also}} add that as {{important}} as ABC is, {{the fact is that}} this is a disease where 50 percent of the people infected in the world are women. When I cite those numbers to people here in the United States, I find most people are astonished. They just have no idea <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>In</b> some countries in Africa, it's well above 50 percent that are women and girls. In many cases this is driven by cultural factors, where young girls are having sex with older men and [...] coerced to do that, where women aren't regarded as equal citizens with men. So there are lots of things that need to be done addressing those kinds of cultural issues also.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{said that}} the first track on the album, [...] "Heaven" [...] was a huge [...] "epic pop song" [...] which had {{sweeping}} strings. It came about when {{she was having a}} late night conversation with Naughty Boy, the song's producer with whom she worked throughout the whole album. She said that Naughty Boy had a beat running in the background, and then she got the first line of the song and the song began to write itself from there. She said; [...] "I love how songs like that develop: before we knew it, we were putting strings on with a synth, Naughty Boy suggested the Funky Drummer loop and it came together really organically." [...] The song was heavily compared to Massive Attack's [...] "Unfinished Sympathy", however Sandé said that she takes it as a compliment as she is a big fan of Massive Attack. However, she said lyrically or melodically the songs are not similar, but the Funky Drummer loop has been used so much and it has strings on people and that is why the connection is made between the two songs. She said she was glad if people get the same vibe from the song, as she loves the song and said the song was [...] "really exciting". Sandé said she also [...] "designed" [...] the song for a night club moment, where everyone can put their hands in the air. The song's genre featured a dubstep pop. Sandé {{said that the}} song was {{based on the fact that}} she believes in God and heaven, although she does not follow a religion. She said that what inspired her the most to write the track was her idea of heaven, which was being surrounded by music and somewhere which is very calm, and she wrote <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Heaven".|$|E
