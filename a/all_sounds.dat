5|$|<b>All</b> <b>Sounds</b> of SaGa is a {{compilation}} {{album of the}} soundtracks for The Final Fantasy Legend, Final Fantasy Legend II, and Final Fantasy Legend III. The first album of the two-disc set is split between 15 tracks from SaGa 1 and 19 tracks from SaGa 2, while the second disc holds 20 SaGa 3 tracks and an arranged medley of SaGa 1 tracks by Uematsu. The album was published on December 21, 1991 by NTT Publishing/Square with a catalog number of N32D-007/8 and re-released on December 15, 2004 by NTT Publishing with a catalog number of NTCP-1004/5. The album has a total length of 1:28:18 and 55 tracks.|$|E
5|$|Audioslave was an American rock {{supergroup}} {{formed in}} Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave {{as a combination}} of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, {{it was noted that}} they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that <b>all</b> <b>sounds</b> on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals.|$|E

5|$|The SaGa Series 20th Anniversary Original Soundtrack -Premium Box- is a soundtrack album {{collection}} {{of music from}} every released SaGa game. The compilation features 515 tracks on 20 CDs with a total length of 19:02:45, and includes a DVD of developer interviews, a stand display showing an illustration painted by Tomomi Kobayashi, and materials to build a display box for the CDs. The set consists {{of all of the}} soundtrack albums from the SaGa series, with <b>All</b> <b>Sounds</b> of SaGa broken up into one disc per game, rather than the original two discs. The set was published on August 26, 2009 to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the release of the first SaGa video game with the catalog numbers SQEX-10145~65. Patrick Gann described it as an excellent collection that was worth the purchase for anyone who wanted to own the entire set and did not already have most of the albums, though he noted that as it included multiple composers and styles the compilation box would not be justified for everyone who liked just some of the music of the SaGa series.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the video games Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II was {{composed}} by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu, who {{would go on to}} be the exclusive composer for the next seven Final Fantasy games. Although they were composed separately, music from the two games has only been released together. <b>All</b> <b>Sounds</b> of Final Fantasy I•II, a compilation of almost all of the music in the games, was released by DataM/Polystar in 1989, and subsequently re-released by NTT Publishing in 1994. Symphonic Suite Final Fantasy, an arranged album of music from the two games by Katsuhisa Hattori and his son Takayuki Hattori was released by DataM in 1989, and re-released by NTT Publishing/Polystar in 1994. Final Fantasy & Final Fantasy II Original Soundtrack, another arranged album, this time by Nobuo Uematsu and Tsuyoshi Sekito, was released in 2002 by DigiCube and again in 2004 by Square Enix.|$|E

5|$|His first {{project was}} a co-effort {{that same year}} between himself and Nobuo Uematsu for the Game Boy title Final Fantasy Legend II (SaGa 2). It led the {{following}} year to the first album release of his music, <b>All</b> <b>Sounds</b> of SaGa, which was a combination album of The Final Fantasy Legend, Final Fantasy Legend II, and Final Fantasy Legend III; all of Ito's work on Legend II appeared on the album. Shortly after in 1991, he composed his first solo work, the soundtrack for Final Fantasy Adventure (Seiken Densetsu), another Game Boy title. He {{then returned to the}} SaGa series for the next few years, composing the soundtracks to the Super Famicom's Romancing SaGa, Romancing SaGa 2, and Romancing SaGa 3. These soundtracks sparked Ito's first arranged albums; the first game was arranged in a French musical style by Masaaki Mizuguchi, while the other two were arranged by Ryou Fukui and Taro Iwashiro, respectively, into orchestral pieces. Ito was originally scheduled to continue on with the Mana series and compose the soundtrack to Seiken Densetsu 2 (Secret of Mana), but was forced to hand the project off to Hiroki Kikuta as his first score due to the demand on his time for scoring Romancing SaGa.|$|E

25|$|Japan also {{pledged that}} {{if it had been}} granted the rights to host the 2022 World Cup games, it would develop {{technology}} enabling it to provide a live international telecast of the event in 3D, which would allow 400 stadiums in 208 countries to provide 360 million people with real-time 3D coverage of the games projected on giant screens, captured in 360 degrees by 200 HD cameras. Furthermore, Japan will broadcast the games in holographic format if the technology to do so is available by that time. Beyond allowing the world's spectators to view the games on flat screens projecting 3D imaging, holographic projection would project the games onto stadium fields, creating a greater illusion of actually being {{in the presence of the}} players.

50|$|After Fox {{lost control}} of Fox Studios in 1930, he used the Tri-Ergon patents to sue the film {{industry}} {{in order to take}} a part-ownership in <b>all</b> <b>sound</b> films and in <b>all</b> <b>sound</b> film systems. The Tri-Ergon patents named particular technical features that preceded all other sound-on-film patents, such as a flywheel on the sound drum. Fox at first won his lawsuit and then lost it in an unusual reversal of decision by the U. S. Supreme Court. In Germany, the Tri-Ergon patents were determined to be so strong, for a time <b>all</b> other <b>sound</b> film systems were shut out of that country.|$|R

25|$|From the {{contemporary}} point of view, {{the importance of}} Schaeffer's musique concrète is threefold. He developed the concept of including any and <b>all</b> <b>sounds</b> into the vocabulary of music. At first he concentrated on working with sounds other than those produced by traditional musical instruments. Later on, he found {{it was possible to}} remove the familiarity of musical instrument sounds and abstract them further by techniques such as removing the attack of the recorded sound. He was among the first musicians to manipulate recorded sound for the purpose of using it in conjunction with other sounds in order to compose a musical piece. Techniques such as tape looping and tape splicing were used in his research, often comparing to sound collage. The advent of Schaeffer's manipulation of recorded sound became possible only with technologies that were developed after World War II had ended in Europe. His work is recognized today as an essential precursor to contemporary sampling practices. Schaeffer {{was among the first to}} use recording technology in a creative and specifically musical way, harnessing the power of electronic and experimental instruments in a manner similar to Luigi Russolo, whom he admired and from whose work he drew inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} game's orchestrated soundtrack; while GameSpot's Greg Kasavin commented that [...] "it <b>all</b> <b>sounds</b> brilliant". GameSpy praised {{the music for}} its nostalgic effect, with soundtracks ranging from {{multiple}} Nintendo series.|$|E

500|$|GameZone {{praised the}} game's sound effects, saying that [...] "you {{will feel the}} explosions of the cannon balls, the muskets firing their endless volleys, and the {{destruction}} of a building. It <b>all</b> <b>sounds</b> extremely realistic, and makes the game come that much more alive." [...] Eurogamer said [...] "AoE3...sounds fantastic," [...] while Game Revolution mentioned that [...] "The ambient sounds, music and voice work all suit the colonial theme." ...|$|E
500|$|Square has reused several {{songs from}} the game (notably the [...] "Battle" [...] theme) in later titles and {{released}} them on compilation soundtracks. The introductory music, titled [...] "Prologue", appeared remixed as the opening {{for the next two}} SaGa games. [...] "Heartful Tears" [...] (also known as [...] "Wipe Your Tears Away") became a staple for later SaGa titles, used in five of the games and arranged differently each time. Fifteen tracks were later included in the 1991 two-disc <b>All</b> <b>Sounds</b> of SaGa soundtrack, encompassing the Game Boy SaGa series and re-released by Square Enix in December 2004 as SaGa Zenkyoku Shu. The final track of the set, [...] "Journey's End", is a synthesizer-arranged version of six of the game's tracks combined into one by Uematsu. In the liner notes for <b>All</b> <b>Sounds</b> of SaGa, Uematsu states he enjoys listening to the track while remembering scenes from the game. The Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra played the song in the Press Start 2008 -Symphony of Games- concert as part of the [...] "When Nobuo Uematsu Was Young" [...] medley, while the [...] "Main Theme" [...] was played alongside [...] "Save the World" [...] from Final Fantasy Legend II on July 9, 2011 at the Symphonic Odysseys concert.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers at {{the time}} of first {{publication}} met the book with undisguised scepticism and satire, but felt that Knight presented his unlikely case with ingenuity. Quentin Bell wrote in The Times Literary Supplement: [...] " [...] begins bravely and fairly by presenting the greater part of the author's case and admitting at once that 'it <b>all</b> <b>sounds</b> terribly unlikely'. It does." [...] Medical History stated: [...] "Despite the author's ingenuity the case does not stand up to careful and critical analysis and is no more 'final' than its many predecessors." [...] Since then, scholars from multiple disciplines have rejected Gorman's story as a ridiculous fantasy, and highlight many facts which contradict the version of events presented by Knight.|$|E

500|$|<b>All</b> <b>Sounds</b> of Final Fantasy I•II is a soundtrack {{album of}} video game music from Final Fantasy I and Final Fantasy II, composed, arranged, and {{performed}} by Nobuo Uematsu. It spans 49 tracks and covers a duration of 62:32. It was first released on February 28, 1989, by DataM/Polystar, and subsequently re-released on March 25, 1994, by NTT Publishing. The original release bears the catalog number H25X-20015, and the re-release bears the catalog number PSCR-5251. Tracks 1 and 49 are arranged versions of tracks {{which appeared in}} both of the games, tracks 2-21 are from Final Fantasy I, and 22-47 are from Final Fantasy II. Track 48, [...] "Dungeon", was composed for Final Fantasy II, but was not used in the game; it was later used in Final Fantasy VI under the name [...] "The Magic House".|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} and THX-certified audio were lauded by critics. The game's animations, scenery, player models, cutscenes, music and voice acting were particularly well received. [...] "Sound effects {{used in the}} game will also blow you away," [...] Knutson said, [...] "Everything from the explosions, swords clashing, hundreds of incoming enemies storming your way, <b>all</b> <b>sounds</b> like it came directly from the movie!" [...] GameSpot's Greg Kasavin noted that [...] "Frame rate issues do affect each version of the game, to varying degrees, {{and none of the}} character models for the main characters look all that remarkable," [...] but conceded that [...] "all other aspects of The Return of the Kings graphics are outstanding [...] The game's audio is even more effective than the graphics at conveying the intensity of the action." [...] Ian McKellen's narration of the game as Gandalf was also praised.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "Mars Attacks! is all 1990s cynicism and disbelief, mocking the {{conventions}} that Independence Day takes seriously. This <b>all</b> <b>sounds</b> clever enough but in truth, Mars Attacks! {{is not as}} much fun as it should be. Few of its numerous actors make a lasting impression and Burton's heart and soul is not in the humor". Desson Thomson from The Washington Post said [...] "Mars Attacks! evokes plenty of sci-fi classics, from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Dr. Strangelove (1964), but it doesn't do much beyond that superficial exercise. With the exception of Burton's jolting sight gags (I may never recover from the vision of Sarah Jessica Parker's head grafted on to the body of a chihuahua), the comedy is half-developed, pedestrian material. And the climactic battle between Earthlings and Martians is dull and overextended." ...|$|E
