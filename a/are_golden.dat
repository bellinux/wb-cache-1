5|$|B. i. coromandus {{differs from}} the {{nominate}} subspecies in breeding plumage, when the buff colour on its head extends to the cheeks and throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and tarsus are longer on average than in B. i. ibis. B. i. seychellarum is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white cheeks and throat, like B. i. ibis, but the nuptial plumes <b>are</b> <b>golden,</b> as with B. i. coromandus. Individuals with abnormally grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, X.bracteatum can be {{distinguished}} from X.bicolor in Tasmania by its broader leaves and cobwebby hairs on the stems, and from X.macranthum in Western Australia by the flower head colour; the latter species has white flower heads whereas those of X.bracteatum <b>are</b> <b>golden</b> yellow. Xerochrysum subundulatum from alpine and subalpine areas of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania is rhizomatous, and has markedly pointed orange bracts. The eastern Australian species X. viscosum may {{be distinguished}} by its rough and sticky leaves.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its {{predecessor}} Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie features three-dimensional worlds containing items to be collected. Among the items <b>are</b> <b>golden</b> jigsaw pieces, called Jiggies, {{that are used}} to complete jigsaw puzzles that unlock the levels. Instead of exploring the hub world in search of incomplete puzzle boards as in Banjo-Kazooie, a singular board is used within a temple where Master Jiggywiggy resides. Whenever the player has obtained the number of Jiggies required, a timed puzzle-completion challenge can be played, after which Jiggywiggy grants access to each world. Each puzzle challenge requires more Jiggies than the last.|$|E

5|$|Arbroath smokies, {{for which}} Arbroath is {{well-known}} nationally and internationally, are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004, which limits Arbroath smokie production to within 4km of Arbroath. Smokies {{are made from}} haddock using traditional methods {{dating back to the}} late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish <b>are</b> <b>golden</b> brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area. However, one larger processor, RR Spink, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains. It appears that, nowadays, the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie. The company holds the Royal Warrant as a fishmonger to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Female banded sugar ants {{are easily}} {{recognised}} by their black head, orange thorax and the orange-brown band that wraps around their gaster. Males {{of the species}} are completely black. The dark sides of the thorax and legs are ferruginous (rusty in colour). The scape (the base of the antenna) and mandibles are black, and the head is wider than the thorax. The thorax is longer than its total width and slightly compressed, and the gaster is covered with tiny black dots. Erect setae <b>are</b> <b>golden</b> in colour and absent under the head but present on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia and scape are shorter than those on the mesosoma. The anterior of the gaster is lighter in colour compared to the posterior, and the dorsum of the mesosoma is outlined and curved. A worker's metanotum is absent and the eyes are bulging, while a soldier's metanotum is noticeable and the eyes are flat. The wings on the queen are dark, and the stigmata and nerves are yellow. While many ant species have a metapleural gland, the gland is not present in the banded sugar ant; the number of malpighian tubules in workers is 21.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} the workers and queens are as long as broad with convexed sides. The mandibles are long with {{thirteen}} known teeth. The first and third segments of the funiculus are equally long. The thorax is longer than broad by two to three-fourths its width, and the mesonotum is longer than it is broad in workers; the mesonotum is broader than it is long in queens. The node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is {{as long as it}} is broad, and the postpetiole is one-sixth broader than long. The first segment of the gaster is broader than its length. M.regularis shares a similar appearance to M.forficata, but there are several morphological differences that separate the two. Owing to the rugose sculpture of the head and thorax, M.regularis is noticeably smaller than M.forficata. The mandibles of M.regularis are much narrower, the posterior corners of the head are more round and the petiolar peduncle is longer. The mandibles appear to be deep red, and some areas, such as the gastric segments, <b>are</b> <b>golden</b> brown.|$|E

A conspicuous black stripe {{runs along the}} spine (back bone). Chital have well-developed preorbital glands (near the eyes) which have stiff hairs. They also have well-developed metatarsal glands and pedal glands located in their hind legs. The preorbital glands, larger in males than in females, are frequently opened in response to certain stimuli.|$|E

Inflorescences occur on short lateral branchlets; this species bears a great many inflorescences, often carrying an inflorescence in almost every axil. Flowers <b>are</b> <b>golden</b> or reddish pink, with a greenish cream limb. After flowering, heads can bear up to 5 follicles each.|$|E
25|$|What this means: The colour of {{the shield}} is first described. Vert is green so the shield is green. A fess is a {{horizontal}} stripe across the shield and engrailed means {{the edges of}} the fess are wavy. The fess is between three crowns and or means gold so the crowns <b>are</b> <b>golden.</b> Conventionally with three objects two are placed above and one below, in this case, the fess. A canton is a square and azure is blue so a blue square is placed on the fess. An estoille is a star and argent is silver so there are four silver stars on the canton. These are supposed to represent the Southern Cross.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} {{temple of}} some 20 in Muang Sing is the Wat Sing Jai or Wat Xieng Jai, located behind the Muangsing Guest House. The monastery, painted in hues {{reminiscent of the}} Caribbean, has a museum, but because its items are of high local value, it is closed to visitors for fear of theft. Another major temple is the Wat Namkeo. The wihan in the town are typically multi-tired roofed buildings typical of northern Laos, but most houses have corrugated metal roofs and wooden beams, reflecting a lack of wealth in the area. The Buddhas, however, <b>are</b> <b>golden,</b> and typically have large long earlobes, commonly seen in Xishuangbanna, China and Shan State of Burma.|$|E

The head is dark olive brown to greenish above, while the cheeks and opercles are golden-green, with a dark blotch on the opercle of some individuals. The trumpeter whiting is usually easy to {{distinguish}} by its characteristic dark brown irregular blotches present {{on the side of}} the fish, as well as a golden silver longitudinal band. The spinous dorsal fin is whitish, with a mottled olive green and brown texture. The soft dorsal fin has about five rows of brownish green spots. The anal and ventral fins <b>are</b> <b>golden</b> to yellow with cream margins, while the pectoral fins are yellow to pale yellow-green, with a distinct black-blue spot at the base. The caudal fin is olive brown to a darkish green-brown with darker margins.|$|E

500|$|Xerochrysum 'Princess of Wales' is a {{spontaneous}} hybrid, arising from {{a cross between}} 'Dargan Hill Monarch' and an annual form. Arising in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra, it was selected by employee Peter Ollerenshaw in summer 1983. He applied to register the cultivar with ACRA in March 1985. It was named in honour of a visit by Diana, Princess of Wales to the gardens in November 1985, the same month registration was granted. With compact foliage, this form reaches [...] high and wide. Unlike its parent 'Dargan Hill Monarch', its foliage has hair only on the midrib on the leaf underside. It flowers very profusely, and the large flower heads are borne on stalks [...] above the foliage. Unlike other forms, the stems wither and die naturally after flowering, making way for more new growth and flowers. The flower heads <b>are</b> <b>golden</b> yellow and measure [...] across.|$|E
500|$|In each story, {{the player}} navigates through {{open-ended}} hub worlds known as [...] "Town Stages", {{where they can}} converse with townspeople and perform missions to advance the story. The main gameplay takes place in linear levels called [...] "Action Stages" [...] that become accessible as the game progresses. Although each character traverses the same levels, their unique abilities allow the player to access different areas of each stage and prevent them from accessing certain items. Scattered through each level <b>are</b> <b>golden</b> rings, which serve {{as a form of}} health. The rings can protect a character from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, at which point they will be scattered and blink before disappearing. The game begins with Sonic, Shadow, and Silver each assigned a limited number of lives. These lives are successively lost whenever, with no rings in their possession, the characters are hit by an enemy or obstacle or encounter other fatal hazard. The game ends when the player exhausts the characters' lives. Every few levels, players will encounter a boss stage; in order to proceed, players must defeat the boss by depleting its health meter.|$|E
