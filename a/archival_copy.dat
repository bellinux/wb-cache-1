5000|$|Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. {{established}} the [...] "substantial non-infringing use" [...] test for contributory infringement. Quaid argued that RAMKEY passes this test {{because it can}} be used to create archival copies that are exempt under 17 U.S.C. §117(2). Vault argued that RAMKEY did not have any non-infringing use because one could create a sufficient <b>archival</b> <b>copy</b> without the use of RAMKEY. Vault asserted that the <b>archival</b> <b>copy</b> exemption of 17 U.S.C. §117(2) was designed to protect only against [...] "destruction or damage by mechanical or electrical failure," [...] but not against (for example) loss or destruction of a disk. The court declined to construe the archival exemption in this manner, saying that even though it had appeal, it was not the law and that only the Congress could decide to limit the exemption in that way.|$|E

The court said that, while there are legitimate uses that some users might engage in, 321 Studios itself was distributing software which had {{the primary purpose of}} circumventing CSS.|$|E

50|$|In {{spite of}} these disadvantages, there are several use cases where LTFS-formatted tape is {{superior}} to disk and other data storage technologies. While LTO seek times can range from 10 to 100 seconds, the streaming data transfer rate can match or exceed disk data transfer rates. Additionally, LTO cartridges are easily transportable and hold far more data than any other removable data storage format. The ability to copy a large file or a large selection of files (up to 1.5 TB for LTO-5 or 2.5 TB for LTO-6) to an LTFS-formatted tape, allows easy exchange of data to a collaborator or saving of an <b>archival</b> <b>copy.</b>|$|E

50|$|High-quality {{cotton fibre}} paper {{is known to}} last {{hundreds}} of years without appreciable fading, discoloration, or deterioration, so it is often used for important documents, such as the <b>archival</b> <b>copies</b> of dissertations or theses. As a rule of thumb, for each percentage point of cotton fibre, a user may expect one year of resisting deterioration by use (the handling to which paper may be subjected). Legal document paper typically contains 25% cotton. Cotton paper will produce a better printout than copy paper because it can more readily absorb ink or toner.|$|R

The system uses erasure codes as a means to recreate data in the event that one or more servers fail.
