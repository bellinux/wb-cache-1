40|$|Insectivorous birds reduce {{arthropod}} abundances {{and their}} damage to plants in some, but not all, studies where predation by birds has been assessed. The variation in bird effects {{may be due}} to characteristics such as plant productivity or quality, habitat complexity, and/or species diversity of predator and prey assemblages. Since <b>agroforestry</b> <b>systems</b> vary in such characteristics, these systems provide a good starting point for understanding when and where we can expect predation by birds to be important. We analyze data from bird exclosure studies in forests and <b>agroforestry</b> <b>systems</b> to ask whether birds consistently reduce their arthropod prey base and whether bird predation differs between forests and <b>agroforestry</b> <b>systems.</b> Further, we focus on <b>agroforestry</b> <b>systems</b> to ask whether the magnitude of bird predation (1) differs between canopy trees and understory plants, (2) differs when migratory birds are present or absent, and (3) correlates with bird abundance and diversity. We found that, across all studies, birds reduce all arthropods, herbivores, carnivores, and plant damage. We observed no difference in the magnitude of bird effects between <b>agroforestry</b> <b>systems</b> and forests despite simplified habitat structure and plant diversity in agroforests. Within <b>agroforestry</b> <b>systems,</b> bird reduction of arthropods was greater in the canopy than the crop layer. Top-down effects of bird predation were especially strong during censuses when migratory birds were present in <b>agroforestry</b> <b>systems.</b> Importantly, the diversity of the predator assemblage correlated with the magnitude of predator effects; where the diversity of birds, especially migratory birds, was greater, birds reduced arthropod densities to a greater extent. We outline potential mechanisms for relationships between bird predator, insect prey, and habitat characteristics, and we suggest future studies using tropical agroforests as a model system to further test these areas of ecological theory...|$|R

50|$|A cabruca is an <b>agroforestry</b> <b>system</b> {{found in}} the Latin American {{countries}} of Belize, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica and Brazil. These cabrucas, largely run by smallholder farmers, are the production locations for cacao trees that grow underneath the canopy of mixed native trees. This forest canopy like the shade coffee {{has been found to}} provide a diverse ecosystem. An example of the biological importance of cabrucas can be found in Brazil’s main cacao production region Southern Bahia, Brazil. A 2008 study of biodiversity conservation in cacao regions found that the cabrucas in Southern Bahia are used by a significant amount of native flora and fauna. Due to parts of the region experiencing high deforestation and fragmentation, these cabrucas are providing habitat, fragment connection, and edge effect reduction. Another study in Costa Rica on the role of these cacao plantations in maintaining avian diversity found that the plantations do not substitute for a forest but do provide a home for a large number of avian generalist species.|$|E

The study shows that Sicilian <b>agroforestry</b> <b>systems</b> are much more diversified than it was known so far.

40|$|A {{challenge}} in establishing <b>agroforestry</b> <b>systems</b> is ensuring that farmers {{are interested in}} the tree species, and are aware of how to adequately manage these species. This challenge was tackled in the Atlantic Rainforest biome (Brazil), where a participatory trial with <b>agroforestry</b> coffee <b>systems</b> was carried out, followed by a participatory systematisation of the farmers experiences. Our objective was to identify the main tree species used by farmers as well as their criteria for selecting or rejecting tree species. Furthermore, we aimed to present a specific inventory of trees of the Leguminosae family. In order to collect the data, we reviewed the bibliography of the participatory trial, visited and interviewed the farmers and organised workshops with them. The main farmers' criteria for selecting tree species were compatibility with coffee, amount of biomass, production and the labour needed for tree management. The farmers listed 85 tree species; we recorded 28 tree species of the Leguminosae family. Most trees were either native to the biome or exotic fruit trees. In order to design and manage complex <b>agroforestry</b> <b>systems,</b> family farmers need sufficient knowledge and autonomy, which can be reinforced when a participatory methodology is used for developing on-farm <b>agroforestry</b> <b>systems.</b> In the case presented, the farmers learned how to manage, reclaim and conserve their land.
