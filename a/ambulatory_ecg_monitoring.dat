50|$|Two {{methods are}} {{currently}} FDA-cleared to perform MTWA {{testing in the}} U.S., namely, the Spectral Method, which was developed by Cohen and Smith at M.I.T. and was commercialized by Cambridge Heart, and the Modified Moving Average (MMA) method, which was developed by Nearing and Verrier at Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and is commercialized by GE Healthcare. The Spectral Method requires a specialized exercise protocol and proprietary electrodes and washout of beta-adrenergic blocking agents to allow the patient to achieve a target heart rate of 105-110 beats/min. The MMA method uses routine, symptom-limited exercise stress testing or <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitoring</b> and standard electrodes and requires that chronic medications be retained. Both methods achieve 1-microvolt resolution. Interpretation of Spectral Method test results is described above. With the MMA method, risk {{is defined by the}} peak MTWA level, with cutpoints of 47µV and 60 µV for abnormal and severely abnormal risk, respectively. Quantification of TWA levels allows physicians to track patients' responses to medications and cardiac rehabilitation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>ambulatory</b> electrocardiographic (<b>ECG)</b> <b>monitor</b> is {{a device}} {{developed}} approximately 30 {{years ago to}} detect, locate and document hemodynamic insufficiency states in target organs with compromised regional arterial circulations. These insufficiency states are usually silent until they are suddenly precipitated by secondary remote, hemodynamically significant cardiac arrhythmias, hypotensive states caused by internal hemorrhage or reduced cardiac output including cardiogenic shock. Insufficiency events cause serious regional dysfunction, resulting in transitory or permanent damage of the remote target organs (brain, heart, splanchnic and renal) often causing paralytic ileus, gangrene of the gut or rectum, myocardial infarction or cerebral stroke. Comprehensive experimental studies conducted in the author's laboratory {{over a period of}} years (1946 – 1971) proved that such remote ischemic states are often recurrent and can cause serious, irreparable damage, but whenever the cause of the regional ischemic state was treated promptly it could reverse the insufficiency state. Practical <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> diagnostic <b>monitors</b> and data reduction systems were developed to diagnose these elusive precipitating pathophysiologic events that might coincide with the patient's symptoms and thus determine the most appropriate preventive therapy...|$|R

5000|$|Wireless {{ambulatory}} electrocardiography (ECG) {{is a type}} of ambulatory electrocardiography with {{recording devices}} that use wireless technology, such as Bluetooth and smartphones, for at-home cardiac monitoring (monitoring of heart rhythms). These devices are generally recommended to people who have been previously diagnosed with arrhythmias and want to have them monitored, or for those who have suspected arrhythmias and need to be monitored {{over an extended period of}} time in order to be diagnosed. [...] Wireless Ambulatory ECGs work in a way similar to a regular ECG by measuring the electrical potential of the heart through the skin. The data is saved on an application on a Smart Phone, and then uploaded to a computer through Bluetooth or Cloud technologies. The information can also be sent through these technologies or through email to a doctor or cardiac technician. [...] Wireless Ambulatory ECGs are able to provide voice alarm messages when cardiac abnormalities occur, such as bradycardia, and can record this information and provide a screen prompt for the patient to view the data. The devices can also store mass amounts of ECG data on the phone, replay the ECG readings at a high speed, and have a low voltage alarm function to not waste the battery life. These characteristics of the devices are seen as benefits in comparison to current <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitoring</b> equipment such as the Holter monitor.|$|E
40|$|Capturing electrocardiograms (ECGs) during {{spontaneous}} {{events is}} the most powerful available tool to identify or exclude an arrhythmic cause of symptoms, and often can elucidate the definite diagnosis for different conditions, such as transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC), lightheadedness, or palpitations. Current <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitoring</b> technologies include 24 -hour Holter, wearable event recorder, external loop recorder (ELR), and insertable cardiac monitoring (ICM). Of them, Holter ECG is most frequently used in daily practice in Japan, while ELR and ICM are less frequently used. However, the appropriate monitor choice should be based on the expected frequency of symptoms. Frequent events may be adequately detected by Holter ECG, but less frequent symptoms are more effectively assessed by longer-term monitoring (i. e., ELR or ICM).

Therefore, we developed a wavelet-based method for detecting QRS complexes, especially adapted to the real-time requirements.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} define {{the extent to which}} the {{therapeutic}} efficacy of three single-drug regimens on ambulatory ischemia paralleled efficacy on other clinical manifestations of ischemia, specifically exercise test performance and anginal symptoms. Background. Some studies have shown that the presence and severity of ambulatory ischemia are predictive of anginal symptoms and exercise test performance, whereas other studies have not. Less is known about effects of antianginal treatment and whether response to therapy for one clinical manifestation reflects therapeutic responses for other clinical manifestations. Methods. We studied 50 patients in the Angina and Silent Ischemia Study who had documented coronary disease, an exercise test positive for ischemia, the presence of ambulatory and asymptomatic ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) Holter monitoring and stable anginal symptoms. Patients received maximally tolerated dose of sustained release propranolol (mean 293 mg/day), sustained release diltiazem (mean 350 mg/day), nifedipine (mean 79 mg/day) and placebo, each for 2 -week periods in a double-blind, crossover fashion. Patients' responses to treatment were assessed by 48 -h <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitoring,</b> exercise test (standard Bruce protocol) and diaries of angina. Levels of efficacy for each agent and for each clinical measure were compared using Spearman correlation analysis. Results. With placebo there was no correlation among the frequency of ischemic episodes by <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitoring,</b> exercise time to 1. 0 -mm ST segment depression or frequency of anginal episodes. Furthermore, for a given patient the efficacy of each active medication in reducing ambulatory ischemia was not correlated with response in anginal symptoms or exercise test performance (r = - 0. 21 to 0. 24, p = NS). Within each of these clinical measures, efficacy of one drug was more strongly correlated with efficacy of another drug (r = 0. 64 to 0. 81 for ambulatory ischemia, 0. 48 to 0. 56 for exercise test performance and 0. 16 to 0. 54 for anginal symptoms).

Nine patients dropped out due to side effects (3 during amlodipine and 6 during ISDN therapy), and one patient was excluded for technical reasons. A maximal symptom limited supine bicycle tolerance test and a 48 h <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitoring</b> were performed {{at the end of}} each 5 week period of therapy. During exercise, exercise time, time to onset of angina, and time to onset of ischaemia, i. e., 1 mm ST segment depression were measured. During ambulatory monitoring, number of anginal episodes and duration per hour of ST deviation were assessed. Amlodipine significantly prolonged time to angina (320 ± 155 vs 304 ± 126 sec; p< 0. 05) and time to ischaemia (292 ± 153 vs 232 ± 126 sec; p< 0. 001). when compared with ISDN, while exercise time was similar for both treatments. Furthermore, amlodipine reduced anginal episodes (1. 2 ± 1. 6 vs 2. 4 ± 3. 0 attacks/ 48 h; p< 0. 001), whereas, no difference was found between amlodipine and ISDN in duration of ST deviation during ambulatory monitoring. In conclusions, addressing the long-term treatment of patients with stable angina pectoris, once-daily dosing of amlodipine appears to be more effective than ISDN, as determined by its anti-anginal and anti-ischaemic effects during exercise tolerance testing and <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitoring...</b>|$|E

The primary outcome {{of the study was}} to compare the detection arrhythmia events over total wear time for both devices. Arrhythmia events were defined as detection of any 1 of 6 arrhythmias, including supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, pause greater than 3 seconds, atrioventricular block, ventricular tachycardia, or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. McNemar's tests were used to compare the matched pairs of data from the Holter and the adhesive patch monitor. ResultsOver the total wear time of both devices, the adhesive patch monitor detected 96 arrhythmia events compared with 61 arrhythmia events by the Holter monitor (P <. 001). ConclusionsOver the total wear time of both devices, the adhesive patch monitor detected more events than the Holter monitor.

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} ventricular arrhythmias related to episodes of transient myocardial ischemia during ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring, 97 patients with stable angina pectoris, angiographically proved coronary artery disease and an abnormal exercise test were studied. A total of 573 episodes with ST segment depression were documented: in 118 episodes (21 %) the patients were symptomatic and in 455 (79 %) they remained asymptomatic. Ventricular arrhythmias (> 5 premature ventricular beats/min, bigeminy, couplets or salvos of premature ventricular beats) occurred during 27 (5 %) ischemic episodes in a subset of 10 patients (10 %) (group A). The other 87 patients (90 %) (group B) showed exclusively ischemic episodes without ventricular arrhythmias. Comparison of patients in group A and group B showed no differences in hemodynamic, angiographic, exercise testing and <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitoring</b> data. Ischemic episodes with and without ventricular arrhythmias showed a similar duration and amplitude of ST segment depression and a comparable heart rate {{at the onset of}} ischemia. Both types of ischemic episodes, with and without arrhythmias, occurred predominantly during the morning hours between 6 : 00 am and noon, and both types remained asymptomatic to within similar percentages.

The ST segment {{monitoring}} substudy of the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO-I) trial {{compared the}} speed and stability of ST segment recovery among four thrombolytic strategies for acute myocardial infarction. Background. Rapid resolution of ST segment elevation has been suggested as a noninvasive marker of infarct-related artery patency. We expected that patients treated with accelerated recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) would show a quicker recovery than that of other patients but that those treated with streptokinase would show greater stability of recovery. Methods. ST segment monitoring was initiated in 1, 067 patients within 30 min of the start of thrombolysis and continued for > 18 h {{with the use of}} a three-channel continuous vectorcardiographic monitor, a 12 -lead continuous electrocardiographic (<b>ECG)</b> <b>monitor</b> or a three-channel (V 2, V 5, aVF) Holter <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitor.</b> Results. Time to 50 % recovery could be assessed in 618 patients and was similar in the four treatment groups: median 45 min with streptokinase/subcutaneous heparin, 45 min with streptokinase/intravenous heparin, 42 min with accelerated rt-PA and 47 min with combination therapy (p = 0. 7). No significant difference among the thrombolytic regimens was shown with the three monitors used. Time to initiation of ST segment analysis was directly related to time to 50 % recovery (p = 0. 0001) and was its best predictor in a multiple regression model. ST segment elevation recurred equally in each treatment group (∼ 36 %, p = 0. 9) but was significantly more common in patients with a patent infarct-related artery (p = 0. 033) or a low ejection fraction (p = 0. 001). Conclusions. The greater 90 -min patency seen with accelerated rt-PA in the angiographic substudy did not correlate with a shorter time to 50 % ST segment recovery, possibly because of technical limitations and study design. The similar rates of recurrent ischemia (as assessed by ST elevation) among the regimens support the similar infarction and reocclusion rates seen in the main trial and angiographic substudy...|$|R

Competitive {{athletes are}} widely {{regarded}} as a special group of healthy individuals with a unique lifestyle who are seemingly invulnerable and often capable of extraordinary physical achievement. Athlete’s heart is generally regarded as a benign increase in cardiac mass, with specific circulatory and cardiac morphological alterations, that represents a physiological adaptation to systematic training.

The slope for sudden cardiac death was most negative (0. 6060 ± 0. 276). The slope of 1 /f showed a significant correlation with QOL (F; 8. 87 p< 0. 01). These findings suggest that 1 /f fluctuations of HR can serve as one index of intermediate cardiovascular control, QOL and prognosis in clinical cardiology...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of ischemia on <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> (AECG) <b>monitoring</b> adversely influences {{the outcome in}} patients with coronary artery disease. In the Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP), 618 clinically stable patients with revascularizable coronary artery disease, abnormal stress tests and asymptomatic ischemia on AECG monitoring were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment strategies: angina-guided care, ischemia-guided care or revascularization. Repeat AECG monitoring was done at 12 weeks On treatment and the patients were followed for outcome analysis at 1 year. At 1 year death, MI or hospitalization occurred in 38 of 262 patients without AECG ischemia at 12 weeks (14. 5 %), and 55 of 272 (20. 2 %) 0 f those with AECG ischemia at 12 weeks (p< 0. 08). Aggregate adverse outcomes (death, MI, hospitalization or ischemia on 1 year En) occurred in 160 (61 %) of patients without AECG ischemia at 12 weeks and 225 (83 % 1 of patients with AECG ischemia at 12 weeks (p< 0. 001). These data provide {{evidence to support the}} hypothesis that AECG monitoring results during treatment may be predictive of future coronary events...|$|R
40|$|Background While {{previous}} studies using epidemiological data and <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitoring</b> have shown peak occurrence of sudden death and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the morning, none have examined circadian variation of potentially life-threatening ventricular tachycardia (VT), nor has any study observed circadian behavior of any arrhythmias in individuals followed longitudinally. We used the event memory of multiprogrammable implantable cardio-verter-defibrillators {{to evaluate the}} circadian pattern of sus-tained VT over time. Methods and Results Data were reviewed from 32 consecu-tive patients with coronary artery disease and sustained VT who had received the Ventak PRX (CPI, Inc) cardioverter-defibrillator between May 1991 and August 1993 and had experienced at least one episode of VT terminated by thei...|$|E
40|$|Although it is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that silent myo-cardial ischemia detected by <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitoring</b> (AEM) {{is the most common}} form of ischemia, the debate regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for ischemic episodes during daily life is far from being settled. 1, 2 Because most of the early investigations in this field had reported that the vast majority of transient ischemic episodes (TIEs) occurred during periods of little or no physical activity, it generally was assumed that mechanisms other than an increase in myocardial oxygen demand might be responsible in their genesis. 3 - 5 Although most patients in the earlier investiga-tions had evidence of obstructive lesions secondary to coronary atherosclerosis as well as ischemia secondary to increased oxygen demand during exercise testing, base...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Mutations in cardiac myosin binding protein-C (MYBPC 3), {{the most}} common genetic cause of hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM), {{have been reported to}} cause a comparatively benign and late-onset form of the disease with incomplete penetrance. Based upon selected families with small numbers of mutations, these early reports may be misleading however. This study aimed to redefine the clinical characteristics of HCM related to MYBPC 3 by evaluating a large cohort of unselected patients and their families, in whom an MYBPC 3 mutation had been identified. Methods: Index cases and their families underwent history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), transthoracic echocardiography, <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitoring,</b> metabolic exercise testing and mutation analysis. Long-term follow up data was collected where available. Results: 44 MYBPC 3 mutations were identified in 59 index cases. 26 of 59 (44...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective Exposure to fine {{airborne}} particles (PM 2. 5) {{has been shown}} to be responsible for cardiovascular and hematological effects, especially in older people with cardiovascular disease. Some epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with diabetes may be a particularly susceptible population. This study examined effects of short-term exposures to ambient PM 2. 5 on markers of systemic inflammation, coagulation, autonomic control of heart rate, and repolarization in 22 adults (mean age: 61 years) with type 2 diabetes. Methods Each individual was studied for four consecutive days with daily assessments of plasma levels of blood markers. Cardiac rhythm and electrocardiographic parameters were examined at rest and with 24 -hour <b>ambulatory</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>monitors.</b> PM 2. 5 and meteorological data were measured daily on the rooftop of the patient exam site. Data were analyzed with models adjusting for season, weekday, meteorology, and a random intercept. To identify susceptible subgroups, effect modification was analyzed by clinical characteristics associated with insulin resistance as well as with oxidative stress and by medication intake. Results Interleukin (IL) - 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha showed a significant increase with a lag of two days (percent change of mean level: 20. 2 % with 95 %-confidence interval [6. 4; 34. 1] and 13. 1 % [1. 9; 24. 4], respectively) in association with an increase of 10 μg/m 3 in PM 2. 5. Obese participants as well as individuals with elevated glycosylated hemoglobin, lower adiponectin, higher ferritin or with glutathione S-transferase M 1 null genotype showed higher IL- 6 effects. Changes in repolarization were found immediately as well as up to four days after exposure in individuals without treatment with a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. Conclusions Exposure to elevated levels of PM 2. 5 alters ventricular repolarization and thus may increase myocardial vulnerability to arrhythmias. Exposure to PM 2. 5 also increases systemic inflammation. Characteristics associated with insulin resistance or with oxidative stress were shown to enhance the association...|$|R

Optimization {{of therapy}} in {{patients}} with arterial hypertension (HT) 1 - 2 grade considering heart rate variability (HRV) and efficacy of metoprolol tartrate in long-acting presentation (Egilok retard) during 96 weeks of usage. Material and methods. 33 patients with mild to moderate HT were treated with Egilok retard. Doses were titrated from 50 to 200 mg. If the target level of blood pressure (BP) wasn’t reached, hydrochlorothiazide (12, 5 - 25 mg) was added. <b>Ambulatory</b> BP and <b>ECG</b> <b>monitoring</b> with HRV analysis were carried out before start and after 24, 48, 96 weeks of therapy, echocardiography - after 48 and 96 weeks.

40|$|AbstractThe anti-ischemic {{effects of}} {{atenolol}} and nifedipine were compared in a randomized double-blind crossover manner in 24 patients with stable exertional angina and transient silent ischemia during <b>ambulatory</b> electrocardiographic (<b>ECG)</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Both atenolol and nifedipine were effective (p < 0. 005) {{in reducing the}} average number and duration of transient ischemic events, but therapy with atenolol {{was associated with a}} significantly greater reduction in the mean number (p < 0. 05) and duration (p < 0. 01) of silent ischemic events. Analyses of the silent ischemic activity during the morning hours revealed that only therapy with atenolol produced a significant reduction in the average duration per patient (139 ± 54 vs. 1, 609 ± 468 s, p < 0. 01) and in the average duration of silent ischemia per event between 6 amand 12 noon (62 ± 21 vs. 208 ± 24 s, p < 0. 005). There were fewer adverse experiences during therapy with atenolol. These results show that although both atenolol and nifedipine are effective in reducing silent ischemic events, treatment with atenolol is associated with significantly greater efficacy, particularly on the morning surge of silent myocardial ischemia...|$|R
