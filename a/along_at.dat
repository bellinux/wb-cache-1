5|$|When Ste {{comes back}} from rehab, {{he goes to}} see the kids but he meets Ryan, Amy's new fiance and discovers that Leah doesn't {{want to be with}} him, which hurts him. He then meets Warren and after he says he'll tell Brendan that Ste is dead, he's {{determined}} to get better and even finds house for Amy. They move to Hollyoaks, since Ryan is a policeman there. But he and Ste don't get <b>along</b> <b>at</b> all. Leah eventually grows closer to Ste again but Amy later pleads full custody of the children when Ste suffers a brain demage from taking drugs, that causes blanks, when he doesn't control or remember what he's doing. During one of these, he almost attacks Amy, which Leah sees and refuses to see him.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{proved more}} challenging than other Atlus projects for multiple reasons. As the characters' text bubbles {{were designed to}} use Japanese kanji characters—which compress {{a lot of information}} into a single symbol in a way impossible in the English alphabet—each text bubble had to be individually resized and sometimes shifted so they would not intrude on other elements within scenes. The sheer amount of voice acting in the game meant that dubbing took far longer than other similar projects, running past its projected time and requiring Atlus staff members to voice very minor characters to save time. The main characters were a major focus due to the storytelling style of multiple interlinked narratives, with each character's personal growth needing to be reflected in their voice performance. This was particularly true of Mercedes. The auto-scrolling nature of dialogue, which moved <b>along</b> <b>at</b> a set pace rather than through the player's button prompts, meant that performances needed to be correctly timed and balanced to the varying paces at which the actors read their lines. This led to lines being modified during recording to keep within schedule. During the last stages, the team needed to rerecord some lines of dialogue, but to keep the localization in budget and on schedule it was done outside a professional recording studio, resulting in an audible drop in quality.|$|E

25|$|Next {{match was}} with Pakistani team, which gave Lankans their first World Cup defeat in home soil. Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi won the toss {{and decided to}} bat first against Sri Lanka, one of the pre-tournament favorites. Sri Lanka got the wicket of Ahmed Shehzad in the sixth over, but Pakistan still managed to proceed <b>along</b> <b>at</b> a rapid run rate in the first ten overs. Mohammed Hafeez, {{proceeded}} <b>along</b> <b>at</b> over a run a ball until a mix up with Kamran Akmal had him run out, and Kamran himself was stumped a few overs later to leave the match evenly poised at 105/3 in the 21st over. Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq then built a 104 run partnership in 20 overs without taking too many risks, until Younis fell to Rangana Herath for 72 while trying to accelerate. Misbah stayed not out till the end for a well made 83, kept Pakistan to 277/7 at the end.|$|E

25|$|A totally one-sided trans-Tasman clash saw New Zealand {{collapse}} to {{a feeble}} 58 all out after being sent in, with only captain Fleming reaching 20. Australian slow left-armer Brad Young took a hat-trick to finish with an exceptional analysis of 4–2–4–4. In reply, the Australians rattled <b>along</b> <b>at</b> nearly six an over, losing only Mark Waugh as they raced to 62/1 in 10.5 overs with Gilchrist smashing three sixes as he hit 42 from 36 balls.|$|E
25|$|During this time, the Outlaws began a {{feud with}} Kane and Mankind.

25|$|Nottinghamshire routed Surrey at the Brit Oval after Surrey self-destructed to Mark Ealham in {{the first}} innings. Surrey were looking for quick runs and got that, but didn't last fifty overs as Ealham took four of their men for 53 runs. James Benning was top-scorer with 56 runs off 43 balls, with nine fours and a six, and Surrey {{finished}} with 217 in 49.1 overs. By contrast, Darren Bicknell and Jason Gallian scored at a more sedate pace for Nottinghamshire, plodding <b>along</b> <b>at</b> 3.5 runs an over - but got the runs. An opening partnership of 178 gave Nottinghamshire the edge, and despite losing Anurag Singh for a duck, they were only trailing by thirteen runs at stumps.|$|E
25|$|Kamenev and Zinoviev had {{a falling}} out with Lenin over their {{opposition}} to Soviet seizure of power in October 1917. On 10 October 1917 (Old Style), Kamenev and Zinoviev {{were the only two}} Central Committee members to vote against an armed revolt. Their publication of an open letter opposed to the use of force enraged Lenin, who demanded their expulsion from the party. However, when the Bolshevik-led Military Revolutionary Committee, headed by Adolph Joffe, and the Petrograd Soviet, led by Trotsky, staged an uprising, Kamenev and Zinoviev went <b>along.</b> <b>At</b> the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, Kamenev was elected Congress Chairman and Chairman of the permanent All-Russian Central Executive Committee. The latter position was equivalent to the head of state under the Soviet system.|$|E
25|$|England {{felt they}} {{probably}} {{still had a}} chance of victory if they could pick up quick wickets, {{and set up a}} low final day run chase, but would otherwise be looking for the draw. Things began brightly for England when Geoff Marsh was caught behind for only 6 off Neil Foster's bowling. But from then on David Boon and Mark Taylor looked determined to put the game out of England's reach, until Taylor was out for a well made 60 leaving Australia at 97 for 2. Captain Allan Border came in and looked determined to lead from the front, scoring at a fast rate, and when Boon was out for 43, Dean Jones emerged from the dressing room looking even more determined. The pair moved <b>along</b> <b>at</b> a rapid rate, taking Australia to 158 for 3 at stumps.|$|E

25|$|Following her graduation, Ellis became first {{understudy}} to Marti Webb in a UK concert tour of The Magic of the Musicals in 1998, {{required on}} several occasions in Webb's absence, yet took a hiatus in 1999 to board cruise ship MS Voyager of the Seas, employed as lead vocalist in the ship's entertainment staff. After nine months traveling across the Caribbean, she left the ship in Los Angeles, spent three months travelling across the US until her visa ran out, {{and then returned to}} understudy in the UK concert tour. By November 1999, she had made her first television appearance on Children in Need for their special Pudsey the Musical and was featured in a jingle for Capital FM. Following this, she appeared as the title role in a Gary Griffin-directed workshop production titled Helen of Troy and played the role of Mary in Merrily We Roll <b>Along</b> <b>at</b> the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to small pedestrian postern gates {{like the one}} by Tower Hill, it had four main gates: Bishopsgate and Aldgate in the northeast at the roads to Eboracum (York) and to Camulodunum (Colchester) and Newgate and Ludgate in the west <b>along</b> <b>at</b> the road that divided for travel to Viroconium (Wroxeter) and to Calleva (Silchester) and at another road that ran along the Thames to the city's main cemetery and the old ford at Westminster. The wall partially utilized the army's existing fort, strengthening its outer wall with a second course of stone to match {{the rest of the}} course. The fort had two gates of its own—Cripplegate to the north and another to the west—but these were not along major roads. Aldersgate was eventually added, perhaps to replace the west gate of the fort. (The names of all these gates are medieval, as they continued to be occasionally refurbished and replaced until their demolition in the 17th and 18th centuries to permit widening the roads.) The wall initially left the riverbank undefended: this was corrected in the 3rd century.|$|E
25|$|Coleman {{was born}} on January 26, 1892, in Atlanta, Texas, the tenth of {{thirteen}} children to sharecroppers George Coleman, who was mostly Cherokee and part African-American, and Susan, who was African-American. When Coleman was two years old, her family moved to Waxahachie, Texas, where she lived until age 23. Coleman began attending school in Waxahachie {{at the age of}} six. She had to walk four miles each day to her segregated, one-room school, where she loved to read and established herself as an outstanding math student. She completed all eight grades in that school. Every year, Coleman's routine of school, chores, and church was interrupted by the cotton harvest. In 1901, George Coleman left his family. He returned to Oklahoma, or Indian Territory, as it was then called, to find better opportunities; but Susan and her family did not go <b>along.</b> <b>At</b> the age of 12, Bessie was accepted into the Missionary Baptist Church School on scholarship. When she turned eighteen, she took her savings and enrolled in the Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University (now called Langston University) in Langston, Oklahoma. She completed one term before her money ran out and she returned home.|$|E

25|$|Ricky Ponting, {{the next}} man in, {{had a great}} start to his innings, {{creaming}} a boundary off only the second ball he faced. When Ponting had added just six to his tally, Virender Sehwag dropped a chance at third slip off Pathan, and when he reached 12, a close lbw decision against him off Ajit Agarkar's bowling was turned down. Overcoming these hiccups, Ponting strove on further with his innings, reaching his fifty off 64 balls, with a four off Ashish Nehra's bowling, in the 23rd over of Australia's innings. One over later, Langer joined the party, too, amassing 20 runs off Anil Kumble's sixth over with two boundaries and two sixes apiece. However, Kumble {{was to have the}} last laugh, as he trapped Langer, who nevertheless, made a dominating and attacking 58 from a mere 72 deliveries in the fifth ball of the 26th over, when Australia were cruising <b>along</b> <b>at</b> a run-rate of above five per over. The dismissal occurred shortly before lunch, providing the Indians with a vital breakthrough, but the relief was a short one, as Langer was replaced by Martyn, who proved to be a thorn in the Indian team's flesh. Martyn seemed to be in a graceful touch from his first ball, stroking some good shots to the fence against the pace duo of Agarkar and Pathan, the latter being unable to replicate his good start with the new ball. Just when he seemed set for a big score, Martyn threw away his wicket when he chased a wide ball from Nehra to VVS Laxman. Steve Waugh the next batsman also played a few through the off-side for his 30 before he was bowled by a clever piece of bowling from Nehra. Simon Katich came in at the fall of the fourth wicket at 252, and then he proceeded to add 138 runs for the fifth wicket with Ponting. Katich started slowly, but gained momentum and proceeded to pepper shots all over the wicket once he settled down, the most memorable shot being a six of Nehra. The partnership ended in the 88th over of the Australian over of the day, when he top-edged a pull from Agarkar, only to be caught by a spectacular catch by Sehwag, who came in diving full-length and held on to the cherry with both hands.|$|E
25|$|The first {{match of}} the show {{featured}} the lucha libre unique Mini-Estrellas division, a division {{that is not the}} same as midget professional wrestling, in the fact that it is not restricted to people with dwarfism but also wrestlers who are generally short in stature. IWRG does not have a regular Mini-Estrella division, which meant that this special attraction match featured workers from AAA and the Mexican Independent circuit, some who may work in the regular division elsewhere. The match was originally announced as Mini Espiritu teaming with Mini Psicosis and Piratita Morgan, Jr., but he was replaced by Mini Ozz on the night with no explanation given for the substitution. Mini Psicosis was the reigning AAA World Mini-Estrella Champion, Mini Ozz is a smaller version of Dark Ozz from AAA and Piratita Morgan, Jr. is the latest wrestler to use the name and ring character of a smaller version of Pirata Morgan, or perhaps in this case Morgan's sons Hijo de Pirata Morgan/Pirata Morgan, Jr. The trio took on and defeated the tecnico trio of Mini Batista, Mini Rey Cometa, Mini Super Astro. Mini Batista works as a comedy mini version of former World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler Batista, Mini Rey Cometa as a smaller version of Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) worker Rey Cometa and Mini Super Astro as mini of Super Astro, who himself is close to the Mini-Estrella height limit. The second match of the evening featured six IWRG regulars as the team of Alan Extreme, Carta Brava, Jr. and Eita defeated Avisman, Cerebro Negro and Dinamic Black. The third match of the night and the first match with a background to it saw the clash of Los Oficiales, represented by Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro and the splinter faction Los Comandos Élite, represented by Rayan and Spartan. On the night Comandos Élite defeated Los Oficiales, adding another chapter to the feud between the two factions. In the fourth match Los Traumas showed that they had not forgotten El Ángel's actions the last time they teamed up together and the trio did not get <b>along</b> <b>at</b> all. While neither side actually turned on each other or came to blows there was a lot of problems for the team. The problems lead to Bestia 666, Canis Lupus and Damián 666 taking advantage of it to win the match. Following the match Los Traumas challenged their tag team partner to put his mask on the line.|$|E
25|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} Block B competing, Rush stated {{that he was willing}} to put his {{differences}} with El Terrible aside as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. The second block matches started with a battle royal to determine the order of matches. The match included Ángel de Oro, Marco Corleone, Delta, El Felino, El Hijo del Fantasma, Pólvora, Rey Escorpión and Rush with El Felino and Ángel de Oro being the last two men in the ring. In the first round the team of Stuka, Jr. and Pólvora did not get along, playing off the two of them being disqualified from the 2012 Reyes del Aire ("Kings of the Air") tournament on the February 3, 2012 Super Viernes show. The dissension made it easy for Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión to win the first match of the tournament. In other first round matches Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero defeating El Hijo del Fantasma and Misterioso, Jr. Rush and El Terrible proved that they could indeed put their differences aside for at least one night as they worked well together to defeat Delta and Ephesto. While the final first round match featured the only all-rudo team in the tournament it did not mean that El Felino and Rey Bucanero got <b>along</b> <b>at</b> all, during the match Rey Bucanero left his former La Peste Negra partner alone in the ring as he walked out of the arena. The odds were too hard to overcome for Felino and he fell to Ángel de Oro and Psicosis. The first match in the second round saw two members of Los Guerreros del Infierno on opposite sides as Guerreros leader Último Guerrero teamed up with Marco Corleone and Guerrero team member Rey Escorpión teamed with Black Warrior. Initially the two Guerreros members avoided each other, but when they were finally in the ring with each other the fought like they had no allegiance with each other. The closing moments of the match saw Marco Corleone pin not just Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión but also his own teammate Último Guerrero when he got in the way of Corleone's move off the top rope. Guerrero expressed his displeasure at being pinned by his own team mate after the match. If the first second round match saw allegiances put aside for the tournament, the second match saw rivalry put aside for the tournament as Rush and El Terrible once again worked better together than expected as they defeated Ángel de Oro and Psicosis to become the second team in the semifinal match. In the third and final round of the evening Rush's promise to put differences aside and win the tournament turned out to be true as the two defeated Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero to earn the second spot in the tournament finals.|$|E
