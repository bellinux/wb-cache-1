40|$|Deprecated ancient HTML math methods: [...] latexmathml, [...] gladtex, [...] mimetex, [...] jsmath. Fixed URIs in data/jats. csl. They {{were being}} {{rendered}} twice, leading to invalid XML in default JATS output with pandoc-citeproc. lua-filters. md: use real-world man page filter as example. Add lua filter functions walk_inline and walk_block in the pandoc module, to apply filters inside particular inline and block elements. Refactored some code from Text. Pandoc. Lua. PandocModule into new internal module Text. Pandoc. Lua. Filter. Markdown reader: Allow fenced code blocks to be indented 1 - 3 spaces (# 4011). This brings our handling {{of them into}} alignment with CommonMark's. Fix YAML metadata with "chomp" (|-). Previously if a YAML block under |- contained a blank line, pandoc would not parse it as metadata. Removed etc. from <b>abbreviations</b> <b>file.</b> Often etc. ends a sentence, and we want the period {{to be treated as}} a sentence-ending period. Fix regression with [...] metadata (# 4054). Values specified with [...] metadata should replace a metadata value set in the document itself, rather than creating a list including a new value. EPUB writer: Fix EPUB OCF structure. # 3720 had been improperly implemented. Fix modified paths for raw HTML tags (src, poster, etc.) (# 4050, # 4055). This had not been updated for the new EPUB container layout, with a separate text/ subdirectory. Fix image paths with empty [...] epub-subdirectory. Miscellaneous code cleanup (Alexander Krotov). Use pandoc-types 1. 17. 3, which adds Walkable instances for [Block] Block and [Inline] Inline. Remove obsolete stack. full. yaml (# 4052). Change to using pandoc-citeproc 0. 12. 1 in binary packages. Consolidate math output method documentation (# 4049, Mauro Bieg). MANUAL. txt: fix header level of "Extension: emoji" (Albert Krewinkel). Use lua filter to generate man page from MANUAL. txt, replacing old Haskell filters. This is easier and faster. Improved INSTALL. md. Update commands to extract deb archive on Linux (# 4043, Salim B) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} the next-to-next-to-leading order O(α_s^ 4) one-loop squared corrections {{to the production}} of heavy quark pairs in quark-antiquark annihilations. These are part of the next-to-next-to-leading order O(α_s^ 4) radiative QCD corrections to this process. Our results, with the full mass dependence retained, are presented in a closed and very compact form, in the dimensional regularization scheme. We have found very intriguing factorization properties for the finite part of the amplitudes.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} design issues {{of a global}} file system, aiming to provide {{transparent}} data availability, security against loss and disclosure, and support for mobile and disconnected clients. First, the paper surveys general challenges and requirements for large-scale file systems, and then the design of particular elementary parts of the proposed file system is presented. This includes {{the design of the}} raw system architecture, the design of dynamic file replication with appropriate data consistency, file location and data security. Our proposed system is called Gaston, and will be referred further in the text under this name or its <b>abbreviation</b> GFS (Gaston <b>File</b> System) ...|$|R
