5|$|During the {{following}} six hours, Urmil underwent explosive deepening {{as the main}} feeder band wrapped around the center of circulation. After the brief period of intensification, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 110km/h (70mph) according to both the RSMC Nadi and the JTWC, making it a high-end Category 2 cyclone on the Australian Scale. The highly favorable environment, {{in combination with the}} fast forward motion of the storm, allowed Urmil to rapidly reach its peak intensity, despite wind shear reaching 35km/h (25mph). However, <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> storm strengthened, it began to weaken as convection weakened. With both wind shear and forward motion increasing, the cyclone quickly became disorganized. Around 0000UTC on January15, the center of circulation was devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. About six hours later, Urmil transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was subsequently absorbed into the mid-latitude westerlies.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{opens with}} the {{civilian}} Dr. Catherine Halsey and Lieutenant Jacob Keyes traveling to meet John, a six-year-old boy. Dr. Halsey reveals to Keyes that John {{is one of}} 150 children who possess rare genetic markers making them suitable for conscription into the SPARTAN-II program, a secret experiment {{with the aim of}} creating super soldiers for the UNSC to quell rebellions. Seventy-five of the children are kidnapped by operatives of the Office of Naval Intelligence and replaced by clones engineered to die of natural causes shortly thereafter. From this point on, the recruits are known only by their first name and a three digit number. John-117 {{and the rest of the}} children are drilled and trained by Franklin Mendez; John demonstrates leadership of his fellow Spartans leading to his promotion to squad leader. In 2525, the Spartans undergo a series of surgical enhancements which turn them into highly efficient super soldiers at the cost of crippling or killing more than half of the original seventy-five. The Spartans are also equipped with powerful MJOLNIR battle armor, designed to respond <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> soldier's thoughts. John-117 is given the rank of Master Chief Petty Officer. The Spartans are highly successful, but they experience a priority shift after a collective of alien races known as the Covenant begin obliterating human colonies, declaring humanity's destruction as the will of the gods. Mendez leaves the group to train the next generation of Spartans as John and his comrades first face the Covenant.|$|E

25|$|The Acuera, {{who lived}} along Ocklawaha River, seem have become {{independent}} by {{the start of}} the 16th century, and founded at least one chiefdom. The French sources attest that they were part of Utina's confederacy in the 1560s, though Worth notes that the level of control Utina exercised over them is arguable. Francisco Pareja noted that the Acuera spoke their own dialect of the Timucua language (Acuera), distinct from the Agua Dulce dialect. The Acuera did not experience demographic decline nearly <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Agua Dulce or Tocoy chiefdoms, perhaps partially because of their remote location in the Florida interior and their less frequent contact with the Europeans. As such, Acuera represents one of the simpler, localized chiefdoms that proved sustainable well after more integrated societies such as Utina's confederacy had fallen.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to the {{considerable}} {{economies of scale}} Paxton was able to exploit, the manufacture and assembly of the building parts was exceedingly quick and cheap. Each module was identical, fully prefabricated, self-supporting, and fast and easy to erect. All of the parts could be mass-produced in large numbers, and many parts served multiple functions, further reducing both the number of parts needed and their overall cost. Because of its comparatively low weight, the Crystal Palace required absolutely no heavy masonry for supporting walls or foundations, and the relatively light concrete footings on which it stood could {{be left in the}} ground once the building was removed (they remain in place today just {{beneath the surface of the}} site). The modules could be erected <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> parts could reach the site - indeed, some sections were standing within eighteen hours of leaving the factory - and since each unit was self-supporting, workers were able to assemble much of the building section-by-section, without having to wait for other parts to be finished.|$|E

500|$|The Irish Brigade, though {{advancing}} in {{good order}} under heavy fire and delivering effective fire in return, {{did not reach}} the Sunken Road. [...] The brigade retired, the regimental historian observed, [...] "as steadily as on drill." [...] The 29th has been criticized by some historians, including Marion Armstrong, for not advancing <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> rest of the Irish Brigade. [...] An accident in the terrain, a small rise {{in front of the}} 29th's position, afforded them cover, and their casualties were lighter than those of the other regiments of the brigade. [...] Armstrong argues that Barnes was reluctant to leave this advantageous ground, a factor which {{may have contributed to the}} failure of the Irish Brigade's charge. [...] The casualties of the 29th were nine killed, 31 wounded and four missing.|$|E
500|$|In November 1774, Acton {{formed a}} company of Minutemen, and Davis was elected captain. [...] He was {{determined}} that his company be as well-equipped as the British soldiers. Most provincial Minuteman companies, unlike professional soldiers, were not equipped with bayonets for use in close combat and they typically re-loaded using powder horns, a slow method more suited to hunting than to battle. Davis employed his skills as a gunsmith to outfit nearly every man in his company with a bayonet and saw that his men were supplied with cartridge boxes, allowing his company to re-load <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> British. [...] Finally, Davis emphasized marksmanship, training his company on an improvised shooting range behind his house. [...] These high standards in terms of equipment and training made the Acton company {{one of the best}} prepared in Massachusetts.|$|E

500|$|Amarte Es un Placer is a pop album {{composed}} of twelve love songs, consisting mainly of orchestrated romantic ballads and several uptempo numbers. Unlike his previous pop record Nada Es Igual... (1996), which featured dance music and hip-hop influences, Amarte Es un Placers {{emphasis is on}} adult contemporary music. The opening track, [...] "Tu Mirada" [...] is a rock ballad with a guitar solo. Manzanero composed three ballads for the album: [...] "Soy Yo", [...] "Dormir Contigo", and [...] "Ese Momento". [...] "Ese Momento" [...] deals with a [...] "narrative account of the instance when two bodies merge in fiery passion".

500|$|The February Revolution of 1917 did not demoralize the Black Sea Fleet <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Baltic Fleet. Captain Fyodor Stark, {{a former}} {{destroyer}} commander, maintained Rostislav in combat-ready condition {{until the end}} of the year. The battleship sailed out for her last voyage to Batumi in September and October. Stark managed to contain the radical politics, anti-German sentiment and Ukrainization of the crew, but nevertheless raised the flag of Ukraine on his return to Sevastopol on October 25. From this moment desertion and [...] "volunteering" [...] into the Red Guards intensified, and by December 21 the crew was reduced to 460 enlisted men and 28 officers. In January 1918 the fleet disintegrated completely: the officers fled from the enraged enlisted men, then the enlisted men abandoned the ships and fled from the advancing German Army. On April 29, 1918, the Bolsheviks managed to extricate two battleships and sixteen destroyers from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk, but Rostislav and the rest of the fleet remained in Sevastopol.|$|E

2500|$|The city {{earned the}} {{nickname}} [...] "The Golden City" [...] in the 1850s. The gold rush population peaked at almost 60,000, mostly male diggers, by 1858. However the early population was largely itinerant. <b>As</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> alluvial deposits drew prospectors to Ballarat, {{the rate of}} gold extraction fluctuated and, as they were rapidly worked dry, many quickly moved to rush other fields as new findings were announced, particularly Mount Alexander in 1852, Fiery Creek in 1855, and Ararat in 1857. By 1859, {{a smaller number of}} permanent settlers numbering around 23,000, many of whom had built personal wealth in gold, established a prosperous economy based around a shift to deep underground gold mining.|$|E
2500|$|Ion {{channels}} are {{located within the}} membrane of most cells and of many intracellular organelles. They are often described as narrow, water-filled tunnels that allow only ions of a certain size and/or charge to pass through. This characteristic is called selective permeability. The archetypal channel pore is {{just one or two}} atoms wide at its narrowest point and is selective for specific species of ion, such as sodium or potassium. However, some channels may be permeable to the passage of more than one type of ion, typically sharing a common charge: positive (cations) or negative (anions). Ions often move through the segments of the channel pore in single file nearly <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ions move through free solution. In many ion channels, passage through the pore is governed by a [...] "gate", which may be opened or closed in response to chemical or electrical signals, temperature, or mechanical force.|$|E
