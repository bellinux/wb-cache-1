5|$|There {{have been}} several {{theories}} proposed for why the phylloxera was ignored as the possible cause of the disease {{that resulted in the}} failure of so many vineyards, most of which involve the feeding behaviour of the insect, and the way it attacks the roots. The proboscis of the grape phylloxera has both a venom canal from which it injects its deadly venom and <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> through which it takes in vine sap and nutrients. As the toxin from the venom corrodes the root structure of a vine, the sap pressure falls and, as a result, the Phylloxera quickly withdraws its feeding tube and searches for another source of food. Thus, anyone digging up a diseased and dying vine will not find Phylloxera clinging to the roots of the plant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> {{placement}} can {{be achieved}} by fluoroscopic or endoscopic techniques. Significant complications due to nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> placement, such as hydrothorax, duodenal perforation and retroperitoneal emphysema, are very rare. We present a case of massive retroperitoneal emphysema and abscess because of duodenal perforation caused by a kink in <b>a</b> nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube.</b> Case presentation <b>A</b> 34 -year-old Chinese woman was admitted to our intensive care unit due to hypertriglyceridemia and severe acute pancreatitis. As she suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation, <b>a</b> nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> was placed by transnasal endoscopic technique. The procedure took place at her bedside. Half a month later, she had a high fever and abdominal distension. An abdominal radiography was performed and showed that the nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> was kinking on the third portion of the duodenum and the tip of the nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> was inserted into the right retroperitoneum on the second portion of the duodenum. Conclusion When <b>a</b> nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> is placed through the transnasal endoscopic technique, an abdominal radiography should be used to confirm the tube's position and indicate if it is kinking or beyond the ligament of Treitz. </p...|$|R

25|$|Premature babies {{can have}} {{difficulties}} coordinating their sucking reflex with breathing. They may also tire during feeds. Premature infants {{unable to take}} enough calories by mouth may need enteral or gavage feeding - inserting <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> into the stomach to provide enough breast milk or a substitute. This is often done together with Kangaroo care (prolonged skin-to-skin contact with the mother) which makes later breastfeeding easier. For some suckling difficulties, such as may happen with cleft lip/palate, the baby can be fed with a Haberman Feeder.|$|E
25|$|Difficulty in chewing and {{swallowing}} makes eating {{very difficult}} and {{increases the risk of}} choking or of aspirating food into the lungs. In later stages of the disorder, aspiration pneumonia can develop, and maintaining a healthy weight can become a significant problem that may require the insertion of <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube.</b> As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the rib cage that support breathing weaken, measures of lung function such as vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish. In respiratory-onset ALS, this may occur before significant limb weakness is apparent. Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure or pneumonia.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Background: Enteral feeding is {{preferred}} over parenteral methods, and feeding into the duodenum is pre-ferred over gastric feeding in certain groups of critically ill patients. However, with current techniques, <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> often coil in the stomach, exposing patients {{to the risk}} of aspiration.

Methods: This is a case series of 288 critically ill patients who needed placement of <b>an</b> enteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tube,</b> carried out in the intensive care units and wards of a university-affiliated community hospi-tal.

25|$|Clinical {{decisions}} {{also take}} into account morbidities, particularly if cancer outcomes are comparable for instance surgery {{is associated with a}} risk of bleeding between 5–10%, and a 0.3% risk of fatal postoperative haemorrhage. Surgery may also be complicated by dysphagia, and while most patients can tolerate a diet on the first postoperative day, long term use of <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> has been reported as high as 10%. Patients with larger tumours, involvement of base of tongue and requiring postoperative adjuvant therapy are more likely to require a long term feeding tube. Overall, function and quality of life appear relatively similar between surgery with postoperative radiation, and primary chemoradiation, but HPV+OPC patients tend to have better quality of life at diagnosis than HPV-OPC but may sustain greater loss following treatment.|$|E
25|$|A {{panel of}} The Heart Rhythm Society, a {{specialist}} {{organization based in}} Washington, DC {{found that it was}} legal and ethical to honor requests by patients, or by those with legal authority to make decisions for patients, to deactivate implanted cardiac devices. Lawyers say that the legal situation is similar to removing <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube,</b> though there is currently no legal precedent involving pacemakers in the United States of America. A patient in the United States is thought to have a right to refuse or discontinue treatment, including a pacemaker that keeps him or her alive. Physicians have a right to refuse to turn it off, but are advised by the HRS panel that they should refer the patient to a physician who will. Some patients believe that hopeless, debilitating conditions, like those brought on by severe strokes or late-stage dementia, can cause so much suffering that they would prefer not to prolong their lives with supportive measures, such as cardiac devices.|$|E

2500|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a shift in the {{management}} paradigm from TPN (total parenteral nutrition) to early, post-pyloric enteral feeding (in which <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> is endoscopically or radiographically introduced to the third portion of the duodenum). The advantage of enteral feeding is that it is more physiological, prevents gut mucosal atrophy, and is free from the side effects of TPN (such as fungemia).

40|$|Abstract Introduction Percutaneous {{endoscopic}} gastrostomy {{and feeding}} jejunostomy {{are used for}} providing long-term nutritional support to patients with neurological disorders. Various mechanical complications of these procedures are described. Case presentation We report {{a case of a}} 17 -year-old boy with cerebral injury who had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy <b>tube</b> changed to <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> jejunostomy <b>tube.</b> Twenty-four hours later he developed abdominal pain and became clinically septic. A contrast study through the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> and <b>a</b> subsequent computed tomography scan did not reveal any intra-abdominal pathology. At laparotomy it was discovered that the tip of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> had perforated through the jejunal wall and was lying outside the lumen. This was successfully treated by re-inserting <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> jejunostomy <b>tube</b> distally and closure of the perforation and previous FJ site Conclusion We suggest that the threshold for contrast studies and operative intervention should be low in neurologically impaired patients to avoid the delay in treatment of tube-related complications. </p...|$|R
