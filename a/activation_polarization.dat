However an important correlation exists between composition, microstructure, and thickness of an electrode and its performance. This correlation has been investigated in this work using a theoretical model. The model, in order to consider all the losses occurring in an electrode, includes Ohm's law for ionic and electronic charge transport; and the Butler-Volmer equation to evaluate the <b>activation</b> <b>polarizations,</b> and mass transport equations, taking into account diffusion through porous media, to evaluate the concentration losses. The model shows that the best electrode performance is a trade-off between activation and concentration losses. This is because a decrease in the dimensions of the particles or an increase in its thickness result, on the one hand, in a reduction of the <b>activation</b> <b>polarizations,</b> because of a larger active area for the electrochemical reaction, and, on the other hand, in an increase in the concentration losses due to a more difficult gas diffusion.

30|$|It {{needs to}} {{be noted that the}} {{optimization}} of flow channel dimensions has not drawn sufficient attention, which is in fact a very important issue. Therefore, this paper focuses on developing a numerical model to not only study the effect of operating conditions of temperatures, pressures, and stoichiometry coefficients, but also the effect of flow channel dimensions (width of ribs and channels) on the cell performance. Consequently, both fuel cell design and operating parameters can be optimized for high power output. The mathematical model of high-temperature PEM fuel cells is for operating temperatures above 120  °C, which allows the authors to analyze the performance of fuel cells using flow channels in different dimensions (width of channels versus ribs) and thus optimize the gas channels. This is especially important because once all of the major designs have been decided, optimizing the flow channel dimensions will not change the overall layout, but will improve the performance of the fuel cell significantly. The general procedures of the present modeling of high-temperature PEM fuel cells stem from Ref. [1] for low-temperature fuel cells; however, details of mass transfer analysis, the <b>activation</b> <b>polarizations,</b> the membrane and its proton conductivities are different from that for low-temperature fuel cells. The effects of operating conditions on the high-temperature PEM fuel cell performance were also studied in this paper. The electrode <b>activation</b> <b>polarizations</b> and PBI membrane conductivities as functions of operating temperatures are also examined through comparison of modeling results and experimental data from literature.|$|R

Although these are important features, macrophages are functionally very complex and involved in virtually all aspects of life, from immunity and host defense, to homeostasis, tissue repair and development. To accommodate for this, macrophages adopt a plethora of polarization states. Understanding their transcriptional regulation and phenotypic heterogeneity is vital because macrophages are critical in many diseases and have emerged as attractive targets for therapy. Here, we review how epigenetic mechanisms control macrophage polarization.

40|$|Background: Dendritic cells (DCs) {{determine}} the <b>activation</b> and <b>polarization</b> of T cells via expression of costimulatory molecules and secretion of cytokines. The function of DCs derived from monocytes ex vivo strongly {{depends on the}} composition of the maturation cocktail used. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed the effect of costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine secretion by DCs on T and natural killer (NK) cell activation by conducting a head-to-head comparison of a Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist-based cocktail with the standard combination of proinflammatory cytokines or IL- 10 alone. We could show that TLR-induced DCs are characterized by a predominance of costimulatory over coinhibitory molecules and by high secretion of IL- 12 p 70, but not IL- 10. Functionally, these signals translated into an increase in IFN-c secreting Th 1 cells and a decrease in regulatory T cells. T cell <b>activation</b> and <b>polarization</b> were dependent on IL- 12 p 70 and CD 86, but remarkably not on CD 80 signaling. By means of IL- 12 p 70 secretion, only TLR-induced DCs activated NK cells.

In the present study, we reported a direct stimulatory effect of MBP on RAW 264. 7 cells, a murine macrophage cell line. When stimulated with MBP, the production of nitric oxide (NO), IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and IL- 12 p 70, and the expressions of CD 80, MHC class II and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were all increased in RAW 264. 7 cells, indicating the <b>activation</b> and <b>polarization</b> of RAW 264. 7 cells into M 1 macrophages induced by MBP.

The analytical model was used to study the behavior of irreversible losses and the effects of operation parameters to the fuel cell polarization curves in high temperature PEM fuel cells. The effects of operating pressure, stoichiometric parameters of hydrogen and oxygen to the fuel cell performance are similar to what is known for low temperature PEM fuel cells. The extra supply of oxygen (at stoichiometric factor larger than 1.0) to the fuel cell is more significant for improving fuel cell performance than an extra supply of hydrogen. A higher operating temperature for a high-temperature PEM fuel cell results in better performance if the temperature is within the safety limit of the membrane.|$|R
30|$|One of the {{important}} approaches to having high power density in a fuel cell {{is to reduce the}} internal losses. The internal losses can always be attributed to the three types of polarizations [1]: <b>activation</b> <b>polarization,</b> concentration polarization, and ohmic polarization. As these polarizations increase, the overpotential can become too large for the fuel cell to produce a high power density with reasonably high energy efficiency [2, 3, 4]. The minimization of polarization will largely depend on the mechanism that causes each specific type of polarization. The <b>activation</b> <b>polarization</b> is caused by the slowness of the electrochemical reactions taking place {{on the surface of the}} electrodes. Consequently, a proportion of the available ideal voltage is sacrificed in the electrochemical reaction. The concentration polarization is due to mass transfer resistance from bulk flow to the surface of the electrodes when fuel and oxygen are consumed and water is generated. The ohmic polarization is the straightforward resistance to the flow of electrons through the material of the electrodes and the various interconnections as well as the resistance to the flow of protons through the electrolyte.|$|E
