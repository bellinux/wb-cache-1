40|$|Alongside {{developments}} in language research, {{the potential of}} corpora as a resource in language learning and teaching has been evident to researchers and teachers since the late 1960 s. Despite publications which emphasise the benefits of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> for language learners (Bernardini, 2002; Kennedy & Miceli, 2001), {{there is little evidence}} to suggest that direct <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> is coming {{to be seen as a}} complement or alternative to consultation of a dictionary, course book, or grammar by the majority of learners.

40|$|Aside {{from their}} {{intrinsic}} {{value for the}} purposes of language description, corpora can be used in language courses under the broad umbrella term of "data-driven learning", or DDL (Johns 1990). They {{can be used as a}} teaching aid or learning tool, but also as a reference resource, particularly for writing and revision / error-correction, with an increasing body of empirical evidence (cf. Boulton in press) largely concerning students needing English for academic purposes. Corpora can also be used as a reference resource in translation, and here the DDL-related research focuses largely on translation trainees (e. g. Beeby et al. 2009). However, as Zanettin (2009) points out, translation is also a staple activity in many undergraduate language programmes where learners may also benefit <b>from</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> and not just to help with the immediate translation assignment. The techniques involved build on many cognitive and metacognitive skills (O'Sullivan 2007), and once mastered, can be applied to other language courses and a variety of future language needs. The main research question in this paper is thus: Can general language corpora be used by non-translation students for translation purposes? The students in this study are enrolled in a translation course in the third year of a degree in English at the distance education centre of a French university. They have no prior experience of corpus use and are expected only to work only with freely available on-line monolingual corpora of contemporary English. The simple interface provided by Mark Davies ([URL] to large corpora of British and American English (100 million and 400 + million words respectively) is widely used for such purposes, with over two thirds of all users declaring their primary interest as language learning, teaching or translation. The sites are suitable for novice users to navigate and are accompanied by tutorials and help features; this is highly desirable in the distance teaching context where face-to-face input is not an option, and means that the course itself can keep the introduction to the basic concepts and techniques to a minimum. After that, the constraints of the distance context play to the strengths of constructivism as the students explore the corpora on their own; though email contact with the teacher is possible, and there are discussion forums to facilitate peer-to-peer collaboration, these are generally under-used. Following an earlier pilot study, the results presented here are based on on-line examinations where the methodology component requires the students to choose sections of a previously unseen text and demonstrate and explain how they use corpora to solve the problems encountered in context. Comparing data from two sessions shows how the students come to grips with corpora for translation, and allows a qualitative analysis of individual performance on the various techniques used with greater or lesser success. These data are backed up by questionnaires submitted after the examinations to gain feedback from both successful and less successful students. Particular attention is accorded to corpus use beyond the usual concordance lines, including frequencies, register distributions, collocates lists, word comparisons, and so on, which allow the learner to ask not just 'can I say this?', but 'is this appropriate in this translation context?'...|$|R

40|$|Since its {{inception}} {{the issue of}} absence has preoccupied both the practitioners of corpus linguistics and its detractors. To the latter it is self-evident, a truism, that a corpus can yield no information about phenomena it does not contain, a criticism which we hope to demonstrate {{is based on a}} failure to grasp the complexity of the notion of absences and an ignorance of the flexibility of corpus techniques. However the former, the exponents of CL, have also worried greatly about the significance of not finding something, say, a particular set of lexical items or a certain syntactic structure in their corpus. Is this (non) discovery telling me something about the discourse type(s) under study or about what is usually termed the ‘representativity’ of the corpus (i. e. how typical of the discourse type is the subset of it contained in the corpus) ? And the CL literature is replete with warnings ‘not confuse corpus data with language itself’ (McEnery & Hardie 2012 : 26), to which we would add that observations <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>corpus</b> data can only be generalised with the utmost care. Following Kant, we must not confuse the tangible, the phenomenal (corpus) with the intangible noumenal (language). In this chapter we will discuss, {{on the basis of a}} number of case studies, what can reasonably be inferred about discourses <b>from</b> <b>corpus</b> analysis, particularly with regards to absences. Along with Scott, we maintain ‘much can be inferred from what is absent’ (2004), and following Taylor (2012) we will argue that corpus tools provide an ‘armory’ for locating and verifying absence. In particular, the comparison and contrast among different corpora can firstly reveal absences, both those being searched for and others accidentally stumbled upon, and then allow the analyst to track the appearance and disappearance of linguistic elements or discoursal notions once they have come in some way to the analyst’s attention. Finally, since most things are absent from most places most of the time we need to decide the parameters of relevant or salient or meaningful absence/s, those which are worth either looking for if somehow suspected or instead, if stumbled upon, are worthy of further investigation. One indication could be unexpectedness or non-obviousness, that is, discovering absence when a presence is expected. This however raises the question of expected by whom and why, especially since researchers have their own unique past primings (Hoey 2005) which influence expectations in the present. And then, when an absence is discovered, how does one decide whether the absence is intentional or otherwise, especially given, as already stated, that absence is the norm? Far too often, particularly in the field of critical discourse analysis, it is taken for granted that a silence or absent message or voice must have been deliberately suppressed with little evidence of intentionality. Finally, once an absence is adjudged relevant and worthy of investigation, do we attempt to explain it? If so, what kinds of explanations are valid and interesting? Which are trivial and which non-trivial, that is, are themselves non-obvious and unexpected...|$|R

Nonetheless, the multiple affordances of a corpus approach provide reason to think the investment might have larger pay-offs than often realised: familiarity with corpora can be applied across sub-disciplines in many if not all courses in a typical university degree in language. Further, learners can start using corpora productively even with minimal training in distance education, quickly going beyond simple concordancing. The students in this study are enrolled in a translation course in the third year of a degree in English at a French distance education centre. While corpora are widely used in translation teaching, this often involves the compilation of specific parallel corpora by the students. In this course, students have no prior experience of corpus use and are expected only to work only with freely available on-line monolingual corpora of contemporary English, thus enabling them to work immediately. The simple interface provided by Mark Davies ([URL] to large corpora of British (100 million words) and American (400 million words) English is widely used for such purposes, with over two thirds of all users declaring their primary interest as language learning, teaching or translation.

While much research on new literacies focuses on the World Wide Web, the aim {{in this study is}} to investigate the importance of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> as a new type of literacy which is of particular relevance in the context of language learning and teaching. After briefly situating the theoretical and pedagogical context of the study in relation to authenticity and learner autonomy, the paper describes an empirical study involving eight postgraduate students of French. As part of a Masters course they write a short text and subsequently attempt to improve it by using concordancing software to consult a small corpus containing texts on a similar subject. The analysis of the results reveals a significant number of changes made by the learners which may be classified as follows in order of frequency: grammatical errors (gender and agreement, prepositions, verb forms/mood, negation and syntax); misspellings, accents and hyphens; lexico- grammatical patterning (native language interference, choice of verb and inappropriate vocabulary); and capitalisation. The conclusion notes that the situation in which these students found themselves (i. e. faced with a text on which the teacher had indicated phrases which could be improved) is replicated in many cases every day, and suggests that <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> may have a useful role to play in the context of interactive feedback, particularly in cases where traditional language learning resources are of little use.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} looked at the value of corpus-based data-driven learning (DDL) for second language (L 2) written error correction, with generally positive results. However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students’ written production for DDL. The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, {{and at the same time}} does not eliminate the need for <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries.
