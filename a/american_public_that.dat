25|$|The 1890 Manifesto did not, itself, {{eliminate}} {{the practice of}} new plural marriages, as they continued to occur clandestinely, mostly with church approval and authority. In addition, most Mormon polygamists and every polygamous general authority continued to co-habit with their polygamous wives. Mormon leaders, including Woodruff, maintained that the Manifesto was a temporary expediency designed to enable Utah to obtain statehood, and that at some future date, the practice would soon resume. Nevertheless, the 1890 Manifesto provided the church breathing room to obtain Utah's statehood, which it received in 1896 after a campaign to convince the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>that</b> Mormon leaders had abandoned polygamy and intended {{to stay out of}} politics.|$|E

500|$|The UFC {{also began}} a public {{relations}} campaign to discredit the Guatemalan government; it hired Edward Bernays, who mounted a concerted misinformation campaign for several years which portrayed the company as {{the victim of a}} communist Guatemalan government. The company stepped up its efforts after Dwight Eisenhower was elected U.S. President in 1952. These included commissioning a research study from a firm known to be hostile to social reform, which produced a 235-page report that was highly critical of the Guatemalan government. Historians have stated that the report was full of [...] "exaggerations, scurrilous descriptions and bizarre historical theories" [...] but it nonetheless {{had a significant impact on}} the members of Congress who read it. Overall, the company spent over half a million dollars to convince lawmakers and the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>that</b> the Guatemalan government needed to be overthrown.|$|E
500|$|The {{scenario}} is {{an adaptation of}} Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer and was not, by that time, not familiar to most theatergoers. The writer of the {{scenario is}} unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The impetus to adapt the play for the film may {{have been inspired by}} a recent Broadway production as noted in one Thanhouser advertisement, [...] "So revered is She Stoops to Conquer in the hearts of the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>that</b> recently they saw it as an all-star Broadway production with Eleanor Robson as Kate and Kyrle Bellew as Marlow, and it scored an epoch-making success. The present producers don't claim it to be a Broadway production but they [...] know it's the best picture thing of its kind that has been released this far in the game." [...] The advertisement also claims to be the first film adaptation of the play, which according to The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film it is. She Stoops to Conquer would see numerous adaptations over the following decades, but the Thanhouser Company would also draw from Goldsmith's work with their first adaptation of The Vicar of Wakefield in 1910.|$|E

This interest and interpretation is confirmation of a continued transatlantic dialogue and spread of information post-signing of the Declaration of Independence, and recovers an instance of continued interconnectedness between the British and <b>American</b> <b>publics</b> <b>that</b> informed Patriots and Loyalists' identities and ideologies during the war...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the government's unwillingness to grant {{immediate}} citizenship to all Indians reflected prevailing views among many {{politicians and the}} <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>that</b> Indians were not worthy of citizenship and should therefore not be entrusted with the responsibilities accorded citizens. Reformers chose wardship as the problem and fought for US citizenship for full participation in American life. Arthur C. Parker, {{a founding member of}} the Society of American Indians, characterized the anti-Indian tenor among politicians noting, [...] "one senator wrote me that there was a great deal of prejudice in considering Indian matters and reluctance to take them on." [...] In 1906, Congress passed the Burke Act, an amendment to the Dawes Act, which gave the U.S. Secretary of the Interior the ability to grant fee-simple titles to any land allottee [...] "competent and capable of managing his or her affairs." [...] The intent of the Act was to accelerate Indian assimilation and citizenship, and stipulated that every Indian who received a fee-simple title immediately became a citizen of the United States. However, the Act delayed citizenship for most Indians until the end of a 25-year trust period, citing as the primary reason Indians' unpreparedness for citizenship. McKenzie criticized the legislation for postponing citizenship of the majority of Indians for another generation, and argued that citizenship for the Indian meant opening the door of hope and self-responsibility.|$|E
60|$|I told Sir Walter Scott, that, {{in order}} to secure a {{copyright}} in America, it was necessary the book should never have been published anywhere else. This was said under the popular notion of the matter; or that which is entertained among the booksellers. Reflection and examination have since convinced me of my error: the publication alluded to in the law can only mean publication in America; for, as the object of doing certain acts previously to publication is merely to forewarn the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>that</b> the right is reserved, there can be no motive for having reference to any other publication. It is, moreover, in conformity with the spirit of all laws to limit the meaning of their phrases by their proper jurisdiction. Let us suppose a case. An American writes a book, he sends a copy to England, where it is published in March complying with the terms of our own copyright law, as to the entries and notices, the same work is published here in April. Now will it be pretended that his right is lost, always providing that his own is the first American publication? I do not see how it can be so by either the letter or the spirit of the law. The intention is to encourage the citizen to write, and to give him a just property in the fruits of his labour; and the precautionary provisions of the law are merely to prevent others from being injured for want of proper information. It is of no moment to either of these objects that the author of a work has already reaped emolument in a foreign country: the principle is to encourage literature by giving it all the advantages it can obtain.|$|E
