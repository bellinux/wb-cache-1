Kirkman avouched that since the initiation of the zombie apocalypse, many of the characters have reverted to traditional gender roles; [...] "Lori is really just aggravated over {{a lot of things}} and she's lashing out. She was serious and she wants Andrea to pull her weight; certain people are stuck with certain tasks and to a certain extent people are retreating back into traditional gender roles because of how this survival-crazy world seems to work. Lori has <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on so she's definitely going to be behaving somewhat irrationally at times as she tries to cope with the pregnancy and the conflict between Rick and Shane as well as dealing with the fact that Rick was out on the road again. She's going through a lot of stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} leaked onto the {{internet}} in later October 2009 with several preliminary tracks from Raymond v. Raymond. [...] "Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)", one of the tracks that follows-up Usher's divorce, and the change in content from Here I Stand, back to Confessions-style, was one of six tracks co-written by Rico Love for the album. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Love said of Usher's return to that style, [...] "I feel like he’s got his mind right and it’s focused. He went through a lot. He had lost his father when he was creating the Here I Stand record, {{a lot of controversy}} with his marriage, he had kids, he parted ways with his mother’s management, and there were just <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on and he kind of lost focus. It’s not like Here I Stand wasn’t a good album. I just feel like he lost touch with his demographic." [...] According to MTV News, the song provides the reasons behind Usher's crumbling marriage as narrated in [...] "Papers".

500|$|West {{collaborated with}} American film score {{composer}} Jon Brion, {{who served as}} the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. West had been exposed to Brion's work while watching the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, for which Brion had composed music. West was also listening to songs Brion had produced for When the Pawn..., the second studio album of alternative singer-songwriter Fiona Apple, another one of West's favorite musicians and sources of musical inspiration for the album. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. When questioned if his presence made Late Registration any less hip-hop, Brion replied, [...] "There are colors and ideas that make [...] different from average hip-hop, but Kanye is already different from the average hip-hop guy. He's got this sense of pop record-making which is really solid, and he likes tracks with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on in them — which is not necessarily common for hip-hop. He was already barking up that tree. This is definitely not just a hip-hop album. But it is also by no means overtly arty, or non-hip-hop. I don't think it's a weird record by any means." ...|$|E
