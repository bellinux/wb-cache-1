500|$|While the {{original}} song's verses each {{told the story}} of three abnormal children, each verse of [...] "Headline News" [...] tells the story of three famous tabloid stories of 1993 and 1994: Singapore caning American delinquent Michael Fay, figure skater Tonya Harding's then-boyfriend attacking her rival Nancy Kerrigan, and Lorena Bobbitt severing her husband's penis with a knife. In the last verse, Yankovic substitutes the term [...] "penis" [...] with euphemisms like [...] "wiener" [...] and [...] "Mr. Happy". Yankovic later joked that he [...] "wanted to write a song <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> because [...] think they're getting quite enough media attention", a reference to the stories' over-saturation in the news.|$|E
500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, {{the thing that}} struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, {{because you have to}} care <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> in order to be worried about what might happen to them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. [...] "I believe in fate. I think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you're taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan".|$|E
50|$|Scholars do {{not agree}} about the first {{settlers}} {{in what is now}} Uruguay; but there is evidence that there was human presence some 10,000 years BCE, the Homo catalanensis culture. Indigenous Uruguayans disappeared in the 1830s, and {{with the exception of the}} Guaraní, little is known <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples,</b> and even less about their genetic characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the first}} outside contact with the Shompen in the 1840s, there is no {{reliable}} information <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples.</b> Danish Admiral Steen Bille {{was the first to}} contact them in 1846 and Frederik Adolph de Roepstorff, a British officer who had already published works on the languages of Nicobar and Andaman, collected ethnographic and linguistic data in 1876. Since then very little has been added to the stock of reliable information on the Shompen, mainly because access to the Nicobar Islands has been restricted for foreign researchers since Indian independence. A polling station was set up in their area for election of 2014. Shompen people for the first time participated in democratic process.|$|R

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} it on behalf of Tor.com, comparing it to [...] "The Naked Time" [...] and stating that [...] "there's nothing in this episode as entertaining as Sulu bare-chested with an epee, and Wesley being nerdy in the engine room is nowhere near as much fun as Riley singing." [...] He gave the episode a score of two out of ten, remarking that [...] "it's rarely a good idea to do an episode where everyone acts out of character as only the second one out of the gate, since we don't know enough <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> for their acting strange to be meaningful." [...] Cast member Wil Wheaton re-watched the episode for AOL TV, and summed it up saying [...] "whether it was the worst episode ever or not probably rested upon the viewer's expectations. Trekkies who were looking for reasons to hate The Next Generation found plenty" [...] while [...] "viewers who were willing to watch it with an open mind saw flashes of things they came to love watching," [...] and gave it a score of D+.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the first episode was not favourable; in The Independent, Nicholas Barber called it the most depressing TV programme he had ever seen. He wrote of the six main characters, [...] "Are we supposed to care <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>people?</b> The theory, I think, {{is that we should}} relate to them, because their lives are as prosaic as our own, and because Cold Feet is a portrait of urban life as it really is in the Nineties. This is another way of saying the writer hasn't bothered with research or imagination." [...] He criticised the conclusion of Episode 1 but praised the other five, which he had seen on preview tapes. On The Late Review, Germaine Greer and Tony Parsons singled out Nesbitt's acting; Greer called him [...] "especially awful" [...] and Parsons wished that he had plunged to his death from the scissor lift Adam appears on {{at the beginning of the}} episode. General reaction improved as the first year went on. At the conclusion of the first series, Andrew Billen compared it with Vanity Fair in the Evening Standard and was pleased that it offered a televisual outlet for the [...] "forgotten" [...] twentysomethings. Paul Hoggart for The Times wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing and looked forward to how Rachel's pregnancy plot would be resolved in the second series.|$|E
500|$|As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates {{to shoot}} Dale, Daryl takes {{the gun and}} inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions and care <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>people.</b> So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, you can do the things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step in and take that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate to do the same thing with Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and does what he needs to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album Lore (1996) {{gave some}} {{thought to the}} Native American Indians. On [...] "Trail of Tears", when Noel Duggan imagines {{how it felt to}} be exiled from one's ancestral land, he was also {{thinking}} <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> and their connection with the Irish. It opens with [...] "Croí Cróga" [...] ('braveheart' in English) which was written as a theme tune for the Mel Gibson film Braveheart which, for unknown reasons, never made it onto the soundtrack. Lore features American drummer Vinnie Colaiuta and Mel Collins. It contained a strong jazz element, with songs such as [...] "Seanchas" [...] blending contemporary sounds with traditional Irish music and the Irish language. Clannad toured Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand in 1996 to promote the Lore album, but due to apparent disagreements with Atlantic Records, plans to tour the USA were scrapped. In 1996, they received a lifetime achievement award from the Irish recording industry (the IRMA).|$|E

50|$|The C-Group {{culture was}} an ancient civilization {{centered}} in Nubia, which existed from ca. 2400 BCE to ca. 1550 BCE. It was named by George A. Reisner.
