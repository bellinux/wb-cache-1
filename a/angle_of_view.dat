5|$|The {{scales on}} {{butterfly}} wings are pigmented with melanins {{that can produce}} the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an excretory product. Bright blues, greens, reds and iridescence are usually created not by pigments but through the microstructure of the scales. This structural coloration {{is the result of}} coherent scattering of light by the photonic crystal nature of the scales. The specialised scales that provide structural colours to reflected light mostly produce ultra-violet patterns which are discernible {{in that part of the}} ultra-violet spectrum that lepidopteran eyes can see. The structural colour seen is often dependent upon the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{study is}} trying to {{discriminate}} features of graphic design in terms of stylization classified and to assess the affects of the graphic styles that confront with deficient <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> The research emphasizes on three phases. Firstly, the graphic stylizations in packaging are categorized as the types of illustration that are applied to the test samples in the experiment. They are: pictorial graphics, rendering graphics and symbol graphics. Secondly, recognition performance has been estimated for the graphic styled against different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Pictorial and rendering graphics are of better performance than symbol graphics. The larger <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> have worse performances of recognition. Thirdly, the interaction between view angles and graphic stylization is detected for the proof of correlation. That the graphic stylization of rendering graphics has been found more effective on recognizing performance while confronting with larger view angles.

50|$|The table below {{shows the}} horizontal, {{vertical}} and diagonal <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> in degrees, when used with 22.2 mm × 14.8 mm format (that is the common mid-market DSLR APS-C frame size) and a diagonal of 26.7 mm.|$|R
25|$|Depth {{of field}} {{increases}} with f-number, {{as illustrated in}} the image here. This means that photographs taken with a low f-number (large aperture) will tend to have subjects at one distance in focus, {{with the rest of}} the image (nearer and farther elements) out of focus. This is frequently used for nature photography and portraiture because background blur (the aesthetic quality of which is known as 'bokeh') can be aesthetically pleasing and puts the viewer's focus on the main subject in the foreground. The depth of field of an image produced at a given f-number is dependent on other parameters as well, including the focal length, the subject distance, and the format of the film or sensor used to capture the image. Depth of field can be described as depending on just <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> subject distance, and entrance pupil diameter (as in von Rohr's method). As a result, smaller formats will have a deeper field than larger formats at the same f-number for the same distance of focus and same <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> since a smaller format requires a shorter focal length (wider angle lens) to produce the same <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and depth of field increases with shorter focal lengths. Therefore, reduced–depth-of-field effects will require smaller f-numbers when using small-format cameras than when using larger-format cameras.|$|E
25|$|The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of a lens {{depends upon}} its focal length and the camera's image sensor size; a sensor smaller than 35mm film format (36×24mm frame) gives a {{narrower}} <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> for a lens {{of a given}} focal length than a camera equipped with a full-frame (35mm) sensor. As of 2017, only a few current DSLRs have full-frame sensors, including the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II, EOS 5D Mark IV, EOS 5DS/5DS R, and EOS 6D Mark II; Nikon's D5, D610, D750, D810, and Df; and the Pentax K-1. The scarcity of full-frame DSLRs is partly {{a result of the}} cost of such large sensors. Medium format size sensors, such as those used in the Mamiya ZD among others, are even larger than full-frame (35mm) sensors, and capable of even greater resolution, and are correspondingly more expensive.|$|E
25|$|Long focus lens: <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> {{narrower}} than {{a normal}} lens. This is any lens with a focal length {{longer than the}} diagonal measure of the film or sensor. The {{most common type of}} long focus lens is the telephoto lens, a design that uses a special telephoto group to be physically shorter than its focal length.|$|E

25|$|Painters {{depicting}} someone {{gazing into}} a mirror often also show the person's reflection. This {{is a kind}} of abstraction—in most cases the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> is such that the person's reflection should not be visible. Similarly, in movies and still photography an actor or actress is often shown ostensibly looking at him- or herself in the mirror, and yet the reflection faces the camera. In reality, the actor or actress sees only the camera and its operator in this case, not their own reflection.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} is not as simple if {{it is important that}} a background object, such as a sign, be unrecognizable. The magnification of background objects also increases with focal length, so with the technique just described, there is little change in the recognizability of background objects.-number will achieve both objectives, and that using a lens of different focal length will make no difference in the result. However, a lens of longer focal length may still be of some help; because of the narrower <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> a slight change of camera position may suffice to eliminate the distracting object from the field of view.|$|E
25|$|If {{the camera}} {{position}} and image framing (i.e., <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>view)</b> have been chosen, {{the only means}} of controlling DOF is the lens aperture. Most DOF formulas imply that any arbitrary DOF can be achieved by using a sufficiently large f-number. Because of diffraction, however, this isn't really true. Once a lens is stopped down to where most aberrations are well corrected, stopping down further will decrease sharpness in the plane of focus. At the DOF limits, however, further stopping down decreases the size of the defocus blur spot, and the overall sharpness may still increase. Eventually, the defocus blur spot becomes negligibly small, and further stopping down serves only to decrease sharpness even at DOF limits (Gibson 1975, 64). There is thus a tradeoff between sharpness in the POF and sharpness at the DOF limits. But the sharpness in the POF is always greater than that at the DOF limits; if the blur at the DOF limits is imperceptible, the blur in the POF is imperceptible as well.|$|E

Their coloring is a dark green with blue spots with a light white underbelly also known as countershading. Its snout is very short and broadly angular along with its angular disc. The rays' bright coloration serves as a warning for its venomous spines. The ray has a very long tail accommodating two venomous spines {{on the base of}} the tail. The tail is about twice as long as the body of the ray, and the barbs or spines are two different sizes, one being very large and the other a medium-sized barb. The bluespotted stingray has bright yellow eyes that are positioned to allow them a wide <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Since the gills are located ventrally, the spiracles allow water to reach the gills while resting or feeding on the benthos. The spiracles are located directly behind the eyes. The mouth is located on the ventral side of the body, which promotes the unique foraging technique of stingrays. Rays are normally solitary individuals but can occur in groups. One unique characteristic of the bluespotted stingray is that they rarely bury themselves in the sand, only to hide from predators, unlike the majority of stingrays who bury themselves regularly to hunt.|$|E
