Carey writes books and articles for a scientifically interested general audience. She is the author of The Epigenetics Revolution <b>and</b> <b>Junk</b> DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome which explore advances in the field of epigenetics and their implications for medicine.

5|$|In {{terms of}} combat, the game allows players {{to create and}} {{customise}} their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen moves are Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will {{be made available to}} the player {{over the course of the}} game: the moves enable them to do things like stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer <b>and</b> <b>Junk</b> Bolt.|$|E

5000|$|The people given power suits called JUNK, {{allowed to}} do {{whatever}} they want with them as long as they hand in a set of data {{at least once a week}} to an organization eventually revealed as JUNK SYSTEMS. When the Black <b>and</b> White <b>JUNKs</b> made their appearance, they, Red <b>JUNK</b> <b>and</b> Blue <b>JUNK</b> were from then on called the [...] "supermen." [...] The Black, White <b>and</b> Red <b>JUNKs</b> were prototypes made for the eventual perfection of the mass-produced Blue JUNK model, to be used by JUNK SYSTEMS to destroy the current Japanese government and remake it into a new Bakumatsu era.|$|R

25|$|The {{level of}} risk in {{investments}} is taken into consideration. Riskier investments such as shares <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> bonds are normally expected to deliver higher returns than safer ones like government bonds.|$|E
25|$|His arrival on Wall Street {{coincided with}} the {{explosion}} of white collar criminal investigations in finance. He wrote about the stock trading scandals involving speculator Ivan Boesky <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> bond king Michael Milken, {{as well as the}} Treasury markets scandal at Salomon Brothers. He also covered the excesses of the takeover era, including the biggest deal of the time, the acquisition of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{study on}} ETF returns in 2009 by Morgan Stanley, ETFs missed in 2009 their targets {{by an average of}} 1.25 {{percentage}} points, a gap more than twice as wide as the 0.52-percentage-point average they posted in 2008. Part of this so-called tracking error is attributed to the proliferation of ETFs targeting exotic investments or areas where trading is less frequent, such as emerging-market stocks, future-contracts based commodity indices <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> bonds.|$|E
25|$|Joann {{is able to}} {{complete}} the one {{piece of the puzzle}} that Frank could not: revealing what happened to the band's second album. After storming from the studio, Eddie brought her to the Palace of Depression, a makeshift castle made of garbage <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> that he visited often as a child. She reveals it was in fact she who took the master tapes for the album from Satin Records, hiding them in the Palace of Depression, where she felt they belonged.|$|E
25|$|The name Merzbow {{comes from}} the German dada artist Kurt Schwitters' artwork Merzbau, in which Schwitters {{transformed}} the interior of his house using found objects. The name was chosen to reflect Akita's dada influence <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> art aesthetic. In addition to this, Akita has cited {{a wide range of}} musical influences from progressive rock, heavy metal, free jazz, and early electronic music to non-musical influences like dadaism, surrealism, and fetish culture. Since the early 2000s, he has been inspired by animal rights and environmentalism, and began to follow a vegan, straight edge lifestyle.|$|E
50|$|Pursuing {{their quest}} for {{alternative}} trade routes to Asia, the Dutch reached the Philippines and sought to dominate the commercial sea trade in Southeast Asia. Being at war with Spain, they engaged in privateering activities. They harassed the coasts of Manila Bay and its environs, and preyed on sampans <b>and</b> <b>junks</b> from China <b>and</b> Japan, thereby disrupting Spanish trade.|$|R
50|$|In August 2008, {{when the}} Philippine Supreme Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order against {{the signing of}} the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain (MOA-AD) between the Philippine {{government}} and the MILF in Malaysia, the CBCS was one of the civil society groups which separately filed motions for reconsideration. The court denied their appeal declaring as unconstitutional the memorandum <b>and</b> <b>junked</b> their motions.|$|R
5000|$|Canadian author Heather Pringle {{has noted}} Kiss' unconcern for {{conventional}} scientific {{theory and the}} way in which his ideas 'greatly appealed to right-wing extremists who were always looking for ways of Germanizing science <b>and</b> <b>junking</b> anything that smacked of [...] "Jewish" [...] science'. [...] According to Pringle, mainstream scientists in America and Britain at the time described Kiss as a 'complete idiot'.|$|R
25|$|She soon {{moved in}} with Jean Tinguely, who by then had {{separated}} from his wife, Eva Aeppli. He was becoming well-known for his kinetic sculptures made from cast-off mechanisms <b>and</b> <b>junk.</b> In many ways, the pair were polar opposites, and sometimes had violent disagreements, and frequent affairs with others. They would live together intermittently and collaborate closely on artistic projects {{for over a decade}} before marrying in 1971. Two years later they separated, but remained on good terms and continued to collaborate on various projects up through Tinguely's death in 1991.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{recycling}} is {{performed by the}} entrepreneurial poor such as the karung guni, zabbaleen, the rag-and-bone man, waste picker, <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> man. With the creation of large recycling organizations that may be profitable, either by law or economies of scale, the poor {{are more likely to}} be driven out of the recycling and the remanufacturing market. To compensate for this loss of income, a society may need to create additional forms of societal programs to help support the poor. Like the parable of the broken window, there is a net loss to the poor and possibly the whole of a society to make recycling artificially profitable e.g. through the law. However, in Brazil and Argentina, waste pickers/informal recyclers work alongside the authorities, in fully or semi-funded cooperatives, allowing informal recycling to be legitimized as a paid public sector job.|$|E
25|$|Silversides {{became a}} part of the Combined Great Lakes Navy Association in Chicago, Illinois, behind Chicago's Naval Armory on 24 May 1973. For years, the {{submarine}} was tended by a small crew of dedicated volunteers, drawn to her illustrious history and technical marvels. They donated tens of thousands of man-hours to restore her, maintained her at their own expense, and served as docents and chaperones. When association volunteers first stepped on board, they faced a musty, mildewed sub with paint peeling off in sheets inside and out, <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> scattered everywhere. After many years, the refrigeration compartment had produced a growth so thick, they could be measured in multiple inches instead of millimeters. Evidence of water damage prevailed in the forward compartments but the aft end was in reasonably good condition. Topside, the decking was weathered and worn in spots and some areas of the superstructure were rusted and in need of replacement.|$|E

50|$|On September 6, in {{downtown}} Lawrence, the filmmakers repainted signs, changing {{the names of}} stores, staining the facades with soot. The large windows were shattered into sharp teeth, bricks were scattered <b>and</b> <b>junked</b> cars were painted with clouds of black spray. Two industrial-sized yellow fans bolted to a flatbed trailer blew clouds of white flakes into the air. This fallout-matter was actually Cornflakes painted white.|$|R
500|$|Critics {{felt that}} the visual style was {{similar to those of}} the {{previous}} Silent Hill installments. Enjoying the visuals, Jeff Haynes of IGN wrote: [...] "From the cluttered <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> strewn locations to the rusty, chaos filled doppelgangers of the alternate dimensions, everything feels like it's been stripped from one of the other titles and shrunk down to the handheld." [...] Reviewers praised the graphics, the monster designs, the detailed environments, and atmosphere. However, some reviewers wrote that the character models could have been more detailed.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} Madonna {{and her two}} backup dancers dancing in a club while lights blink in the background. The shots {{continue}} while interspersing close-up shots of Madonna dancing while wearing a coat <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> jewelry. Author Douglas Kellner in his book Media Culture: Cultural Studies, Identity, and Politics Between the Modern and the Postmodern noted that already with her first video, Madonna was deploying fashion, sexuality {{and the construction of}} an individual image to present herself both as an alluring sex object and as a transgressor of established norms. The band Fab Five Freddy reminisce that with the video Madonna [...] "is attracting those who were more street, more savvy, more flavorful." ...|$|E
500|$|This [...] "70/30 Law" [...] was {{not only}} applied to the visual designs for the film, {{but also for the}} sound effects and music. Sound {{designer}} Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team [...] "scoured hobby shops <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms" [...] in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to [...] "avoid sounding slick or sci-fi". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried [...] "affected his comedy", and [...] "the {{last thing you want to}} do in a story like this is affect performances".|$|E
50|$|The Australian {{copies of}} Power were {{returned}} <b>and</b> <b>junked</b> in June 1975. Only two other countries purchased the story {{due to the}} restriction on Dalek sales by Terry Nation: the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation in 1968, which then sent its copy to RTS in Singapore in 1972. RTS's successor Mediacorp {{say they do not}} possess any copies, and what happened to this set is currently unknown.|$|R

500|$|The {{garden was}} closed from February 1 through May 24, 2013 to undergo repair and review for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The family and ten volunteers worked for nearly {{six months to}} restore the grounds. The cleanup process {{included}} the removal of dead vegetation <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> from outbuildings, and an estate sale that included items from before Petersen's death. On May 25, 2013, Petersen Rock Garden hosted its [...] "grand reopening". The opening was attended {{by members of the}} Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, who sang and blessed the garden. Caward has considered opening a cafe on the grounds, and turning the family home into a bed and breakfast. Owen Evans, a friend of the family who has assisted with the restoration, has also envisioned a museum reorganization, a small amphitheater to host outdoor concerts and other events, and additional rock sculptures mimicking Petersen's style.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the details}} the team added are post-war effects that {{continue}} on the battlefield throughout the game, where dust and smoke continue to roll through the streets, clouding up vision, <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> and debris scattered everywhere. The game has sound attenuation, with a 5.1 surround sound system, and context sensitive dialog, {{with a total of}} twenty-thousand lines of dialog. Each of the soldiers fighting alongside the player will call out the position of enemy soldiers, warn of flank attacks, and help out in ways that were not possible in {{the first game of the}} series. Zampella said, [...] "We really wanted realistic battle chatter going that's not only entertaining, but actually adds to the gaming experience. So now you'll hear your guys telling you that there's [...] two guys hiding behind that rusty car in the street or that there are people on the second floor of a building".|$|E
500|$|McDougal {{is an avid}} {{motorcycle}} rider and car collector. Her first modelling {{assignment was}} being a promotional model at a Harley-Davidson bike show in Detroit. In 2004, she bought a pink custom-built motorcycle, and entered an Easyriders sponsored motorcycle competition in Pomona, where her motorcycle won the Best Radical Custom award. She also professes to be a chocoholic <b>and</b> <b>junk</b> food junkie even when she considers herself a [...] "health nut". [...] In her spare time, she works out 5 days a week to stay in shape. When she was Playmate of the Year of 1998, she had a healthy BMI of 19. [...] Although she is a swimsuit model, {{she is not a}} proficient swimmer because of her aquaphobia. She is an animal lover and owned two cats: Brittany and Brandy. McDougal has two tattoos, one is a tattoo of a cat on the second toe of her right foot to honor her cats, the other is that of a cross behind her right ear as a reminder of her spirituality.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, Miller {{came across}} Wilbur Hot Springs, {{which was in}} terrible shape, badly vandalized <b>and</b> {{littered}} with <b>junk.</b> Rusting vehicles <b>and</b> dilapidated buildings were scattered around the property, including the decrepit 20-room bathhouse; and literally tons of old wood, broken glass, burned mattresses and couches, old toilets <b>and</b> other <b>junk</b> littered the land.|$|R
