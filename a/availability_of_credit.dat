In Kentucky, rapid population growth and strong demand for the state's goods led to land speculation becoming a popular enterprise.

Demand for housing was both a cause and effect of the rapidly expanding shadow banking system, which helped fund the shift to more lending of the speculative and ponzi types, through ever-riskier mortgage loans at higher levels of leverage. This helped drive the housing bubble, as the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> encouraged higher home prices. Since the bubble burst, {{we are seeing the}} progression in reverse, as businesses de-leverage, lending standards are raised and the share of borrowers in the three stages shifts back towards the hedge borrower.|$|E

25|$|In {{exchange}} for US $43 billion in liquidity aid, Suharto {{was forced to}} sign three letters of intent from October 1997 to April 1998 with the IMF. The LoI promised reforms which includes closing banks owned by Suharto's family and cronies starting in November 1997. Plan to close unhealthy banks resulted in a bank run that drained liquidity; depositors knew of the poor regulations and risky related-party credit extensions of Indonesian banks. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantee for bank deposits, and set-up Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take-over management of troubled banks to prevent collapse of the financial system. Based on IMF recommendation, the government increased interest rates to 70% pa in February 1998 to control spiralling inflation caused by higher price of imports, but this action killed <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> to the corporate sector. Suharto's foot-dragging in undertaking reforms demanded by IMF in relation to his children's business further weakened public confidence.

40|$|Although {{the neoclassical}} {{investment}} theory postulates that private investment is {{strongly related to}} the cost of capital, empirical studies have indicated a weak and often insignificant link between the two. There are two potential reasons for this identified in the literature. One argument is that the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> may be more binding than the costs in developing countries because of their institutional and structural characteristics. The other is that the uncertainty surrounding the cost of capital may have a more substantial impact on private investment than the level of cost. Given these arguments, this paper investigates {{the question of whether the}} cost, quantity <b>of</b> <b>credits,</b> and/or cost uncertainty stemming from financial markets play a more important role in determining private investment in a developing country such as Turkey. To this end, this study modifies the neoclassical investment model to include credit availability and an appropriate measure of cost uncertainty obtained by fitting a univariate GARCH process of real interest rate. While reinforcing the findings of previous studies that the quantity <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> significantly affects private investment, the results go on to indicate that cost uncertainty, but not the level, has an adverse impact on private investment in Turkey...|$|R
