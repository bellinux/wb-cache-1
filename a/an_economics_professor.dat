25|$|The {{club was}} not keen on repeating the {{disaster}} of 1991–92, {{and in the}} next season Bayern spent the equivalent of €12 million on the new players—Thomas Helmer (€4M), Brazil's captain Jorginho (€2.8M) and Lothar Matthäus (€2M) topped the bill of a list that also included Mehmet Scholl. Calming the nerves of the thrifty President Dr. Fritz Scherer, <b>an</b> <b>economics</b> <b>professor</b> at the University of Munich, was the sale of Stefan Effenberg and Brian Laudrup for €8.5 million to Fiorentina.

The fiscal multiplier, required to be over the value of one for the effect to take place, was in practice close to zero – not 1.5 as he said the Obama team were assuming – which means the extra employment generated by the stimulus would be cancelled out by less output and investment in the private sector.|$|E

Then they can grow to become productive adults and live longer, healthier lives. However, in poor countries like Bangladesh, working children are essential for survival in many families, as they were in our own heritage until the late 19th century. So, while the struggle to end child labour is necessary, getting there often requires taking different routes—and, sadly, there are many political obstacles.|$|E
