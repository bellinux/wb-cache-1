This time, rather than being intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> boost competitiveness, some states, especially Japan and the Eurozone, may be motivated to devalue their currencies <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> counter the threat of deflation. ECB President Mario Draghi has however denied any intent to engage in competitive devaluation.|$|E
5|$|Acquacotta {{was invented}} in part <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> make stale, {{hardened}} bread edible. People that worked {{away from home for}} significant periods of time, such as woodcutters and shepherds, would bring bread and other foods with them (such as pancetta and salt cod) to hold them over. Acquacotta was prepared and used to marinate the stale bread, thus softening it.|$|E

5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that}} we can never treat a human <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E

5|$|According to Russell's {{outlook on}} power, {{there are four}} {{conditions}} under which power ought to be pursued with moral conviction. First, it must be pursued only <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> some end, and not {{as an end in}} itself; moreover, if it is an end in itself, then it must be of comparatively lower value than one's other goals. Second, the ultimate goal must be to help satisfy the desires of others. Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they outweigh the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201). Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216–218).|$|E

5|$|Allocators {{were invented}} by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL).

However, in the process of adopting STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standardization committee realized that a complete abstraction of the memory model would incur unacceptable performance penalties. To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were made more restrictive. As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E
