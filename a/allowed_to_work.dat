5|$|One hundred cyclists {{had entered}} for the 1906 Tour de France; only 82 of them {{showed up at}} the start.

At that point, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining riders in accordance with their positions in those stages. At the end of the Tour de France, only 14 cyclists finished.

5|$|During his suspension, Ramirez was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{out at the}} Dodgers' {{facilities}} and he trained with Dodger coach Manny Mota. To get back into shape he was allowed a short rehab stint in the minor leagues. Ramirez played two games with the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes, where his appearance led to record crowds for the Isotopes. He played several games with the Single-A Inland Empire 66ers, homering in his first at-bat with the 66ers. Ramirez returned from his suspension and reclaimed his starting role with the Dodgers on July 3 against the San Diego Padres. On July 7, Ramirez was ejected by homeplate umpire John Hirschbeck after throwing his elbow guard in the air after being called out on strikes. Instead of causing conflict, Ramirez walked into the dugout where he remained {{the rest of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{had put a}} {{price on}} Federico Pistrucci's head, as he had prosecuted Bonapartist rebels, so the family fled Rome when the French {{advanced}} towards it, stopping in Frosinone, where the boys were again put into an academic school. Filippo satisfied his father with enough academic achievement that he was allowed to take a job with a painter named Mango. Deprived of his brother, Benedetto became despondent and was eventually <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at Mango's. There, he quickly displayed his artistic talent. Mango told Benedetto of his brother Giuseppe Mango, a cameo engraver in Rome. With the Pope and the French having made peace, the family was able to return there, and Benedetto Pistrucci began his training as a cameo carver. He advanced quickly, also taking lessons from Stefano Tofanelli, and soon Giuseppe Mango was selling Pistrucci's carvings as his own. Realising that his works were being sold as counterfeit antiques, Pistrucci began placing a secret mark, the Greek letter λ (lambda) on his creations.|$|E
5|$|Today, the MLB commissioner's office {{directly}} {{employs the}} official scorers {{who are responsible}} for producing score reports, but most scorers are hired on the recommendation of the public relations directors of baseball teams. Official scorers are typically retired writers, coaches, and umpires. Unlike umpiring teams, MLB official scorers do not typically travel between stadiums. Each official scorer is assigned to a stadium for the season, with each stadium having one or more scorers. Scorers now have access to replay video from different angles which they can review before making a decision. As of 2012, MLB official scorers earned $150 per game. Official scorers are not required to meet the old BBWAA requirements, and are also no longer required to pass a written test, which was once administered by the National League before it was phased out in the mid-1990s. Potential scorers are generally required to briefly apprentice under an existing scorer before they are <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> alone.|$|E

5|$|Trucks {{were first}} used {{extensively}} {{by the military}} during World War I. With the increase in construction of paved roads, trucking began to achieve a significant foothold in the 1930s. Public safety concerns made it necessary to implement various government regulations (such as the 1965 hours of service rule; recently revised with a compliance date of July 1, 2012) of how long drivers were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and drive each day/week. In 1956, Taxpayers provided funds to build the Interstate Highway System, an extensive network of highways and freeways that linked major cities across the continent. The addition of Interstate Highway System also {{made it possible for}} the trucking industry to grow substantially in the late 1950s and early 1960s and trucking has come to dominate the freight industry in the latter portion of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|After the Liberation of Paris in August 1944, the French {{scientists}} {{wanted to}} go home. Auger had already returned to London to join the French Scientific Mission in April 1944.

While he maintained that he did not divulge any nuclear secrets to his previous boss (although he had discussed patent rights), Halban was not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> or to leave North America for a year, although he left the Montreal Laboratory in April 1945. In 1946 he settled in England. B. W. Sargent then became Head of the nuclear physics division. Cockcroft arranged for Goldschmidt, Guéron and Kowarski to remain until June 1945, later extended until the end of 1945. Goldschmidt was willing to stay longer, and Cockcroft wanted to keep him, but Groves insisted that he should go, and, in the interest of Allied harmony, he did. All the French scientists had left by January 1946.|$|E
5|$|In late 2008 Rey Hechicero was {{scheduled}} to team up with Último Guerrero for a Ruelta de la Muerta ("Roulette of death") tournament where the losers of the match advance and the losing team would have to fight each other for their masks. Rey Hechicero suffered an injury shortly before the tournament {{and had to be}} replaced by Difunto II. There was no verification if Rey Hechicero was indeed injured or if the replacement was done because whomever had originally agreed to lose their mask changed their mind and Difunto II agreed to lose his match. Also in 2008 Rey Hechicero began working for a local promotion called Poder Y Honor ("Power and Honor"; PYH) and in 2009 he outlasted Chucho Mar Jr., Estrella Dorada Jr. and Tigre Universitario to become the inargual PYH Heavyweight Champion. In the following years he worked for a number of wrestling promotions as they toured through Monterrey, including winning the mask of Caifán Rockero I on a Perros del Mal show in March 2010. While he began working for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ("World Wrestling Council"; CMLL) in 2014, he was also <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for various local promotions by CMLL. On December 25, 2014 Rey Hechicero unsuccessfully challenged Black Terry for the FLLM Master Championship on a Cara Lucha show in Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl.|$|E

5|$|Supplies of {{raw cotton}} from the United States were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–65, {{leading to the}} {{formation}} of the Royton Local Board of Health in 1863, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality. On 26 November 1884 an explosive device containing gunpowder was detonated in Royton Town Hall, in a cellar underneath the offices of Royton's local board. An anonymous communication was received by the supposed bomber, stating that he intended the explosion for the Royton School Board because children are not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at the age of 10 years, and because he wanted the abolition of the Factory Acts. There were no fatalities caused by the explosion, and damage to the building was restricted to smoke damage and shattered windows, doors and woodwork. The Great Depression, and First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline in Royton. However, in as late the 1950s, 80% of Royton's population was employed in the textile mills. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns increased during the mid-20th century, Royton's textile sector declined gradually to a halt; cotton spinning reduced in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the early 1980s only four mills were operational. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton was spun in the town in 1998. Less than a dozen mills are still standing in Royton, the majority of which are now used for light engineering or as distribution centres.|$|E
