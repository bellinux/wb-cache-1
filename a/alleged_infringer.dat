25|$|The court {{states the}} test for {{copyright}} infringement as copying an item {{that is the subject}} of a valid copyright, making no mention of improper appropriation of protectible elements. This is in contrast to the 2nd Circuit's prior opinion in Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119 (1930), that infringement occurs only when there is copying and improper appropriation. The Nichols court held that appropriation was not improper when the <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer</b> copied only unprotectible elements of the original work. While it is appropriate to look at both protectible and unprotectible elements of a work to determine whether copying has occurred, only the protectible elements are relevant when it comes to determining improper appropriation. The Steinberg court made no attempt to separate the protectable and unprotectable elements of Steinberg's drawing.|$|E

Lawsuits cost <b>alleged</b> <b>infringers</b> about $ 28. 7 million ($ 92) in the mean and $ 2. 9 million in the median.

2500|$|Nike has vigorously {{defended the}} Air Force 1 in U.S. courts. In one case, it sued an <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer</b> of its {{trademark}} in the Air Force 1, who responded by filing a counterclaim to invalidate the Air Force 1 trademark. Several months later, apparently fearful that the defendant's counterclaim could succeed, Nike dismissed all its claims with prejudice {{and gave the}} defendant a [...] "Covenant Not To Sue". The issue that went up on appeal was whether Nike's tactics had thereby rendered the entire dispute moot (meaning {{there was no longer}} an active case or controversy), so that the U.S. federal courts had been deprived of jurisdiction to hear the defendant's counterclaim. On January 9, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Nike's favor.|$|E

5000|$|The {{patent owner}} {{must be very}} careful when {{communicating}} with possible infringers. If a patent owner does {{suggest that there is}} patent coverage of what an <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer</b> is doing or planning to do, the <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer</b> may bring suit. The <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer,</b> as the plaintiff in the suit, can choose the venue subject to constitutional restrictions and the state long-arm statute of the forum in question. The suit can be brought in any forum if the local federal district court can properly obtain personal jurisdiction over the <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer.</b> The patent owner being sued for a declaratory judgment created a situation where he has lost the [...] "home-field advantage". Travel costs to a distant courthouse can be substantial, and a party litigating in a distant forum may have to hire a local attorney, if required by the local rules, in addition to the regular patent litigation counsel.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{bifurcated}} patent litigation systems, {{claims of}} infringement {{and validity of}} a patent are decided independently {{of each other in}} separate court proceedings at different courts. In non-bifurcated systems, infringement and validity are decided jointly in the same proceedings at a single court. We build a model that shows the key trade-off between bifurcated and non-bifurcated systems and how it affects the incentives of plaintiffs and defendants in patent infringement cases. Using detailed data on patent litigation cases in Germany (bifurcated) and the U. K. (non-bifurcated), we show that bifurcation creates situations in which a patent is held infringed that is subsequently invalidated. We also show that having to challenge a patent's validity in separate court proceedings under bifurcation implies that <b>alleged</b> <b>infringers</b> are less likely to do so. We find this to apply in particular to more resource-constrained <b>alleged</b> <b>infringers.</b> Finally, we find parties to be more likely to settle in a bifurcated system...|$|R
5000|$|Declaratory {{judgments}} {{are common in}} patent litigation, {{as well as in}} other areas of intellectual property litigation, because declaratory judgments allow an <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer</b> to [...] "clear the air" [...] about a product or service that may be a business's focal point. Take, for example, a typical patent-infringement claim. When a patent owner becomes aware of an infringer, the owner can simply wait until he pleases to bring an infringement suit. [...] Meanwhile, the monetary damages continuously accrue - with no effort expended by the patent owner, apart from marking the patent number on products the patent owner sold or licensed. [...] On the other hand, the <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer</b> could do nothing to rectify the situation if no declaratory judgment existed. The <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer</b> would be forced to continue to operate his business with the cloud of a lawsuit over his head. Fortunately, the declaratory-judgment procedure allows the <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer</b> to proactively bring suit to resolve the situation and eliminate the cloud of uncertainty looming overhead.|$|E

5000|$|Reverse payment patent settlements, {{also known}} as [...] "pay-for-delay" [...] {{agreement}}s, {{are a kind of}} an agreement that settles patent infringement litigation, in which the company that has brought the suit agrees to pay the company it sued.

These agreements are distinct from most patent settlements, which usually involve the <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer</b> paying the patent holder.|$|E

50|$|In patent law, for example, {{a patent}} owner is an {{indispensable}} party to a patent infringement suit brought by an exclusive licensee against an <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer.</b> The patent owner's rights would be {{directly affected by}} a finding of invalidity or unenforceability of the patent claims.

50|$|Courts will {{occasionally}} not uphold {{a copyright}} on modified public domain material if {{the changes are}} deemed to be de minimis. Similarly, courts have dismissed copyright infringement cases {{on the grounds that}} the <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer's</b> use of the copyrighted work (such as sampling) was so insignificant as to be de minimis. However, in Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films, such a ruling was overturned on appeal, the US appeals court explicitly declining to recognize a de minimis standard for digital sampling.|$|R
5000|$|A core {{criticism}} of patent trolls is that [...] "they {{are in a}} position to negotiate licensing fees that are grossly out of alignment with their contribution to the <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer's</b> product or service", notwithstanding their non-practising status or the possible weakness of their patent claims. The risk of paying high prices for after-the-fact licensing of patents they were not aware of, and the costs for extra vigilance for competing patents that might have been issued, in turn increases the costs and risks of manufacturing.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{estimates}} {{the total cost}} of patent litigation. We use a large sample of stock market event studies around the date of lawsuit filings for US public firms from 1984 - 99. Even though most lawsuits settle, we find that the total costs of lawsuits are large compared to estimated legal fees, estimates of patent value, and R&D spending. By the late 1990 s, <b>alleged</b> <b>infringers</b> bore expected costs of over $ 16 billion per year. These estimates support the view that infringement risk should be a major concern of policy...|$|R

5000|$|When a {{copyright}} owner engages in intentionally misleading representations concerning his abstention from suit, and the <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer</b> detrimentally {{relies on the}} copyright owner’s deception, the doctrine of estoppel may bar the copyright owner’s claims completely, eliminating all potential remedies.|$|E
5000|$|Usually the {{claimant}} is actually making, using, selling, offering {{to sell or}} importing or is prepared to actually make, use or sell, offer to sell or import an allegedly infringing device or method, and usually the patent owner has claimed that such activities by claimant will result in patent infringement. [...] An express threat of litigation is not needed, {{nor is it a}} guarantee that jurisdiction will be granted. [...] Some factors courts have considered in this analysis are whether a patent owner has asserted its rights against an <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer</b> in a royalty dispute, whether the owner has sued a customer of an <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer,</b> or whether an owner has made statements regarding its patents in trade magazines.|$|E

The court did not reject the defense, but left only a [...] "very narrow and strictly limited experimental use defense" [...] for [...] "amusement, to satisfy idle curiosity, or for strictly philosophical inquiry." [...] The court also precludes the defense where, regardless of profit motive, the research was done [...] "in furtherance of the <b>alleged</b> <b>infringer’s</b> legitimate business." [...] In the case of a research university like Duke University, the court held that the alleged use was in furtherance of its legitimate business, and thus the defense was inapplicable.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., {{copyright}} infringement {{is sometimes}} confronted via lawsuits in civil court, against <b>alleged</b> <b>infringers</b> directly, or against providers {{of services and}} software that support unauthorized copying. For example, major motion-picture corporation MGM Studios filed suit against P2P file-sharing services Grokster and Streamcast for their contributory role in copyright infringement. In 2005, the Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} MGM, holding that such services could be held liable for copyright infringement since they functioned and, indeed, willfully marketed themselves as venues for acquiring copyrighted movies. The MGM v. Grokster case did not overturn the earlier Sony v. Universal City Studios decision, but rather clouded the legal waters; future designers of software capable of being used for copyright infringement were warned.|$|R

The RIAA uses systems to gather lists of <b>alleged</b> <b>infringers,</b> and bulk-sues them.

40|$|After {{years of}} legal {{maneuvering}} and courtroom skirmishes, {{the lines in}} the war between copyright holders and online copyright infringers have been clearly drawn. This conflict, which is poised to erupt in courts across the country, began decades ago {{with the birth of}} the Internet, which gave rise to a previously unparalleled opportunity for the dissemination, sharing, and enjoyment of every conceivable form of human expression. In addition to the benefits it has provided, the Internet also has given rise to copyright infringement on a global scale through the unauthorized posting and sharing of digital files. After years of unsuccessfully battling Internet service providers (ISPs) and file sharing network software distributors, such as Napster and KaZaA, the war against digital copyright infringement may end soon, now that copyright holders are finally taking action directly against the actual infringers. To bring such actions against individual infringers, copyright holders must serve subpoenas on the ISPs pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act [hereinafter DMCA] to obtain the infringers’ subscriber information. Before the real conflict concerning copyright infringement can be fought in the courts or over settlement tables, various issues with the intermediate subpoena process must be resolved. First, does the subpoena authority granted by the DMCA put too much power into the hands of copyright owners? And even more importantly, does this subpoena power strip from <b>alleged</b> <b>infringers</b> any defense that they may have against its abuse? Unless an appropriate balance can be reached with respect to the authority granted by the DMCA’s subpoena provision, the war against copyright infringement will be won at the expense of service providers and the Constitutional rights of <b>alleged</b> <b>infringers.</b> The goal of this Article is to demonstrate that the DMCA subpoena provision neither aids those attempting to enforce copyrights nor sufficiently protects the interests of Internet users. A recent decision by the DC Court of Appeals stripped copyright holders of the use of the DMCA subpoena in situations where the offender’s ISP acts merely as a conduit for the transmission of infringing material, which encompasses the most pervasive and egregious form of infringement: unauthorized sharing of copyrighted material via peer-to-peer (P 2 P) networks, such as KaZaA. Thus, the DMCA subpoena power is unavailable to copyright holders when it is most needed. This situation must be remedied. At the same time, and even more importantly, additional statutory safeguards protecting the interests of ISPs and the rights of <b>alleged</b> copyright <b>infringers</b> must be built into the subpoena provision, which may be accomplished without sacrificing or significantly impeding copyright owners’ ability to enforce their copyrights. At best, the DMCA subpoena provision, in its current form, completely undermines alleged infringers’ Fifth Amendment due process rights and unfairly places the likely immense burden of challenging and responding to subpoenas on ISPs. At worst, the provision is susceptible to mistakes and abuse by those who would use it for purposes other than copyright enforcement. The inclusion of certain requirements, such as requiring the provision of notice to <b>alleged</b> <b>infringers</b> before their subscriber information is released, would not unduly burden copyright holders or hinder the enforcement process, but would protect against mistakes and abuse...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of the {{probabilistic}} nature of patents on the functioning of Germany's bifurcated patent litigation system where infringement and validity of a patent are decided independently by different courts. We show that bifurcation creates situations in which a patent is held infringed that is subsequently invalidated. Our conservative estimates indicate that 12 % of infringement cases in which the patent's validity is challenged produce such 'invalid but infringed' decisions. We also show that having to challenge a patent's validity in separate court proceedings means that more resource-constrained <b>alleged</b> <b>infringers</b> are less likely to do so. We find evidence that 'invalid but infringed' decisions create uncertainty which firms that were found to infringe an invalid patent attempt to reduce by filing more oppositions against newly granted patents immediately afterwards...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effects of patent {{enforcement}} insurance when used by an incumbent patent holder in order to increase its incentives to oppose <b>alleged</b> <b>infringers</b> (entrants). By covering some of the legal costs ex-ante, the incumbent can increase its commitment to litigate and, as a result, deter some potential entrants and, in case of entry, induce a more profitable settlement deal. We find that it is always optimal for the incumbent to undertake patent enforcement insurance, typically with a deductible that either prevents litigation from occurring in equilibrium or trades off its ex post costs in some situations with the ex ante gains in terms of deterring infringement and enhance the settlement deal in some others. We assess the value of enforcement insurance across different legal-cost allocation rules and parameterizations of the model...|$|R
