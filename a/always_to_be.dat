5|$|Mulder has Melissa undergo {{regression}} hypnosis for her {{to recount}} her past lives. She implies that she and Mulder have met over their past lives, <b>always</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> separated or lost to each other. To confirm her events, Mulder has himself hypnotized and recalls {{a time when he}} was a Jewish woman with a son, who had the same soul as his sister Samantha; his deceased father, who was Scully, is dead. Melissa was his husband in this life, and had been taken to a Nazi concentration camp by a Gestapo officer who was The Smoking Man. Mulder also recalls his past life from the Civil War, when he was a man named Sullivan Biddle, while Melissa was Sarah Kavanaugh; Scully, Mulder claims, was his sergeant. Scully finds pictures of Biddle and Kavanaugh in the county's hall of records and gives them to Mulder. He wears Confederate uniform in the photo.|$|E
5|$|The {{station at}} Chalfont Road was built with almost all {{facilities}} {{on the up}} side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, {{was on the other}} side of the tracks, most passengers travelling to and from the station were obliged to take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road giving access to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London–Aylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside the up platform for trains to Chesham. A run-around loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform <b>always</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line were obliged to push their trains out of the station before performing the manoeuvre.|$|E

25|$|On Blanshard's view, the Absolute is {{thus not}} merely {{consistent}} (i.e., noncontradictory) but positively coherent, {{shot through with}} relations of necessity and indeed operating purely deterministically. (Blanshard held the law of causality, properly understood, to be a logical law and believed that effects logically determine their causes as well as vice versa.) Strictly speaking, he admitted, we cannot prove {{that there are no}} atomic facts, bare conjunctions, or sheer surds in nature, but we can take it as our working hypothesis that relations of necessity are <b>always</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found; until and unless this hypothesis meets with absolute defeat, we are justified in adopting it at least provisionally.|$|E
25|$|While {{some of his}} men thought Oates to be too {{aggressive}} {{for his own good}} and theirs, most admired his courage and affirmed that he was <b>always</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found at the front of his men, in the thick of combat, and that he never asked them to go anywhere that he was not willing to go himself. A political rival, Alexander Lowther, would replace Oates as regimental commander in July 1864 after allegedly engineering Oates' removal from command. It was Oates, however, who led the 15th Alabama into its most noted engagement of the war, at Little Round Top on July 2, 1863, during {{the second day of the}} Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E
25|$|Marcus {{had much}} {{love and respect}} for his adoptive father. The tribute he gives Pius in the first book of the Meditations is the longest of any. He would have more {{influence}} on the young Marcus than any other person.From my father: gentleness and unshaken resolution in judgments taken after full examination; no vainglory about external honours; love of work and perseverance; readiness to hear those who had anything {{to contribute to the}} public advantage; the desire to reward every man according to his desert without partiality; the experience that knew where to tighten the reign, where to relax. Prohibition of unnatural practices, social tact and permission to his suite not invariably to be present at his banquets nor to attend his progress from Rome, as a matter of obligation, and <b>always</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found the same by those who had failed to attend him through engagements. Exact scrutiny in council and patience; not that he was avoiding investigation, satisfied with first impressions. An inclination to keep his friends, and nowhere fastidious or the victim of manias but his own master in everything, and his outward mien cheerful. His long foresight and ordering of the merest trifle without making scenes. The check in his reign put upon organized applause and every form of lip-service; his unceasing watch over the needs of the empire and his stewardship of its resources; his patience under criticism by individuals of such conduct. No superstitious fear of divine powers nor with man any courting of the public or obsequiousness or cultivation of popular favour, but temperance in all things and firmness; nowhere want of taste or search for novelty.|$|E

500|$|One {{factor in}} {{ignoring}} the Code {{was the fact}} that some found such censorship prudish. This was a period in which the Victorian era was sometimes ridiculed as being naïve and backward. When the Code was announced, The Nation, a liberal periodical, attacked it. The publication stated that if crime were never presented in a sympathetic light, then, taken literally, [...] "law" [...] and [...] "justice" [...] would become the same. Therefore, events such as the Boston Tea Party could not be portrayed. And if clergy were <b>always</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> presented positively, then hypocrisy could not be examined either. The Outlook agreed, and, unlike Variety, predicted from the beginning the Code would be difficult to enforce.|$|E

If {{they were going to be}} defeated, the raven did not stir at all, and its limbs hung motionless.|$|E

500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of this job {{is that in a}} week you might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than <b>always</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the kind character. It was good to see those dents in her armour I think".|$|E
500|$|... 1. 'Relative Size: According to Goffman, {{relative}} size can {{be defined}} as “one way in which social weight–power, authority, rank, office, renown- is echoed expressively in social situations through relative size, especially height”. With relative size, women are generally shown smaller or lower than men in terms of girth and height. Although men tend to be biologically taller or larger than females, Goffman suggests that this size difference is manipulated in man-made advertisements to convey difference in status or power in certain social situations. The concept that relative size conveys social status remains relevant even when women are portrayed as the taller or larger individual on screen or in print. Goffman states that on the few occasions when women are pictured taller than men, the men seem almost <b>always</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subordinated in social class status and/or depicted as inferior.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the revelation}} {{at the end}} of the film that Arroway's {{recording}} device recorded approximately 18 hours of static is arguably conclusive proof of the fact of—if not the experience of—her [...] "journey", several coincidences and indications throughout the film cast doubt on its authenticity. Director Robert Zemeckis indicated: [...] "The point of the movie is for there <b>always</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a certain amount of doubt [...]" [...] These indications consist mostly of visual cues during the [...] "journey" [...] that echo Ellie's experiences earlier in the film (which Ellie believed to be the result of the aliens [...] "downloading [...] thoughts and memories"), but the timing of the message's arrival and its eventual decoding are also highly coincidental: the message was first received shortly before Arroway and her team were to be ejected from the VLA facility and was successfully decoded only by S.R. Hadden (Arroway's only sponsor, who was close to death from cancer) after weeks of failed attempts by the team at the VLA.|$|E
500|$|Diarmaid Ferriter {{selected}} {{the book as}} his pick in The Sunday Business Post feature [...] "Authors' choices". Ferriter commented: [...] "Rogan has to be admired for his perseverance and determination {{when it comes to}} chronicling {{the life and times of}} contrary musical giants – having previously tackled Morrissey. Well-researched biography is <b>always</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> encouraged, particularly when dealing with a difficult and elusive character". David Sinclair, author of Wannabe: How The Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fam, reviewed the book for The Guardian, and commented: [...] "Rogan's scrutiny of Morrison's work is undertaken with no less care than that devoted to the details of the singer's life story, and the analysis and appreciation of Morrison's very real accomplishments as a musician provide some welcome ballast to a personal portrayal that is otherwise almost comically unflattering. Rogan's book certainly sheds new light on the life and times of this puzzling and reclusive performer." [...] Sinclair also noted the book takes a negative tone towards some of Morrison's mannerisms, and concluded his review with: [...] "But it may be as well to get hold of a copy before Morrison's legal representatives have had a chance to get out their fine-tooth combs." ...|$|E
