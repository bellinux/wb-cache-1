40|$|AbstractNuclear {{factor of}} {{activated}} T cells (NFAT) {{is a critical}} regulator of early gene transcription in response to TCR-mediated signals. Here, we show that mice lacking both NFATp and NFAT 4 develop a profound lymphoproliferative disorder likely due to a lowered threshold for TCR signaling coupled with increased resistance to apoptosis secondary to defective FasL expression. NFAT mutant mice also have <b>allergic</b> <b>blepharitis,</b> interstitial pneumonitis, and a 103 to 104 fold increase in serum IgG 1 and IgE levels, secondary to a dramatic and selective increase in Th 2 cytokines. This phenotype may be ascribed to unopposed occupancy of the IL- 4 promoter by NFATc. Our data demonstrate that lymphoid homeostasis and Th 2 activation require a critical balance among NFAT family members...|$|E

About 30 % of people suffer from allergic symptoms and 40 %&ndash; 80 % {{of them have}} symptoms in the eyes. Atopic conjunctivitis {{can be divided into}} seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) and perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC). The treatment of SAC is simple; antihistamines, anti-inflammatory agents, or chromoglycate. In severe cases of SAC, subcutaneous or sublingual immunotherapy is helpful. PAC needs longer therapy, often year round, with mast cell stabilizers, antihistamines, and sometimes local steroids. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is a more severe disease showing chronic blepharitis often connected with severe keratitis. It needs, in many cases, continuous treatment of the lid eczema and keratoconjunctivitis. Blepharitis is treated with tacrolimus or pimecrolimus ointment. Conjunctivitis additionally needs corticosteroids and, if needed, cyclosporine A (CsA) drops are administered for longer periods. Basic conjunctival treatment is with mast cell-stabilizing agents and in addition, antihistamines are administered. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is another chronic and serious allergic disease that mainly affects children and young people. It is a long-lasting disease which commonly subsides in puberty. It demands intensive therapy often for many years to avoid serious complicating corneal ulcers. Treatment is mast cell-stabilizing drops and additionally antihistamines. In relapses, corticosteroids are needed. When the use of corticosteroids is continuous, CsA drops should be used, and in relapses, corticosteroids should be used additionally. Nonallergic eosinophilic conjunctivitis (NAEC) is a less known, but rather common, ocular disease. It affects mostly middle-aged and older women. The eye symptoms of NAEC are largely similar to those seen in chronic allergic conjunctivitis. Basic therapy is mast cell-stabilizing drops. Eosinophilic inflammation needs additional corticosteroids. In severe cases, CsA drops are recommended. Antihistamines should be avoided. It is important to recognize the different forms of allergic ocular diseases and to start the treatment early and intensively enough to avoid chronicity of the disease and accompanying tissue destruction.

5000|$|While {{the initial}} patents {{obtained}} by American Cyanamid {{company in the}} late 1970s/ early 1980's for ointment, cream, and lotion formulations have expired, new patents have been obtained for alternative transdermal delivery methods. [...] More recently, however, the drug formulation itself has not been patented but ways to incorporate it into occlusive dressings such as a pressure sensitive adhesive layer as demonstrated by Senju USA, Inc. in 2012 - 2014. Specifically, these new dosage forms target diseases of the eyelid such as <b>blepharitis,</b> <b>allergic</b> conjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and atopic keratoconjunctivitis. [...] This is significant as previous formulations of Amcinonide have not been used to treat ocular inflammations. Patents such as these {{are likely to continue}} to be published as research searches for low cost alternatives to new drugs to increase bioavailability and patient compliance.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{identify}} diagnostic accord and {{disagreement between}} general practitioners and an ophthalmologist and thereby determine how undergraduate and non-specialist postgraduate ophthalmic training could be improved. DESIGN [...] Comparison of diagnosis of presenting conditions by general practitioners and one ophthalmologist in patients consulting general practitioners for ophthalmic problems during March 1989 to February 1990. SETTING [...] 12 general practices in west Nottingham. PATIENTS [...] 1474 patients presenting {{to the study}} general practitioners with new ophthalmic conditions or new episodes of recurrent conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Diagnoses of general practitioners and ophthalmologist. RESULTS [...] 1121 (76 %) of patients with eye problems agreed to see the ophthalmologist and most were seen within three days. Sufficient data for comparison were available on 1103 patients. Diagnostic agreement was found in 638 cases (58 %), but potentially serious misdiagnosis was found in only 15 cases; management in three of these cases would have ensured later identification. Most commonly confused conditions were infective and <b>allergic</b> conjunctivitis, <b>blepharitis,</b> and dry eyes. General practitioners assessed visual acuity in only 114 cases yet eight of the 15 patients seriously misdiagnosed had reduced acuity, an important diagnostic sign. CONCLUSIONS [...] Most ophthalmic disease seen in general practice does not require specialised equipment for diagnosis. Most cases of misdiagnosis have no serious consequences for the patient. Undergraduate and postgraduate training in ophthalmology should ensure that common conditions can be easily differentiated and more serious conditions identified and referred...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Disorders of the {{lacrimal}} {{functional unit}} {{are common in}} ophthalmological practice, with meibomian gland dysfunction, blepharitis, and dry eye forming {{a significant part of}} the general ophthalmologistâ€™s practice. The eyelid and its associated structures form a complex organ designed to protect the fragile corneal surface and improve visual acuity. This organ is subject to a number of disorders, including meibomian gland dysfunction, dry eye syndrome, anterior <b>blepharitis,</b> <b>allergic</b> and dermatological conditions, and disorders associated with contact lens use. Although commonly described separately, disorders of the lacrimal function unit are better considered as a group of interacting pathologies that have inflammatory mediators as a central feature. Eyelid hygiene, in the sense of routine cleansing and massage of the eyelids, is well accepted in the management of many disorders of the eyelid. However, a broader concept of eyelid health may be appropriate, in which eyelid cleansing is but a part of a more complete program of care that includes screening and risk assessment, patient education, and coaching. The ophthalmologist has an important role to play in helping patients persist with routine eyelid care that may be long-term or lifelong. A number of preparations exist to make routine eyelid care both more effective and more pleasant, and might also improve compliance. Several such preparations have been devised, and are being assessed in clinical studies, and appear to be effective and preferred by patients over traditional soap and water or baby shampoo...|$|R

40|$|In all Australian states optometrists are {{permitted}} to use diagnostic topical ocular drugs {{in the practice of}} their profession. In addition, legislation has just been passed in Victoria allowing optometrists to prescribe topical S 4 medications for ocular conditions. Changing optometric legislation to incorporate S 4 ophthalmic agents is a topical issue within optometry. METHODS: By postal survey, we asked Queensland optometrists to gauge their level of education, current mode of practice and whether they were in favour of gaining access to prescription-only therapeutic medications. Their opinions on the education requirements, perceived potential public benefits and the possible barriers to optometrists gaining prescribing rights to therapeutic agents were also investigated. RESULTS: A 45 per cent response rate to the survey (231 responses out of 517) was obtained. The majority of respondents (88 per cent) {{wanted to be able to}} prescribe therapeutic agents. Over 50 per cent considered themselves competent and believed they were capable of treating dry eye, <b>blepharitis,</b> <b>allergic</b> conjunctivitis, corneal abrasions and contact lens induced papillary conjunctivitis. Over 90 per cent would be confident recommending topical lubricants and antihistamines, while 65 per cent felt they were adequately prepared to prescribe topical antibiotics. Education level, in particular the completion of a therapeutic drugs course, was the main factor that determined whether the respondents practised or were willing to practise at a higher level. CONCLUSION: The majority of Queensland optometrists are well aware of the issues surrounding the use of pharmaceutical agents. Many optometrists feel they are well prepared for prescribing ocular therapeutic agent...|$|R
