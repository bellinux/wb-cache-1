5|$|The Diary of <b>a</b> <b>Nobody</b> is an English comic novel {{written by}} the {{brothers}} George and Weedon Grossmith, with illustrations by the latter. It originated as an intermittent serial in Punch magazine in 1888–89 and first appeared in book form, with extended text and added illustrations, in 1892. The Diary records the daily events {{in the lives of}} a London clerk, Charles Pooter, his wife Carrie, his son Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances over a period of 15 months.|$|E
5|$|The Diary of <b>a</b> <b>Nobody</b> was {{the work}} of George Grossmith and his brother Weedon Grossmith, the sons of a court {{reporter}} and part-time stage entertainer, also named George. The younger George followed his father, first as a reporter and later on the stage; the 7-years-younger Weedon studied at the West London School of Art and had some success as a portrait painter before becoming a comic actor. The brothers were fascinated with the stage at an early age. In 1864, at 17 and 10, they hosted a complex programme of musical and dramatic entertainment in their parents' garden at Haverstock Hill. This included a 20-minute burlesque version of Hamlet, in which George played the title role; Weedon was Ophelia.|$|E

5|$|Picard confronts Q, {{who tells}} him that {{although}} the bout with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It taught him that life was too precious to squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore {{the consequences of his}} indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as <b>a</b> <b>nobody.</b> Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart and laughing as he collapses to the floor. In the present, Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, he wonders if his journey into the past was one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Nevertheless, he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him.|$|E

25|$|Ashur-dugul, inscribed maš-šur-du-gul, “Look to (the god) Ashur!”, (c. 1665 BC – c. 1659 BC), apparently, “son of a nobody”, {{seized the}} throne {{from the three}} unpopular Amorite vassals. The Assyrian King List says of Ashur-dugul {{that he was a}} “son of <b>a</b> <b>nobody,</b> without right to the throne” meaning that he was not of royal descent and {{consequently}} unqualified to govern according to the patrilineal principle of legitimacy relied upon by later monarchs. During Ashur-dugul's reign six other kings, “sons of nobodies also ruled at the time”. This may suggest a fragmentation in the small Assyrian kingdom, with rival claims to the throne. Ashur-dugul was unable to retain control for long, and was soon deposed by a rival claimant, Ashur-apla-idi.|$|E
25|$|Soon after {{appearing}} in Kingdom Hearts II at Hollow Bastion {{with the other}} Organization XIII members, he is assigned to look over Sora's progress in the Organization's plan, much to his chagrin. Demyx confronts Sora in the Underworld of Olympus Coliseum, stealing a medallion called the Olympus Stone {{to protect him from}} the Underworld's energy-reducing curse. After attempting to talk to Roxas through Sora, Demyx pits him against his water copies, and leaves after losing. Demyx later crosses paths with the protagonists again at Hollow Bastion, and battles them after they enrage him by mocking his nature as <b>a</b> <b>Nobody,</b> but is defeated and fades into darkness. In his first chronological appearance in 358/2 Days, Demyx reluctantly participates in the missions Saix assigns to him out of fear of what Xemnas could do to him.|$|E

25|$|Burnand's last stage {{works were}} a {{collaboration}} with J. Hickory Wood, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1905, on a pantomime of Cinderella, {{and he was}} partly responsible for a pantomime of Aladdin for the same theatre in 1909. His later contributions to Punch became increasingly wordy and anecdotal, relying on far-fetched puns, {{but he was a}} good judge of talent, and under him the paper prospered. Stedman rates as a high point of his editorship the publication of The Diary of <b>a</b> <b>Nobody</b> by the brothers George and Weedon Grossmith, which was soon turned into book form and has never been out of print. He was reluctant to retire, but was persuaded to do so in 1906, and was succeeded by Owen Seaman. In 1908, Burnand became the editor of The Catholic Who's Who, published by Burns & Oates.|$|E
25|$|After {{earning a}} contract, {{he made his}} TV debut as The Kamikaze Kid on Monday Night Raw on May 3, losing to Doink the Clown. He quickly became The Cannonball Kid, then simply The Kid. After several weeks as a jobber, he scored an upset pinfall on Razor Ramon on the May 17 episode of Monday Night Raw, thus {{becoming}} The 1–2–3 Kid. Razor challenged him to a rematch, wagering $10,000 of his own money. Kid accepted the challenge, but grabbed the money and ran from the arena during the match. Ted DiBiase, who was feuding with Razor, taunted him over losing to <b>a</b> <b>nobody.</b> This angered Kid, {{and led to a}} match in which he upset DiBiase as well. Razor turned face shortly after and took Kid under his wing. The 1–2–3 Kid made his pay-per-view debut at SummerSlam, losing to DiBiase's tag partner Irwin R. Schyster after Razor had defeated DiBiase. At Survivor Series, Kid was on Razor's team in a four-on-four elimination match. He and Marty Jannetty were the sole survivors, which led to them forming a tag team and holding the Tag Team Championship for a week in January 1994 after beating The Quebecers.|$|E
500|$|Grossmith is {{best remembered}} for {{two aspects of}} his career. First, he created a series of nine memorable {{characters}} in the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan from 1877 to 1889, including Sir Joseph Porter, in H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), the Major-General in The Pirates of Penzance (1880) and Ko-Ko in The Mikado (1885–87). [...] Second, he wrote, in collaboration with his brother Weedon, the 1892 comic novel The Diary of <b>a</b> <b>Nobody.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1892, Grossmith {{collaborated with}} his brother Weedon Grossmith to expand a series of amusing columns they had written in 1888–89 for Punch. The Diary of <b>a</b> <b>Nobody</b> was {{published}} as a novel {{and has never been}} out of print since. [...] The book is a sharp analysis of social insecurity, and Charles Pooter of The Laurels, Brickfield Terrace, Holloway, was immediately recognised {{as one of the great}} comic characters of English literature. [...] The work has itself been the object of dramatisation and adaptation, including three times for television: 1964, 1979 and 2007.|$|E

[...] After receiving many abusive messages from Brown's fans after posting the comment, he later tweeted, [...] "I don't care that you call me <b>a</b> <b>nobody.</b> Stealing is still stealing, doesn't matter who you are!...Because Chris Brown is an international celebrity doesn't make it OK to rip off a guy from [...] UK not many people have heard of." ...|$|E

[...] "In those days I was <b>a</b> <b>nobody,</b> not earning a penny and after being made to sit on the bench all season I just wanted to get away and play with my friends" [...] he said. [...] "But my dad always supported me and cheered me up until my career turned round." [...] He went on to begin his footballing career at UP Langreo and when he turned 17 he joined the Mareo football school.|$|E

500|$|Keith Waterhouse's Mrs Pooter's Diary of 1983 is an {{adaptation}} of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter. In 1996 Helen Fielding used the imaginary diary format for Bridget Jones's Diary, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life. The New York Times critic wrote that it [...] "captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to {{be all things to}} all men." [...] This diary began as a weekly column in The Independent, and was later published in books which sold more than 15 million copies in 40 countries. In the 1990s the satirical magazine Private Eye lampooned John Major, British prime minister 1990–97, in [...] "The Secret Diary of John Major aged 47", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with The Diary of <b>a</b> <b>Nobody,</b> which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.|$|E
500|$|Roxas is {{depicted}} as a spiky blond-haired boy with blue eyes. Due to his nature as <b>a</b> <b>Nobody,</b> he is an [...] "empty shell" [...] of series' protagonist Sora created when the latter sacrifices his heart and becomes a Heartless during the events of Kingdom Hearts. As a result, despite his teenage appearance, Roxas is one day short of a year old when he rejoins Sora in Kingdom Hearts II. As a civilian, he wears a white jacket over a black one and white trousers. As a member of Organization XIII, Roxas wears a hooded black coat that covers most of his body. His weapon is the Keyblade known as , resembling a classic skeleton key with a long silver keychain extending from the hilt, and a Mickey Mouse token {{on the end of}} it. However, the player can modify it during Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days using the game's panel system. Roxas also becomes able to dual-wield Keyblades after leaving the Organization, and exclusively uses the weapon's [...] and [...] forms for each.|$|E
500|$|Film critic Baradwaj Rangan {{finds the}} {{sequence}} where Haasan's character, Cheenu, narrates {{the story of}} The Blue Jackal to Sridevi's character, Bhagyalakshmi, to be a distant echo of the arc negotiated by Cheenu: [...] "He is, after all, <b>a</b> <b>nobody</b> [...] who, through a salubrious twist of fate, becomes the ruler of a woman's life, until he is restored, at the end, to the nobody he was, a fraudulent claimant to her emotions." [...] In his book Dispatches from the wall corner: A journey through Indian cinema, Rangan says that although Haasan is inspired by Marlon Brando, the scene where Haasan burns himself while cooking and vents his anger on Sridevi, {{is reminiscent of the}} acting style of Marcel Marceau. In another book of Rangan, Conversations with Mani Ratnam, he states that in the scene where Cheenu enters Bhagyalakshmi's room in the brothel, there was fumbling and embarrassment, whereas in another Haasan film Nayakan (1987), Haasan's character, Velu Nayakar, behaves as if he has visited a brothel before. Nayakans director Mani Ratnam replied by saying that the two scenes are very different from one another and that it [...] "can't be played the same way".|$|E
