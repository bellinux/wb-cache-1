50|$|Generally, an {{application}} of divorce involves submitting the population registration certificates of both parties, together with the payment of {{an application}} fee of 450 krona. Additionally, a standard form must be completed and filed to the District Court {{where one of the}} partners is domiciled. Domicile in this context means the place where one was registered for population purposes. Where neither of the partners is domiciled in Sweden, the application must be made to Stockholm District Court. Complications usually arise where spouses of different nationalities are involved. In such instances, there are special rules that will dictate when a Swedish court is competent to deal with the <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>divorce.</b>|$|R

50|$|Albany {{finally arrived}} back in Scotland in November 1521 and was warmly {{received}} by Margaret. It was soon rumoured that their cordial relations embraced more than politics. Angus went into exile while the Regent — {{with the full}} cooperation of the Queen-Dowager — set about restoring order to a country riven by three years of intense factional conflict. Albany was useful to Margaret: {{he was known to}} have influence in Rome, which would help ease her <b>application</b> <b>for</b> a <b>divorce.</b> Angus and his allies spread the rumour that the two were lovers, to such effect that even the sober-headed Lord Dacre wrote to Wolsey, predicting that James would be murdered and Albany would become king and marry Margaret.

40|$|By {{amending}} the Family Code {{according to the}} provisions of the Law no. 202 / 2010 regarding some measures in order to speed the solving of processes (“Law of small reform”), representing the introduction to the New Civil Code adopted by the Law no. 287 / 2009, published in the Official Gazette no. 511 of July 24, 2009, being to become effective, is inserted {{for the first time the}} possibility to end the marital relations also before the registrar of births, marriages and deaths or notary public, in strict terms of law. For instance, if there was an agreement between the spouses, without minor children, born during the marriage or adopted, the legislator sets up the possibility to evade the contentious proceeding before the common law courts and allows the spouses to choose between the administrative procedure and the notary procedure in order to dissolve the marriage. In other words, is legislated the possibility of spouses to cease the marital relations also by mutual agreement, like at the time of their marriage, ascertained by the registrar of births, marriages and deaths or notary public. Therefore, on the one hand, is expressed the principle of legal symmetry in this matter, in terms of recognition regarding the ascertaining of the existence of mutual agreement, without the intervention of the magistrate, according to the maxim “mutuus consensus, mutuus dissensus”. On the other hand, legitimately, the legislator has in view to eliminate the settlement of the <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>divorce</b> by the courts, given that there is the convergence of spouses’ will and no minor child, for the purpose of relieving the courts, a solution that seems quite logical considering that the settlement of such case does not require the jurisdictional work. As a conclusion, an analysis of the new vision of the legislator as regards the settlement of divorce by notary non-contentious procedure is absolutely necessary given that the New Civil Code reintegrates {{the provisions of the}} Family Code in the spirit of the unitary conception of the Romanian pre-war private law school...|$|R
