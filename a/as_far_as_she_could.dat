5|$|Ana Po'uhila {{participated in}} the women's shot put on the behalf of Tonga at the Beijing Olympics, and was the only female athlete {{competing}} for Tonga at the 2008 Olympic games. She was born in Nuku'alofa, the national capital, which lies on the primary Tongan island of Tongatapu. Po'uhila first {{participated in the}} Olympics at age 24, when she represented Tonga in shot put at the 2004 Athens games. She represented Tonga again in Beijing {{at the age of}} 32. During the qualifying heat of her event, which took place on August 15, the Tongan field athlete was placed in the seventeen-person second heat. Po'uhila was given three attempts to put the shot <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> During the first attempt, she lobbed the shot 16.21meters, ranking 12th in her heat. She bested this ranking on her second attempt when she lobbed it 16.42meters, ranking seventh amongst those who threw during the second try. Her third and final attempt, 16.35meters, did not beat her second attempt. Using her best mark, 16.42meters, Po'uhila placed 12th out of the 16 athletes who finished the event. She ranked ahead of Taiwan's Lin Chia-Ying (16.32meters) and behind Russia's Irina Khudoroshkina (16.84meters) in a heat led by China's Gong Lijiao (19.46meters) and Belarus' Nadzeya Ostapchuk (19.08meters). Of the 33 athletes who finished the event, Ana Po'uhila ranked 27th. She did not advance to the final round.|$|E
25|$|Theosophy and spiritualism {{were both}} very popular metaphysical {{schools of thought}} {{especially}} in the early 20th century and thus were always clashing in their different beliefs. Madame Blavatsky was critical of spiritualism; she distanced theosophy from spiritualism <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> and allied herself with eastern occultism.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{agreed to}} return {{for a few days}} in 1988 to finish off Daphne's storyline. This time, the actress asked for her {{character}} to be killed off. Smith told Robyn Harvey from The Sydney Morning Herald, [...] "I wanted Daphne to die. I didn't want to be stuck in a television series {{for the rest of my}} life. I'd taken Daphne <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go. She's run the gamut of every life experience she could possibly have. I'd had enough." [...] Daphne was critically injured during a car crash on the way to her father's funeral and she was left in a coma. Off-screen, representatives from the serial's production company tried to persuade Smith to sign a new contract, but she refused. Daphne briefly regained consciousness to say [...] "I love you Clarkey" [...] to Des, before becoming the first regular character to die.|$|E

500|$|... ʻAna Poʻuhila was {{the oldest}} person (and the sole female athlete) to take part for Tonga at the London Olympic Games {{at the age of}} 32. She had participated in the {{previous}} two Olympic Games in Athens and Beijing. Po'uhila gained entry into the Games by meeting qualification standards because her best throw of 16.40 metres, set at the 2011 Pacific Games, was 0.90 metres better than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for the women's shot put competition. [...] She spent time in Auckland preparing for the Games. During the qualifying heat of her event, which took place on 7 August, the Tongan field athlete was placed in the sixteen-person second heat. Po'uhila was given three attempts to put the shot <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> During the first attempt, she lobbed the shot 15.80 metres, ranking 14th in her heat. Po'uhila was unable to best the ranking on her ranking when she lobbed it 15.75 metres, placing 11th amongst those who threw during the second try. Her third and final attempt, 15.11 metres, did not beat her first attempt. Using her best mark, 15.80 metres, Po'uhila placed 29th out of 30 athletes who completed the event. She finished ahead of Elena Smolyanova of Uzbekistan (14.42 metres) but behind Taiwan's Lin Chia-ying (17.43 metres) in a heat led by Yevgeniya Kolodko of Russia (19.31 metres).

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of Season 16, Romana begins to take {{on some of the}} {{characteristics}} of the screaming [...] "damsel in distress", which reinforced Tamm's decision not to remain in the role as she felt the character had been taken <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go. As a result, Romana regenerates at the start of Season 17, emerging with a different physical appearance and a lighter personality.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hem!" [...] said Tanner: [...] "I do {{not know}} that I do very much," [...] and he whispered to his wife. Sybil removed from them <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was able.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was his money, perhaps, that Mrs Roper {{got from}} Lupex {{the day before}} yesterday. If so, {{it comes to the}} same thing <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is concerned, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If--hum--it came to {{the other}} thing," [...] said Mr. Paramor, [...] "the settlement's at an end <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> 's concerned. We 're bound to look at every case, you know, old boy." ...|$|R
60|$|The magpie listened, hopped awhile from {{branch to}} branch, and then darted away, the princess {{watching}} him anxiously <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see.|$|E
60|$|However, Gwendolen soon reappeared, {{showing her}} usual spirits, and evidently {{determined}} to ignore <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> the striking change {{she had made}} {{in the part of}} Hermione.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think it}} is,' said Picotee outside, {{stretching}} her neck forward <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> 'No, {{it is the}} men on the beach dragging up their boats; they expect wind to-night.' ...|$|E
60|$|David and Dwight laughed, {{and so in}} fact did Caleb; and Madam Rachel {{then said}} that if he would tell David and Dwight the story <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had gone, she would finish it.|$|R
60|$|Bland {{supposed}} {{this was}} <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> ventured in allusion to her widowed state; but, stirred {{as he was}} by her implied submission, it struck him <b>as</b> significant that <b>she</b> should so clearly recognize the restrictions conventionality imposed on her.|$|R
60|$|Eleanor {{assured her}} father that, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was concerned, she could leave {{her house and}} her ponies without a single regret. She was only so happy that he was going--going where he would escape all this dreadful turmoil.|$|R
60|$|To put {{the matter}} in this {{negative}} way was <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> possibly go. It was {{for him to make}} the positive proposal to which she had thus thrown wide the door.|$|E
6000|$|It was <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get. There was a pause; his intellect was {{struggling}} to comprehend; presently it did manage to catch the idea in time to save embarrassment all around, and he said gratefully-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Jerry {{poked her}} head <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> out of the window. [...] "Miss Ponsonby, {{you are going to}} the dance," [...] she said in a {{cautious}} undertone, [...] "so don't cry any more or your eyes will be dreadfully red." ...|$|E
60|$|She watched Tom {{through the}} glass door all the morning {{to see if he}} read the letter, and betrayed any emotion at its contents: but Tom went about his {{business}} <b>as</b> usual, and, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> saw, never read it at all.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a sudden}} silence, for the door opened; but it was to admit Miss Mohun, who began, 'Oh! Rotherwood, you are too munificent. Why, what's the matter?' Lady Merrifield hastily explained, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> yet understood, what had brought him.|$|R
25|$|At Acremant's {{trial in}} 2007, 33-year-old Kosova testified she had indeed cut off their relationship, {{which began in}} April 1995, in August of the same year. She {{confirmed}} {{that they had a}} relationship, but said that it was purely financial in nature <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was concerned.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had hoped}} for an answer here--for {{a few words to}} say that her conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual tone, he said, ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. MARCHMONT. Well, we are {{not going}} to praise her. I hear she went to the Opera on Monday night, and told Tommy Rufford at supper that, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see, London Society was entirely made up of dowdies and dandies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Signora," [...] he said, {{turning to}} the q-b. She did not like him, he was impudent, and she shut a deaf ear to him <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> [...] "Signora," [...] he said, [...] "do you {{understand}} me what I say?" ...|$|E
60|$|II. Upon {{discovering}} {{it to his}} wife, {{or rather}} her drawing the discovery from him by her importunity, she immediately, and most readily and cheerfully, enters into measures to retrench her expenses, and, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was able, to prevent the blow, which was otherwise apparent and unavoidable.|$|R
2500|$|Oliver {{had finally}} {{told her that}} he wasn't a real count, but she didn't care (it was clear she never cared about him) and thusly didn't believe her husband's words, believing that he had been called [...] "Count" [...] in Paris, that MADE him the Count, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was concerned.|$|R
60|$|By these tidings Hannah was {{of course}} prostrated, and driven {{into a state of}} {{excitement}} that was not without its pleasantness <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was concerned. Of course she objected that the last will must be the real will, and in this way the matter came to full discussion between them.|$|R
60|$|He {{held out}} the warm deerhide garment, and the girl flashed a covert glance at him. He stood close by her in loose blue shirt and thin duck trousers, and, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see by the moonlight, his face was pinched and blue with cold.|$|E
6000|$|She went, and she saw, but she didn't see Bob! And he wasn't in {{the next}} room, or in any bed in the house, or under any bed, or {{anywhere}} at all, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see; and so, pretty soon, there was a nice hubbub in that house! ...|$|E
60|$|She {{took with}} him the tone that elderly people use with those older than {{themselves}} who have begun to break; there were authority and patronage in it. At {{the bottom of her}} heart she thought that Bromfield Corey should not have been allowed to come; but she determined to keep him safe and harmless <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E
60|$|Yet, observe, with {{exquisite}} accuracy <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> reaches. There {{is a wide}} {{difference between}} elementary knowledge and superficial knowledge--between a firm beginning, and an infirm attempt at compassing. A woman may always help her husband by what she knows, however little; by what she half-knows, or mis-knows, she will only tease him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly do I rejoice!" [...] said Christina, {{wishing she}} could convey to him how welcome {{he had been}} to marry any one he liked, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was concerned--he, in whom her fears of mincing goldsmiths had always taken form--then signing with her hand, [...] "I have my sons {{likewise}} to show her." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} was answered for him, and so oppressed was he by the grayness {{of life that}} he forgot the tentative proposition she had made {{for him to go}} to work. And <b>she,</b> having gone <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> dared, was willing to wait the answer till she should bring the question up again.|$|R
