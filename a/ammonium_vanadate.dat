The optimum conditions for the colorimetric measurements were worked out (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Development of the color was carried out by addition of <b>ammonium</b> <b>vanadate</b> and concentrated hydrochloric acid to the acetone extract of capsaicin, as like the method of Fordor. The color intensity was measured 6 minutes after the development of the color, using the S 72 -filter (Pulfrich photometer) and the amount of the capsaicin involved was determined from the standard curve (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The measurements were well reproducible with probable error of about 4 /o. The method of North, recently reported, gives usually low value of capsaicin, _ probably because of the complicated treatment of separation of row capsaicin from other phenolic methoxy-compounds.

40|$|ABSTRACT Friend murine {{erythroleukemia}} cells underwent apparently normal erythropoiesis when {{treated with}} dimethyl sulfoxide. One {{of the earliest}} events associated with this induction was a decrease in ouabain sensitive 86 Rb+ uptake, an assay of the plasma membrane Na, K(ATPase). <b>Ammonium</b> <b>vanadate</b> (10 /~M) blocked differentiation of these cells without affecting cell viability. Vanadium was taken up by Friend cells and prevented the dimethyl sulfoxide-induced decrease in ouabain sensitive 86 Rb+ uptake. Vanadate reactivated 86 Rb+ transport previously inhibited by dimethyl sulfoxide treatment but had no affect on 86 Rb+ transport in untreated cells. These results suggest an essential role for the (Na,K) ATPase in cell differentiation. Friend murine erythroleukemia cells grow indefinitely in suspension but may be induced to terminally differentiate by {{a wide variety of}} drugs, including dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO'). One of the earliest events associated with induction is a decrease in ouabain sensitive SrRb+ uptake, an assay of the plasma membrane (Na, K) ATPase (1, 2). This event appears to be the rate limiting step in commitment since pretreatment of cells with ouabain prior to adding DMSO accelerates commitment to erythropoiesis by eliminating a characteristic lag time (2). In some cells lines, ouabain alone will induce erythropoiesis (3). To further characterize the role of the (Na,K) ATPase in Friend cell differentiation we have investigated the effects of vanadate on this system. Vanadate is a potent (Na,K) ATPase inhibitor in vitro (4) but has been reported to activate this enzyme in certain hormone sensitive tissues (5). Here we show that addition of 10 - 20 uM <b>ammonium</b> <b>vanadate</b> to Friend cell cultures completely blocks differentiation.

Electron microscopic studies of the hybrid reveal that the VO 2 (B) nanotubes are wrapped by and trapped between graphene sheets. The hybrid shows potential to be a high capacity cathode material for lithium ion batteries. It exhibits a high capacity (similar to 450 mAh/g) and cycling stability. The high capacity of the hybrid is attributed to the interaction between the graphene sheets and the VO 2 (B) tubes which improves the charge-transfer.

Though the observed capacity of this material was quite satisfactory, the rate capability was not. To improve the rate capability we wanted to prepare a graphene-VO 2 (B) hybrid in which the VO 2 (B) would be built on 2 D nanosheets that would enable better electrode-electrolyte contact.

Reactivity of alpha-Sb 2 O 3 (senarmontite) towards oxidation is significantly enhanced after recirculating its suspension in a magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) system. This inspired the MHD synthesis of a molybdenum-vanadiumantimony mixed oxide with superior catalytic activity for selective partial oxidation of isobutane. Traditionally these mixed oxides are synthesized via sol-gel processes involving complexing agents and/or costly alkoxides.

On the other hand, the catalysts prepared from pentavalent vanadium sources showed lower activity owing to the smaller amounts of vanadium in the matrix. Although the activity of the catalyst slightly decreased after first recycle as due to leaching of small amounts of active vanadium species, it however remained nearly the same even after several recycles. This was further confirmed by washing experiments wherein non-framework vanadium ions were removed upon ammonium acetate treatment; the washed catalysts showed a similar activity to those of the recycled catalysts.

The density functional theory (DFT) calculated Gibbs free energy of reaction 2 (VO) -O-V(OEt) (L- 4) ] + H 2 O reversible arrow ((VOL 4) -O-V) (2) -mu-O] + 2 EtOH is only 2 - 3 kcal mol(- 1), indicating that the dinuclear complexes may form in a significant amount. The electrochemical behavior of the complexes is investigated by cyclic voltammetry, with the V-V-V-IV E- 1 / 2 (red) values being in the range 0. 27 - 0. 44 V (vs SCE). Upon controlled potential electrolysis, the corresponding (L) (O) V-IV-O-V-V(O) (L) mixed-valence species are obtained upon partial reduction of the ((VOL) -O-V) (2) -mu-O] complexes formed in solution, and some spectroscopic characteristics of these dinuclear mixed-valence complexes are investigated using DFT calculations and by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), with the formation of V-IV-O-V-V species being confirmed by the observation of a 15 -line pattern in the EPR spectra at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} mono- and oligonuclear vanadium(V) and vanadium(IV) {{complexes}} containing various chelating N,O-, N 3 -, and O 2 -ligands have been prepared. The biphasic reaction of an aqueous solution of <b>ammonium</b> <b>vanadate</b> and a dichloromethane solution of hexamethylphosphoramide (hmpa) and pyrazine- 2 -carboxylic acid (pcaH) or pyrazine- 2, 5 -dicarboxylic acid (pdcaH 2) or pyridine- 2, 5 -dicarboxylic acid (pycaH 2) yields yellow crystals of [VO 2 (pca) (hmpa) ] (1), [(VO 2) 2 (pdca) (hmpa) 2] (2), and [VO 2 (pycaH) (hmpa) ] (3), respectively. The single-crystal X-ray structure analyses reveal 1 and 3 to be mononuclear vanadium(V) complexes, {{in which a}} VO 2 unit coordinates to one nitrogen and one oxygen atom of a pca or pycaH chelating ligand, and 2 to be a dinuclear vanadium(V) complex, in which two VO 2 units are coordinated through one nitrogen and one oxygen atom of a pdca bridging ligand; in the three complexes the vanadium atoms also coordinate to the oxygen atom of a hmpa ligand. The reaction of N,N,N′,N′ -tetrakis(2 -benzimidazolylmethyl) - 2 -hydroxo- 1, 3 -diaminopropane (hptbH) and VOSO 4 in methanol gives the cationic complex [(VO) 4 (hptb) 2 (μ-O) ] 4 + (4), which can be crystallized as the perchlorate salt. In this tetranuclear complex, two dinuclear vanadium(IV) units are held together by a μ-oxo bridge. The known complex [VOCl 2 (tmtacn) ] (5) was synthesized from the reaction of 1, 4, 7 -trimethyl- 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane (tmtacn) and VCl 3 in acetonitrile; the reaction of tetrabutylammonium vanadate with pyro -cathecol (catH 2) in acetonitrile gives the known anionic complex [V(cat) 3] − (6), in which the vanadium(V) center is bonded to three cat chelating ligands through the oxygen atoms, obtained as the tetrabutylammonium salt. All compounds synthesized are highly efficient oxidation catalysts for the reaction of cyclohexane with air and hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence of}} four equivalents of pcaH per vanadium, although the catalytic activity of the complexes containing bulky chelating ligands 4 and 5 is somewhat lower in the initial period of the reaction. During this period the active species are formed from the complexes and final turnover numbers are high. The catecholate ligands of complex 6 may reduce from V(V) to V(IV) {{in the beginning of the}} process, thus providing very high initial oxidation rates...|$|E
40|$|Simple, accurate, {{sensitive}} and selective spectrofluorimetric, atomic absorption spectrometric and spectrophotometric methods are described for the quantitative determination of ten fluoroquinolones (amifloxacin, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, difloxacin hydrochloride, enoxacin, enrofloxacin, lomefloxacin hydrochloride, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin mesylate). The first method was a spectrofluorimetric method in which {{samples of the}} studied drugs in 0. 1 N H 2 SO 4 showed native fluorescence at 450 nm when excitation was at 290 nm. The calibration graph was rectilinear from 0. 3 - 1. 4 &# 956;g mL - 1 (method I). Cobalt sulphate was used for precipitation of the ion associates formed from the reaction with the cited drugs. The formation and solubility of the solid complexes at the optimum conditions of pH and ionic strength values have been studied. The method depends on direct determination of the ions in the precipitate or indirect determination of the ions in the filtrate by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The optimum conditions for precipitation were carefully studied. Rectilinear calibration graphs were obtained {{in the range of}} 3 - 30 &# 956;g mL - 1 for each of the investigated drugs. The molar ratios of the formed chelats were determined by Job's method and their association constants were also calculated (method II). <b>Ammonium</b> <b>vanadate</b> was used for the spectrophotometric determination of the selected fluoroquinolones by oxidation in sulphuric acid medium resulting {{in the development of a}} greenish blue colour measured at 766 nm which was attributed to the vanadium (IV) produced by reduction of vanadium (V) by the selected drugs. The optimum conditions for heating time, reagent concentration and sulphuric acid concentration were carefully studied. The accuracy and precision of the proposed method was confirmed by estimating five or six replicates within Beer's law limits were obtained in the range 10 - 40 &# 956;g mL - 1 for each of the investigated drugs with correlation coefficients not less than 0. 9994 for the investigated drugs (method III). The developed spectrofluorimetric, atomic absorption spectrometric and spectrophotometric methods were applied successfully for the determination of the studied drugs in their pharmaceutical dosage forms with a good precision and accuracy compared to official and reported methods as revealed by t-and F-tests. The first method was approximately ten times more sensitive than the second and third methods. Atomic absorption spectrometric method was also applied for the determination of studied drugs in spiked urine and plasma samples...|$|E
40|$|Douglas Buttrey, Ph. DMo-V-Nb-Te-O {{mixed metal}} oxides are the most {{efficient}} catalysts for new alkane-fed processes leading to some important C 2 and C 3 compounds in the chemical industry, such as ethylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile [1]. The purpose {{of this research is}} to study factors influencing the morphology of the orthorhombic M 1 phase catalyst. Control of the crystallite dimensions of the desired catalyst phase, M 1, requires control of composition and impurity phase content. The M 1 phase was synthesized by mixing <b>ammonium</b> <b>vanadate,</b> ammonium heptamolybdate, telluric acid, and ammonium niobium oxalate in sequence, similar to a procedure used earlier by PhD student Xin Li [2, 3]. The M 1 phase was observed for calcination temperatures between 575 °C and 625 °C and for several starting compositions. The lower V/Mo ratios, longer calcination times, or close proximity to the limits of calcination temperature produced higher-purity crystalline M 1 phase, as long as all conditions fall within reasonable ranges. Higher calcination temperatures resulted in increased crystal size along the c-axis. One of our goals is to obtain crystallites with small dimension along c-axis, but large dimensions perpendicular to c-axis, since the catalytically active surface is oriented perpendicular to c-axis. For this reason, reducing the c/ab_average ratio is a priority. Under the same element ratio, pH, and argon calcination time, 550 °C argon calcination is found to be near optimal to approach the goal. For temperatures below 500 °C, for the calcination temperature, the Mo-V-Nb-Te-O {{mixed metal oxides}} did not crystalize very well. The pentagonal ring building-blocks found in the M 1 phase do not fully self-assemble if the calcination temperature is too low or if there is insufficient time for growth; they exist only as disordered clusters [4]. These disordered products are much less active than the well-ordered orthorhombic M 1 phase. Increasing the calcination time up to 96 h for this sample did not result in a well-ordered orthorhombic M 1 structure. Without adjusting the precursor solution pH, all samples prepared to date contain the desired M 1 phase along with another phase, known as M 2, as pseudo-hexagonal tungsten bronze-type (HTB-type) impurity. The M 1 phase cannot be crystallized from precursor solutions with pH above about 3. 5. For precursor solutions with pH < 2, the product becomes highly sintered after calcination and likely does not contain the M 1 phase. The sample could not be ground into powder for XRD analysis, so the phase content has not yet been characterized. It appears that the M 1 phase is only stable within the pH range 2. 8 - 3. 5.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} a soil fungal community of contaminated agricultural soils and to test the growth response of selected species to the toxic metal vanadium. Physico-chemical analysis was performed on contaminated soils that lay under maize and wheat crops in the Valle Latina (southern Lazio, Italy). The Valle Latina {{is one of the}} 57 sites of national interest (S. I. N.). It’s a high environmental risk area due to its industrial sites, waste landfills and agricultural activities and the environmental contamination of hexachlorocyclohexane, an anthropogenic pollutant. Moreover, natural background high level of potentially toxic elements due to volcanic rocks (pyroclastic deposits) occurs in this area in which several elements, including vanadium, thallium and beryllium exceed the threshold values established by Italian legislation, as well. The soil community of saprotrophic fungi of contaminated agricultural soils near the Sacco River have been studied. Contrary to expectations, the community was found to be rich in fungal species (150 species in total), although the typical Penicillium and Aspergillus species components were poorly represented. Species, reported to be tolerant/resistant to heavy metals in the literature and potentially useful in bioremediation, were found. The occurrence of these may be taken as a potential bioindicator of environmental pollution. Vanadium, one of the elements which exceed threshold values, was chosen as metal to test fungi tolerance. In the last decades, evidence in increasing of the environmental levels of vanadium, has raised concern over its release into the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources of which hydrocarbon fuel combustion is the most important. Burning of fossil fuels caused about 110000 t V/a to enter the atmosphere globally (Manfred, 2004). Vanadium is essential for several species of green algae, fungi and nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, as well. We selected six species : Aspergillus terreus Tiegh., Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen.) G. A. de Vries, Clonostachys rosea (Preuss) Mussat, Paecilomyces lilacinus (Thom) Samson, Penicillum citrinum Sopp and Rhizopus arrhizus Fischer, among isolated species, reported to be tolerant/resistant to heavy metals in the literature, and examined the growth response by inoculating them with malt extract agar amended with <b>ammonium</b> <b>vanadate</b> at concentrations of 1, 2, 3 and 6 mM to simulate potential environmental concentrations. Metal tolerance was assessed in all samples by means of growth measurements, tolerance index, scanning electron microscopy, electron dispersion spectroscopy and biomass metal concentrations. Results revealed that all the fungi tested tolerated 6 mM concentrations, Clonostachys rosea and Rhizopus arrhizus being the most tolerant. Soil fungi tolerance to natural metal occurrence may explain their tolerance to anthropogenic contamination. Therefore results of this research can contribute to enhance knowledge on the potential use of these fungal species for mycoremediation purposes in polluted sites...|$|E
40|$|The {{phosphorylation}} {{and cell}} adhesion properties of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) isoforms were investigated. MAG {{is a member}} of the immunoglobulin supergene family and is thought to mediate interactions between myelinating glial cells and neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Two isoforms of MAG exist, L-MAG and S-MAG, which exhibit differential expression patterns. Using retroviral infection and transfection of the cDNAs encoding L-MAG and S-MAG, L cell fibroblasts and NIH 3 T 3 cell lines that express either isoform were generated. The expression of both isoforms on the cell surface of L cells induced the cells to aggregate in a MAG-dependent fashion. The adhesion phenomenon was determined to be calcium and temperature independent. A critical level of cell surface MAG expression was required for cell aggregation to occur. The adhesion was found to be heterotypic in nature, signifying the presence of a MAG receptor on the cell surface of L cells. The MAG isoforms are identical in their extracellular and transmembrane domains. They share a common region in their cytoplasmic domain, but are distinct at their carboxyl termini. The unique carboxyl tails are comprised of 54 amino acids in L-MAG and 10 residues in S-MAG. Both isoforms were determined to be phosphorylated in fibroblasts. L-MAG exhibited phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. The phosphorylation on tyrosine was augmented by treatment of cells with <b>ammonium</b> <b>vanadate.</b> S-MAG phosphorylation occurred mainly on serine residues, but some phosphotyrosine was also detected. The phosphorylation of S-MAG, however, was relatively insensitive to vanadate treatment. Tryptic digest analysis showed that two serine and the major tyrosine phosphorylation site in MAG were identical in L-MAG and S-MAG. The major tyrosine phosphorylation site in MAG was, thus, identified as tyrosine 558. This tyrosine residue is homologous to the major tyrosine phosphorylation site in the fibronectin receptor, integrin. A similar phosphorylation pattern of L-MAG was observed in primary rat oligodendrocytes. Determination of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation revealed that phosphorylation of L-MAG was at least one order of magnitude greater than S-MAG, especially with respect to tyrosine phosphorylation. This result indicates the presence of a carboxyl terminal sequence unique to L-MAG that activates the phosphorylation of tyrosine 558. This region may represent docking sites for protein tyrosine kinase binding, making L-MAG-kinase interactions more efficient. Two populations of L-MAG molecules were discovered: those that are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, and those that exhibit serine/threonine phosphorylation. In effect, tyrosine phosphorylation precludes serine/threonine phosphorylation, suggesting that the alternatively phosphorylated L-MAG molecules perform different functions. Increasing the tyrosine phosphorylation of MAG had no detectable effect on the cell adhesion behaviour of the cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of L-MAG, however, induced its capacity to bind the SH 2 domain of phospholipase C-gamma. Therefore, L-MAG has the potential to interact with a variety of signalling molecules via its cytoplasmic domain. While L-MAG may participate in signal transduction pathways, S-MAG may function in a more restricted manner and perform only as a cell adhesion molecule. Thus, the differential regulation of MAG isoform expression may serve to increase the repertoire of MAG functions at specific times during development...|$|E
