5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> had in recent nights.|$|E

5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} or seizures {{are typically}} denied a pilot license. In Canada if <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> {{had no more}} than one seizure, they may be considered after five years for a limited license if all other testing is normal. Those with febrile seizures and drug related seizures may also be considered. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration does not allow those with epilepsy to get a commercial pilot license. Rarely, exceptions can be made for persons who have had an isolated seizure or febrile seizures and have remained free of seizures into adulthood without medication. In the United Kingdom, a full national private pilot license requires the same standards as a professional driver's license. This requires a period of ten years without seizures while off medications. Those who do not meet this requirement may acquire a restricted license if free from seizures for five years.|$|E

The result supported the hypotheses and indicated that the higher belief in a just world <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>had,</b> the more likely he assumed this punishment was in keeping with distributive justice; the higher belief in idealism <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>had,</b> the more likely he assumed this punishment violated procedural justice...|$|R

Thus from moment to moment angels attempt to lead each person to what is good tacitly using the person's own thoughts.|$|E

25|$|The {{impaired}} {{functioning of}} autobiographical memory due to damage or disease can have profound effects on an individual's episodic memory.

25|$|The {{omissions}} {{of individuals}} {{are generally not}} criminalised in English criminal law, subject to situations of special duty, contractual duty, {{and the creation of}} dangerous situations.

Proponents of the current legal position regard it as wrong for the criminal law to punish individuals for committing no physical act, which it is argued would be an infringement on human autonomy. Academics arguing for reform argue that a social responsibility to assist others should exist, particularly where there would be no danger to the rescuer.|$|E
