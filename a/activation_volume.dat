Different underlayers and CoCrPt layer thicknesses {{were used to}} provide a range of lateral grain sizes, MIδ (product of remanence MI and film thickness δ) values, and remanence coercivities.

40|$|A short {{review of}} the effect of {{pressure}} on copolymerization kinetics shows the necessity of simple models for a better understanding of <b>activation</b> <b>volumes.</b> Therefore, a simple concept, possibly generally valid for free-radical polymerization, is proposed, {{based on the assumption that}} molar <b>volumes</b> of <b>activation</b> can be expressed as an addition of a characteristic radical and a monomer contribution, regardless of the combination involved. The scheme may facilitate the visualization of the transition state and contribute to the understanding of reaction mechanisms of radical polymerizations. Ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymerization at 62 °C with tert-butyl alcohol as solvent agrees with the proposed scheme, appearing from the pressure independence of the product of reactivity ratios at the different levels (35, 600, and 1200 kg/cm 2).

40|$|A {{technique}} for performing patch-clamp experiments under high hydrostatic (oil) pressure is described. The method allows {{the transfer of}} whole cell or membrane patches in a recording configuration into a pressure vessel, where pressure can be increased up to 60 MPa (approximately equal to 600 bar). We have studied {{in this way the}} pressure dependence of single acetylcholine receptor channels in excised "outside-out" membrane patches from cultured rat muscle cells. In the range of 0. 1 to 60 MPa the open channel conductance in 140 mM NaCl solutions did not vary by more than 2 %, which implies that the translocation of sodium ions through the channel pore does not involve steps with significant <b>activation</b> <b>volumes.</b> At high acetylcholine concentrations (20 microM) bursts of single-channel activity allowed measurements of the mean open and mean closed times of the channel. Pressurization to 40 MPa increased both mean open and mean closed times giving apparent <b>activation</b> <b>volumes</b> of about 59 and 139 A 3, respectively. This implies a net volume increase of 80 A 3, associated with the transition from the agonist-free state to the open state of the channel, which may be partially associated with the agonist-binding step. All the observed pressure effects were reversible. The <b>activation</b> <b>volumes</b> for the gating of acetylcholine receptor channels are comparable to those of sodium and potassium channels in the squid giant axon, suggesting that there is some basic common mechanism in the operation of ion-channel proteins...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo {{reveal the}} {{operating}} mechanisms of plastic deformation in an FCC high-entropy alloy, the activation volumes in CrMnFeCoNi have been measured {{as a function}} of plastic strain and temperature between 77 K and 423 K using repeated load relaxation experiments. At the yield stress, sigma(y), the <b>activation</b> <b>volume</b> varies from similar to 60 b(3) at 77 K to similar to 360 b(3) at 293 K and scales inversely with yield stress. With increasing plastic strain, the <b>activation</b> <b>volume</b> decreases and the trends follow the Cottrell-Stokes law, according to which the inverse <b>activation</b> <b>volume</b> should increase linearly with sigma - sigma(y) (Haasen plot). This is consistent with the notion that hardening due to an increase in the density of forest dislocations is naturally associated with a decrease in the <b>activation</b> <b>volume</b> because the spacing between dislocations decreases. The values and trends in <b>activation</b> <b>volume</b> agree with theoretical predictions that treat the HEA as a high-concentration solid-solution-strengthened alloy. These results demonstrate that this HEA deforms by the mechanisms typical of solute strengthening in FCC alloys, and thus indicate that the high compositional/structural complexity does not introduce any new intrinsic deformation mechanisms.

40|$|Background and objectiveBlood {{oxygenation}} level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) {{has been}} extensively used as a marker of brain dysfunction and subsequent recovery following stroke. However, growing evidence suggests that straightforward interpretation of BOLD fMRI changes with aging and disease is challenging. In this study, we investigated the effect of calibrating task fMRI data by applying a hemodynamic calibration method using the resting-state fluctuation amplitude (RSFA). Task fMRI responses were obtained during a covert verbal fluency task {{in a group of}} early stage stroke patients and matched healthy normal controls. MethodsFifteen acute left hemisphere stroke patients (less than 7 [*]days from stroke; aged 44 – 84 [*]years, average ~ 64 [*]years) and 21 healthy controls (aged 55 – 77 [*]years, average ~ 61 [*]years) were prospectively studied. All subjects completed a 3 -min covert verbal fluency task, and a 10 -min eyes-closed resting-state fMRI scan, from which the calibration factor (RSFA) was computed. A behavioral measure on the verbal fluency task was also collected outside the scanner. Whole brain <b>activation</b> <b>volumes</b> and region-of-interest (ROI) -wise percent signal change and <b>activation</b> <b>volumes</b> before and after calibration were computed. ResultsBetween-group differences in whole brain <b>activation</b> <b>volumes,</b> although statistically significant before calibration failed to be significant after calibration. There were significant within-group differences before and after calibration with RSFA. Statistically significant between-group differences on ROI-wise measures before calibration also significantly reduced after calibration. Exploratory brain-behavior correlations revealed a similar pattern: significant correlations before calibration failed to survive after calibration. Discussion and conclusionBOLD fMRI changes with aging and disease is confounded by changes in neurofunctional coupling leading to challenges in the straightforward interpretation of task fMRI results. Application of the hemodynamic calibration using the RSFA technique in the current study appeared to mitigate any differences between stroke and age-matched healthy controls. Our study indicates that estimating neural activity after applying hemodynamic scaling is important for studies of aging and for studies tracking post-stroke changes. We recommend that further investigation of hemodynamic calibration with RSFA in healthy subjects and in stroke in larger samples is necessary...|$|R
