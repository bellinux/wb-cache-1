25|$|Shakespeare's {{influence}} {{extends from}} theatre and literature to present-day movies, Western philosophy, and the English language itself. William Shakespeare {{is widely regarded}} as the greatest writer {{in the history of the}} English language, and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He transformed European theatre by expanding expectations <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> be accomplished through innovation in characterization, plot, language and genre. Shakespeare's writings have also impacted a large number of notable novelists and poets over the years, including Herman Melville Charles Dickens, and Maya Angelou, and continue to influence new authors even today. Shakespeare is the most quoted writer in the history of the English-speaking world after the various writers of the Bible; many of his quotations and neologisms have passed into everyday usage in English and other languages.|$|E

She is jealous of Bell's involvement with other girls' affairs, including Ais', but is still in love with him, devoted to protecting him, and helping with his growth, even after learning that he only views her as family. She and Bell live in a room under an abandoned church, and she works part-time for the Guild as a clerk, and also some food stands to help Bell with day-to-day living expenses, until moving to the former palace of the Apollon Familia upon defeating them in the War Game and claiming their assets.

25|$|When {{a serial}} killer dubbed The Salem Stalker starts wreaking havoc around town, killing many friends, {{including}} Roman, John and Marlena are worried <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> happen to them. The killer, though, is later revealed to be Marlena, though John believes {{she was forced to}} by someone else. Marlena is arrested, and sent to prison, while John tries to clear her name. Marlena tries to escape, and is killed by police fire. However, she's later found alive with all of her victims on Melaswen Island, and it's revealed she was brainwashed by Andre DiMera into committing the murders. She reunites with John, but soon after, Marlena finds out she's pregnant with Roman's child, conceived when they were stranded on the island. During an argument between John and Roman, Marlena falls down the stairs and miscarries. She wakes up with amnesia, {{as a result of the}} miscarriage. Amnesiac specialist Alex North is brought in to care for Marlena, and she appears to fall in love with him. Alex later reveals that he is Marlena's first husband, and was presumed dead in Vietnam. Since Alex and Marlena's marriage has never been dissolved, Marlena's subsequent marriages are all invalid. Suspicious, John investigates, and finds out that Alex is an abusive husband. John uncovers that Alex is planning to kill Marlena. By the time that Alex is proven to be a fraud, he and Marlena have renewed their vows, and left on a honeymoon. Alex takes Marlena to Morgan Island, but John soon finds them and, after a shootout and scuffle, Alex falls over a cliff and is presumed dead.|$|E

Stewie comes to collect, but Brian laughs him off and tells him he will have the money in 24 hours. After 24 hours, Stewie asks for the money owed, but Brian {{says he does not}} have it and to give him until next Friday. Stewie reveals that he is serious about {{settling}} the bet and, on two occasions, brutally beats up Brian (using such means as a golf club, shooting him in both knees with a pistol, and a flamethrower) to coerce him into paying up. Eventually, Brian agrees to pay off the bet. After Stewie's bet is satisfied, he offers Brian an opportunity to get one [...] "free revenge shot" [...] to make up for all the torture he caused. Brian accepts the offer, but leaves Stewie in suspense as to when the free hit will be delivered, until Stewie is overcome with paranoia and starts beating himself up in an attempt to satisfy Brian. After biding his time and making Stewie worry <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> happen, Brian—while the Griffins are in London, leaving the Patriots-Silly Nannies game—nonchalantly shoves Stewie in front of a moving bus.|$|E

Specifically, in plays like Hamlet, Shakespeare [...] "integrated characterization with plot," [...] such that if the main character was different in any way, the plot would be totally changed. In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare mixed tragedy and comedy {{together to create a}} new romantic tragedy genre (previous to Shakespeare, romance had not been considered a worthy topic for tragedy). Through his soliloquies, Shakespeare showed how plays could explore a character's inner motivations and conflict (up until Shakespeare, soliloquies were often used by playwrights to [...] "introduce (characters), convey information, provide an exposition or reveal plans").|$|E

Although the two were able to pay him back swiftly, it led Laird to speculate <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> have been: [...] "if we hadn't gotten that loan from him at that point in our lives, it might have taken us a couple more months to raise that money from other sources, and who knows what might have happened differently {{as a result of that}} delay?" [...] It occurred to him that [...] "there must be so many times where a self-publishing venture can sink or float on the strength of" [...] a relatively small amount of money, so he felt a desire to use some of his [...] "good fortune, in the financial sense, to help people out" [...] (and, in addition to the creators, the Foundation also aids those [...] "involved in charitable organizations").|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} by Reprise Records on November 30, 2010. Its first single [...] "Sometimes I Cry" [...] was released on August 2, 2010 and became a number-one hit on the Urban AC chart. It peaked at number 16 in November and ultimately spent five weeks on the US Billboard Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It also charted at number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay. Benét has said of the song, [...] " [...] is about how you've completely moved on but still there's still some melancholy about the break-up. Maybe you're even dating somebody, but sometimes, when you're alone, you're sad <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> have been". [...] "Never Want to Live Without You" [...] was released as the album's second single on November 1. It charted at number 75 on the Billboard Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs. In promotion of Lost in Time, Benét is performing on a two-month-long, nationwide tour with R recording artist Fantasia.

2500|$|Some area {{residents}} suggested the crossing itself was the problem.

There's a bank there that always collects water, making it even more dangerous." [...] He also said he and his coworkers often complained about how quickly the train came after the gates went down, gates which had been installed after a 1984 crash killed a van driver. [...] "How safe is that crossing—for this to happen again?" [...] that victim's sister asked the newspaper. While the crossing had undergone upgrades in recent years, including brighter lights and an additional sign warning passing drivers not to stop on the tracks, in 2009 another upgrade, which would have added a sign with flashing lights [...] up the road west of the tracks was not installed. [...] "It's way too early to be guessing <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> have or couldn't have made a difference," [...] said a spokesman for the New York State Department of Transportation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, guitarist Dan Hoerner and bassist Nate Mendel {{met when}} they became housemates at the University of Washington. After jam sessions, they decided to form a band and sought a drummer, {{eventually}} deciding to invite William Goldsmith. Goldsmith played in many bands but decided to join the duo's project. They released a demo tape under the name [...] "Empty Set". Post-release, the band changed their name from Empty Set to Chewbacca Kaboom, upon realization that a band with the name Empty Set already existed. However, when another demo tape was released, the new name earned them little attention, and it was yet again subject to change, this time to 'One Day I Stopped Breathing'. The band eventually settled on the name Sunny Day Real Estate. Mendel stated the band's name [...] "was just a random thought that popped into my head that came from a Talking Heads song, '(Nothing But) Flowers'". He felt that since the band's outlook on the world saw that every possible thing was becoming a commodity to be bought and sold, {{it was possible that}} one day, people would even start selling sunny days. The lyrics made him ponder <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> be sold as property, and come up with the commercialization of sunny days.|$|E

2500|$|Corry, Renn, and Stachel {{authored}} a {{joint reply}} to Winterberg, which they claimed Zeitschrift für Naturforschung refused to publish without [...] "unacceptable" [...] modifications, {{and unable to}} find a publisher [...] elsewhere, they made it available on the internet. The reply accused Winterberg of misrepresenting the reason why Science would not publish his paper (it {{had to do with the}} section of the journal it was scheduled to appear in), and also misrepresenting that the paper published in Zeitschrift für Naturforschung was the same paper he had submitted to Science, and had in fact been [...] "substantially altered" [...] after Winterberg had received their comments on an earlier draft. Actually, Winterberg in his Final Comment had clearly stated that the paper submitted to Science had been a previous version. [...] They then argue that Winterberg's interpretation of the Hilbert paper was incorrect, that the lost part of the page was unlikely to have been consequential, and that much of Winterberg's reasoning <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> be in the missing piece was incorrect (down to noting [...] Winterberg claims that 1/3 of the page was removed, when actually over half a page is missing total from the two cut off pages) and internally inconsistent. They further argued there was a likely [...] "non-paranoid" [...] explanation for the missing part of the page.|$|E
2500|$|While {{developing}} the scenario, the team {{needed to work}} carefully so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed to take decisions <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in social norms since the original's release, in particular a scene where Cloud cross-dressed as a woman {{as part of an}} infiltration mission. The team were also planning to include references to events detailed in the Compilation titles, though what form these reference will take and their scope is still under consideration. Nomura later clarified that, as of early 2017, Remake did not share a direct continuity with the Compilation. The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015. The game will be fully voiced, and the plan is for the voice actors from the CGI movie [...] to reprise their roles, although not all of them have been asked yet and characters who were limited to cameo appearances such as Red XIII may be recast. The subtitle [...] "Remake" [...] was included to differentiate the game from its 1997 original. It was originally going to be story-related, but the team did not want {{to give the impression that}} it was a sequel or spin-off. Rather than using the character models and graphical style of Advent Children, which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of Advent Children with deformed stylization. Nomura is in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari is in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modelling is being supervised by Visual Works, Square Enix's CGI development branch.|$|E
