25|$|An added {{attraction}} of the Mid-Levels is its close proximity to nature and a comparatively better air quality than many parts of Hong Kong Island. Many wealthy people in Hong Kong {{are willing to pay}} top market price for a residence that is away from pollution <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> close to the centre of the city.|$|E
25|$|He was old, {{his life}} was behind him, and, save herself, he had no ties. What did it matter to him how his {{struggle}} should end? But she was young, she was beautiful, she might form new friendships, the world was before her, the world might yet be at her feet, and life, so sweet and so sad, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> good a thing withal, was ready and waiting for her.|$|E
60|$|Her {{concern was}} <b>so</b> genuine <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> somehow <b>so</b> {{innocent}} that Evelyn's heart softened.|$|R

5000|$|Volker Hage of Der Spiegel {{compared}} {{the book to}} the works of Botho Strauß, as both Strauß and Handke use literature {{to reflect on the}} activity of writing. Hage wrote that My Year in the No-Man's-Bay might be described as [...] "postmodern literature-literature", something critics have anticipated with horror, but continued: [...] "What does a label like that matter, when the prose is <b>so</b> intense <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> relaxed, <b>so</b> surprising <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> obvious, <b>so</b> beautiful <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> original".|$|R
25|$|I saw in {{his hand}} a long spear of gold, and at the point {{there seemed to be}} a little fire. He {{appeared}} to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it...|$|E
500|$|Robert Ross {{had read}} Wilde's poems before they met, and was {{unrestrained}} by the Victorian prohibition against homosexuality, {{even to the}} extent of estranging himself from his family. By Richard Ellmann's account, he was a precocious seventeen-year-old who [...] "so young <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> knowing, was determined to seduce Wilde". According to Daniel Mendelsohn, Wilde, who had long alluded to Greek love, was [...] "initiated into homosexual sex" [...] by Ross, while his [...] "marriage had begun to unravel after his wife's second pregnancy, which left him physically repelled".|$|E
500|$|.....where a {{fresh start}} is badly needed—is in a treaty to outlaw nuclear tests. The {{conclusion}} of such a treaty—so near <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> far—would check the spiraling arms race {{in one of its}} most dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our security—it would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards.|$|E

500|$|Built between 1093 and 1490, Durham Cathedral, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the upper parts of its towers, the eastern extension known as the Chapel of Nine Altars, and the large west window of 1341, is entirely Norman and is regarded by Alec Clifton-Taylor as [...] "the incomparable masterpiece of Romanesque architecture". The interior is “overwhelmingly impressive”. The western Lady Chapel known as the Galilee Chapel is a unique Norman building different in style to the cathedral itself. The view of the cathedral from the south west is particularly famous because of its “incomparable setting” on a steep promontory above the River Wear. The Venerable C.J. Stranks wrote “It stands today vast and impressive in its massive strength, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> well proportioned that there is nothing about it which seems ponderous.” ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for {{the portal}} Vistina, Maja Bećković {{credited}} the singer for conveying [...] "so much warmth, so many emotions" [...] in an album; she called [...] "every word - a new pearl, every verse - gold, every vocal - a shining diamond". She continued describing the songs as [...] "so authentic, so old, so archaic <b>and</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>so</b> modern and rich, both production and author-wise". The journalist {{observed that the}} lyrics were carefully selected with every track eligible for [...] "a compilation containing the best lyric songs from this region, which contains so many centuries of elegy and sadness, interwoven with rare moments of joy, which make life worth living". She credited the singer for adding even [...] more value to what already was valuable material arranged for the album and concluded, [...] "All in all, Macedonian girl will touch your heart and spirit even for the second time".|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said the songs produced by David Foster are too predictable {{due to their}} [...] "slick commercial appeal". However, Erlewine noted that Braxton [...] "manages to infuse the songs with life and passion that elevates them beyond their generic confines" [...] due to her vocal ability. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered the track [...] "a tearjerker so grandiose <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> intrinsically, assuredly hit-bound, it's the kind of mass-appeal grabber that's probably already sent a jealous Diana Ross diving for a comfort gallon of Häagen-Dazs." [...] Tucker also named it the worst track on Secrets, and further stated: [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] is [...] "one of those the-verses-exist-only-for-the-swelling-chorus showstoppers that allude to emotions without ever actually embodying them. Braxton does her darnedest to plug some life into the song, to no avail". J.D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun described [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] as [...] "overblown".|$|E

500|$|Both Dozier and Yuricon {{president}} Erica Friedman {{wrote about}} the sexual nature of Honey, including the lesbian desire of the Jewel Princess (one of Honey's enemies) {{for her in the}} second episode. Friedman—who had looked for such [...] "implied yuri" [...] in Cutie Honey manga—called the Princess's appearance [...] "*just* what I was hoping for", and praised Honey's change to her S Queen form in response. Ross said about the series: [...] "It's seemingly exploitative, it's incredibly sexist, and the female members of my household - you'd expect them to be indignant, but, no, they were laughing their butts off because it was so blatant, and yet Honey was actually never objectified in the whole series." [...] He further writes, [...] "Honey Kisaragi is an extremely strong character who is no damsel in distress. If anyone needs help in this series, it's the guys!" [...] Toole said that Jessica Calvello [...] "gives the character a growling, tough-girl charm that was conspicuously absent from the original version", while Dozier said that Calvello captured [...] "the combination of innocence and bravado [...] that is both so confusing <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> appropriate". Beveridge said the [...] "fight sequences are pretty well done and provide some fun moments watching Honey battle the various demonic forms", but concluded that Honey main goal is to showcase the lead heroine's changes: [...] "Oh, lets face it. it's all about the half to completely naked transformation sequences. They're grrreat!" ...|$|E
500|$|Sometimes, Mary and George {{appear to}} have been distant parents. At first, they failed to notice the nanny's abuse of the young Princes Edward and Albert, and their {{youngest}} son, Prince John, was housed in a private farm on the Sandringham Estate, in Bill's care, perhaps to hide his epilepsy from the public. However, despite Mary's austere public image and her strait-laced private life, Mary was a caring mother in many respects, revealing a fun-loving and frivolous side to her children and teaching them history and music. Edward wrote fondly of his mother in his memoirs: [...] "Her soft voice, her cultivated mind, the cosy room overflowing with personal treasures were all inseparable ingredients of the happiness associated with this last hour of a child's day... Such was my mother's pride in her children that everything that happened to each one was of the utmost importance to her. With the birth of each new child, Mama started an album in which she painstakingly recorded each progressive stage of our childhood". He expressed a less charitable view, however, in private letters to his wife after his mother's death: [...] "My sadness was mixed with incredulity that any mother could have been so hard and cruel towards her eldest son for so many years <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> demanding at the end without relenting a scrap. I'm afraid the fluids in her veins have always been as icy cold as they are now in death." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the {{painting}} was celebrated as a technical accomplishment, some critics were uncertain if it had the correct moral effect. The Library of the Fine Arts was critical of its [...] "pantomimic" [...] quality, which it considered [...] "calculated to excite any but such ideas as we should wish to see produced by Art", while The Examiner complained about the depiction of women being attacked, arguing: [...] "Mr Etty should not treat the fair sex in this harsh and wanton manner. We doubt his right to put {{a single one of}} them into the hands of a Demon, much less to deliver them over by the dozen to the grasp of the destroyers." [...] The Times said, [...] "We do not profess to understand what class of compositions that is which originates neither in history nor poetry—no doubt Mr. Etty does; but {{as far as we can}} comprehend his picture, which is much more intelligible than his language, it represents a quantity of able-bodied demons, who appear angry at the ladies for having stayed out so long, and who are come to fetch them home accordingly", and criticised Etty for a [...] "slovenly manner" [...] and for [...] "abusing his rich gifts, and [...] upon the wild and unmeaning what might be made subservient to much more worthy purposes". Despite this, the same critic conceded that [...] "The work is one of extraordinary power" [...] and that [...] "The figures are drawn with exquisite skill, the grouping admirably varied, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> combined as to present a complete picture, and the colouring vigorous and harmonious in an eminent degree." ...|$|E

2500|$|Life as a {{civilian}} during the five years of occupation of the Channel Islands by the German army, which started in June 1940 was difficult and as the war progressed, became much harder. The winter of 1944-45 was particularly hard when food and fuel were in short supply and liberation seemed so close <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> far away ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to watch this game for a few minutes," [...] she told her companion. [...] "The men are such {{opposite}} types <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> both <b>so</b> good-looking. <b>And</b> Lady Maggie fascinates me." ...|$|R

2500|$|E.R. Punshon in The Guardians {{issue of}} 2 April 1940 concluded, [...] "The {{story is told}} with all and even more of Mrs. Christie's {{accustomed}} skill and economy of effect, {{but it is a}} pity that the plot turns upon a legal point familiar to all <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> misconceived that many readers will feel the tale is deprived of plausibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|Van Gogh {{described}} Ears of Wheat to {{painter and}} friend Paul Gauguin as [...] "nothing more than ears of wheat, green-blue stalks long, ribbon-like leaves, under a sheen of green & pink; ears of wheat, yellowing slightly, {{with an edge}} made pale pink by the dusty manner of flowering; at the bottom, a pink bindweed winding round a stalk. I would like to paint portraits against a background that is so lively <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> still." [...] The painting depicts [...] "the soft rustle of the ears of grain swaying {{back and forth in}} the wind." [...] He used the motif as the background to a portrait.|$|E
2500|$|Meghnad Badh Kavya, The Slaying of Meghnad, {{the story}} of the final fight and demise of Meghnad, the eldest son of Ravana, is {{unanimously}} hailed as his magnum opus, although his journey to publication and recognition was far from smooth. However, with its publication, he distinguished himself as a serious composer of an entirely new genre of heroic poetry, that was Homeric and Dantesque in technique and style, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>so</b> fundamentally native in theme. To cite the poet himself: [...] "I awoke one morning and found myself famous." [...] Nevertheless, it took a few years for this epic to win recognition all over the country.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Unless I had you.' Of all {{the words}} which he could have spoken in such an {{emergency}} these were the most foolish; <b>and</b> <b>yet,</b> at <b>so</b> tender a moment, how were they to be repressed? ...|$|R
