In 2007 his coach Ivan Manco, who came from Slovakia, arranged for Walker to tryout for HC Vítkovice in the Czech Republic, where Manco knew one of the coaches. Walker impressed the team enough to be given <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>on</b> their under-18 junior team.

Her scores in the junior division at the 2004 U.S. National Championships were competitive with those being posted by the seniors, and Marta Karolyi, the U.S. national team coordinator, has said that if Liukin had been eligible, {{she would have been}} named to the Olympic team.|$|E

5|$|Brundage {{took the}} {{position}} that as the Germans had reported nondiscrimination to the IOC, and the IOC had accepted that report, US Olympic authorities were bound by that determination. Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent that with the Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>on</b> the German team. Brundage stated on this issue that as only 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it would hardly be surprising if none did in 1936.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Evita set her {{sights on}} earning <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>on</b> the ballot as {{candidate}} for vice-president.

Although Arana had come to the military conspiracy relatively late, his defection had brought the powerful Guardia de Honor (Honor Guard) over to the revolutionaries, and for this crucial role he was rewarded with <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>on</b> the junta.
