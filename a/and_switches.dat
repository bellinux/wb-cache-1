40|$|Abstract—Modern {{parallel}} {{and distributed}} applications {{have a wide}} range of communication characteristics and performance requirements. These diverse characteristics affect the performance and suitability of particular routing <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> policies in multihop point-to-point networks. In this paper, we identify a core set of architectural features necessary for flexible selection and implementation of multiple routing <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> schemes. Using this, we present a flexible router whose routing <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> policies can be tailored to the application, allowing the network to meet these diverse needs. By dedicating a small programmable processor to each incoming link, we can implement wormhole, virtual cut-through, <b>and</b> packet <b>switching,</b> as well as hybrid switching schemes, each under a variety of unicast and multicast routing algorithms. In addition, a flexible router can support several applications or traffic types simultaneously, enabling better support of applications with multiple traffic classes. We have designed, implemented, and fabricated the Programmable Routing Controller (PRC). Cycle-level simulations of mesh-connected PRCs also demonstrate that flexible routing <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> can significantly enhance application performance.

40|$|Context-aware {{applications}} monitor {{changes in}} their environment <b>and</b> <b>switch</b> their behaviour {{in order to continue}} satisfying requirements. Specifying monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> in such applications can be difficult due to their dependence on varying environmental properties. Two problems require analysis: the detection of changes in the operating environment to assess their impact on requirements satisfaction, and the adaptation of application behaviour to ensure requirements satisfaction. This thesis borrows from the world of problem-oriented software system development and product-lines to analyse monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> problems on one hand and contextual changes on the other. It proposes a shift of focus from treating monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> as activities to be analysed as part of the design, to treating them as part of the problem whose requirements are analysed. We claim three novel contributions: (1) we provide concepts and mechanisms for analysing monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> problems in context; (2) we formulate and prove two theorems for monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching,</b> which define the necessary and sufficient conditions for monitoring a contextual variable <b>and</b> for <b>switching</b> application behaviour to restore requirements satisfaction when they are violated; and (3) we provide a tool for automated derivation of the conditions for monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching.</b> Our approach is evaluated using two case studies of a proof of concept mobile phone productline and a logistics company that delivers and monitors products across the UK. We found the applications of the approach to be effective in analysing unforeseen requirements violations caused by changes in the systems operating environments. Furthermore, the monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> mechanisms derived from the analysis enabled the software to become, to some extent, context-aware.

Specifying monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> in such applications can be difficult due to their dependence on varying environmental properties. Two problems require analysis: the monitoring of environmental properties to assess their impact on continual requirements satisfaction, and the selection of appropriate behaviours that ensure requirements satisfaction. To address these problems, we provide concepts for refining contextual properties which we then use to formulate two theorems for monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching.</b> These enable us to formally analyse the impact of context on monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> problems. We have instantiated our general approach by encoding monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> problems into propositional logic constraints, which we analyse automatically using a standard SAT solver. The approach is applied to an industrial case study to assess its efficacy.

5|$|Aeron's main {{weapon is}} the Oraclos Chain, an {{artifact}} {{that can be}} used in multiple ways: it can tie up enemies, bind enemies together so they share damage taken when Aeron attacks, and swing them around Aeron to deal damage. The Chain can also be used to rip armor or materials from enemies. The Chain's attack power increases the longer it is pulled when attached to an enemy. In addition to the Oraclos Chain, Aeron has access to multiple subweapons, such as a sword. Puzzles within the Towers include activating levers <b>and</b> <b>switches,</b> manipulating platforms, triggering special mechanisms unique to each Tower environment, and climbing along walls and beams to reach other areas within the Towers. The Chain is essential to these puzzles, being used as a grappling hook and a rope from which Aeron can swing from one platform to another. Elements within the Towers, such as what enemies are active and what items may be found, vary with the time of day Aeron visits them.|$|E

Many puzzles {{are based on the}} differences between the two realms; for example, platforms and environment features in one realm may change form to open new paths in the other.

5|$|The {{ancestors}} {{to these}} games include the cathode-ray tube amusement device, {{the earliest known}} interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen. The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope, with a set of knobs <b>and</b> <b>switches.</b> The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947. While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes. This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around {{the same time as the}} device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer.|$|E
