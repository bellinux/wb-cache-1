5|$|Integrated {{education}} {{models are}} {{emerging in the}} <b>academic</b> <b>world,</b> a model which {{is referred to as}} T-shape and π-shaped education. T-shaped professionals are taught general knowledge in a few disciplines (e.g. management and engineering) and specific, deep knowledge in a single domain (e.g. design). This model also applies to companies, when they shift their focus from small T innovations (innovations involving only one discipline, like chemists) to big T innovations (innovations involving several disciplines, like design, ethnography, lead user, etc.). Like in education, this shift makes breaking down silos of departments and disciplines of knowledge essential.|$|E

In 1901, after being stateless for more than five years, Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1905, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich.

25|$|Throughout {{much of the}} <b>academic</b> <b>world,</b> {{the term}} Doctor refers {{to someone who has}} earned a {{doctoral}} degree (highest degree) from a university. This is normally the Doctor of Philosophy, abbreviated PhD (sometimes Ph.D. in North America) from the Latin Philosophiae Doctor or DPhil from its English name, or equivalent research doctorates at level 8 of the International Standard Classification of Education 2011 classifications (ISCED 2011) or level 6 of the ISCED 1997 classifications. Beyond academia, Doctor as a noun normally refers to a medical practitioner, who would usually hold a qualification at level 7 of ISCED 2011/level 5 of ISCED 1997 such as the British MBBS or the American MD.|$|E
25|$|Schur {{lived in}} Berlin {{as a highly}} {{respected}} member of the <b>academic</b> <b>world,</b> an apolitical scholar. A leading mathematician and outstanding and very successful teacher, he held a prestigious chair at the University of Berlin for 16 years. Until 1933, his research group had an excellent reputation at the University of Berlin in Germany and beyond. With Schur in the center, his faculty worked with representation theory, which was extended by his students in different directions (including solvable groups, combinatorics, matrix theory). Schur made fundamental contributions to algebra and group theory which, according to Hermann Weyl, were comparable in scope and depth to those of Emmy Amalie Noether (1882–1935).|$|E
25|$|In February 1841, Talbot {{obtained}} an English {{patent for}} his developed-out calotype process. At first, he sold individual patent licences for £20 each; later, {{he lowered the}} fee for amateur use to £4. Professional photographers, however, had to pay up to £300 annually. In a business climate where many patent holders were attacked for enforcing their rights, and an <b>academic</b> <b>world</b> that viewed the patenting of new discoveries as a crass hindrance to scientific freedom and further progress, Talbot's behaviour was widely criticised. One reason Talbot later gave for vigorously enforcing his rights {{was that he had}} spent, according to his own reckoning, about £5,000 on his various photographic endeavours over the years and wanted to at least recoup his expenses.|$|E

25|$|In the <b>academic</b> <b>world,</b> {{plagiarism}} {{by students}} is usually considered {{a very serious}} offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study {{did not have a}} good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very confident that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are. The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.|$|E
25|$|He {{worked to}} {{maintain}} a strong network of contacts among anti-fascist intellectuals throughout Italy, {{while much of the}} Italian <b>academic</b> <b>world</b> bowed to the regime. With his former students and followers Ernesto Rossi and Carlo Rosselli he founded the first clandestine anti-fascist newspaper Non mollare (Don't Give Up) in January 1925. A half year later he was arrested and put on trial, but was released on a technicality, although he was kept under surveillance. Threats against his life were published in the Fascist press and his lawyer was beaten to death by Fascist blackshirts. His name was on top of the list of the Fascist death squads during raids on 4 October 1925 in Florence. However, Salvemini had fled to France in August 1925. He was dismissed from the University of Florence and his Italian citizenship was revoked in 1926.|$|E
25|$|Richardson's Quaker beliefs entailed {{an ardent}} pacifism that {{exempted}} him from military service during World War I as a conscientious objector, though this subsequently disqualified him from having any academic post. Richardson worked from 1916 to 1919 for the Friends' Ambulance Unit {{attached to the}} 16th French Infantry Division. After the war, he rejoined the Meteorological Office but was compelled to resign on grounds of conscience when it was amalgamated into the Air Ministry in 1920. He subsequently pursued a career {{on the fringes of}} the <b>academic</b> <b>world</b> before retiring in 1940 to research his own ideas. His pacifism had direct consequences on his research interests. According to Thomas Körner, the discovery that his meteorological work was of value to chemical weapons designers caused him to abandon all his efforts in this field, and destroy findings that he had yet to publish.|$|E
40|$|In {{the best}} of all <b>academic</b> <b>worlds,</b> the phrase “grading in honors” is an oxymoron. According to many and various sources, the gifted college student is more of a perfectionist with higher {{educational}} aspirations than non-honors students. She tends to be more autonomous, self-aware, and willing to engage in discourse than non-honors students. We know that she comes to us with higher academic credentials than non-honors students and that she is, therefore, more poised for success. How, then, do we assess the creative, energetic, enthusiastic, impassioned work we expect from such students? Should we be required to do so? In {{the best of}} all <b>academic</b> <b>worlds,</b> students sit at the feet of wise and experienced professors and gather knowledge until they feel they have achieved the measure of education to which they aspire. Such students determine the parameters of their own learning and, thus, their saturation point. They maintain their own quality control so that their efforts reflect their personal best. In an age of big-business education and rising credentialism, however, this model is impractical and unmanageable. More’s the pity...|$|R
