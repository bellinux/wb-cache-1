5|$|This subtype {{makes up}} about 10% {{of all cases}} of aphthous stomatitis. It is termed major <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulceration</b> (MaAU) or major {{recurrent}} aphthous stomatitis (MaRAS). Major aphthous ulcers (major aphthae) are similar to minor aphthous ulcers, but are more than 10mm in diameter and the ulceration is deeper. Because the lesions are larger, healing takes longer (about twenty to thirty days), and may leave scars. Each episode of ulceration usually produces {{a greater number of}} ulcers, and the time between attacks is less than seen in minor aphthous stomatitis. Major <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulceration</b> usually affects non keratinized mucosal surfaces, but less commonly keratinized mucosa may also be involved, such as the dorsum (top surface) of the tongue or the gingiva (gums). The soft palate or the fauces (back of the throat) may also be involved, the latter being part of the oropharynx rather than the oral cavity.

5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of aphthous stomatitis, {{accounting}} for about 80–85% of all cases. This subtype is termed minor <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulceration</b> (MiAU), or minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MiRAS). The lesions themselves may be referred to as minor aphthae or minor aphthous ulcers. These lesions are generally less than 10mm in diameter (usually about 2–3mm), and affect non-keratinized mucosal surfaces (i.e. the labial and buccal mucosa, lateral borders of the tongue and the floor of the mouth). Usually several ulcers appear at the same time, but single ulcers are possible. Healing usually takes seven to ten days and leaves no scar. Between episodes of ulceration, there is usually an ulcer-free period of variable length.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulceration.</b> Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E

A variety of treatment options {{is available in the}} literature for all of these lesions and conditions. Topical ozone therapy is a minimally invasive technique {{that can be used for}} these conditions without any side effects. Aim and Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of ozonized olive oil in the treatment of oral lesions and conditions. Materials and Methods: A longitudinal study was carried out on 50 patients (<b>aphthous</b> <b>ulcerations,</b> herpes labialis, oral candidiasis, oral lichen planus, and angular cheilitis). The ozonized olive oil was applied twice daily until the lesion regresses for a maximum of 6 months. Results: All the lesions regress in patients with <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulcerations,</b> herpes labialis, oral candidiasis and angular cheilitis or showed improvement in the signs and symptoms in oral lichen planus patients. No toxicity or side effect was observed in any of the patients. Conclusion: Ozone therapy though requires a gaseous form to be more effective, but topical form can also bring out the positive results without any toxicity or side effect. Hence, it can be considered as a minimally invasive therapy for the oral infective and immunological conditions...|$|R

2500|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} (also termed recurrent aphthous stomatits, RAS, and {{commonly called}} [...] "canker sores") {{is a very}} common cause of oral ulceration. 10–25% {{of the general population}} suffer from this non-contagious condition. The appearance of aphthous stomatitis varies as there are 3 types, namely minor <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulceration,</b> major <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulceration</b> and herpetiform ulceration. Minor <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulceration</b> is the most common type, presenting with 1–6 small (2-4mm diameter), round/oval ulcers with a yellow-grey color and an erythematous (red) [...] "halo". These ulcers heal with no permanent scarring in about 7–10days. Ulcers recur at intervals of about 1–4months. Major <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulceration</b> is less common than the minor type, but produces more severe lesions and symptoms. Major <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulceration</b> presents with larger (>1cm diameter) ulcers that take much longer to heal (10–40days) and may leave scarring. The minor and major subtypes of aphthous stomatitis usually produce lesions on the non-keratinized oral mucosa (i.e. the inside of the cheeks, lips, underneath the tongue and the floor of mouth), but less commonly major aphthous ulcers may occur {{in other parts of the}} mouth on keratinized mucosal surfaces. The least common type is herpetiform ulceration, so named because the condition resembles primary herpetic gingivostomatitis. Herpetiform ulcers begin as small blisters (vesicles) which break down into 2-3mm sized ulcers. Herpetiform ulcers appear in [...] "crops" [...] sometimes hundreds in number, which can coalesce to form larger areas of ulceration.

Case Report: A case of Crohn’s disease with orofacial manifestations in a 10 year old girl is described. She had suffered from fever, dysphagia, arthralgia, painful recurrent ulcers of the oral mucosa and swelling of the lower lip lasting over 6 weeks. Clinical examination and the punch biopsy from the buccal mucosa revealed major recurrent <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulcerations.</b> A partial regression and significant relief of lesions were achieved {{two weeks after the}} treatment, but the patient suffered from abdominal pain, irregular bowel movements, arthritis, multiple hyperplastic and swollen mucosal folds, after 3 months. The patient was referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed pyloric ulcer formation. Abdominal ultrasound showed increased thickening of the ileal wall with multiple enlarged lympadenopathies in the periileal region. Colonoscopy images showed deep ulcers with surrounding erythema. The histopathological examination of biopsies from the terminal ileum and the colon showed basal plasmacytosis, minimal crypt distortions and <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulcerations.</b> The diagnosis of Orofacial Crohn’s disease was made.

40|$|Celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immune-mediated {{disease of}} the small bowel that results in malabsorption. It classically {{presents}} with gastrointestinal symptoms including chronic diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal bloating and anorexia. It is becoming more frequently identified in asymptomatic patients with a diagnosis of deficiencies related to malabsorption of iron, folic acid, vitamin B 12 and vitamin D. It is increasingly identified as a cause for early or refractory osteoporosis. Occasionally, celiac disease presents with cutaneous manifestations alone. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a well-recognized cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. Other cutaneous manifestations include alopecia, angular stomatitis and <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulcerations.</b> Described here {{is a case of}} a 24 -year-old woman who presented with intermittent urticaria and gastrointestinal complaints. She was found to have celiac disease on small-bowel biopsy. Both her gastrointestinal symptoms and urticaria resolved when she was put on a gluten-free diet, suggesting that her urticaria was a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease...|$|R
40|$|Recurrent oral <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulcerations,</b> genital ulcerations and {{cutaneous}} manifestations including erythema nodosum like lesions, superficial thrombophlebitis and papulopustular lesions are {{the most}} common manifestations of Behcet’s disease. The pathergy reaction reflects skin hypersensitivity to travma in Behcet’s disease. Pathergy test which is characterized by the formation of a sterile pustule 24 - 48 h after intradermal needle prick has a high diagnostic value especially in Middle East and Mediterrenian countries. Due to their high sensitivity, mucocutaneous lesions and pathergy test constitude four out of the five criteria in the International Behcet’s Disease study group classification criteria. Behcet’s disease has a wide clinical spectrum and since there are no specific diagnostic laboratory tests, diagnosis depends on clinical acumen of the physician. In the majority of patients with systemic findings, mucocutaneous lesions precede the onset of systemic involvement and therefore prompt recognition of mucocutaneous manifestations is of utmost importance in the early diagnosis and the outcome of the disease...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The exact {{prevalence}} of oral lesions in childhood {{is not well}} known. We sought to define the {{prevalence of}} oral mucosal lesions in {{a large group of}} children. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed using clinical charts from January 1997 to December 2007. Data collected included age, gender, and pathologic diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 10, 128 children (0 - 12 years old) were enrolled. Clinical diagnostic criteria proposed by the World Health Organization were followed. The frequency of children presenting oral mucosal lesions was 28. 9 %, and no differences related to gender were observed. The most frequent lesions recorded were oral candidiasis (28. 4 %), geographic tongue and other tongue lesions (18. 5 %), traumatic lesions (17. 8 %), recurrent <b>aphthous</b> <b>ulcerations</b> (14. 8 %), herpes simplex virus type 1 infections (9. 3 %), and erythema multiforme (0. 9 %). Children suffering from chronic diseases had a higher frequency of oral lesions compared with healthy children (chi-square: P <. 01). CONCLUSION: Mucosal alterations in children are relatively common, and several oral disorders are associated with underlying medical conditions...|$|R
