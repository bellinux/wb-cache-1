30|$|Currently, {{testing of}} the effects of GMP on NTO is {{primarily}} based on various ecotoxicological <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> originally developed and standardized for assessing the effects of plant protection products (PPPs) [43]. However, most of the hitherto existing ecotoxicological <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> do not meet the specific characteristics of the assessment of GMP, including the exposure of NTO via food and the food chain. Furthermore, there are limited possibilities to perform dose–response tests with GMP material and to apply safety factors on the derived effect concentrations. Additionally, Directive 2001 / 18 /EC [10] explicitly requires a ‘case-specific’ ERA. Annex II of the Directive defines a case as a combination of the parent organism (the crop plant and its biology, ecology and agronomy), its genetic modification and the possible receiving environment (i.e., a combination of abiotic factors and the biocoenosis) related to the intended (as opposed to accidental) release and use of the GMP. These registration requirements for GMP significantly exceed those for PPPs. A critical issue when accounting for the receiving environment is the choice of test organisms. Hilbeck et al. [20] pointed out that the use of universal standard test organisms for the assessment of chemicals may not meet the case-specific requirements for the assessment of GMP. Test species for PPP often do not occur in the receiving environment. Together with the need to consider exposure via food containing or consisting of GMP, {{there is a need for}} <b>additional</b> <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> that account for these differences. Newly selected species must be practical for use in standardized testing under laboratory conditions, e.g., laboratory breeding must be possible [42].|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{utility of}} <b>additional</b> cardiac {{diagnostic}} <b>testing</b> following exercise treadmill tests (ETT) {{is not well}} characterized. Our aim was to estimate the frequency and yield of downstream testing following exercise treadmill testing (ETT) and identify/predictors of patients who are most and least likely to benefit from <b>additional</b> <b>testing.</b> <b>Methods</b> and Results We followed a cohort of 3, 345 consecutive individuals without known coronary artery disease referred for a clinical ETT at large medical center. Downstream tests included all tests (invasive and noninvasive) within six months of ETT. Overall, 332 (9. 0 %) underwent noninvasive imaging while 84 (2. 3 %) were referred directly to invasive angiography. The rates of positive downstream testing following negative, inconclusive and positive ETT were 6. 4 %, 14. 2 % and 32. 9 % respectively. Over a mean follow-up of 2. 5 ± 1. 1 years, there were 76 (2. 2 %) adverse events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarctions, and coronary revascularizations) with annual incidence of 0. 2 %, 1. 3 % and 12. 4 % following negative, inconclusive and positive ETT respectively (P< 0. 001). Among 1, 043 (28. 5 %) inconclusive ETT studies, rapid recovery of ECG changes (n= 134, 13 %) was associated with negative downstream test results and excellent prognosis while typical angina despite negative ECG (n= 103, 10 %) {{was associated with a}} higher frequency of positive downstream tests and adverse prognosis (P< 0. 001).

40|$|The diverse {{effects of}} emotion on human memory {{is a topic}} of {{discussion}} that has brought about much interest within psychology (Cardwell, Clark and Meldrum, 2004) with a particular emphasis on how further understanding of its influence can aid our knowledge about the structure of underlying memory systems. In recognition memory research, dual-process models propose that judgements can be based on two independent retrieval processes: “familiarity”, based on the perception of a memory’s strength, and “recollection”, founded on its contextual information. Much of the literature suggests that emotional stimuli, compared with neutral stimuli, can boost performance for contextual recollection, but not familiarity (Doerksen and Shimamura, 2001). The present study contained a source retrieval task, where presented scenes were of positive, negative or neutral valence with either a yellow or red border colour, {{in order to assess}} the contribution of emotion’s effects on recollection. The probabilities of correctly recognizing an item and retrieving its respective border colour were noted using a counter-balanced design. It was predicated that negative scenes would be more accurately recollected than both positive and neutral scenes, whereas item recognition performance would not be affected by emotional valence. Contrary to the hypotheses, results were indicative of an effect of valence on item recognition performance for the scenes, with negative images being remembered more accurately than positive and neutral stimuli. However, recollection for the border colours of the scenes was not found to differ across valence. The findings are discussed in respect to the Yonelinas Model of Dual-Processing (Yonelinas, 1999) to show the potential effect of emotion on recollective ability despite the results, and further study implications are suggested in order to establish the potential influence of recollection on the scenes using the current source retrieval procedure by applying <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> such as a remember/know task...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} two years (2001 - 2002) of this project, the primary effort was focused on {{evaluating}} the effect of hydrogen on the cracking behavior of candidate target materials namely, Alloys EP- 823, HT- 9 and 422 in aqueous environments of different pH values at ambient and elevated temperatures. More recently, emphasis is being placed to evaluate the cracking behavior of these materials in molten lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) environment at much higher testing temperatures so as to compare the cracking susceptibility in environments containing molten metals and aqueous solutions, respectively. The most recent tests to evaluate the cracking susceptibility were primarily based on two state-of-the-art techniques known as constant-load and slow-strain rate (SSR) methods. Simultaneously, efforts were made to determine the localized corrosion (pitting and crevice corrosion) behavior in similar aqueous environments at ambient and elevated temperatures using electrochemical polarization techniques. However, these techniques cannot be applied to LBE environment. Therefore, the work scope described in the original proposal is being modified to include <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> to suit the high-temperature LBE environment. Although, testing still will be continued to complete the original matrix involving all three alloys in aqueous environments using constant-load, SSR, and polarization techniques, future testing will be performed in both aqueous and LBE environments using self-loaded specimens such as C-Ring and U-Bend stress-corrosion-cracking (SCC) test specimens. In addition to this corrosion testing, significant efforts will be made to evaluate the crack-growth behavior of radiation hardened target materials using sub-size compact tension (CT) specimens. The test materials will undergo appropriate thermal treatments prior to their testing. All tested specimens will be examined metallographically. Further, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) will be used to determine the extent and nature of cracking in the tested specimens.

It {{was evident that}} there is a need for <b>additional</b> toxicity <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> for these groups. Annette Aldrich (Agroscope, Wädenswil, Switzerland) reported that amphibians are experiencing increasing pressure from diverse stressors, in particular loss of habitat, and plant protection products (PPP). The data requirement for authorization of PPP in the European Union (EU 283 / 2013) determines that amphibians must be considered to be in prospective environmental risk assessment. However, amphibians do not need to be tested for PPP authorization; therefore, there is a lack of information regarding PPP toxicity to this group. Dermal uptake is considered to be a significant route of exposure, but so far there is no adequate testing system. Katharina Kaufmann (BASF SE, Limburgerhof, Germany) presented the results of a skin absorption in vitro test (OECD TG 428), which was adapted to amphibian skin (Xenopus laevis). Dermal absorption and uptake were quantified using two reference substances, caffeine and testosterone. To address dermal toxicity, an amphibian skin corrosion test based on OECD TG 431 was successfully used. Her studies showed that amphibian skin was significantly more permeable for chemicals than human skin.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Heparins {{are one of}} {{the most}} used class of {{anticoagulants}} in daily clinical practice. Despite their widespread application immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions to heparins are rare. Among these, the delayed-type reactions to s. c. injected heparins are well-known usually presenting as circumscribed eczematous plaques at the injection sites. In contrast, potentially life-threatening systemic immediate-type anaphylactic reactions to heparins are extremely rare. Recently, some cases of non-allergic anaphylaxis could be attributed to undesirable heparin contaminants. A 43 -year-old patient developed severe anaphylaxis symptoms within 5 – 10 minutes after s. c. injection of enoxaparin. Titrated skin prick testing with wheal and flare responses up to an enoxaparin dilution of 1 : 10. 000 indicated a probable allergic mechanism of the enoxaparin-induced anaphylaxis. The basophil activation <b>test</b> as an <b>additional</b> in-vitro <b>test</b> <b>method</b> was negative. Furthermore, skin prick testing showed rather broad cross-reactivity among different heparin preparations tested. In the presented case, history, symptoms, and results of skin testing strongly suggested an IgE-mediated allergic hypersensitivity against different heparins. Therefore, as safe alternative anticoagulants the patient could receive beneath coumarins the hirudins or direct thrombin inhibitors.

40|$|In {{response}} to rising petroleum prices, {{the demand for}} lower emissions standards for vehicles, and better vehicle fuel economy, the market for hybrid and electric vehicles is expanding. These systems incorporate advanced battery systems which store and provide energy in the vehicle. Over time, though, cells degrade and lose capacity in accordance with two different aging phenomena: cycling and calendar aging. It is imperative to understand how these degradation phenomena occur as the loss in capacity results in a loss in vehicle range. Through understanding how these phenomena occur, mitigation efforts can be designed to prevent or lessen their effects. This thesis will focus primarily on studying the effects of calendar aging on commercial LiFePO 4 cells. Cells are aged at varying temperatures and states of charge (SOC) {{to determine the extent}} of capacity fade and degradation. <b>Additional</b> <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> are then utilized to attempt to determine which aging phenomena are promoting the losses within the cell. Capacity loss in cells stored at high temperature and fully charged conditions resulted in faster degradation rates. Temperature had the most significant role in the degradation of the cell and then the cell’s SOC. Comparing capacity losses between cells stored at the same temperature, but with different SOCs, found that the cells with higher SOC experienced increased rates of degradation in comparison to their fully discharged counterparts. In addition, storage at high SOC and high temperatures promoted such severe losses that the cells in question were unable to recapture capacity that they had lost reversibly. The primary degradation mode for the cells was the loss of cyclable lithium, and was found to occur under all of the storage conditions. Cells stored at much more severe conditions, though, also demonstrated a loss of active material at the anode. The extent of the loss of the active material was largely predicated on whether or not the cell was stored at fully charged or discharged conditions. Storage of lithium-ion batteries at high temperatures has a dramatic effect on the continual usage of the cells after storage conditions have changed. Despite shifting temperatures or states-of-charge to a lower value, the initial storage conditions leads to increased degradation rates throughout the cell life. Thus, the history of storage for the cell must be also be taken into account when considering losses in capacity...|$|R

40|$|The current {{acceptance}} criteria for structural masonry {{in accordance with}} International Building Code allows for the prism <b>test</b> <b>method</b> to be used. However, without a proper understanding {{of the effects of}} variable material properties such as individual masonry unit compressive strength and the various material moduli of elasticity, as well as the effect of field conditions on the unit’s performance, masonry prisms may “fail” to reach the design compressive strength (f’m). By identifying causes of failure and evaluating the failure magnitude, it is concluded that when the masonry prism <b>test</b> <b>method</b> is utilized for acceptance testing of as-built masonry structures, <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> should be performed on the grout in order to fully understand the influence that grout strength and possible grout deformation on the concrete masonry unit during the uniaxial compression test.

40|$|Background: Language is {{important}} for the psychosocial and educational development of a child and is interrelated with cognitive abilities. Language deficits in childhood are associated with many subsequent problems and affect the person concerned through adulthood. The review of language skills in preschool plays a special role. Aim: This dissertation will investigate how language skills can be estimated during the diagnostic process and which cognitive basic competences affect language skills of children aged between four and five years. Different linguistic levels are considered and compared. Methods: Pursuing findings of the construction and norming phase of the language assessment test for children between 3 and 5 years of age (SET 3 - 5; Petermann, 2016) are described in depth and discussed. This includes an examination into what way the current <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> acquire general language standards comply with the interdisciplinary guidelines of linguistic assessment. Furthermore, {{the construction of a new}} language assessment test is described and the relationship of language skills and cognitive skills are illustrated. The results of each study are integrated into a comprehensive model. The empirical analyses are based on data of the construction (N = 316) and standardization (N = 1095) of the SET 3 - 5. Results: The results show a deficiency of evidence-based <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> relating to estimation of language abilities, what requires the development of new <b>test</b> <b>methods.</b> The newly developed test SET 3 - 5 proceeds from this stage with a wide variation of item difficulties, differentiations in various ranges of performance and an intern consistency in the different subtests from satisfying to good. Moreover one of the important outcome was the influence of basic competences like processing performance or memory capacity of the different linguistic levels. The results show as well that the pragmatic communicative competences are associated with the behavior and the socio-emotional development. Conclusion: The results of the present dissertation are contributing an important part to answer the question regarding how to measure the language level in a reliable way and which part the review of cognitive skills in the range of linguistic assessment plays. With regard to the inclusion of a social communication disturbance as an own fault category to the diagnostical and statistical manual of psychological disorders (DSM- 5; Falkai & Wittchen, 2015) first results concerning the influence of cognitive basic competences to pragmatics were found. The focus of scientific research should be the development of <b>additional</b> evidence-based <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> and the design of therapy measures and incentive methods...|$|R
