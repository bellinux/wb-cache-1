5|$|Many guitar picks {{employ the}} Reuleaux triangle, as its shape {{combines}} a sharp point to provide strong articulation, {{with a wide}} tip to produce a warm timbre.

5|$|Casey {{hoped to}} become Chief of Engineers when Lieutenant General Raymond A. Wheeler retired in 1948, but President Harry S. Truman passed him over {{in favor of}} the Missouri River Division Engineer, Major General Lewis <b>A.</b> <b>Pick.</b> Instead, Casey {{remained}} in Japan as MacArthur's Chief Engineer until Casey's retirement on 31 December 1949. He edited Engineers of the Southwest Pacific, a seven-volume series about their wartime service. He received a number of foreign awards for his service, including the Distinguished Service Star from the Philippines, the Commander of the Order of the British Empire from Australia, the Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau from the Netherlands, and the Officer of Légion d'honneur from France.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the station were for access to be from Monmouth Road, which runs {{parallel}} to the railway, north of the line. There {{was to be a}} fully accessible footbridge across the line, with both ramp and stairs, as well as a pedestrian crossing across Monmouth Road and a lit 50-space car park on the old goods yard at the eastern end of Monmouth Road. The very end of the goods yard would be maintained for Network Rail access. These plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on Station Road. The new plans have the entrance to be on Station Road, at the east end of the site, meaning there would be no need for a footbridge. There would be disabled parking and <b>a</b> <b>pick</b> up/drop off point adjacent to the entrance, although the exact design of this area is still under consideration. Noise mitigation options are to be investigated and there will be improvements to local footpaths. The line is due to reopen in 2020.|$|E
5|$|Modell said {{he would}} look outside the Browns {{organization}} for a new coach, a break from past hirings that drew from the team's own ranks. Peter Hadhazy, who Modell had hired as the Browns' first general manager, recommended a 45-year-old New Orleans Saints receivers coach named Sam Rutigliano. After an interview before Christmas in which Modell and Rutigliano spent hours talking and watching game film in Modell's basement, the owner named him head coach on December 27, 1977. An affable, charismatic man with an even temper, Rutigliano was {{a stark contrast to}} Gregg. Sipe immediately flourished under Rutigliano, racking up 21 touchdowns and 2,906 passing yards during the 1978 season, when the NFL moved to a 16-game schedule. His prime targets were Reggie Rucker, a veteran receiver the Browns signed in 1975, and Ozzie Newsome, a rookie tight end out of Alabama who the Browns drafted with <b>a</b> <b>pick</b> acquired in the Phipps trade. Cleveland won its first three games, but poor defense dashed the team's playoff chances and the Browns finished with an 8–8 record.|$|E

5|$|The Astros {{have made}} 12 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft. They have made the first overall selection in the draft five times; in 1976, 1992, 2012, 2013, and 2014. They have had 16 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Astros have failed to sign three of their first-round picks. First, pitcher Randy Scarbery (1970) did not sign though the Astros received no pick in compensation. John Burke (1991) and Brady Aiken (2014) also did not sign. The Astros were given the 37th pick of the 1992 draft and <b>a</b> <b>pick</b> in the 2015 draft in compensation.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{entered the}} 2010 NHL Entry Draft without a {{selection}} {{in the first}} two rounds. They would have picked 13th overall, however that pick was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes as part of a 2009 trade for Olli Jokinen. Their second round pick went to the Chicago Blackhawks as part of a 2008 deal in which Calgary acquired Rene Bourque. The Flames' first selection was early in the third round, <b>a</b> <b>pick</b> acquired from the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Anton Stralman. They selected Max Reinhart with that pick. His father Paul was also a former Flames draft pick. Calgary made one trade at the draft, sending their sixth round pick (163rd overall) to the Sharks in exchange for goaltender Henrik Karlsson.|$|E
5|$|After he {{graduated}} from Warren High School in Arkansas, where he played football as a wide receiver, Gragg committed to the University of Arkansas along with three other Warren players. Although he spent his freshman season as a receiver on the Arkansas Razorbacks football squad, the coaching staff converted Gragg into a tight end in 2010. In his sophomore and junior seasons, the Razorbacks made appearances in Bowl Championship Series games and defeated the Kansas State Wildcats in the 2012 Cotton Bowl Classic, which culminated the 2011 season. A knee injury caused Gragg to miss eight games in his senior season as the Arkansas team finished with a losing record. Invited {{to participate in the}} NFL Scouting Combine, an evaluative competition among prospective NFL players, Gragg ran the fastest 40-yard dash time and had the second-highest vertical jump among tight ends in attendance; in the draft, the Bills chose Gragg with the 222nd overall selection, <b>a</b> <b>pick</b> Buffalo acquired from a trade with the St. Louis Rams. One of five tight ends in spring training, he made Buffalo's regular-season roster and played in nine regular-season games during the 2013 NFL season. He then played in 10 games in 2014 and 13 games in 2015 before missing the entire 2016 season due to injury.|$|E

5|$|In the off-season, Colorado had two first-round picks. Present at the draft, former Avalanche great Joe Sakic {{served his}} first duties as new {{alternate}} governor and adviser of hockey {{operations of the}} club. With their first pick, second overall, they selected Gabriel Landeskog, the young captain of the Kitchener Rangers. Second, they selected defenseman Duncan Siemens 11th overall, <b>a</b> <b>pick</b> acquired from the St. Louis Blues in the controversial trade that sent power-forward Chris Stewart, long time top prospect Kevin Shattenkirk and a second round pick to the Blues {{in exchange for their}} first round pick, veteran Jay McClement and 2006 former first overall pick, Erik Johnson. A complete overhaul at the goal tending position sent Peter Budaj to the Montreal Canadiens and Brian Elliott to St. Louis, Elliott having been acquired from the Ottawa Senators for Craig Anderson during the team's downward spiral the season previous. Goalie Semyon Varlamov was dealt to Colorado from the Washington Capitals for a first and second pick, while veteran netminder and former Conn Smythe Trophy winner Jean-Sebastien Giguere was {{signed as a free agent}} in hopes to mentor the young Varlamov. Duncan Siemens was sent back to his major junior team, the Saskatoon Blades in camp, while Gabriel Landeskog made the opening night roster against the Detroit Red Wings on October 8, 2011, at Pepsi Center. Adam Deadmarsh was promoted from video/developmental coach to offensive assistant coach after Steve Konowalchuk accepted a job as head coach in the minor league.|$|E

40|$|The primary step in {{the process}} of {{developing}} <b>a</b> <b>picking</b> robot is to define its specifications. Then, a decision on whether the robot should move along the plants or the plants to move along the robot has to be made. Other aspects dealing with the economics of the robot (investment and annual costs), working time and required picking speed are decided on. This paper addresses these questions and concludes that <b>a</b> <b>picking</b> robot will be more feasible in a traditional stationary production system than in mobile production systems. For a 2 ha nursery, approximately 8 robots working 12 h a day with <b>a</b> <b>picking</b> speed of one fruit per 3 seconds, are needed to cover the main work load involved in harvesting tomatoes throughout the year. Hence, the room for investment per robot amounts to NLG 89, 000. Based on these findings, this paper presents a technological concept of <b>a</b> <b>picking</b> robot for fruit vegetables...|$|R

25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with <b>a</b> <b>pick,</b> but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or <b>a</b> <b>pick.</b> Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use <b>a</b> <b>pick</b> occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E
