5|$|Due to the {{relativistic}} {{stabilization of}} flerovium's 7s27p valence electron configuration, the 0 oxidation state should <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> stable for flerovium than for lead, as the 7p1/2 electrons begin to also exhibit a mild inert pair effect: this stabilization of the neutral state may bring about some {{similarities between the}} behaviour of flerovium and the noble gas radon. Due to the expected relative inertness of flerovium, its diatomic compounds FlH and FlF should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding lead compounds PbH and PbF. Flerovium(IV) should be even more electronegative than lead(IV); lead(IV) has electronegativity 2.33 on the Pauling scale; the lead(II) value is only 1.87.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E

5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located in}} a recess in the skull base known as the sella turcica ("Turkish saddle", after its shape). It is attached to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, by a stalk that also contains the blood vessels that supply the gland. It is unclear why pituitary tumors are five times more likely to bleed than other tumors in the brain. There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either infarction (insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction) or hemorrhage. The {{pituitary gland}} normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus, but tumors develop a blood supply from the nearby inferior hypophyseal artery that generates a higher blood pressure, possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding. Tumors may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure, and the blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage. It has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction (infarction followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue). Larger tumors are more prone to bleeding, and more rapidly growing lesions (as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein PCNA) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy.|$|E

25|$|Since {{many new}} arbitrants {{would have been}} expecting to litigate claims, the {{arbitration}} should be sensitive to that and allow more extensive discovery processes before the hearing, with the steady guidance of an arbitrator to ensure that aspect of the process did not become as time-consuming {{as it had in}} litigation.

25|$|Women {{who have}} a more {{unrestricted}} sociosexual orientation index may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> likely to resist mate guarding too. This type of sociosexuality is defined by more promiscuity {{and low levels of}} intimacy in relationships. Related to this, females who report less investment in their current relationship also exhibit more resistance to mate guarding by avoiding contact with their partner. This strategy along with resisting control has also been found to be more widely used for women who report less intimacy in their relationship.|$|E

Additionally there will be graphic visualisations providing further clarification and comparison between different data sets and comparison over time using data from earlier censuses. There will <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> specialist reports and products. Certain data bases will also be produced in the Welsh language.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted, however, that, {{due to the}} {{different}} rates set by each city's taxi regulators, renting a taxi for a 12-hour shift in Boston can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> expensive than in New York City. Using figures from the New York Taxi & Limousine Commission and the Boston Police Department's Hackney Carriage Unit, actual rates for the Chicago newspaper's hypothetical five-mile trip with five minutes wait time in Boston is $18.60. In New York, the same trip can cost either $15, $15.50 or $16, depending on time of day, due to varying surcharges and the fifty-cents NY State Sales tax added to each fare.|$|E

25|$|Individual differences, such as {{skill at}} {{engaging}} active coping techniques and comfort with expressing emotions, may modify {{the tendency to}} successfully employ emotional approach coping. Individuals high in perceived emotional intelligence may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> likely to use emotional approach coping skillfully. Holding unrealistic perceptions of control may make the use of coping through emotional approach less likely because expressing and processing emotions could lead to evaluations that result in acknowledgement of illusions of control. Personality attributes, such as hope, can also moderate the effectiveness of emotional approach coping. Women with breast cancer who were high in hope and reported coping with emotional expression, had fewer medical appointments for cancer-related complaints, enhanced physical health and decreased distress compared to women who did not cope using emotional expression.|$|E
25|$|The {{more modern}} {{idea of a}} piece of a {{winemaking}} equipment used to extract the juice from the skins probably emerged during the Greco-Roman periods where written accounts by Cato the Elder, Marcus Terentius Varro, Pliny the Elder and others described wooden wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert pressure on the pomace. The wines produced by these presses were usually darker, with more color extracted from the skins but could <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> harsh with bitter tannins also extracted. That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church leading to the modern tank batch and continuous presses used in wineries today.|$|E
25|$|In Wisconsin, a town is an unincorporated {{jurisdiction}} {{within a}} county; Wisconsin towns {{are similar to}} civil townships in other states. All areas in the state {{that have not been}} incorporated as cities or villages are parts of towns. Towns provide a limited number of services to their residents. The U.S. Census considers Wisconsin towns to be minor civil divisions. As of 2015, Wisconsin had 1,255 towns. Towns often have the same names as adjacent cities or villages. For example, the unincorporated Town of Cedarburg is adjacent to the city of Cedarburg, and the Town of New Glarus completely surrounds the village of New Glarus. There may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than one town in the state (although not in a county) with the same name. For example, there are towns named Albion in Dane County, Jackson County, and Trempealeau County.|$|E
