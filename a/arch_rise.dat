40|$|Nowadays in Malaysia, many {{contractors}} and developers {{are still struggling}} {{to catch up with}} the current pace of development, especially in meeting country's demand, as conventional construction methods still work. Although traditional practice, this conventional method has several disadvantages such as high labor and material costs, and especially, a tendency not to change production of construction waste. Therefore, to overcome these weaknesses, permanent formwork using lightweight concrete is chosen as an alternative solution. In short, the new technology existence in construction to overcome this problem is permanent formwork using lightweight concrete which is more useful than conventional methods in terms of effectiveness of the functions, lighter, safety features and productivity. The main objective of this study is to determine the density and compressive strength of lightweight concrete to be used as arch slab by using polystyrene beads. The tests will be conducted is to find compressive strength and the displacement of the arch slab. All the procedures are prepared accordingly, to assure the research objectives are applicable, and to secure proper sequence and smooth running of the entire flow, from start until end. Six samples will provided, which three of them are 50 mm and the rest is 75 mm. All six samples of the slab tile are concreted at Heavy Structure Laboratory, Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) and compressive strength test also conducted at same laboratory. Meanwhile the flexural test is conducted at Tensile Laboratory. From the theoretically calculation of arch tile of 50 mm <b>arch</b> <b>rise</b> have highest horizontal and vertical force compared than <b>arch</b> <b>rise</b> 75 mm with difference average load 1. 267 kN. While displacement of <b>arch</b> <b>rise</b> 50 mm have highest displacement compared than arch tile of 75 mm with difference displacement 0. 463 mm because of its geometry. Meanwhile, the density of fresh concrete with and without EPS also has difference about 68 kg/m 3. As conclusion, EPS can be used as extenuating agent in concrete. However, from the observation, we can hardly distinguish which of this arch tile is stronger. Besides that, the development of the graph pattern for each sample is not consistent, thus explains the indifferences of the load bearing capacity...|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} to strengthen existing masonry vaults consisting {{in the application}} at the extrados of a GFRP mesh reinforced mortar coating is herein presented. The effectiveness of the technique is investigated through non-linearstaticanalysisutilizinga 2 Dsmearcrackmodel. Solidbrickbarrelvaultswiththreedifferent aspect ratio between the <b>arch</b> <b>rise</b> and the curvature radius are considered (1, 0. 75 and 0. 6). Two different load patterns are analyzed: vertical and horizontal load, with distributions proportional to the self-weight. The mechanical characteristics of the masonry, the GFRP mesh and the reinforced mortar coating are assessed through experimental tests. The simulations permitted to evaluate the collapse mechanisms of the vaults, governed by the flexural behavior. The great effectiveness of the reinforcement technique was evidenced by comparing both the resistance and the displacement capacity of reinforced and unreinforced vaults...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{consists in}} the experimental and theoretical investigation of the finite deflection and buckling of two similar structures; the low arch or slightly curved beam and the shallow spherical dome, both subjected to lateral loads. These structures are of interest because the large interaction between bending and axial forces causes their load-deflection behavior to become nonlinear at very low values of the deflection. Due to the wide difference in the methods of solution of these two problems they are separated into two parts, each having its own abstract. [Part I] When a low arch (a thin curved beam of small curvature) is subjected to a lateral loading acting {{toward the center of}} curvature, the axial thrust induced by the bending of the arch may cause the arch to buckle so that the curvature becomes suddenly reversed. The critical lateral loading depends on the dimensions and rigidity of the arch, the elasticity of the the end fixation, the type of load distribution, and the initial curvature of the arch. A general solution of the problem is given in this paper, using the classical buckling criterion which is based on the stability with respect to infinitesimal displacements about the equilibrium positions. For a sinusoidal arch under sinusoidal loading, the critical load can be expressed exactly as a simple function of the beam dimension parameters. For other arch shapes and load distributions, approximate values of the critical load can be obtained by summing a few terms of a rapidly converging Fourier series. The effect of initial end thrust and axial and lateral elastic support are discussed. The buckling load based on the energy criterion of Karman and Tsien is also calculated. The results for both the classical and the energy criteria are compared with experiments made on a series of centrally loaded, pin-ended arches. For larger values of a dimensionless parameter [gamma subscript l], which is proportional to the ratio of the <b>arch</b> <b>rise</b> to the arch thickness, the experimental critical buckling loads agreed quite well with the classical criterion, but, for smaller values of [gamma subscript l], the experimental critical loads were appreciably below those calculated from the classical criterion, although they were always above those obtained from the energy criterion. [Part II] The shallow spherical dome subjected to lateral pressure is a structure for which the deformation departs appreciably from the linear theory at very small values of the deflection amplitude. It is also. one for which the buckling process is characterized by a rapid decrease in the equilibrium load once the buckling load has been surpassed. For structures having this type of buckling characteristic, the question arises as to whether the proper buckling criterion to apply is the classical criterion, which considers equilibrium with respect to infinitesimal displacements or the finite displacement "energy criterion" proposed by Tsien. In this paper the problem of the finite displacement and buckling of a shallow spherical dome is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. In the theoretical approach the nonlinear equations are converted into a sequence of linear equations by expanding all of the variables in powers of the center deflection and then equating the coefficients of equal powers. The basic parameter for the shallow dome is proportional to the ratio of the central height of the dome, h, to its thickness, t. For small values of this ratio the expansions converge rapidly and enough terms are computed to determine the buckling load. For higher values of h/t, convergence deteriorates rapidly and the buckling, load is not computed. However, even for these higher values of h/t the deflection shapes are determined for deflection amplitudes below the amplitude at which buckling occurs. These deflection shapes are characterized by their rapid change as h/t increases and by the fact that, over most of the range of h/t studied, the maximum deflection does not occur {{at the center of the}} dome. The experimental program was carried out on a series of clamped-edge, eight inch base diameter shells, subjected to uniform pressure. The deflection shapes and the buckling loads agreed quite well with the values computed theoretically. It was also found that there was no significant difference between the buckling loads observed using air pressure and those observed using oil pressure. Thus it is concluded that for the shallow domes studied the classical buckling criterion holds rather than the "energy criterion" proposed by Tsien...|$|E
