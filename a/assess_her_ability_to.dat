50|$|After Samantha Carter takes {{control of}} Atlantis, Woolsey once again returns {{in order to}} <b>assess</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> command the expedition. Once again he finds himself {{in the middle of}} a {{dangerous}} situation, including coming face to face with a Wraith for the first time. Eventually he leaves and apparently presents a favourable report of Carter's methods. Although he had claimed to want to produce a report which was as thorough as possible, he indicated to Carter that certain facts would be left out to make the report more favourable to her. In an alternate timeline Woolsey became the leader of Atlantis, after Carter was killed in a kamikaze run against three Hive ships. In this timeline, he ordered every resource in Atlantis to focus on the protection of the city and recalled everyone trying to help other humans in the galaxy who had fallen victim to Michael's plans for galactic domination.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} two areas: (1) teacher {{implementation of}} aesthetic and critical {{activities in the}} classroom; and (2) the nature of fourth and fifth grade students' responses during such activities. A series of lessons were designed and taught to fourth and fifth grade students. The study had two goals: (1) to solicit responses from the students that would illustrate their cognitive levels and their stages of understanding art; and (2) to provide a venue by which the researcher would <b>assess</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> design and facilitate philosophical and interpretive activities. Data from the study indicates that these students recognize expressive qualities of portraits, understand basic symbolism, apply the concept of figurative expression to their own abstract representations, and give clearly stated reasons for their aesthetic beliefs. Reflections on the teacher's {{participation in the study}} indicate need for fine tuning of questioning and facilitating strategies, and a greater historical knowledge of art and aesthetic theories...|$|E
40|$|A {{case study}} of an obese 14 -year-old female was {{conducted}} to assess her body weight and dietary and physical activity habits. The {{purpose of this study}} was to promote weight loss through improved dietary practices and an increase in energy expenditure. This was done by monitoring and altering caloric intake and engaging in regular, vigorous physical activity. Furthermore, the subject increased health-related knowledge, developed new skills, and ultimately attempted behavior modification. From April to September 2009, the subject participated in a minimum of two supervised exercise sessions per week to increase her energy expenditure and to teach her strategies for exercising independently on a regular basis. Further, she was given personalized dietary strategies to promote weight loss and healthy weight management. Anthropometric, cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and resting metabolic rate assessments were conducted at regular intervals. Baseline assessments were performed in early April, and mid-program measurements were taken in early June. Post-testing was conducted in September to evaluate the subject’s final measurements and <b>assess</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> maintain healthy habits, while transitioning from a more structured schedule during the school year to one with more leisure time during her summer break. The subject increased health behaviors from baseline to mid-program testing, but regressed between mid- and post-program assessments. Results reflected these patterns...|$|E
40|$|Ms. L, a 32 -year-old G 5 P 2 A 2 (gravida 5, para 2, abortions 2) woman, is {{admitted}} to hospital because of premature rupture of membranes {{at an estimated}} 34 weeks of gestation. She has had only intermittent prenatal care and no prenatal tests. This is an unplanned pregnancy, {{and she is not}} sure of the time of conception. Her 2 older children have been in foster care since birth, because child welfare authorities <b>assessed</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> parent as inadequate at the time; 1 child {{is in the process of}} adoption. Although child welfare authorities have documented a history of problem drinking, the woman denies any drinking during the current pregnancy. Her physical and neurologic examinations are unremarkable. Although she has sought routine prenatal care only periodically during her pregnancy, she describes developing a desire to parent this child in recent weeks. She denies any "recent " use of alcohol or cocaine, but will not be more specific. Informed consent for drug testing is obtained; no alcohol is detected in her blood, and a urine toxic screen is negative for cocaine, heroin, amphetamines and cannabinoids. Her hemoglobin level is 130 g/L, leukocyte count is 8. 5 109 /L, mean corpuscular volume is 82 fL...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Balint's Syndrome {{is a rare}} condition, often {{associated}} with hypoxic brain damage. The major characteristic is an inability to localise objects in space, another is simultanagnosia frequently resulting in reading difficulties. We present RN, a 37 year old woman whose major problem with reading was her inability to recognise individual letters correctly in either lower or upper case. We noted, however, that she was better if the letters were shown in red type. The aims were to determine if RN could relearn {{letters of the alphabet}}, investigate whether colour affected <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> learn, and to explore more specifically whether the red type also helped her to read words. METHOD: Using a single case experimental ABA design, we first determined that the optimal font for RN was size 16. In the baseline (A) phase, we <b>assessed</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> read all lower and upper case letters of the alphabet in black ink. In the intervention (B) phase we used font size 16 in red ink and an errorless learning approach to teaching the letters. Sessions ran 5 times per week (20 minutes per session). The intervention was then applied to picture recognition and word reading with four sets of 10 words and corresponding pictures. RESULTS: A consistent difference was noted between initial baseline and intervention. Improvement carried over when we returned to baseline. CONCLUSION: Using red type and an errorless learning approach enabled RN to re-learn letters of the alphabet and read words she was previously unable to read. This did not however generalise to her everyday life...|$|R
