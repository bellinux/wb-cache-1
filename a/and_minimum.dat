40|$|In {{the seminal}} {{contribution}} [4] the joint weak convergence of maxima <b>and</b> <b>minima</b> of weakly dependent stationary sequences is derived under some mild asymptotic conditions. In this {{paper we address}} additionally the case of incomplete samples assuming that the average proportion of incompleteness converges in probability to some random variable. We show the joint weak convergence of the maxima <b>and</b> <b>minima</b> of both complete and incomplete samples.

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the NFL, {{contractual}} negotiations took place between individual players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining. A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules <b>and</b> <b>minimum</b> payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{can be used}} {{to prove}} an isoperimetric {{inequality}} for surfaces whose Gaussian curvature is a non-increasing function of the distance from the origin, such as the paraboloid. On such a surface, the smooth compact set that has any given area <b>and</b> <b>minimum</b> perimeter for that area is necessarily a circle centered at the origin. The proof applies the curve-shortening flow to two curves, a metric circle and the boundary of any other compact set, and compares the change in perimeter of the two curves as they are both reduced to a point by the flow.|$|E

5|$|There {{are some}} {{circumstances}} {{where this is}} not the case, and it is desirable to make the width of the transition line larger than the Doppler profile. For instance, when tracking a quickly accelerating object, the band-pass of the ALF must include within it the maximum <b>and</b> <b>minimum</b> values for the reflected light. The accepted method for increasing the band-pass involves placing an inert gas in the vapor cell. This gas both widens the spectral line and increases the transmission rate of the filter.|$|E
5|$|As the JMA issued {{their first}} advisory, the JTWC {{designated}} {{the system as}} Tropical Depression 09W while located about 280km (175mi) east-northeast of Iwo Jima. Early the next day, the JMA classified Maria as a severe tropical storm with winds of 95km/h (60mph 10-minute winds) while the JTWC reported that Maria had just become a tropical storm with winds reaching 75km/h (45mph 1-minute winds). The storm also had a slight northward relocation. Tracking towards the northwest, the storm intensified into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity with winds of 130km/h (80mph 10-minute winds) <b>and</b> <b>minimum</b> pressure of 975hPa (mbar) at 0900UTC. Around the same time, the JTWC assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 110km/h (70mph 1-minute winds). However, the JTWC operationally classified Maria as a minimal typhoon with winds of 120km/h (75mph 1-minute winds) on August7.|$|E

Herne Bay is sometimes warmer than other parts of Kent as it is backed by the North Downs to the south. Between 1999 and 2005, Herne Bay recorded the highest daily temperature in the United Kingdom nine times. East Kent's average annual rainfall is about 728mm (29inches), the wettest months being October to January. This was lower than the national average annual rainfall of 838mm (33inches), and recent droughts have led to hosepipe bans by Mid Kent Water.|$|E

The Vinson-Trammell Act limited profit from a ship's construction to 10percent, while the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act specified a minimum wage and required working conditions for workers. The latter act greatly affected {{the ability of the}} navy to acquire steel, as the text of the law caused friction between executives in the industry, who greatly disliked the forty-hour work week <b>and</b> <b>minimum</b> wage requirements, and their workers—who themselves were embroiled in a separate dispute pitting the union of the skilled workers, the American Federation of Labor, against the union of the unskilled, the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Amid the unrest, the navy ran into difficulties trying to acquire 18million pounds of steel to build six destroyers and three submarines; many more pounds than this would be needed for the new battleships.|$|E
5|$|The players went {{on strike}} on July 13, 1970 after the owners locked them out for a brief period. The strike lasted for two days ending with a new four year CBA which was reached after the owners {{threatened}} to cancel the season. Due to the new agreement, the union won the right for players to bargain through their own agents with the clubs, <b>and</b> <b>minimum</b> salaries were increased to $12,500 for rookies and $13,000 for veterans. Also, players' pensions were improved and dental care {{was added to the}} players' insurance plans. Players also gained the right to select representation on the league's retirement board and the right to impartial arbitration for injury grievances. Following the 1970 agreement, many union representatives were released by their teams. Unfazed, the players were determined to create a stronger union through better communication. Attorney Ed Garvey was hired by the NFLPA in 1971 to act as their first executive director, and the NFLPA became officially certified as a union by the NLRB the same year. Headquarters were established in Washington, D.C. and a campaign was launched to help inform players of their rights.|$|E
