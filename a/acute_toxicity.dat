5|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>{{toxicity}}</b> has {{not been}} seen in humans, and the toxicity depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median lethal dose (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E
5|$|Metallic gallium is not toxic. However, {{exposure}} to gallium halide complexes {{can result in}} <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity.</b> The Ga3+ ion of soluble gallium salts tends to form the insoluble hydroxide when injected in large doses; precipitation of this hydroxide resulted in renal toxicity in animals. In lower doses, soluble gallium is tolerated well and does not accumulate as a poison, instead being excreted mostly through urine. Excretion of gallium occurs in two phases: the first phase has a biological half-life of one hour while the second has a biological half-life of twenty-five hours.|$|E
5|$|The acute oral {{toxicity}} for chromium(VI) ranges between 50 and 150µg/kg. In the body, chromium(VI) {{is reduced}} by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism, by which also sulfate and phosphate ions enter the cell. The <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> of chromium(VI) is due to its strong oxidational properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. Hemolysis, renal, and liver failure result. Aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic.|$|E

However, the differences of metals and organics <b>acute</b> <b>toxicities</b> to V. fischeri have not been compared. Here, four heavy metals (Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Cd 2 +, Cr 6 +) and five organics (phenol, benzoic acid, p-hydroxy benzoic acid, nitro-benzene and benzene) <b>acute</b> <b>toxicities</b> to V. fischeri were investigated. Heavy metals toxicities to V. fischeri were increased along with the reaction time, while the organics toxicities kept the same level in different reaction times. In order to explain the difference, the relative cell death rate of V. fischeri was detected. In metals toxicities tests, the bioluminescence inhibition rate of V. fischeri {{was found to be}} significantly higher than the relative cell death rate (P< 0. 05), while for the organics toxicities tests, the cell death rate was similar to the bioluminescence inhibition rate. These results indicated that organics <b>acute</b> <b>toxicities</b> to V. fischeri could reflect the death of cell, but metals <b>acute</b> <b>toxicities</b> to V. fischeri may not lead to the death of cell, just represent the bioluminescence inhibition...|$|R

5|$|The phallotoxins {{consist of}} at least seven compounds, {{all of which have}} seven similar peptide rings. Phalloidin was {{isolated}} in 1937 by Feodor Lynen, Heinrich Wieland's student and son-in-law, and Ulrich Wieland of the University of Munich. Though phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells, they have since been found to add little to the death cap's toxicity, as they are not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, phalloidin is also found in the edible (and sought-after) Blusher (Amanita rubescens). Another group of minor active peptides are the virotoxins, which consist of six similar monocyclic heptapeptides.

First generation anticoagulant rodenticides (FGARs) generally require multiple feedings over several days to achieve a threshold concentration in tissue and cause adverse effects.

25|$|Also paeoniflorin {{seems to}} have a detoxifying effect on the <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> of {{aconitine}} in test animals. This may result from alternations of pharmacokinetic behavior of aconitine in the animals due to the pharmacokinetic interaction between aconitine and paeoniflorin. In addition, in emergencies, one can wash the stomach using either tannic acid or powdered charcoal. Heart stimulants such as strong coffee or caffeine may also help until professional help is available.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{toxicity}} {{results when}} {{the amount of}} circulating iron exceeds the amount of transferrin available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet over-consumption rather than variations in diet. The type of <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> from iron ingestion causes severe mucosal damage in the gastrointestinal tract, among other problems.|$|E
25|$|The <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> of {{n-butanol}} {{is relatively}} low, with oral LD50 values of 790–4,360mg/kg (rat; comparable values for ethanol are 7,000–15,000mg/kg). No deaths were reported at an inhaled concentration of 8,000ppm (4-hour exposure, rats). At sub-lethal doses, n-butanol {{acts as a}} depressant of the central nervous system, similar to ethanol: one study in rats indicated that the intoxicating potency of n-butanol is some six times {{higher than that of}} ethanol, possibly because of its slower transformation by alcohol dehydrogenase.|$|E

25|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> is dose-related; skin {{exposure}} to ready-to-use glyphosate formulations can cause irritation, and photocontact dermatitis has been occasionally reported. These effects are {{probably due to}} the preservative benzisothiazolin-3-one. Severe skin burns are very rare. Inhalation is a minor route of exposure, but spray mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, or tingling and irritation in the throat. Eye exposure may lead to mild conjunctivitis. Superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation is delayed or inadequate.|$|E
25|$|Manganese {{may affect}} liver function, but the {{threshold}} of <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> is very high. On the other hand, more than 95% of manganese is eliminated by biliary excretion. Any existing liver damage may slow this process, increasing its concentration in blood plasma. The exact neurotoxic mechanism of manganese is uncertain but there are clues pointing at the interaction of manganese with iron, zinc, aluminum, and copper. Based {{on a number of}} studies, disturbed iron metabolism could underlie the neurotoxic action of manganese.|$|E
25|$|In general, <b>acute</b> <b>{{toxicity}}</b> {{occurs at}} doses of 25,000 IU/kg {{of body weight}}, with chronic toxicity occurring at 4,000 IU/kg of body weight daily for 6–15 months.

In people with renal failure, 4000 IU can cause substantial damage. Signs of toxicity may occur with long-term consumption of vitamin A at doses of 25,000-33,000 IU per day.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: High-dose {{chemotherapy}} (HDCT) as consolidation after conventional-dose {{salvage therapy}} {{may increase the}} response and survival rates in patients with relapsed or refractory germ cell cancer. This dose-escalation leads to severe haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities as nephrotoxicity, hearing impairment and neurotoxicity. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate <b>acute</b> and late <b>toxicities</b> after HDCT for relapsed or progressive germ cell cancer (GCC). Patients and methods: <b>Acute</b> <b>toxicities</b> (nephro-, neuro- and ototoxicity) where evaluated retrospectivally in 257 patients treated with HDCT in two phase I/II multicenter studies. 145 patients were treated with 2 conventional cycles of PEI (cisplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide) followed by 1 cycle of HD-CEI (carboplatin, etoposide, ifosfamide); 112 patients were treated with 3 cycles of conventional dosed TIP (cisplatin, ifosfamide, paclitaxel) followed by 1 cylce of HD-CET (carboplatin, etoposide, thiotepa). The late toxicities were investigated by interviews and questionnaires of long-term survivors in both sudy-groups. Toxicities where classified according to the modified criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Results: Acute nephrotoxicity was more common after PEI/CEI than after TIP/CET, whereas acute neuro- and ototoxicity were seen more often following TIP/CET; <b>acute</b> <b>toxicities</b> did not differ significantly between the two patient groups. In long-term follow-up, the incidence of nephrotoxicity did not differ between both patient groups and almost all patients had normal serum-creatinin-values. However, patients of the PEI/CEI-regime showed a progression of high-grade neurotoxicities (WHO°III and IV) whereas we found an improvement of neurotoxicities after TIP/CET. High grade hearing impairment was common in both patient groups increasing in the long-term follow-up. Statistically, the results were not significant. Conclusion: The increased response and favorable outcome in patients with poor prognosis GCC is highly associated with <b>acute</b> and late <b>toxicities</b> after HDCT. <b>Acute</b> <b>toxicities</b> depend on the chosen HD-regime whereas late sequelae seem to be independent of the treatment-regime. Especially nephrotoxicity seems to be reversible whereas neuro- and ototoxicity may even increase. Further clinical trials should evaluate the sequelae of HDCT treatment for testicular cancer prospectively...|$|R

25|$|The natural arsenic {{pollution}} {{occurs because}} aquifer sediments contain organic matter that generates anaerobic {{conditions in the}} aquifer.

As a consequence, arsenic-rich groundwater is often iron-rich, although secondary processes often obscure the association of dissolved arsenic and dissolved iron.. Arsenic is found in groundwater most commonly as the reduced species arsenite and the oxidized species arsenate, being the <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> of arsenite somewhat greater than that of arsenate.

25|$|Copper {{toxicity}} {{can occur}} from excessive supplement use, eating acid foods cooked in uncoated copper cookware, exposure to excess copper in drinking water, {{or as the}} result of an inherited metabolic disorder in the case of Wilson's disease. A significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state. This catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions, such as hydroxyl radical {{in a manner similar to}} Fenton chemistry. This catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes with which it is associated, thus is only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. This increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed oxidative stress, and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity.</b>|$|E
40|$|High-dose {{methotrexate}} (HD-MTX) {{is commonly}} accepted {{as the most}} effective option for first-line therapy in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). In this context, patients often suffer from <b>acute</b> <b>toxicities</b> potentially limiting their prognosis. However, prognostic factors that may be helpful for developing individual risk-adapted HD-MTX-based treatment strategies have not been established yet. This study focused on two aspects: 1. Identification of independent prognostic factors for <b>acute</b> HD-MTX-related <b>toxicities</b> in PCNSL {{for the first time}} ever, 2. Development of prognostic scoring systems to assess the individual risk of the patient for selected <b>acute</b> <b>toxicities</b> before treatment implementation. This study was based on a phase 3 trial with 526 evaluable immunocompetent PCNSL patients undergoing therapy with HD-MTX or HD-MTX+ifosfamide (G-PCNSL-SG- 1 study). Patient-related, pre-therapeutic variables (baseline variables) and <b>acute</b> HD-MTX <b>toxicities</b> were included in univariate and multivariate analyses to identify prognostic factors. The prognostic scoring systems were developed by calculating individual prognostic scores for each patient, followed by deployment of three patient risk groups for each toxicity. The following baseline variables were identified as prognostic factors for the respective toxicities (p 25 vs. ≤ 25 kg/m 2 for hemoglobin; BMI ≤ 25 vs. > 25 kg/m 2 for state of consciousness; elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase yes vs. no for pulmonary toxicity and infection; preexisting pulmonary disease yes vs. no for platelets, hematologic toxicity and state of consciousness; preexisting cardiovascular disease yes vs. no for cardiac function; preexisting cardiovascular disease no vs. yes for granulocytes and transaminases; therapeutic regimen (HD-MTX+ifosfamide vs. HD-MTX) for hemoglobin, leukocytes, granulocytes, platelets, hematologic toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, infection and cardiac function. The prognostic scoring systems demonstrated a risk to develop hematologic toxicity of 20 %, 34. 2 % and 44. 4 % in the low, intermediate and high risk group. The respective percentages for infection were 17. 5 %, 27. 1 % and 45. 3 %. For the first time ever, valid prognostic factors were identified and prognostic scoring systems were developed for <b>acute</b> <b>toxicities</b> from HD-MTX-based treatment in PCNSL. These findings could be of high relevance for the development of individualized HD-MTX-based treatment approaches for PCNSL patients in the future...|$|R
