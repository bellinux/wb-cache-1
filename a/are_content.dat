5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case a DVI-D monitor {{would have the same}} level of basic interoperability unless there <b>are</b> <b>content</b> protection issues with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI, instead of RGB. An HDMI source such as a Blu-ray player may demand HDCP-compliance of the display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication {{is that there is a}} small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.|$|E
5|$|They {{eventually}} {{find and}} purchase Vanilla, who acts {{as if she}} suffers from psychological trauma. While {{on a date with}} the sexaroid, Vanilla recovers her memories of having been ordered to bury her master's corpse by her mistress. Meanwhile, Ichiro is captured by agents of the SG Corporation. Learning of this, the sexaroid leaves to rescue him, against the wishes of another reprogrammer, Psycho Candy. Captured, tagged for destruction, and reunited with Ichiro, the sexaroid finds himself ordered by Ichiro to switch places with him and escape. Ichiro then gives the sexaroid a name, Itsuki. With Itsuki's tag for destruction, Ichiro is killed at the moment his father finally recognizes him. Doll concludes with SG Corporation's scandal and subsequent bankruptcy, as Motohiko and his wife <b>are</b> <b>content</b> with knowing that they left Dolls in the world, while Vanilla and Itsuki live together in a house purchased by Ichiro.|$|E
5|$|A {{preponderance}} of historians favour {{the story that}} though the Victorious had sailed through the Lombok Strait rather than the Sunda, Britain had come off easily the best through {{a show of force}} during the Sunda Straits Crisis. Numerous accounts, including Gregory Fremont-Barnes' History of Counterinsurgency, <b>are</b> <b>content</b> with a simplified version that Indonesia closed the Strait for one reason or another, and that the arrival of the task force assembled around the aging carrier had intimidated Sukarno into reopening it. A common argument is that the passage was an effective and daring show of force, and often ignores the Sunda Strait issue altogether. This was a sentiment shown by the crew of the Victorious herself, who during their passage through the Lombok Strait went to action stations at the sight of an Indonesian submarine and prepared to fire on it if there was any sign of hostility, and believed that the Indonesians thought it wiser to hold back in fear of their power. This was not a view that the British official reports sought to dissuade, depicting the result as a compromise concession by the Indonesians, who had in brinksmanship terms, 'blinked first' after British refusal to back down. The Foreign Office even went to the extremity of claiming that the Lombok Strait was just as convenient for passage as the Sunda Strait, despite its far greater distance from Singapore and Australia. At the very least, the subsequent Indonesian United Nations defeat and Abdul Rahman's agreement to avoid retaliation was a very positive result for Britain to take from the incident.|$|E

[...] Lawrence finishes his review noting, [...] "Hollywood Undead <b>are</b> <b>content</b> to deliver clichés– more out of a lack of imagination than cynical opportunism, but it still smacks of both.

Books and a vase lay strewn across the floor, while Lewis weeps in the corner and Haynes watches from a distance teary-eyed. The video switches to several other shots of Lewis singing the first verse, looking morose. In a third shot, Lewis is seen standing on a rooftop against the Los Angeles skyline dressed in a dark red crop top. Then the video switches to Lewis standing in front of projected images of the memorable times of her relationship with Haynes. Lewis and Haynes are seen sat at opposite ends of the sofa looking into the distance, spliced with more scenes of Lewis on the rooftop. The couple are seen during an awkward dinner before switching to images of the couple in bed together, seemingly happy. As the chorus kicks in for the first time, the couple are seen arriving at a party, with Lewis wearing an aqua-coloured dress with a portion of her midriff revealed, meanwhile Haynes wears a plaid shirt and jeans. Initially the couple <b>are</b> <b>content,</b> embracing guests but socialising separately and avoiding contact with each other. The camera switches between these and the earlier scenes of Lewis in front of projected images and the LA skyline throughout the chorus. As Lewis sings [...] "I'm a whole lot of trouble/ We're in a whole lot of trouble", she glances over to see Haynes flirting with another girl.|$|E
