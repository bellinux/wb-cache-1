5|$|After 1764, {{under the}} {{ownership}} of James Townsend, the house was remodelled again. The narrow east front was remodelled into <b>an</b> <b>entrance</b> front, and given {{the appearance of a}} typical Georgian house, while the gabled attics on the south front were removed, giving the south facade the appearance it has today.|$|E

5|$|Built between 1117 and 1508, Peterborough Cathedral is {{remarkable}} as the least altered of the Norman cathedrals with only its famous Early English west front, with its later porch and the Perpendicular rebuilding {{of the eastern}} ambulatory by John Wastell being in different styles. J.L.

5|$|Opposite the Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End, which bears an {{electronic}} scoreboard on its roof and can seat {{a maximum of}} 1,800 fans. Originally a home section, the Oak Road End {{was turned into a}} stand for away fans only {{at the start of the}} 1991–92 season. Early in the 2013–14 season, the Oak Road End was re-opened for home supporters for fixtures where visiting support was predicted to be especially low, with the section for away fans moved to A Block of the Kenilworth Stand for these games. Later that season, it was announced that the stand was available for shared use between both home and away supporters, increasing Kenilworth Road's home capacity by 15%. The Oak Road End has <b>an</b> <b>entrance</b> that is often considered unusual, requiring spectators to go through <b>an</b> <b>entrance</b> built into the row of houses and up stairs to the stand.|$|E

It remains uncertain {{if there was a}} second corner tower built in the south-east corner of the castle complex; excavations in 1978 in one possible location failed to find any traces, and a geophysical survey in 1998 proved inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The school {{provides}} day {{education to}} about 900boys aged 10 to 18 and employs approximately 100teachingstaff and around another 100non-teachingstaff.

Admissions are based on <b>an</b> <b>entrance</b> examination and an interview.|$|E
