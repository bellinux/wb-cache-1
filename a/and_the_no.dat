5|$|At {{the start}} of conference play, the Bearcats were 4–1, and their only loss was against top-five {{opponent}} Oklahoma. With Pike still injured, Cincinnati beat Rutgers, 13–10, in the Bearcats' first Big East game of the season. The Bearcats suffered their second defeat {{of the season in}} the following week, however, losing to the UConn Huskies, 40–16. Pike returned from the injury and had the Bearcats leading at halftime, but he left the game at the half when numbness in his non-throwing hand prevented him from being able to take the snap. In the two weeks that followed the loss to the Huskies, Cincinnati recovered to beat two top-25 opponents: No. 23 South Florida and No. 20 West Virginia. The two victories pushed the Bearcats to a 3–1 conference record <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 22 position in the AP Poll before Cincinnati's annual rivalry game against Louisville.

5|$|Audi's No. 7 car of André Lotterer, Marcel Fässler and Benoît Tréluyer won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained their advantage on the race's first lap. Lotterer initially {{pulled away from}} the field but lost the lead to Mark Webber in Porsche's No. 1 car who remained in the position. Co-driver Brendon Hartley remained in first until he retired following heavy contact with Michael Wainwright in the No. 86 Gulf Racing car. This handed the lead to Neel Jani in the sister No. 2 car, but it switched again to Tréluyer when Jani's co-driver Marc Lieb was delayed by a slower vehicle. Although he was challenged by Lieb after being blocked by slower cars Tréluyer pulled away from him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 7 Audi maintained its advantage over the No. 2 Porsche {{for the majority of the}} remainder of the event to finish the race first. However the No. 7 Audi was disqualified when scrutineers discovered that its front skid block was worn out by more than the regulations allowed for, handing the victory to Lieb, Jani and Romain Dumas. Toyota No. 5 drivers Stéphane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi finished in second and Dominik Kraihamer, Alexandre Imperatori and Mathéo Tuscher came in third to secure Rebellion Racing's first podium in the series since 2013.|$|E

5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E

5|$|Four {{hours of}} {{practice}} were {{held for the}} field on Wednesday afternoon, but again suffered from variable wet conditions throughout. The No. 17 Porsche once again led the session although Webber was the fastest driver to set the three minutes and 21.362 seconds lap time. Audi closed to within half a second with Loïc Duval's three minutes and 21.950 seconds lap. The LMP2 category had only a single car manage a lap under three minutes and 40 seconds when Richard Bradley set a three minutes and 39.897 seconds lap, a full second ahead of the No. 34 OAK Ligier-Honda. The KCMG car had earlier caused the session to be red flagged when the car {{came to a stop}} at the first Mulsanne Straight chicane. The Murphy Prototypes Oreca-Nissan later caused a second stoppage when Mark Patterson spun in the Porsche Curves entry and heavily impacted the safety barrier. Patterson was unhurt. The LMGTE Pro category was again led by Aston Martin, Richie Stanaway's No. 99 car setting a three minutes and 55.895 seconds lap, followed by the No. 64 Corvette <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 97 Aston Martin. Mathias Lauda kept the No. 98 Aston Martin ahead in LMGTE Am, nearly two seconds ahead of the two Proton Porsche cars.|$|E
5|$|Further {{down the}} field, {{there was an}} intense battle between Audi and Toyota for {{positions}} three to six. Audi struggled to find an optimum set-up for their cars as they secured fourth and sixth positions. They were separated by the two Toyota vehicles in third and fifth places. André Lotterer was slowed by another car on {{the start of his}} first timed lap and was affected by oversteer on his second lap of the circuit. Marcel Fässler took over the No. 7 Audi entry from Lotterer and abandoned his first attempt because his vehicle's rear-end became excessively light and later lost downforce behind two cars in Blanchimont corner which restricted the car to starting sixth. The two Rebellion Racing cars <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 4 ByKolles Racing CLM P1/01 rounded out the LMP1 qualifiers. Qualifying was stopped for ten minutes when the ByKolles car collided with the No. 43 Manor entry at La Source and debris coming from the former's rear bodywork littered the track at Radallion corner.|$|E
5|$|Historically, two {{breakers}} {{known as}} the Eddy Creek Shaft <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 2 Shaft were situated {{on the banks of}} Eddy Creek. In the late 1800s, a mine fire started in the No. 2 Shaft. As a last resort, water from Eddy Creek and the Lackawanna River were used in an attempt to extinguish it. Historically, there was a dam on the creek. The dam was owned by the Delaware and Hudson Company and was used for impounding water to flush ashes from a power plant. The creek also supplied water for a washery at the Underwood Colliery.|$|E
