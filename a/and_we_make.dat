An {{anonymous}} student spokesman said, [...] "Our terms are resignation of the president or dismissal by the board." [...] According to a flier the dissidents vow to [...] "shut down the school by not attending classes until we are heard, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> steps in the right direction." [...] Aguillard at a forum on March 20 described LC as [...] "an open book regarding our future and our strength and reminding one another it’s not about us, it’s all about Jesus." [...] A reporter for the Alexandria Daily Town Talk attended the forum for forty-five minutes before being asked to leave. Aguillard claimed that the newspaper [...] "printed false information" [...] in recent articles {{about the status of}} the college and its evaluation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.|$|E

In fact, We had in mind the justifiable anxieties which weigh upon them when We published Our encyclical letter Populorum Progressio. But now We join Our voice to that of Our predecessor John XXIII of venerable memory, <b>and</b> <b>We</b> <b>make</b> Our own his words: [...] "No statement of the problem and no solution to it is acceptable which does violence to man's essential dignity; those who propose such solutions base them on an utterly materialistic conception of man himself and his life. The only possible solution to this question is one which envisages the social and economic progress both of individuals and of the whole of human society, and which respects and promotes true human values." [...] No one can, without being grossly unfair, make divine Providence responsible for what clearly seems {{to be the result of}} misguided governmental policies, of an insufficient sense of social justice, of a selfish accumulation of material goods, and finally of a culpable failure to undertake those initiatives and responsibilities which would raise the standard of living of peoples and their children.|$|E
2500|$|The Party's Ard Fheis in 2009 {{unanimously}} {{passed a}} motion to organise in Northern Ireland by establishing forums, rather than cumainn, {{in each of the}} North's six counties. In December 2009, Fianna Fáil secured its first Northern Assembly MLA when Gerry McHugh, an independent MLA, announced he had joined the party. Mr. McHugh confirmed that although he had joined the party, he would continue to sit as an independent MLA. In June 2010, Fianna Fáil opened its first official office in the North in Crossmaglen, County Armagh. The then Taoiseach Brian Cowen officially opened the office, accompanied by Ministers Éamon Ó Cuív and Dermot Ahern and Deputies Rory O’Hanlon and Margaret Conlon. Discussing the party's slow development towards all-Ireland politics, Mr. Cowen observed: [...] "We have a very open and pragmatic approach. [...] We are a constitutional republican party <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> no secret of the aspirations on which this party was founded. [...] It has always been very clear in our mind what it is we are seeking to achieve, that is to reconcile this country and not being prisoners of our past history. [...] To be part of a generation that will build a new Ireland, an Ireland of which we can all be proud".|$|E

We of the afterguard are weary of this eternal buffeting. Our men have become pulpy, washed-out, sore-corroded shadows of men.
