50|$|Craik’s {{introduction}} to psychology stemmed from his dissatisfaction in medical school. While he found neurology, physiology, and psychiatry interesting, anatomical catalogues were challenging and tiresome {{and the company}} of sick patients were not of interest. While completing his final undergraduate year in psychology, Craik was introduced to experimental psychology. He completed his undergraduate thesis {{on the effect of}} rate of information processing on time perception, a topic that was heavily influenced by George Miller and his workings. His time at the University of Edinburgh also facilitated his exposure to theoretical psychology. Some of the courses he took allowed Craik to read the works of Donald Hebb, Dalbir Bindra, James J. Gibson, and some ethologists while another course introduced him to memory and learning. By the time Craik was ready to graduate with his bachelor of science, he began to realize his interests were in <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>perception.</b> He graduated in 1960.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between spatial <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> conscious <b>perception</b> are currently {{the object of}} intense debate. Recent evidence of double dissociations between <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> consciousness {{cast doubt on the}} time-honored concept of attention as a gateway to consciousness. Here we review evidence from behavioral, neurophysiologic, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging experiments, showing that distinct sorts of spatial attention can have different effects on visual conscious perception. While endogenous, or topdown attention, has weak influence on subsequent conscious perception of near-threshold stimuli, exogenous, or bottom-up forms of spatial attention appear instead to be a necessary, although not sufficient, step in the development of reportable visual experiences. Fronto-parietal networks important for spatial attention, with peculiar inter-hemispheric differences, constitute plausible neural substrates for the interactions between exogenous spatial <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> conscious <b>perception...</b>|$|R
40|$|Visual {{hallucinations}} (VH) {{are common}} in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Both deficits of <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> seem {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of VH in PD. However, the possible coexistence of impairments in <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> visual <b>perception</b> in PD with VH is not known. This study investigated both <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> visual <b>perception</b> in non-demented PD patients with VH, compared to PD patients without VH and healthy controls. Fourteen participants were included in each group. All patients were assessed with sustained visual <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> object <b>and</b> space <b>perception</b> tests. Only PD patients with VH showed impairments on object <b>and</b> space <b>perception.</b> In addition, PD patients with and without VU showed impairments on sustained visual attention, being more severely affected in PD patients with VH. Only in PD patients with VH sustained visual attention was associated with a decreased object <b>and</b> space <b>perception.</b> The results of our study thus suggest that in PD patients with VH an impairment of object <b>and</b> space <b>perception,</b> possibly in association with a decreased sustained visual attention, might play a role in the pathogenesis of VH.

50|$|In Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder's 1982 {{study of}} priming, {{they set out}} to {{determine}} what effect intentional priming might have on the public's evaluation of president Jimmy Carter. Their hypothesis stated that making certain political topics salient through primetime media, such as defense or spending, would cause viewers to evaluate president Carter based on said topics. The experiment's results demonstrated the phenomena of agenda-setting and priming. First, Iyengar et al. found evidence of agenda-setting in the positive correlation between exposure to a given political topic and its importance when evaluating the president. They then found that said standards affected the actual evaluation of the president's performance, demonstrating priming. This experiment points to the potential of news media to direct the public's <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> of political figures, though the researchers also indicate that subjects with higher self-reported levels of knowledge of politics showed decreased effects of priming. This lead Iyengar's team to the conclusion that priming has varied implications depending on an individual's given knowledge prior to political news media exposure.|$|E
5000|$|When {{shifting}} {{focus from}} one object {{to a second}} object, the saccadic movement of one’s eyes is also accompanied by a conscious shift of attention. In {{the context of the}} stopped clock illusion, not only do your eyes move, but you also shift your attention to the clock. This led researchers to question whether the movement of the eyes or simply the shift of the observer’s attention towards the second stimulus initiated saccadic masking. Experiments in which subjects diverted only their attention without moving their eyes revealed that the redirection of attention alone was not enough to initiate chronostasis. [...] This suggests that attention is not the time marker used when perception is filled back in. Rather, the physical movement of the eyes themselves serves as this critical marker. However, this relationship between <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> in the context of chronostasis is often difficult to measure and may be biased in a laboratory setting. Because subjects may be biased as they are instructed to perform actions or to redirect their attention, the concept of attention serving as a critical time marker for chronostasis may not be entirely dismissed.|$|E
40|$|A growing {{literature}} suggests that individuals repeatedly check {{in part because they}} lack confidence in their memories for previously-completed actions. It has also been hypothesized that the cognitive distrust demonstrated by individuals with OCD extends beyond memory to related factors such as attention and perception; however, the relation between distrust in attention, perception and memory has yet to be examined. The present study examined the extent to which distrust in <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> relate to memory distrust and compulsive checking in participants ranging in OCD symptom severity. A measure of distrust in <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> was developed for this purpose. Initial psychometric results indicated that distrust in <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> can be measured reliably and that it is related to previously-established metacognitive factors (e. g., distrust in memory) and OCD-relevant beliefs (e. g., inflated sense of responsibility). Importantly, the present results also indicated that distrust in <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> contributed to checking symptoms beyond memory distrust, baseline negative mood and neuroticism, and previously-established OCD beliefs (i. e., inflated sense of responsibility). Taken together, these findings suggest that distrust in <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> may be an important mechanism in the persistence of compulsive checking...|$|E

40|$|A current {{controversy}} exists {{about the}} relationship between spatial <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> conscious <b>perception.</b> While some authors propose that these phenomena are intimately related (Bartolomeo, 2008; Chun & Marois, 2002; O'Regan & Noë, 2001; Posner, 1994), others report dissociations between them (Kentridge et al., 1999; Koch & Tsuchiya, 2007; Wyart & Tallon-Baudry, 2008). However, spatial attention is not a unitary mechanism, and it is possible that not all forms of attention dissociate from conscious perception. In the present study we used a paradigm in which endogenous and exogenous forms of attention are orthogonally manipulated in order to investigate their relation with conscious perception within the same design. By analyzing two different cue-related components, our results demonstrated that while endogenous attention was electrophysiologically dissociated from conscious perception, exogenous attention was not, consistent with the hypothesis that exogenous attention is an important antecedent of our conscious experience. Our results support previous claims of dissociations between some forms of spatial <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> conscious <b>perception,</b> but also highlight the importance of exogenous orienting on the selection of information for conscious access...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between visual <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> conscious <b>perception</b> {{has been the}} subject of debate across a number of fields, including philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. Whereas some researchers view <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> awareness as inextricably linked, others propose that the two are supported by distinct neural mechanisms that can be fully dissociated. In a pioneering study, van Boxtel, Tsuchiya, and Koch (2010 b) reported evidence for a dissociation between <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> conscious <b>perception</b> using a perceptual adaptation task in which participants 2 ̆ 7 perceptual awareness <b>and</b> visual <b>attention</b> were manipulated independently. They found that participants 2 ̆ 7 awareness of an adapting stimulus increased afterimage duration, whereas attending to the adaptor decreased it. Given the important theoretical implications of these findings, we endeavored to replicate them using an identical paradigm while dealing with some potential shortcomings of the original study by adding more trials and a larger participant sample. Consistent with van Boxtel, Tsuchiya, and Koch, we found that afterimage duration was reliably increased when participants were aware of the adapting stimulus. In contrast to the original findings, however, attention to the adaptor also increased afterimage duration, suggesting that <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> awareness had the same-rather than opposing-effects on afterimage duration. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy...|$|R

40|$|Purpose We {{investigate}} {{job seeker}} visual <b>and</b> verbal <b>attention,</b> <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> regarding company web {{sites in the}} applicant generation phase of recruitment. Design/Methodology/Approach We report three studies using varied methodological approaches including eye-tracking, verbal protocol analysis (VPA), and survey data. Findings Eye-tracking results suggest Web-based job seekers focus visual attention on information containing hyperlinks and on text more than graphic images or navigation tools. VPA suggests Web-based job seekers focus verbal attention on content more than design, especially job opening information. Survey results suggest content, design, and communication features are all related to applicant attraction. Design explains the most incremental variance in web site evaluation, while perceptions of communication features explain the most incremental variance in attitude toward the organization and intentions to pursue employment.

40|$|Visual <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> develop rapidly {{during the}} first few months after birth, and these {{behaviors}} are critical components in the development of language and cognitive abilities. Here we ask how early bilingual experiences might lead to differences in visual <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>perception.</b> Experiments 1 - 3 investigated the looking behavior of monolingual and bilingual infants when presented with social (Experiment 1), mixed (Experiment 2), or nonsocial (Experiment 3) stimuli. In each of these experiments, infants’ dwell times (DT) and number of fixations to areas of interest (AOIs) were analyzed, giving a sense of where the infants looked. To examine how the infants looked at the stimuli in a more global sense, Experiment 4 combined and analyzed the saccade data collected in Experiments 1 - 3. There {{were no significant differences between}} monolingual and bilingual infants’ DTs, AOI fixations, or saccade characteristics (specifically, frequency and amplitude) in any of the experiments. These results suggest that monolingual and bilingual infants process their visual environments similarly, supporting the idea that the substantial cognitive differences between monolinguals and bilinguals in early childhood are more related to active vocabulary production than perception of the environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> consciousness {{has been a}} controversial topic over the last decade. Although {{there seems to be}} an agreement on their distinction at the functional level, no consensus has been reached about attentional processes being or not necessary for conscious perception. Previous studies have explored the relation of alerting and orienting systems of <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> conscious <b>perception,</b> but the impact of the anterior executive attention system on conscious access remains unexplored. In the present study, we investigated the behavioral interaction between executive <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> conscious <b>perception,</b> testing control mechanisms both at stimulus-level representation and after error commission. We presented a classical Stroop task, manipulating the proportion of congruent and incongruent trials, and analyzed the effect of reactive and proactive control on the conscious perception of near-threshold stimuli. Reactive control elicited under high proportion congruent conditions influenced participants’ decision criterion, whereas proactive control elicited under low proportion congruent conditions was ineffective in modulating conscious perception. In addition, error commission affected both perceptual sensitivity to detect near-threshold information and response criterion. These results suggest that reactivation of task goals through reactive control strategies in conflict situations impacts decision stages of conscious processing, whereas interference control elicited by error commission impacts both perceptual sensitivity and decision stages of conscious processing. We discuss the implications of our results for the gateway hypothesis about <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> consciousness, as they showed that interference control (both at stimulus-level representation and after error commission) can modulate the conscious access of near-threshold stimuli...|$|R
