This may be advantageous in an insect that feeds intermittently. Chinese mantises live longer, grow faster, and produce more young when they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> pollen.|$|E
5|$|Tarrare (c.1772–1798), {{sometimes}} spelled Tarare, was a French showman and soldier, {{noted for}} his unusual eating habits. <b>Able</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> {{vast amounts of}} meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned {{out of the family}} home as a teenager. He travelled France {{in the company of a}} band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling charlatan; he would swallow corks, stones, live animals and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to Paris where he worked as a street performer.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} with the skies clearing, birds began to appear, {{signalling}} a proximity to land. On 28 May, the Great Barrier Reef was sighted; Bligh found a navigable gap and sailed the launch into a calm lagoon. Late that afternoon, he ran the boat ashore on a small island which he named Restoration Island, where the men found oysters and berries in plentiful supply and were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> ravenously. Over the next four days, the party island-hopped northward within the lagoon, aware that their movements were being closely monitored by natives on the mainland. Strains were showing within the party; following a heated disagreement with Purcell, Bligh grabbed a cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight. Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain, but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered.|$|E

25|$|The owls' diet {{generally}} {{reflected the}} communities of small animals in the area, taking prions (small seabirds) where they lived near colonies, Coenocorypha snipe, kākāriki and even large earthworms. Once Pacific rats were introduced to New Zealand and began {{to reduce the number}} of native prey items the laughing owl was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> switch <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> them instead. They were still therefore relatively common when European settlers arrived.|$|R
5|$|Artisans and {{craftsmen}} {{during the}} Han had a socio-economic status between that of farmers and merchants. Yet some {{were able to}} obtain a valuable income, such as one craftsman who made knives and swords and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> food fit for nobles and officials. Artisans and craftsmen also enjoyed a legal status that was superior to merchants. Unlike lowly merchants, artisans were allowed by law to wear fancy silks, ride on horseback, and ride in carriages. There were also no laws which barred artisans from becoming officials. An artisan painter {{who worked at the}} Imperial Academy turned down many offers to become nominated for public office. In contrast, a bureaucrat who appointed a merchant as an official could suffer impeachment from office, while some even avoided nominations by claiming they were merchants.|$|E

25|$|Some mystics {{are said}} {{to have been able to}} perform miracles. But for many mystics, the miracles {{occurred}} to them.

5000|$|For a {{while in}} the early 2000s, Frosted and Coco Shreddies were advertised as [...] "too tasty for geeks". The {{advertisements}} featured [...] "geeks" [...] trying <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> a bowl of either Frosted or Coco Shreddies, but being overwhelmed by its taste, followed by a much cooler kid named Sure-Eddie being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> easily <b>eat</b> the Shreddies. In 2003, Coco Shreddies were coated with more chocolate.|$|R

25|$|Like other arachnids, spiders {{are unable}} to chew their food, {{so they have a}} mouth part shaped like a short {{drinking}} straw that they use to suck up the liquefied insides of their prey. However, they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> their own silk to recycle proteins needed in the production of new spider webs. Some spiders, such as the dewdrop spiders (Argyrodes), even eat the silk of other spider species.|$|E
25|$|Most {{patients}} do improve with conservative care in 2–5 days. However, on some occasions, {{the cause of}} obstruction may be a cancer and in such cases, surgery is the only treatment.

50|$|The {{indirect}} possessor form is {{used for}} alienably possessed nouns. It occurs as a free morpheme preceding the possessed noun. There are two categories distinguished - 'oral consumable' and 'general'.

25|$|In South Africa, a {{study showed}} that these snails were most {{abundant}} along roadsides; densities decreased dramatically with distance from roads. The snails were observed to be living {{on a variety of}} endemic and introduced plant species; these snails appear to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> an unusually wide range of different food sources. Theba pisana is also a significant pest of citrus, vines, legume crops and cereals in South Africa. In Australia, it feeds on a range of agricultural plants.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} birds have {{acquired}} methods {{that allow them to}} ingest monarchs without experiencing the ill effects associated with the cardiac glycosides. The oriole is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the monarch through an exaptation of its feeding behavior that gives it the ability to identify cardenolides by taste and reject them. The grosbeak, on the other hand, has developed an insensitivity to secondary plant poisons that allows it to ingest monarchs without vomiting. As a result, orioles and grosbeaks will periodically have high levels of cardenolides in their bodies, and they will be forced to go on periods of reduced monarch consumption. This cycle effectively reduces potential predation of monarchs by 50 percent and indicates that monarch aposematism has a legitimate purpose.|$|E
25|$|On December 20, 2010 Yon {{was found}} to be curled up and unmoving near a dried stream. He was brought into the center's {{rehabilitation}} room, where it was discovered that he had pulmonary edema, which had nearly killed him; however, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> by the next day and gradually got better. He was unable to walk for the remainder of December, though by the end of January he had regained this ability and, during February and March, he improved {{enough to be able to}} walk up and down stairs. However, his condition then took a turn for the worse, and he died on the night of April 9 at an estimated fifteen years and one month old. He weighed 3.5 kilograms and was 78.5 centimeters long. He is the oldest Iriomote cat on record.|$|E
50|$|Assisted feeding, {{also called}} hand feeding or oral feeding, is {{the action of}} a person feeding another person could not {{otherwise}} feed themselves.

25|$|In {{fields and}} {{plantations}} of plants {{they do not}} like to eat, e.g., cereals or eucalyptus, the greater rhea can be a species quite beneficial to farmers. It will eat any large invertebrate it can catch; its food includes locusts and grasshoppers, true bugs, cockroaches, and other pest insects. Juveniles eat more animal matter than adults. In mixed cerrado and agricultural land in Minas Gerais (Brazil), R. a. americana was noted to be particularly fond of beetles. It is not clear whether this applies to the species in general but for example in pampas habitat, beetle consumption is probably lower simply due to availability while Orthoptera might be more important. The greater rhea is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> Hymenoptera in quantity. These insects contain among them many who can give painful stings, though the birds do not seem to mind. Sometimes, greater rheas will gather at carrion to feed on flies; they are also known to eat dead or dying fish in the dry season, but as vertebrate prey in general not in large quantities.|$|E
25|$|On April 23, 2012, Bagwell {{was seriously}} {{injured in a}} car accident. According to the Woodstock police report, Bagwell called his wife at 1:35 PM {{to tell her that}} he was about to suffer a seizure while driving. He was {{subsequently}} taken to WellStar Kennestone Hospital in his hometown of Marietta, Georgia, where he was placed in the hospital's intensive care unit after suffering broken bones in his neck, face and jaw. On April 24, fellow WCW alumnus and former tag team partner Scott Norton released a statement via Twitter to confirm that Bagwell was going to be all right. On April 25, Universal Championship Wrestling performer and Bagwell's brother John released a statement to confirm that Bagwell's condition was improving, but that he still required breathing and feeding tubes and would undergo surgery once the swelling in his face and neck subsided. On April 28, Bagwell's mother Judy revealed to TMZ that he had been taken off the breathing tube, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> solid foods, and was able to talk. Fellow WCW alumni Sting, the Steiner Brothers, and Diamond Dallas Page have also kept in contact with Bagwell since his crash. On May 3, Universal Championship Wrestling announced via Twitter that Bagwell was able to walk again, but still had a tingling sensation in his arms and hands. UCW also stated that he had four plates surgically inserted in his face and that his jaw was wired shut after surgery.|$|E
