5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, reactionary {{conspiracy}} theorists, such as Scottish physicist John Robison and French Jesuit priest Augustin Barruel, began speculating that the Illuminati had survived their suppression {{and become the}} masterminds behind the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The Illuminati were accused of being subversives who were attempting to secretly orchestrate a revolutionary wave in Europe {{and the rest of}} the world in order to spread the most radical ideas and movements of the Enlightenment—anti-clericalism, anti-monarchism, and anti-patriarchalism—and to create a world noocracy and cult of reason. During the 19th century, fear of an Illuminati conspiracy was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>concern</b> of the European ruling classes, and their oppressive reactions to this unfounded fear provoked in 1848 the very revolutions they sought to prevent.|$|E
5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated there was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>concern.</b> In response, {{the areas of the}} horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E
25|$|While {{the firing}} of one {{detonator}} out of many will not cause a hollow pit to go critical, especially a low-mass hollow pit that requires boosting, the introduction of two-point implosion systems made that possibility <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E

25|$|For {{screening}} purposes, {{a closer}} visual inspection is then often performed upon {{withdrawal of the}} endoscope {{over the course of}} 20 to 25 minutes. Lawsuits over missed cancerous lesions have recently prompted some institutions to better document withdrawal time as rapid withdrawal times may be a source of potential medical legal liability. This is often <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>concern</b> in clinical settings where high caseloads could provide financial incentive to complete colonoscopies as quickly as possible.|$|E
2500|$|Rachel Reeves, {{elected as}} MP for Leeds West in May 2010, {{raised the issue}} of justice for the victims of the {{asbestos}} disaster and their families in a series of questions in Parliament. In her maiden speech she said: [...] "There is <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>concern</b> that the coalition will use the country's financial deficit as an excuse to unfairly target working people, particularly those who have been left dealing with the devastating effects of exposure to asbestos. With the backing of trade unions and support groups a huge amount of effort has gone into making sure that the voices of asbestos victims and their families are heard by Government and as a result a number of important assurances were made to them {{at the end of the}} last Parliament. It's vital those commitments are not reneged upon to the detriment of thousands of asbestos victims across the country." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the second}} major German offensive, [...] "Georgette" [...] in Flanders (9 April), Haig issued his famous order (11 April) that his men must carry on {{fighting}} [...] "With Our Backs to the Wall and believing in the Justice of our Cause" [...] to protect [...] "The safety of our homes and the Freedom of mankind" [...] – the latter being <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>concern</b> after recent British propaganda dwelled on the harsh terms imposed on Russia at Brest-Litovsk. Just as [...] "Michael" [...] had swept over the Cambrai and the Somme battlefields, won at such cost by Haig's own offensives in previous years, this one swept over Passchendaele although not Ypres itself. The offensive threatened Hazebrouck, [...] "the Amiens of the north", a key railhead through which supplies were brought from the Channel Ports – had it fallen the Channel Ports might have been at risk and Plumer's Second Army might have been cut off.|$|E
2500|$|Haig issued {{his famous}} order (11 April) that his men must carry on {{fighting}} [...] "With Our Backs to the Wall and {{believing in the}} Justice of our Cause" [...] to protect “The safety of our homes and the Freedom of mankind” - the latter being <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>concern</b> after recent British propaganda dwelled on the harsh terms imposed on Russia at Brest-Litovsk. He also added that “the French Army is moving and in great force to our support” – in Greenhalgh’s view {{this may have been}} intended as blackmail. On 12 April Haig met with Clemenceau and told him that the BEF required massive French help to “keep the war going”. 12 April Lt-Gen John du Cane was appointed senior liaison officer between Haig and Foch, an idea broached by Wilson to Foch on 9 April. French observers were impressed by the resilience of British lower ranks, and by Plumer, but less so by other British generals.|$|E
60|$|Thus much of {{the topics}} chosen by the courtiers to {{recommend}} their system; {{it will be necessary}} to open a little more at large the nature of that party which was formed for its support. Without this, the whole would have been no better than a visionary amusement, like the scheme of Harrington's political club, and not a business in which the nation had <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>concern.</b> As a powerful party, and a party constructed on a new principle, it is a very inviting object of curiosity.|$|E

6000|$|It was clear, however, {{that neither}} the limits nor the extent of Mrs. Assingham's vision were now <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>concern</b> to her, and she gave {{expression}} to this as she had not even yet done.

The position, though I was unaware of it, really was hopeless, for the reason that, like most positions, it had a flank as well as a front. In estimating the possibilities of attack, I had figured assaults as coming only from below. I had omitted from my calculations the fact that the loft had a roof.|$|E
