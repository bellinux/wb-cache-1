The excessively high tariffs imposed by the Austrian Empire on the export of Piedmontese wines to Austrian controlled areas of northern Italy was one of the underlying sparks to the revolutions of 1848–1849.|$|E
25|$|The charism (or spiritual focus) of the Carmelite Order is contemplation. Carmelites {{understand}} contemplation in a {{broad sense}} encompassing prayer, community, and service. These three elements <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of the Carmelite charism. The most recent statement about the charism of Carmel was in the 1995 Constitutions of the Order, in which Chapter 2 is entirely devoted {{to the idea of}} charism. Carmel understands contemplation and action to be complementary, not contradictory. What is distinctive of Carmelites is the way that they practice the elements of prayer, community and service, taking particular inspiration from the prophet Elijah and the Blessed Virgin Mary, patrons of the Order.|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{eighteen}} medieval {{villages in}} Milton Keynes are still extant and <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> {{of their respective}} districts. But some, such as Old Wolverton, remain only as field patterns marking a deserted village. The desertion of Old Wolverton was due to enclosure of the large strip cultivation fields into small [...] "closes" [...] by the local landlords, the Longville family, who turned arable land over to pasture. By 1654, the family had completely enclosed the parish. With {{the end of the}} feudal system, the peasants had lost their land and tillage/grazing rights and were forced to find other work or starve. Thus Old Wolverton was reduced from about thirty peasant families in the mid 16th century to almost none, within the space of a century. There are also deserted village sites in Tattenhoe and Westbury (Shenley Wood).|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} with the stark view of Winesburg, Ohio above, a number of scholars have taken the perspective that the cycle is, in fact, about escape from isolation instead of the condition itself. Barry D. Bort writes, [...] "Criticism of Winesburg, Ohio has recognized this desperate need to communicate, but what has not been understood about Anderson's work is that this continual frustration serves as the context out of which arise a few luminous moments of understanding...Such moments <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of Winesburg, Ohio, although they are few and evanescent". Though rarely does escape come in the narrative present, many of the stories prominently feature anecdotes of past adventures where lonely and reserved characters run naked through the town on a rainy night (Alice Hindman in [...] "Adventure"), drive their wagon headlong into a speeding locomotive (Windpeter Winters in [...] "The Untold Lie"), and have window-shattering religious epiphanies (Reverend Curtis Hartman in [...] "The Strength of God"). While {{not all of the}} adventures are so dramatic, each has its place in the annals of the town, sometimes as told to George Willard, other times in the memories of participants.|$|E

[...] Mirsky claimed the reaction to Benefits Street demonstrated how it had [...] "touched a nerve" [...] and subsequently proved it was [...] "essential" [...] the series was made. The boss of Love Productions, Richard McKerrow, also defended the series, saying it was not about [...] "demonising the poor...It’s a very honest and true portrayal of life in Britain and people are frightened of it." [...] Writing as the series concluded, The Daily Telegraphs Neil Midgley felt that Benefits Street had not exploited its participants, and was [...] "definitely the kind of series that Channel 4 should be making: easy to grasp and innovative, and yet a blinding revelation of some ills that <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of modern Britain." [...] Midgley's view was echoed by Jay Hunt, Channel 4's chief creative officer, who described the series as [...] "a perfect Channel 4 show [...] It engaged a huge audience and got millions of people thinking about the welfare state and people at the bottom of society." ...|$|E
