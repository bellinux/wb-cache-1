5|$|In early April 1945, Lützow joined Galland's Jagdverband 44 (JV44—44th Fighter Detachment) at Munich-Riem. JV44 was {{equipped}} with the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, an aircraft which was heavily armed <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> any Allied fighter. Galland hoped that the Me262 would compensate for the numerical superiority of the Allies. Lützow had been released from his position as fighter leader in Italy and Galland appointed him as his adjutant. Lützow was credited with two aerial victories flying the Me262.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that Caprivi began {{ordering}} new protected cruisers, he also authorized the construction of smaller unprotected cruisers for use in Germany's overseas colonies. The first of these, the , were laid down in 1886 and 1887. A further six vessels of the , which were improved versions that were larger <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> their predecessors, followed over the next five years. A final, much larger vessel, , was laid down in 1892; her design was based on contemporary protected cruisers like Kaiserin Augusta. She represented another attempt to merge the colonial cruiser and fleet scout, which was unsuccessful. As a result, the German naval designers began work on the , which provided the basis for all future German light cruisers.|$|E

5|$|The Karlsruhe {{class of}} light cruisers {{was a pair}} of two ships built for the German Imperial Navy before the start of World War I. The ships and were very similar to the {{previous}} s, mounting the same armament and similar armor protection, though they were larger <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> the earlier ships. Both vessels were laid down in 1911, and launched one day apart, on 11 and 12 November 1912. Karlsruhe joined the fleet in January 1914, but fitting out work lasted slightly longer on her sister; Rostock was commissioned the following month.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} part of a large reform {{movement}} to prevent equitable courts such as the Court of Chancery from undermining their business. It was far cheaper <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> the older equivalents used by the Chancery and Common Pleas, leading to a drop in their business and an increase in that of the King's Bench. As such, the Chancery issued injunctions in an ineffective attempt to prevent its use. The Bill was finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832.|$|E

5|$|These {{and other}} {{differences}} reflect the differing design {{goals of the}} two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire400 is faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use, especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives. The newer FireWire800 standard is {{twice as fast as}} FireWire400 <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> USB2.0 high-bandwidth both theoretically and practically. However, FireWire's speed advantages rely on low-level techniques such as direct memory access (DMA), which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack.|$|E
5|$|When an SSD {{is writing}} {{large amounts of}} data sequentially, the write {{amplification}} is equal to one meaning there is no write amplification. The reason is as the data is written, the entire block is filled sequentially with data related to the same file.

In an August 3, 2012 Olympic heat, Cabral finished 4th with a time of 8:21.46 in his 13-man heat, earning the last automatic berth to the August 5 finals.

5|$|The {{events in}} Arkham Origins take place {{about five years}} before , in midwinter Gotham City. Batman, an {{experienced}} crime-fighter {{in the second year}} of his career, is not yet the veteran superhero of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. He is a mysterious force; even the police do not know whether he is a vigilante, a myth or a supernatural being. Batman has fought ordinary criminals and gangsters, and is accustomed to being stronger <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> his opponents. However, on a snowy Christmas Eve he is confronted with more-dangerous foes: eight professional assassins hoping to collect a $50-million bounty placed on Batman's head by Black Mask. Villains (including the Joker) take advantage of the assassins' arrival to launch their own schemes, and Black Mask's henchmen instigate a rise in crime and gang activity in the city.|$|E
5|$|After the {{unsuccessful}} {{action the}} Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg, where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to refuse combat with the allies {{at least until}} they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. After the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May, the allied fleet soon came in contact with it and began pursuing the Swedes. By this time the allies had been reinforced by a small squadron and now totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large or medium ships of the line. The reinforcements also brought with them a new commander, Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the ablest naval tacticians of his time. Tromp, who also was a Lieutenant-Admiral in the Dutch navy, was made Admiral-General of the Danish navy on 8 May 1676. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The rough winds were hard on the Swedish ships. Many lost masts and spars. The Swedes, forming a barely cohesive battle line, tried to sail ahead of Tromp's ships, hoping to get between them and the shore, thus putting themselves on the allied fleet's windward side and gaining the tactical advantage of holding the weather gage. The Dutch ships of the allied fleet managed to sail closer to the wind <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> the rest of the force, and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, snatching the weather gage. Later that morning the two fleets closed on each other, and were soon within firing range.|$|E
