5|$|Accepting {{the offer}} on January 19, 2009, Ryan {{immediately}} began {{to carry out a}} plan of action that he had outlined for the franchise's future. He planned to remove the players from distractions {{on and off the field}} and allow them get to know one <b>another</b> <b>to</b> build team chemistry. Thus, training camp was moved to the campus of SUNY Cortland, where the team would be relatively secluded from the media and any other distractions. Ryan and general manager Mike Tannenbaum were also determined to draft a quarterback who could lead and be the face of the franchise. As a result, the team traded up to select Mark Sanchez of USC in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Although Leng {{credits the}} song's two {{acoustic}} guitar parts to Harrison alone, Spizer suggests that guitarist Peter Frampton may have supplied {{one of these}} parts. Playing the bass, as he did on most of All Things Must Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would be <b>another</b> <b>to</b> find sanctuary at Friar Park. Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971, when reports had Voormann linked to a supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and <b>another</b> <b>to</b> load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E
5|$|From {{her first}} sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings the praises of Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and <b>another</b> <b>to</b> magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things {{to find in the}} woods and what can be made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.|$|E

In addition, he served as the Commissioner of School Lands and as one of the Chancery Commissioners for Hampshire County. White was elected to represent the Fifteenth Senatorial District in the West Virginia Senate in 1930 and served in the senate until 1934. In 1933, White was chairman of the senate's Judiciary Committee and he was also appointed to two special committees: one on economy and efficiency to study state and municipal government spending, and <b>another</b> <b>to</b> investigate the road commission's awarding of a contract for gasoline, oil, and grease to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey over the Elk Refining Company.|$|E
5|$|Hermaphroditism {{appeared}} in medical literature {{enough to be}} considered common knowledge, although cases were rare. Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for <b>another</b> <b>to</b> fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage (1633). Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of species {{were associated with}} the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one <b>another</b> <b>to</b> allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas out of the mainstream for decades.|$|E

They returned to Dalmatia, one brother to Zadar, <b>another</b> <b>to</b> Šibenik, and the last two to the Makarska Riviera, where they started building castles in Gradac and Trpanj, as well as practicing piracy up to Apulia.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Pope Pius XII {{died and}} was succeeded by Pope John XXIII, who, in 1959, after giving Lefebvre {{the choice between}} {{remaining}} either as Apostolic Delegate or as Archbishop of Dakar, appointed <b>another</b> <b>to</b> the post of Apostolic Delegate for French Africa. Lefebvre continued as Archbishop of Dakar until 23 January 1962, when he {{was transferred to the}} diocese of Tulle in France, retaining his personal title of archbishop. Shortly after his appointment as Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers (see below), he resigned from the diocese of Tulle on 7 August, 1962.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interest}} of strengthening the defenses of the kingdom, Andriamasinavalona divided his realm into four quadrants to be ruled by his four favorite sons. This decision had the opposite effect, however; each was interested in expanding his own realm, prompting one son to kidnap the king and hold him hostage for seven years. After the king's eventual release, he famously committed a mock human sacrifice to re-sanctify his authority. Upon his death, Andriamasinavalona's sons launched military campaigns against one <b>another</b> <b>to</b> seize each other's territories, triggering 77 years of civil war in Imerina. In Madagascar today, Andriamasinavalona's reign is remembered as a golden age of justice, harmony and prosperity.|$|E

It was one anchorite's pride to lie naked {{in the mud and}} let the insects bite him and blister him unmolested; it was <b>another's</b> <b>to</b> lean against a rock, all day long, conspicuous to the admiration of the throng of pilgrims and pray; it was <b>another's</b> <b>to</b> go naked and crawl around on all fours; it was <b>another's</b> <b>to</b> drag about with him, year in and year out, eighty pounds of iron; it was <b>another's</b> <b>to</b> never lie down when he slept, but to stand among the thorn-bushes and snore when there were pilgrims around to look; a woman, who had the white hair of age, and no other apparel, was black from crown to heel with forty-seven years of holy abstinence from water. Groups of gazing pilgrims stood around all and every of these strange objects, lost in reverent wonder, and envious of the fleckless sanctity which these pious austerities had won for them from an exacting heaven.|$|R
