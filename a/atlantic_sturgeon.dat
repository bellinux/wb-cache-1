5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sturgeon.</b> Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E

500|$|Six {{species have}} {{disappeared}} from the river since the mid-1980s. The Petitcodiac River was the only known Canadian habitat of the dwarf wedgemussel, and was later isolated to just nine American watersheds after its elimination from the Petitcodiac. The Atlantic salmon is no longer present in the watershed, and has since been listed as an endangered species in Canada. The American shad was a favourite with fishermen, and represented two-thirds of the entire Canadian shad landings from 1870 to 1900; catches peaked at million kilograms (two to sixmillion pounds) per year. Three other species have been eliminated from the river: the striped bass, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> and the Atlantic tomcod. However, a project of the Petitcodiac Riverkeeper, funded by the Government of Canada's Environmental Damage Fund in 2005, noted that {{the removal of the}} causeway would result in a [...] "good" [...] chance of bringing back the eliminated species, and an [...] "excellent" [...] chance of increasing the numbers of species deemed to have been reduced in numbers.

40|$|Abstract: Dams have impeded fish on Maine’s Penobscot River for centuries, {{blocking}} {{connections between}} inland waters and the sea; {{people and the}} river. Populations of sea-run fish, once measured in millions, plummeted to fractions of their historic counts. In 2004, an innovative agreement between the Penobscot Indian Nation, a hydropower company, conservation groups, and resource agencies resolved decades of conflict over fisheries and hydropower. The Penobscot River Restoration Project, a collaborative initiative to restore selfsustaining populations of sea-run fish, charted a whole-system approach endeavoring strategic removal of multiple barriers while rebalancing hydropower. The Penobscot River Restoration Trust, a nonprofit established to work with Project partners to fulfill restoration goals, acquired and decommissioned three large mainstream dams in order to remove the two lower-most (completed in 2012 and 2013) and build a nature-like channel around one further upstream (underway). Widely acclaimed {{as a model for}} cooperative conservation, the Project provides 11 species of native fishes with significantly improved access to critical habitat within nearly 1, 000 miles (1609 km) of watershed. Targeted species include endangered Atlantic salmon, endangered short-nose and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sturgeons,</b> American shad, river herring and American eel. Terrestrial and avian wildlife will also benefit from this “refueled” system. By reestablishing connections between inland waters and the sea, the Project promises renewed ecological functions, cultural interactions, and economic activities throughout the watershed and entire Gulf of Maine. Project effects are already being realized. In 2014, nearly 400, 000 river herring passed the former Veazie dam; 800 shad were counted, a 100 -fold increase from pre-Project counts. The Penobscot Nation will be hosting three years of national canoe racing. This presentation will inform watershed managers, resource specialist, and restoration interests by sharing creative steps taken to balance energy production with ecological and community values through a review of Project accomplishments and initial monitoring...|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the heavy}} human populations and high level of {{industrialization}} along its shores, the wildlife of the North Sea has suffered from pollution, overhunting, and overfishing. Flamingos and pelicans were once found along the southern shores of the North Sea, but became extinct over the 2nd millennium. Walruses frequented the Orkney Islands through the mid-16th century, as both Sable Island and Orkney Islands lay within its normal range. Gray whales also resided in the North Sea but were driven to extinction in the Atlantic in the 17th century Other species have dramatically declined in population, though they are still found. North <b>Atlantic</b> right whales, <b>sturgeon,</b> shad, rays, skates, salmon, and other species were common in the North Sea until the 20th century, when numbers declined due to overfishing.
