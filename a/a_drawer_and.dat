25|$|Walker {{invited the}} author of the OLC memo, John Yoo, to meet with the senior DOD lawyers, both uniformed and {{civilian}} at the Pentagon, which Yoo did twice, explaining the cases in detail and the President's authority and responding to all questions. Mora met with Yoo, who defended the Justice Department's legal analysis, and told Mora the President had the authority to order the application of torture, not that he should but that the Commander in Chief had the authority to do so {{for the safety of the}} nation. Mora then met with Haynes, and advised him of his opinion that the Working Group's legal analysis, taken from the Department of Justice legal memorandum, was flawed, and should be put in <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> <b>and</b> “never... see the light of day again.” The Working Group never relied upon the extreme power of the Commander in Chief as the additional techniques they recommended did not approach what could be construed as torture. The Working Group voted unanimously to send forth the recommended techniques to Secretary Rumsfeld, who adopted the majority of them. The Administration later asked the Justice Department to review the adopted techniques, which they did, finding them consistent with law. John Yoo did not participate in the later analysis.|$|E

Becquerel made the discovery in Paris by leaving {{a sample of}} a uranium salt, K2UO2(SO4)2 (potassium uranyl sulfate), {{on top of an}} unexposed photographic plate in <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> <b>and</b> noting that the plate had become [...] "fogged". He determined that a form of invisible light or rays emitted by uranium had exposed the plate.|$|E
500|$|Lhermitte told {{investigators}} that, when she returned, she hid the knives in <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> <b>and</b> called over her youngest daughter Mina {{while the other}} children were watching [...] Lhermitte tried to strangle Mina, but when the child struggled Lhermitte resorted to slashing her throat {{with one of the}} stolen knives, all while speaking comforting words and apologizing to the child. Medhi was the next to be killed, the youngest and the only son. When her attempts to strangle her child again failed, Lhermitte cut Medhi's throat and washed the knife afterward in the bathroom sink.|$|E

500|$|Officers also searched 5Eaton Row, {{into which}} Lucan had moved early in 1973, and after {{interviewing}} [...] his mother (who {{had called to}} take the children to her home in StJohn's Wood), his last address at 72aElizabeth Street. Nothing untoward was found; on the bed, a suit and shirt lay alongside a book on Greek shipping millionaires, and Lucan's wallet, car keys, money, driving licence, handkerchief and spectacles were on a bedside table. His passport was in <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> <b>and</b> his blue Mercedes-Benz parked outside, its engine cold and its battery flat. Ranson then visited Veronica Lucan at St George's Hospital. Although heavily sedated, {{she was able to}} describe what had happened to her. A police officer was left to guard her, should her assailant return. Rivett's body was taken to the mortuary, and a search was undertaken of all local basement areas and gardens, skips and open spaces.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of November 10, 1912, just {{three days after the}} finish of Eugene V. Debs' 4th — and arguably most {{successful}} — campaign as the Socialist Party's candidate for President of the United States, [...] Wayland retired upstairs to his bedroom. There he opened <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> <b>and</b> removed a loaded handgun. He carefully wrapped the revolver with a sheet to muffle the sound of the explosion. He drew a breath, placed the gun in his hand, raised it to his open mouth, and shot himself in the brain. Wayland never regained consciousness, dying shortly after midnight, November 11, 1912. Harried by the government, despondent over the failure of the Socialist movement to win the support of more than {{a small fraction of the}} laboring classes, tired of life, Wayland left an epitaph tucked into a book on his bedside table: [...] "The struggle under the competitive system is not worth the effort; let it pass." ...|$|E
2500|$|Years {{passed and}} Richter became a {{successful}} screenwriter. Mac Rauch took Richter {{up on his}} offer and arrived in L.A. Richter proceeded to introduce the writer to producer/director Irwin Winkler who gave Mac Rauch rent money {{for the next six}} months. Over several dinners, Mac Rauch told Richter and his wife about a character named Buckaroo Bandy about whom he was thinking of writing a screenplay. Richter and his wife liked the idea and paid Mac Rauch $1,500 to develop and write it. According to Mac Rauch, his script was inspired by [...] "all those out-and-out, press-the-accelerator-to-the-floor, non-stop kung fu movies of the early '70s". Richter remembers that Mac Rauch wrote several Banzai stories and that he [...] "would get thirty or forty pages into a script, abandon its storyline and write a new one". Mac Rauch recalled, [...] "It's so easy to start something and then—since you're really not as serious about it as you should be—end up writing half of it ... You shove the hundred pages in <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> <b>and</b> try to forget about it. Over the years, I started a dozen Buckaroo scripts that ended that way".|$|E

2500|$|Javed Akhtar narrates: [...] "Kamal sahab {{gave me a}} job {{and helped}} me. My salary was Rs.50 {{and even in the}} 60s, you could not rent a house with that amount of money. I used to sleep {{in a corner of the}} studio. I started living in the costume room of the studio. I didn't have enough money to even go out to have a meal. In the evenings I would just potter around in the drawers. There were many {{cupboards}} filled with costumes of Pakeezah; sherwanis, dresses, shoes. One day I opened <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> <b>and</b> found amid the clutter, three Filmfare trophies. I dusted them and realized they were Meena Kumari's Filmfare trophies. I had never held a trophy and a Filmfare trophy was akin to the Oscar in India. There were big mirrors in the room. In the evenings I would come back and lock myself in the costume room and hold the trophies in front of the mirror, acting how I would accept it if I were to receive it. The first trophy I held in my hand was that of Meena Kumari! I was an eighteen-year-old boy who had no home, no money, no food, but these trophies encouraged me to achieve my dreams, and for this, I will be always thankful to Meena-ji." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film then rolls {{into the}} song “A World Without” as a grief-stricken Charlie {{and several other}} mourners, {{some of whom are}} clearly played by Queensrÿche's band members, attend Cathy’s funeral. The priest begins his eulogy but then appears to be {{laughing}} and pointing at Charlie, as do everyone else in attendance except for La Torre, who looks at Charlie with a serious face, as Charlie clutches his child wrapped in a blanket. Brian is also shown to be laughing and pointing but his appearance {{as well as the other}} mourners’ cruelty is revealed to be happening merely inside Charlie’s head, coinciding with the lyric [...] "what is real and what is fantasy". The song continues playing as Charlie is seen sitting beside a crib and drinking heavily while a baby is heard crying. He has a vision of Cathy picking up their child from the crib, and recalls the look on Brian’s face that day when he finked on him. Charlie then proceeds to pull a gun from <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> <b>and</b> point it at his head but the vision of Cathy returns to assure him that she is there with him. Four years later, Charlie is seen working at his desk and smiling at a picture that his daughter drew for him. As he leaves his desk, the camera zooms in on a photograph of his now four-year-old daughter. Charlie heads toward the garage where he finds his brother waiting for him by the car. Without saying a word, Brian nervously holds his hand out to Charlie who happily embraces him, and the two of them reconcile. During the end credits, the track [...] "X2" [...] is played.|$|E
