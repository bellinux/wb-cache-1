40|$|Colletotrichum gloeosporioides {{is a major}} fungal {{pathogen}} of <b>avocado</b> and mango {{fruit in}} Australia and overseas. It causes anthracnose and stem-end rot in these crops but has also been identified as the causal pathogen of pepper spot of <b>avocado</b> and tear stain of mango. Research was initiated to determine the pathogenic diversity of pepper spot, with emphasis on <b>avocado.</b> Eighty C. gloeosporioides isolates obtained from <b>avocado</b> and mango fruit showing anthracnose and pepper spot symptoms were screened for pathogenicity, comparative aggressiveness and cross-infection potential by inoculating onto detached <b>avocado</b> and mango fruit, <b>avocado</b> leaf petioles and branches of young, grafted nursery trees, as well as <b>avocado</b> fruit and pedicels still attached to the tree. On detached, ripening <b>avocado</b> and mango fruit in the laboratory, {{it was found that}} pepper spot isolates were as capable as anthracnose isolates of causing anthracnose lesions. However, <b>avocado</b> isolates were significantly (P 0. 05) more aggressive than mango isolates on <b>avocado</b> fruit and mango isolates were significantly (P 0. 05) more aggressive than <b>avocado</b> isolates on mango fruit. In field inoculations, pepper spots were formed on developing <b>avocado</b> fruit and pedicels on the tree. Likewise, pepper spots developed on petioles and branches of nursery <b>avocado</b> trees, but not on their leaves. When all isolates were grouped according to symptom or host of origin, significant differences in lesion severity were demonstrated between isolates on <b>avocado</b> petioles in the glasshouse, with <b>avocado</b> pepper spot isolates being the most aggressive, followed by <b>avocado</b> anthracnose isolates then mango isolates from both anthracnose and pepper spot, respectively. On unripe <b>avocado</b> fruit in the field, the pattern was generally similar with the mango isolates being the least aggressive. There were more and less pathogenic strains present in the pathogen populations from both mango fruit and <b>avocado</b> fruit but neither were restricted to anthracnose or pepper spot groupings. Generally, a higher percentage of the most aggressive isolates was from <b>avocado</b> pepper spot. When isolates were grouped according to the orchard of origin, there were significant differences in aggressiveness to <b>avocado</b> both in the glasshouse and the field. © 2010 Australasian Plant Pathology Society...|$|R

40|$|Summary Various {{methods were}} used to {{characterize}} <b>avocado</b> honey in Israel. Perseitol, a unique sugar present only in <b>avocado</b> honey, served as an indicator for the degree of purity of <b>avocado</b> honey. Low <b>avocado</b> pollen counts made the common melissopalynology method ineffective at predicting the contribution of <b>avocado</b> nectar to honey. It was {{also found that the}} levels of fructose, sucrose and glucose do not uniquely characterize <b>avocado</b> honey. Potassium content and eight other minerals were linearly highly correlated to perseitol content. Moreover, pH level, absorbance and degree of darkness were significantly correlated to perseitol content, and can therefore be used to characterize <b>avocado</b> honey...|$|R

5|$|Many plants, {{including}} {{a variety of}} food plants, synthesize dopamine to varying degrees. The highest concentrations have been observed in bananas—the fruit pulp of red and yellow bananas contains dopamine at levels of 40 to 50 parts per million by weight. Potatoes, <b>avocados,</b> broccoli, and Brussels sprouts may also contain dopamine at levels of 1 part per million or more; oranges, tomatoes, spinach, beans, and other plants contain measurable concentrations less than 1 part per million. The dopamine in plants is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine, by biochemical mechanisms {{similar to those that}} animals use. It can be metabolized in a variety of ways, producing melanin and a variety of alkaloids as byproducts. The functions of plant catecholamines have not been clearly established, but there is evidence that they {{play a role in the}} response to stressors such as bacterial infection, act as growth-promoting factors in some situations, and modify the way that sugars are metabolized.

5|$|The cyclone caused $50million {{in damage}} to the banana crop and $3million to papaws between Ingham to Cairns alone. Agricultural {{impairment}} {{was not limited to}} Babinda; throughout northern Queensland, the storm devastated banana and papaw crops. Avocado farms at Atherton and pineapple farms in Rollingstone and Mutarnee experienced considerable losses; in addition, $35million in sugar cane crops near Innisfail were destroyed, with 60–70percent of the entire year's harvest ruined. Within the vicinity of Tully, the storm ruined 30percent of the crop, causing $10million in losses. In general, the sugar industry, already economically weak, bore the brunt of the system's impact. Overall, Winifred caused $86.4million in agricultural losses; the cyclone ruined 1.5million tones of sugar, costing $40million, 3.7million cases of bananas, costing $34.6million, and 15percent of the maize crop, costing $500,000. Winifred also damaged $4.9million in papaws, and $3.8million in <b>avocados,</b> lychees, custard apples, flowers, and chokos, as well. Effects to dairy and poultry industries were less severe, with losses reported at $2million and $600,000, respectively.

At the Homestead Air Force Base, most of the 2,000buildings on the base were severely damaged or rendered unusable. Damage to the base was extensive enough that it was recommended for closure. Nearby, {{in the small town}} of Florida City, over 120homes were demolished and 700others were damaged, while a number of other buildings were damaged beyond repair, including City Hall. Further north, damage to poorly constructed homes in communities such as Country Walk and Saga Bay resembled that of an F3 tornado, as winds in the area were estimated to have ranged from , below the threshold for an F3 tornado. Four of the five condominiums at Naranja Lakes were destroyed. The Cutler Ridge Mall suffered severe wind and water damage; after the storm, significant looting was reported at that location.
