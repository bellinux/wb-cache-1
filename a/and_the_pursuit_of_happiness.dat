25|$|On January 6, 1773, black petitioners {{submitted}} {{the first of}} five appeals written during the year, asking {{for a range of}} rights, to Governor Hutchinson and the General Court of Massachusetts. Though signed only by a slave named Felix, the document petitioned for the freedom and rights of all slaves in the Massachusetts colony. While the tone of the petition is cautious, it speaks to the “unhappy State and Condition” in which enslaved persons are forced to live. Abolitionists later published the petition as a pamphlet, along with letters and other abolitionist documents. Felix’s petition expressed the talk of freedom, liberty, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>happiness</b> that was circulating around Massachusetts and other American colonies before the American Revolution. No record of a response from the Massachusetts General Court exists. Although slavery was never explicitly abolished or prohibited in the new Massachusetts Constitution after the Revolutionary War, rulings in freedom suits by Mum Bett and Quock Walker established that its representation of rights was incompatible with slavery, and remaining slaves effectively gained their freedom.|$|E
500|$|Alongside Aladdins {{other main}} characters, Jasmine embodies the film's {{central theme of}} longing for freedom from some form of {{confinement}} or oppression. Both the film and its characters are influenced by Jasmine's [...] "power of choice". The character's desire for both freedom {{and a sense of}} agency is constantly threatened by other characters and situations; the sole decision Jasmine maintains complete agency over during the entire film is who she falls in love with – aided by the Genie's refusal to use his magical powers to force characters to fall in love – although not who she marries. Although Jasmine yearns to explore her kingdom beyond the confines of her palace, she only gets as far as the marketplace before returning home. Jasmine explores [...] "the idea that enclosing yourself behind walls can make you more vulnerable, not less", as evidenced {{by the fact that the}} character is unprepared and knows little about money when she ventures into the marketplace for first time. In the film, Jasmine releases a flock of birds from their cage, which serves as a metaphor for her own situation, being [...] "caged from a world she has never seen and yearns to be released." [...] Jasmine's bedroom is also shaped like a bird cage to represent her own confinement. Jasmine's story also explores themes such as civil rights, racial tolerance, social hierarchy, and Life, Liberty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>Happiness.</b>|$|E

500|$|Stankonia {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from contemporary}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 95, based on 20 reviews. Derek A. Bardowell of NME noted that with Stankonia, OutKast [...] "hit that rare balance of creative eccentricity and mass appeal" [...] and {{wrote that the}} album contains [...] "eternal qualities that will unravel in time on an emotional, intellectual and spiritual level." [...] Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone called the record [...] "one of the best albums of the year" [...] noting {{that all of the}} tracks contain [...] "a down-home generosity and accessibility" [...] and that [...] "even the most street-oriented songs have some sort of commentary in them." [...] Tony Green of The Village Voice praised OutKast's [...] "feel for sonics and structure" [...] and stated, [...] "they've moved toward harder, darker textures, in service of song designs that are often disarmingly subtle." [...] Steve Huey of AllMusic commented that, [...] "given the variety of moods, it helps that the album is broken up by brief, usually humorous interludes, which serve as a sort of reset button. It takes a few listens to pull everything together, but given the immense scope, it's striking how few weak tracks there are". Aishah Hight of PopMatters stated, [...] "Within Stankonia, Outkast successfully presented a southern perspective of life, liberty, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>happiness.</b> But on the surface, phat beats and pure funk should suffice." [...] Alternative Press commented that [...] "experienced, acclaimed groups rarely make albums as bold and confrontational as Stankonia, because they have too much to lose", but felt that [...] "OutKast don't care", writing that they [...] "coalesced the political and societal challenges of hip hop's past into what is one of the genre's most artistically unorthodox releases so far." ...|$|E

2500|$|American philosopher Timothy Garry has {{proposed}} {{an approach that}} deems nonhuman animals worthy of prima facie rights. In a philosophical context, a prima facie (Latin for [...] "on the face of it" [...] or [...] "at first glance") right is one {{that appears to be}} applicable at first glance, but upon closer examination may be outweighed by other considerations. In his book Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory, Lawrence Hinman characterizes such rights as [...] "the right is real but leaves open the question of whether it is applicable and overriding in a particular situation". The idea that nonhuman animals are worthy of prima facie rights is to say that, in a sense, animals do have rights. However, these rights can be overridden by many other considerations, especially those conflicting a human's right to life, liberty, property, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>happiness.</b> Garry supports his view arguing: ...|$|E

In 1773, when the British imposed heavy sanctions on the Massachusetts colony {{in the wake of the}} Boston Tea Party, self described patriots organized colony-by-colony resistance through organizations such as the Sons of Liberty. Fighting broke out in the spring of 1775, and all Thirteen Colonies entered into open rebellion against the crown.

All men--the doctrine is simply--have an equal right to life, liberty, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>happiness.</b> Even when all are in the full enjoyment of their rights, different men will, of course, attain to very different degrees of advancement in the objects of their desire.

There will, of course, be here and there disappointed and discontented individuals, but their discontent will not spread. It is only by the long-continued and oppressive infringement of the natural rights of large masses of men that the way is prepared for revolts and insurrections.|$|E
