40|$|Part I. The {{mechanism}} of the thermal decomposition of <b>acetyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> has been reinvestigated. The intermediacy of acetoxyl radicals has been demonstrated by a scavenging technique and evidence is presented which strongly suggests that the rate constant for acetoxyl radical decarboxylation is {{of the order of}} 2 x 10 [superscript 9] sec. [superscript - 1]. A primary process involving mainly simple 0 _ 0 bond scission followed by acetoxyl radical decarboxylation at a rate competitive with diffusive separation of the radicals satisfies the results quite consistently. Part II. The photosensitized decomposition of <b>acetyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> by certain aromatic hydrocarbons and ketone has been studied. The evidence suggests that the extent of "primary" decarboxylation {{is a function of the}} triplet state energy of sensitizer. A second major mode of destruction of peroxide appears to be operative in the decompositions sensitized by ketones. Mechanisms are suggested to explain these processes...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{research}} was undertaken {{to test the}} action of various oxidizing agents on two typical aliphatic nitroso compounds, propyl pseudonitrole and N-nitrosodimethylamine. The oxidizing agents tested include benzoyl peroxide, <b>acetyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> 30 % hydrogen peroxide, urea peroxide, potassium ferricyanide, and nitric acid. To test the reaction with pseudonitrole {{it was necessary to}} dissolve that compound in various solvents including carbon tetrachloride, ethyl acetate, and glacial acetic acid. With the N-nitrosodimethylamine it was found possible to dissolve the peroxides in the amine itself. The N-nitroso compound was not tested with potassium ferricyanide or nitric acid.

40|$|AbstractOrganic {{peroxides}} have {{significance in}} organic synthesis and biological processes. Characterization of these compounds with weak O–O bonds is sometimes difficult {{due to their}} thermal instability and sensitivity to acid or base. Coordination of diacyl peroxides with AgBF 4 provides a means for analysis of these compounds by coordination ionspray tandem mass spectrometry (CIS-MS/MS). Precursor ion (Q 1) scans of <b>acetyl</b> benzoyl <b>peroxide</b> give two Ag+ adducts, [M + Ag + solvent]+ and [M + Ag + M]+. These silver ion adducts can be selectively dissociated (CID) to give unique structural information about the analyte. Decomposition of the [M + Ag + solvent]+ adduct generates fragmentation products due to apparent homolytic cleavage of the O–O bond followed by decarboxylation of the resultant radicals. The bis-diacylperoxide complex, [M + Ag + M]+ gives CID pathways that involve homolysis of the O–O bond and free radical cross-coupling of the two diacyl peroxides coordinated to the silver ion, i. e. formation of dibenzoyl peroxide, phenyl benzoate, and biphenyl from <b>acetyl</b> benzoyl <b>peroxide.</b> The observation of free radical CID modes is uncommon in mass spectrometry but these pathways are consistent with well-known solution and gas phase processes for peroxide compounds. The proposed fragmentation pathways have been supported by experiments with 18 O and deuterated substrates. This technique {{can be applied to}} analyze diacyl peroxides with different substituents as well...|$|R
40|$|An amperometric {{biosensor}} for phosphate ion {{is described}} {{that is based}} on a cobalt phthalocyanine modified screen-printed carbon electrode (CoPC-SPCE). The biosensor operation is based on the enzyme pyruvate oxidase (PyOd) which catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, in the presence of inorganic phosphate and O 2, to <b>acetyl</b> phosphate, hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> (H 2 O 2) and CO 2. The transducer allows the electrocatalytic oxidation of H 2 O 2 in order to generate the analytical signal. The enzyme was immobilised onto the CoPC-SPCE using a sandwich format. The inner membrane was formed in situ by depositing an acetone solution containing cellulose acetate first onto the transducer surface. The enzyme and cofactors were then deposited onto this layer and allowed to dry; finally a second aliquot of the cellulose acetate solution was deposited onto the enzyme layer and allowed to dry. The biosensor was characterised by amperometry in stirred solution to produce current-voltage curves and for calibration studies. From these it was deduced that a reliable electrocatalytic response was obtained for phosphate ion; an operating potential of + 0. 4 V was selected for the analysis of urine samples. The precision of the response for urine analysis and recovery data for potable water suggests that the biosensor could have applications in clinical and environmental monitoring...|$|R
