5|$|Glacier retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E

5|$|The {{infusions of}} {{tropical}} moisture from Arizona-bound tropical cyclones can be <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rainfall in the region. In years when hurricanes approach Arizona, eastern and northern {{portions of the}} state receive on average 6–8% of the monsoon-season precipitation from tropical systems and their remnants. This percentage rises towards the southwestern corner of the state, which can receive up to {{a quarter of its}} monsoon-season rainfall from tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total {{population}} of stellar systems, with {{up to half of}} all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
5|$|Meshuggah {{returned}} to the studio to record obZen, which was released in March 2008. The band spent almost {{a year on the}} album, its longest recording session yet. <b>A</b> <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year was spent learning to perform the songs they wrote; the recording itself took six months. obZen reached No.59 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 11,400 U.S. copies in its first week of release and 50,000 copies after six months. With obZen, Meshuggah received more media attention and attracted new fans. The release was followed by a world tour, which started in the U.S. and proceeded to Europe, Asia and Australia.|$|E

Since the leading pair were absent, production was stalled. <b>A</b> <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie had been shot and a large sum of money, which had been taken as credit from financers, had been spent.

5|$|The Sami {{were not}} the only people subject to repressions.

5|$|A carnivore, the caracal {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South Africa {{have reported that}} it preys on the Cape grysbok, the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diet. They will feed {{from a variety of}} sources, but tend to focus on the most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet. Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They are notorious for attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game {{is spent}} sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail {{is driven by}} wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a {{tailwind}} behind the boat will give it top speed, while sailing against the wind is difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land. Some items serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea {{with the help of}} a sea chart, which can be updated with information on each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations. On land, dungeons feature similar maps.|$|E
5|$|Dennis claimed {{at least}} 88 lives: 56 in Haiti, 16 in Cuba, 15 in the U.S. and 1 in Jamaica.

In the United States, Dennis drew comparison with Hurricane Ivan of the previous year, but it was both smaller and weaker than Ivan at landfall and caused significantly fewer damages, partly because the region had not yet fully rebuilt.|$|E
