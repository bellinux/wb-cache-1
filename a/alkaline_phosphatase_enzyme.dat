Date of Acceptance: 20 / 06 / 2014 <b>Alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>enzymes</b> are found throughout the living world and fulfil a variety of functions. They have been linked to regeneration, stem cells and biomineralisation in a range of animals. Here we describe the pattern of <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activity in a spiralian append- age, the operculum of the serpulid polychaete Pomatoceros lamarckii. The P. lamarckii operculum is reinforced by a calcified opercular plate and is capable of rapid regeneration, making it an ideal model system to study these key processes in annelids. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activity is present in mesodermal tissues of both intact and regenerating opercular filaments, in a strongly regionalised pattern correlated with major morphological features. Based on the lack of epidermal activity and the broad distribution of staining in mesodermal tissues, calcification- or stem cell-specific roles are unlikely. Transcriptomic data reveal that at least four distinct genes contribute to the detected activity. Opercular <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activity is sensitive to levamisole. Phylogenetic analysis of metazoan <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases</b> indicates homology of the P. lamarckii sequences to other annelid <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases,</b> and shows that metazoan <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> evolution was characterised by extensive lineage-specific duplications.

50|$|The symptom {{that best}} characterizes hypophosphatasia is low serum {{activity}} of <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>enzyme</b> (ALP). In general, {{lower levels of}} enzyme activity correlate with more severe symptoms. The decrease in ALP activity leads {{to an increase in}} pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) in the blood, and correlates with disease severity. Urinary inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) levels are elevated in most hypophosphatasia patients and, although it remains only a research technique, this increase has been reported to accurately detect carriers of the disease. In addition, most patients have an increased level of urinary phosphoethanolamine (PEA). Tests for serum ALP levels are part of the standard comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) that is used in routine exams.|$|E
50|$|Hematoxylin and eosin {{staining}} (H&E) {{shows that}} the cytoplasm of active osteoblasts is slightly basophilic due to the substantial presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The active osteoblast produces substantial collagen type I. About 10% of the bone matrix is collagen with the balance mineral. The osteoblast's nucleus is spherical and large. An active osteoblast is characterized morphologically by a prominent Golgi apparatus that appears histologically as a clear zone adjacent to the nucleus. The products of the cell are mostly for transport into the osteoid, the non-mineralized matrix.

A study based on sodium butyrate effects on cancer cells conveys that it has an effect on androgen receptor co-regulator expression, transcription activity, and also on histone acetylation in cancer cells. This explains why the addition of sodium butyrate show increased activity of alkaline phosphatase in the cancer cells of the human colon.

40|$|PURPOSE:To {{investigate}} biomarkers {{of acute}} renal injury in Wistar rats, subjected to left renal ischemia for 10 minutes, and then compare reperfusion at 24 hours, and at 5, 7, 14 and 21 {{days after the}} procedure. METHODS: Eight female and male rats between 60 and 81 days old {{were used in the}} Central Animal Facility of the UFMS. Assessed biomarkers included urine protein, urea, creatinine, glucose, sodium, potassium, urine <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> and gamma-glutamyl transferase activities, and protein-to-creatinine ratio; and in serum: urea, creatinine, sodium and potassium, fractional excretion of sodium, potassium, urine flow and creatinine clearance. RESULTS:Greater variance was observed in the parameters at 24 hours and at five days (p< 0. 05) after reperfusion. On the 21 st day, these parameters approximated those obtained for the control group. CONCLUSIONS:Renal ischemia for 10 minutes was sufficient to raise urine levels of protein, glucose, fractional excretion of potassium, urea, creatinine clearance, urine activity of gamma-glutamyltransferase and <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>enzymes</b> in the first 24 hours, up to five days after reperfusion, which may indicate risk of acute kidney injury, according to the RIFLE classification...|$|R

It was shown that orthopedic DDT (o-p'-DDT) a major constituent of technical grade preparation of the pesticide- DDT exhibited estrogenic activity in several animals species (Welch et al., 1969 and Bitman et al., 1968). The aim of this work is to study the estrogenic effects of o-p'-DDT on the female reproductive organs (ovary, uterus and vagina) of mice in its neonatal period. In this study fifty of newly-born female mice were used and divided into five groups; three groups of them were received ten intraperitoneal injections of o-p'- DDT in doses of 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1 mg/injection. The study included two control groups, {{the first one was}} injected with 10 ugm estrogen for 10 injections and considered as positive control, while the second group injected with sesame oil only. The animals were scarified 2 days after the last injection. Paraffin and frozen sections were prepared for both histological and histochemical studies. Different staining techniques were used including Hx., E., modified gomori stain for <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>enzyme,</b> methyl green pyronin for RNA and PAS stain for glycogen content. The results showed a distinct increase in number and size of ovarian growing follicles in those animals treated with o-p'-DDT, also, increased activity of the <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>enzyme,</b> as well as increased content of RNA and glycogen was noticed. The effect of o-p'-DDT on the uterine structure were in the form of hypertrophy of the endometrial epithelium, also increase in number of uterine glands.

It was noticed also that high dose of o-p'-DDT leads to accelerated development of the vaginal epithelium with evidence of keratinization. The histochemical changes in the vagina were similar to those obtained in the uterus.

The production of the enzyme was sensitive to the Temperature of growth of the cells; cells grown at 27 ° and 37 °C exhibited a high phosphatase activity whereas cells grown at 42 °C showed little or no activity.

This research analyzed the effects of different tricalcium silicate cement formulations on the temporal osteoactivity profile of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMW-MSCs). These cells were exposed to four commercially available tricalcium silicate cement formulations in osteogenic differentiation medium. After 1, 3, 7 and 10 days, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were performed to detect expression of the target osteogenic markers ALP, RUNX 2, OSX, OPN, MSX 2 and OCN. After 3, 7, 14 and 21 days, alkaline phosphatase assay was performed to detect changes in intracellular enzyme level. An Alizarin Red S assay was performed after 28 days to detect extracellular matrix mineralization. In the presence of tricalcium silicate cements, target osteogenic markers were downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels at all time points. Intracellular <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>enzyme</b> levels and extracellular mineralization of the experimental groups {{were not significantly different}} from the untreated control. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed increases in downregulation of RUNX 2, OSX, MSX 2 and OCN with increasing time of exposure to the tricalcium silicate cements, while ALP showed peak downregulation at day 7. For Western blotting, OSX, OPN, MSX 2 and OCN showed increased downregulation with increased exposure time to the tested cements. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>enzyme</b> levels generally declined after day 7.
