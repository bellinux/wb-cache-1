5|$|A Bernt Michael Holmboe Memorial Prize for {{teachers}} of mathematics was established in 2005, and is awarded annually. The prize money, NOK 50,000, is taken from the Abel Found, which also cover the <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize.</b> The prize {{is administered by the}} board of the Norwegian Mathematical Society. The current board chairman is Tom Lindstrøm, professor at the University of Oslo.|$|E
25|$|Although diversified in its {{research}} and teaching interests, Cambridge today maintains its strength in mathematics. Cambridge alumni have won six Fields Medals and one <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize</b> for mathematics, while individuals representing Cambridge have won four Fields Medals.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, {{when he was}} thirty-seven years old, he {{was awarded}} the Fields Medal, for his work in {{developing}} K-theory, a generalized Lefschetz fixed-point theorem and the Atiyah–Singer theorem, for which he also won the <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize</b> jointly with Isadore Singer in 2004.|$|E
40|$|Presents {{the winners}} of the first five <b>Abel</b> <b>Prizes</b> in mathematics: 2003 - Jean-Pierre Serre; 2004 - Sir Michael Atiyah and Isadore Singer; 2005 - Peter D Lax; 2006 - Lennart Carleson; and 2007 - S R Srinivasa Varadhan.

25|$|Over {{the course}} of its history, a {{sizeable}} number of Cambridge University academics and alumni have become notable in their fields, both academic and in the wider world. Depending on criteria, affiliates of the University of Cambridge have won 90 Nobel prizes. Former undergraduates of the university have won {{a grand total of}} 61 Nobel prizes, 13 more than the undergraduates of any other university. Cambridge academics have also won 8 Fields Medals and 2 <b>Abel</b> <b>Prizes,</b> since the <b>Abel</b> award was first distributed in 2003.|$|R
50|$|From the day {{it opened}} the IAS had {{a major impact on}} mathematics, physics, {{economic}} theory, and world affairs. In mathematics forty-one out of fifty-seven Fields Medalists have been affiliated with the Institute. Thirty-three Nobel Laureates have been working at the IAS. Of the sixteen <b>Abel</b> <b>Prizes</b> awarded since the establishment of that award in 2003, nine were garnered by Institute professors or visiting scholars. Of the fifty-six Cole Prizes awarded since the establishment of that award in 1928, thirty-nine have gone to scholars associated with the IAS {{at some point in their}} career. IAS people have won 20 Wolf Prizes in mathematics and physics. Its more than 6,000 former members hold positions of intellectual and scientific leadership throughout the academic world.|$|R
25|$|The {{monetary}} {{award is}} {{much lower than the}} 8,000,000 Swedish kronor (roughly 1,400,000 Canadian dollars) given with each Nobel prize as of 2014. Other major awards in mathematics, such as the <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize</b> and the Chern Medal, have larger monetary prizes compared to the Fields Medal.|$|E
25|$|Members of Trinity {{have won}} 32 Nobel Prizes {{out of the}} 91 won by members of Cambridge University, {{the highest number of}} any college. Five Fields Medals in {{mathematics}} were won by members of the college (of the six awarded to members of British universities) and one <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize</b> was won.|$|E
25|$|The Wolf Prize in Mathematics, instituted in 1978, recognizes {{lifetime}} achievement, {{and another}} major international award, the <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize,</b> was instituted in 2003. The Chern Medal {{was introduced in}} 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.|$|E
25|$|There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics, though {{sometimes}} mathematicians {{have won the}} Nobel Prize in a different field, such as economics. Prominent prizes in mathematics include the <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize,</b> the Chern Medal, the Fields Medal, the Gauss Prize, the Nemmers Prize, the Balzan Prize, the Crafoord Prize, the Shaw Prize, the Steele Prize, the Wolf Prize, the Schock Prize, and the Nevanlinna Prize.|$|E
25|$|Serre, at twenty-seven in 1954, is the {{youngest}} ever to be awarded the Fields Medal. He {{went on to win}} the Balzan Prize in 1985, the Steele Prize in 1995, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2000, and was the first recipient of the <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize</b> in 2003. He has been awarded other prizes, such as the Gold Medal of the French National Scientific Research Centre (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS).|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} has graduated many notable alumni. As of 2017, Princeton {{has been associated}} with 43 Nobel laureates, 21 National Medal of Science winners, 14 Fields Medalists, 5 <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize</b> winners, 10 Turing Award laureates, five National Humanities Medal recipients, 209 Rhodes Scholars, 139 Gates Cambridge Scholars and 126 Marshall Scholars. Two U.S. Presidents, 12 U.S. Supreme Court Justices (three of whom currently serve on the court) and numerous living billionaires and foreign heads of state are all counted among Princeton's alumni body. Princeton has also graduated many prominent members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Cabinet, including eight Secretaries of State, three Secretaries of Defense and three of the past five Chairs of the Federal Reserve.|$|E
25|$|Atiyah's {{mathematical}} collaborators include Raoul Bott, Friedrich Hirzebruch and Isadore Singer, and {{his students}} include Graeme Segal, Nigel Hitchin and Simon Donaldson. Together with Hirzebruch, he laid the foundations for topological K-theory, an important tool in algebraic topology, which, informally speaking, describes ways in which spaces can be twisted. His best known result, the Atiyah–Singer index theorem, was proved with Singer in 1963 and is widely used in {{counting the number of}} independent solutions to differential equations. Some of his more recent work was inspired by theoretical physics, in particular instantons and monopoles, which are responsible for some subtle corrections in quantum field theory. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 and the <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize</b> in 2004.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, Paul Halmos contributed {{significantly}} to probability theory, statistics, and logic. László Lovász made pioneering developments in the study combinatorics, winning both the Wolf Prize and Knuth Prize in 1999. Cornelius Lanczos developed numerous technics for mathematical calculations, of which the Lanczos algorithm and Lanczos approximation are named after him. John von Neumann, acknowledged {{as one of the}} foremost mathematicians of the 20th century, contributed {{to a wide variety of}} fields, including computer science, economics, quantum theory, statistics, and hydrodynamics. Neumann's work on nuclear physics was influential in the Manhattan Project. The John von Neumann Theory Prize and the IEEE John von Neumann Medal are named in his honor. Peter Lax is a winner of the Wolf Prize in Mathematics and the <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize</b> known for his contributions in several mathematical fields.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{played an}} important role in leading Edinburgh to its reputation as a chief intellectual centre during the Age of Enlightenment, and helped give the city the nickname of the Athens of the North. Alumni of the university include some of the major figures of modern history, including physicist James Clerk Maxwell, naturalist Charles Darwin, philosopher David Hume, mathematician Thomas Bayes, surgeon Joseph Lister, signatories of the American declaration of independence James Wilson, John Witherspoon and Benjamin Rush, inventor Alexander Graham Bell, first president of Tanzania Julius Nyerere, and a host of famous authors such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Louis Stevenson, J.M. Barrie and Sir Walter Scott. Associated people include 23 Nobel Prize winners, 2 Turing Award winners, 1 <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize</b> winner, 1 Fields Medal winner, 2 Pulitzer Prize winners, 3 Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom, 2 currently-sitting UK Supreme Court Justices, and several Olympic gold medallists. It continues to have links to the British Royal Family, having had the Duke of Edinburgh as its Chancellor from 1953 to 2010 and Princess Anne since 2011.|$|E
25|$|On {{hearing that}} Ribet had proven Frey's link to be correct, English {{mathematician}} Andrew Wiles, {{who had a}} childhood fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem and had a background of working with elliptic curves and related fields, {{decided to try to}} prove the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture as a way to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. In 1993, after six years working secretly on the problem, Wiles succeeded in proving enough of the conjecture to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. Wiles's paper was massive in size and scope. A flaw was discovered in one part of his original paper during peer review and required a further year and collaboration with a past student, Richard Taylor, to resolve. As a result, the final proof in 1995 was accompanied by a second smaller joint paper showing that the fixed steps were valid. Wiles's achievement was reported widely in the popular press, and was popularized in books and television programs. The remaining parts of the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture, now proven and known as the Modularity theorem, were subsequently proved by other mathematicians, who built on Wiles's work between 1996 and 2001. For his proof, Wiles was honoured and received numerous awards, including the 2016 <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize.</b>|$|E
500|$|Other {{fields of}} {{probability}} were developed {{and used to}} study [...] stochastic processes, with one main approach being the theory of large deviations. The theory has many applications in statistical physics, among other fields, and has core ideas going back to at least the 1930s. Later in the 1960s and 1970s fundamental work was done by Alexander Wentzell in the Soviet Union and Monroe D. Donsker and Srinivasa Varadhan in the United States of America, which would later result in Varadhan winning the 2007 <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize.</b> In the 1990s and 2000s the theories of Schramm–Loewner evolution and rough paths were introduced and developed to study stochastic processes and other mathematical objects in probability theory, which respectively resulted in Fields Medals being awarded to Wendelin Werner in 2008 and to Martin Hairer in 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Trinity College {{also has}} {{claim to a}} number of winners of the Fields Medal (commonly {{regarded}} as the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel Prize): Michael Atiyah, Alan Baker, Richard Borcherds and Timothy Gowers. [...] Atiyah is also an <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize</b> winner.|$|E
2500|$|This theorem {{was first}} conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 {{in the margin}} of a copy of Arithmetica where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. The first {{successful}} proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians. The proof {{was described as a}} 'stunning advance' in the citation for his <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize</b> award in 2016. The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem also proved much of the modularity theorem and opened up entire new approaches to numerous other problems and mathematically powerful modularity lifting techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1936 {{establishment}} of the Fields Medal, often called the [...] "Nobel Prize for mathematics", ten normaliens have been recipients, contributing to ENS's {{reputation as one of}} the world's foremost training grounds for mathematicians: Laurent Schwartz, Jean-Pierre Serre (also a recipient of the inaugural <b>Abel</b> <b>Prize</b> in 2003), René Thom, Alain Connes, Jean-Christophe Yoccoz, Pierre-Louis Lions, Laurent Lafforgue, Wendelin Werner, Cédric Villani and Ngô Bảo Châu. All French holders of the prize were educated at ENS. Alexander Grothendieck, also a Fields medallist, though he was not a normalien, received a substantial part of his training at the school. These eleven former students have made ENS the institution with the most Fields medallist alumni of any institution worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, the German {{industrialist}} {{and amateur}} mathematician Paul Wolfskehl bequeathed 100,000 gold marks—a large sum at the time—to the Göttingen Academy of Sciences to offer as a prize {{for a complete}} proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. On 27 June 1908, the Academy published nine rules for awarding the prize. Among other things, these rules required that the proof be published in a peer-reviewed journal; the prize would not be awarded until {{two years after the}} publication; and that no prize would be given after 13 September 2007, roughly a century after the competition was begun. Wiles collected the Wolfskehl prize money, then worth $50,000, on 27 June 1997. In March 2016, Wiles was awarded the Norwegian government's <b>Abel</b> <b>prize</b> worth €600,000 for [...] "his stunning proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem by way of the modularity conjecture for semistable elliptic curves, opening a new era in number theory." ...|$|E
