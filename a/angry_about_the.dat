5|$|In 1969, {{more than}} 400 students, <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{dismissal}} {{of a popular}} professor, Marlene Dixon, occupied the Administration Building for two weeks. After the sit-in ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended, the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.|$|E
5|$|When Clark {{finally left}} Fort Pitt in August 1781, he was {{accompanied}} by only 400 men, although he expected to meet Lochry and his Pennsylvanians at Fort Henry (present Wheeling, West Virginia). Clark was <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lack of support given his campaign, but he still hoped that the Kentucky militia, who were to rendezvous with him at Fort Nelson (Louisville, Kentucky), would provide additional men. He intended to at least carry out an expedition against enemy Indians {{if he did not}} have enough men to attack Detroit.|$|E
5|$|As Taylor took office, Congress faced {{a battery}} of {{questions}} related to the Mexican Cession, acquired by the U.S. after the Mexican War and divided into military districts. It was unclear which districts would be established into states and which would become federal territories, while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress. Additionally, many in the South had grown increasingly <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> aid that northerners had given to fugitive slaves. While a southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy. His major goal was sectional peace, preserving the Union through legislative compromise. As the threat of Southern secession grew, he sided increasingly with antislavery northerners such as Senator William H. Seward of New York, even suggesting that he would sign the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fact that he had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors {{that he was going to}} make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|Edward now {{expected}} Isabella {{and their}} son to return to England, but instead she remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back. Until 1322, Edward and Isabella's marriage {{appears to have been}} successful, {{but by the time the}} Queen left for France in 1325, it had deteriorated. Isabella appears to have disliked Hugh Despenser the Younger intensely, not least because of his abuse of high-status women. Isabella was embarrassed that she had fled from Scottish armies three times during her marriage to Edward, and she blamed Hugh for the final occurrence in 1322. When Edward had negotiated the recent truce with Robert the Bruce, he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in Scotland, including the Beaumonts, close friends of Isabella's. She was also <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324. Finally, Edward had taken away her children and given the custody of them to Hugh Despenser's wife.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie works with Mercy West resident Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) on a burglar, and the two get in several disagreements, leading Lexie to steal her diary. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Adamson continuously argue {{over the course of}} treatment for a patient, leading the patient's daughter to yell at them in disbelief. <b>Angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> revelation that Percy (who later apologized saying that they can be friends outside the hospital, but not inside) was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong dialysis to a patient, making her an unviable candidate for the kidney transplant she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a cardiothoracic surgeon to work at the hospital. After being mistreated by Kepner, Lexie begins to mock her about what is written in her diary, thus ruining her emotionally, but subsequently apologizes. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Torres' girlfriend, talks to Carlos, and convinces him to accept his daughter's sexuality. Having found out about Stevens' mistake, Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) reprimands her reports her to the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). Webber asks Stevens to come into her office, and he fires her from the staff, noting that Hunt, Shepherd, and Karev had concerns with her coming back to work so early. Stevens departs, writing Karev a Dear John letter, causing him to cry in front of Meredith and Yang.|$|E

He is even <b>angrier</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fact that his warrior-friend Hugh (Huon) de Narbonne gets nothing at all and decides to become renegade until Charlemagne gives him a suitable reward. In the end Charles adds: Aymons weight in gold and his sister Aye. Aymon is not truly satisfied and swears that he will kill any child born out of his union with the king's sister.|$|R

5000|$|Close, a land-use lawyer, called Measure S [...] "the Proposition 13 of this {{generation}} ... We need to stop pay-to-play development". At {{the time he was}} leading opposition to a proposed redevelopment of a closed Sunkist plant in Sherman Oaks, which he said epitomized what the new initiative was intended to stop. Noting that propositions 13 and U, both of which he had played a leading role in, built crucial early support in the San Fernando Valley, he said, that area's support would be essential to Measure S's passage. [...] "Political action starts in the Valley. It aims to change this city." [...] Close believed Measure S would pass overwhelmingly, since voters were even <b>angrier</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> underlying issues than they had been during the campaign for Proposition U.|$|R

25|$|In {{the weeks}} after the rioting, over 11,000 people were arrested. Many of the looters in black {{communities}} were turned in by their neighbors who were <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> destruction of businesses employing and providing basic needs such as groceries to communities in the area. Many of the looters, fearful of prosecution by law enforcement and condemnation from their neighbors, ended up placing the looted items curbside to rid themselves of the items.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failure}} of the Feltre meeting and the first bombing of Rome, the crisis accelerated. The day after Feltre, 20 July, Mussolini met Ambrosio twice. During the second meeting, in the evening, the Duce told him that he had decided to write to Hitler, confessing the need for Italy to abandon the alliance. Still <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> missed {{opportunity}} to do this in Feltre, the indignant Ambrosio offered his resignation to the Duce, who rejected it. For Ambrosio, after Feltre Mussolini was useless, and he realized that any hope that he could pull the chestnuts out of the fire was an illusion. Therefore, he decided to set the putsch in motion.|$|E
25|$|Social {{activism}} {{had existed}} in Eugene {{prior to the}} mall's opening, and it had both a loyal following and an infrastructure. When Eugene acquired a large, landscaped, outdoor public-use venue with convenient public transportation, it seemed in fulfillment of deeply held social needs that were not dependent upon retail sales. People <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam War gathered on the mall. The mall was an ongoing location for counter-cultural activity. Retail customers experienced unhappiness at the widening generation gap. When Springfield Creamery owner Chuck Kesey, brother of author Ken Kesey, brought the Grateful Dead to the Oregon Renaissance Faire to play a benefit concert for the creamery in 1972, the Eugene Mall {{seemed like a good}} waiting room for the next concert. That concert did not occur until 1982.|$|E

25|$|French {{irregular}} forces (Canadian {{scouts and}} Indians) harassed Fort William Henry throughout {{the first half}} of 1757. In January, they ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga. In February, they launched a raid against the position across the frozen Lake George, destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification. In early August, Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort, which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole. When the withdrawal began, some of Montcalm's Indian allies attacked the British column because they were <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lost opportunity for loot, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves. The aftermath of the siege {{may have contributed to the}} transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations, as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward. Modern writer William Nester believes that the Indians might have been exposed to European carriers, although no proof exists.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, Mills {{was asked}} to talk at a New York party about the cruelty of puppy farms and to promote her book about animals, but was <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> guests {{speaking}} over her speech, saying: [...] "Listen up at the back.

Although Baker assisted with the effects in The Exorcist (1973), Dick Smith was the makeup artist who primarily worked on that film, not Baker. Exorcist director William Friedkin was so <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> poster that, upon seeing it on an associate's wall, he tore it down and ripped it to pieces. Baker, {{who did not know}} about the poster in advance, was horrified by the publicity campaign and publicly apologized for it, claiming: [...] "Dick wanted some help so I first went out to do some work on the dummy whose head turns around 360 degrees. I really didn't do anything creative, I just did labor".|$|E

500|$|While {{supported}} by the state's smaller, regional universities, HouseBill1 immediately drew the ire of University of Kentucky president Charles T. Wethington, Jr. Before becoming university president, Wethington had administered the community-college system. Most of the community colleges and the constituencies in their communities also opposed the plan. The university and the community colleges ran advertisements encouraging opposition to the plan; Patton characterized these ads as [...] "mean". Patton was disappointed when Greg Stumbo, {{a leader in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives and former advocate of an independent community-college system, announced his opposition the plan. Stumbo represented the community of Prestonsburg, an eastern Kentucky coal mining town, and Patton surmised that he was still <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> worker's compensation bill. Prestonsburg was also the home of Prestonsburg Community College (now Big Sandy Community and Technical College). In the face of this opposition, Patton negotiated with individual legislators until he was convinced that he had a majority in both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly. He then pushed forward and was able to get the legislation passed.|$|E
500|$|The first legal {{blow to the}} Stanley plan came on January 11, 1957, {{when the}} U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia held in Adkins et al. v. School Board of the City of Newport News, that the pupil {{assignment}} plan was unconstitutional. Numerous other federal courts also struck down the pupil assignment law {{over the next two}} years. The Pupil Assignment Board, however, continued to claim jurisdiction and legal authority over pupil assignments, leading to widespread confusion among Virginia's school boards. In November 1957, Almond was elected Governor of Virginia. Convinced that [...] "massive resistance" [...] was doomed to failure, Almond pushed to abolish the statewide pupil assignment board, and in April 1959 won passage of a new law which returned control over pupil assignment to local school districts. <b>Angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> new law, the three members of the assignment board quit on February 24, 1960. On June 28, 1960, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Adkins and ruled the state pupil assignment board was unconstitutional. During its three-year existence, the state board made 450,000 pupil assignments but had never permitted an African American child to attend school with whites.|$|E
500|$|Gates {{maintained}} a {{suite at the}} Waldorf-Astoria of New City from 1894 onwards. Though he paid US$30,000 yearly for it, his visits pained the hotel's manager, George Boldt, at times. [...] Gates and his guests were often loud and boisterous. [...] He had a private entrance and elevator, but Gates {{had a habit of}} banging on the elevator doors and shouting for service. Boldt instructed his elevator operators to take their time when serving his floor, as it allowed Gates to make as much noise as he wished for a few minutes. Gates' suite was often home to high-stakes poker parties and Baccarat games. Many poker games began on the train from Chicago to New York and were continued at the Waldorf. One poker game lasted for five days and nights; when it was done at least US$2 million had changed hands. Dellora Gates had long since resigned herself to her husband's all-night poker games, but many times became upset about them. [...] Gates made it a practice to keep some unset diamonds in his vest pocket for the times when Dellora became <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> late hours at cards. He would then present a gem to his wife, who would suddenly forget her anger with him. [...] Dellora would take the diamond to Tiffany & Co. to be set in a piece of jewelry of her choice.|$|E
