The band played mostly blues and ballads, but the most popular music among whites in the area was country. Berry wrote, [...] "Curiosity provoked me to lay <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> country stuff on our predominantly black audience {{and some of our}} black audience began whispering 'who is that black hillbilly at the Cosmo?'

500|$|The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was {{released}} that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies {{in its first}} week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, {{with much of the}} criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, [...] "I know <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that".|$|E
500|$|In 1992 Megadeth {{released}} Countdown to Extinction, {{which contained}} songs with compact, accessible structures that resulted with strong sales and significant radio airplay. 1994's Youthanasia and 1997's Cryptic Writings followed a similar route, receiving platinum and gold certification respectively, {{with the latter}} spawning three rock-radio hits. Frontman Dave Mustaine, speaking about the band's commercial breakthrough, said: [...] "I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> success now {{has to do with}} the fact that we're willing to study the marketplace and educate ourselves. Most musicians don't get the opportunity to go into the market with educated strategy.

500|$|Universal Music Group took extreme {{measures}} {{to prevent the}} album from leaking, offering pre-release listening sessions for critics instead of sending out review copies. However, Universal Music Australia's online music store, getmusic.com.au, accidentally released the album for digital sale on 18February 2009, almost {{two weeks before the}} scheduled release date. The complete album appeared on the website for a short time before it was removed, and the accidental sale led to the album's being leaked and shared across the Internet. U2 reacted to the leak with some positivity. The Edge stated, [...] "The one good thing about that is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> fans have already given us their thumbs up.

500|$|Hey Venus! {{reflected}} the group's desire to [...] "capture {{the spirit of}} the band playing live in a room". The album was recorded [...] "very quickly" [...] and, as the band did not feel the need to [...] "experiment so much with such a simple record", is not particularly [...] "sonically adventurous". In Gruff Rhys's words Hey Venus! is [...] "a straight up album of songs... with key changes and a live band playing them" [...] with more emphasis [...] "on songs than the arrangement". According to Rhys [...] "nobody brought samplers into the studio, so there's far less electronics than on <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> records... a lot of electronic music is quite a solitary pursuit. You sit at your computer or sampler and sometimes it's more of an individual kind of thing. Whereas with this record, we were trying to play as a band: a five people at once kind of record." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1983 and 1984, Crass {{were part}} of the Stop the City actions co-ordinated by London Greenpeace which foreshadowed the {{anti-globalisation}} rallies of the early 21st century. Support for these activities was provided in the lyrics and sleeve notes of the band's last single, [...] "You're Already Dead", expressing doubts about their commitment to non-violence. It was also a reflection of disagreements within the group, as explained by Rimbaud; [...] "Half the band supported the pacifist line and half supported direct and if necessary violent action. It was a confusing time for us, and I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> records show that, inadvertently". This led to introspection within the band, with some members becoming embittered and losing sight of their essentially positive stance. Reflecting this debate, the next release under the Crass name was Acts of Love: classical-music settings of 50 poems by Penny Rimbaud, described as [...] "songs to my other self" [...] and intended to celebrate [...] "the profound sense of unity, peace and love that exists within that other self".|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the songs}} on Slap-Happy were {{recorded}} before the band decided to form Wax Tadpole. Sparks and Gardner wrote all the songs, usually at Gardner's home, even though the whole group contributed to the album {{in one form or}} another. Unlike its predecessor, Slap-Happy was made with a low budget. According to Sparks, [...] "We utilized a lot of home studios, did <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> tracking ourselves, used a lot of first takes. I think there's a lot of life in this record, and yet I think when we started our own label we were fearing having to take a major step down in production because of the financial aspects." [...] The album was produced by Brian Haught, a friend of the band who let the band use his studio [...] "just out of the kindness of his heart." [...] It was recorded and mixed at Synical Labs, PCS Studios, Sound City, de Prume Studios, Sonors Studios, and King Sound and Pictures in Los Angeles. Audio mastering took place at Precision Mastering in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|In mid-October 1965, the Beatles {{entered the}} {{recording}} studio; {{for the first}} time when making an album, they had an extended period without other major commitments. Until this time, according to George Martin, [...] "we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles. Now we were really beginning to think about albums as a bit of art on their own." [...] Released in December, Rubber Soul was hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. Their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy. Biographers Peter Brown and Steven Gaines attribute the new musical direction to [...] "the Beatles' now habitual use of marijuana", an assertion confirmed by the band – Lennon referred to it as [...] "the pot album", and Starr said: [...] "Grass was really influential in <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> changes, especially with the writers. And because they were writing different material, we were playing differently." [...] After Help!s foray into the world of classical music with flutes and strings, Harrison's introduction of a sitar on [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music. As their lyrics grew more artful, fans began to study them for deeper meaning. Of [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] Lennon commented: [...] "I was trying to be sophisticated in writing about an affair... but in such a smokescreen way that you couldn't tell." ...|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started writing}} {{the songs on}} the album, she was {{inspired}} by different situations, like having guitar lessons and getting an idea, or sometimes Ahmadzaï would send over a rough demo to her without the basic chord progression. The songs on American Life and their lyrics were developed like that. Explaining her writing process, Madonna told Q magazine that the [...] "music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics. Sometimes I write free verse. I have a journal and I note down ideas I get from newspapers and books". Madonna also remembered Ahmadzaï's downbeat existentialism regarding the condition of society around them, and the long discussions they had into the night, which ultimately reflected into the songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart. American Life was deemed {{by some as a}} concept album featuring political themes based around the United States, with Madonna explaining that she felt [...] "like America has changed over the years and that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame {{just for the sake of}} fame, no matter what— sell your soul to the devil if that's what it takes. And we're also completely obsessed with the way we look." [...] Madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in the writing of the first three songs, the title track, [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid". John Norris from MTV described them as a trilogy, and an indicator of Madonna's reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her. Madonna partly agreed, saying that the tracks are extensions of one another, and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things, and how she could come out of that [...] "illusion". Madonna discussed the materialistic themes of the record and her personal encounters which have led to the composition with MTV saying: ...|$|E
