Convergence may occur over considerable distances and so may permit virtually straight flight while climbing.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Socratic Greek {{philosophers}} and Indian philosophers developed {{some of the}} earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe. The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> water, offers resistance to motion. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.|$|E

Everett returned six months later, however, before being given his own show by Radio Luxembourg in 1966.|$|E

25|$|In 1827, Wheatstone {{introduced}} his 'kaleidophone', a device for rendering the vibrations of a sounding body apparent to the eye.

As the rod vibrates the spot is seen to describe complicated figures in the <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> a spark whirled about in the darkness. His photometer was probably suggested by this appliance. It enables two lights to be compared by the relative brightness of their reflections in a silvered bead, which describes a narrow ellipse, so as to draw the spots into parallel lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue jay}} mainly feeds on nuts and seeds such as acorns, soft fruits, arthropods, and {{occasionally}} small vertebrates.

It builds an open cup nest in {{the branches of a}} tree, which both sexes participate in constructing. The clutch can contain two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8–12 days after hatching. They may remain with their parents for one to two months.|$|E
25|$|John Glover and Eugene von Guerard {{were among}} the {{foremost}} landscape painters during the colonial era. The origins of a distinctly Australian school of painting {{is often associated with}} the Heidelberg School of the late 1800s. Major figures of the movement include Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton and Frederick McCubbin. They painted en plein <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> the French Impressionists, and sought to capture the intense light and unique colours of the Australian bush. Popular works such as McCubbin's Down on His Luck (1889) and Roberts' Shearing the Rams (1890) defined an emerging sense of national identity in the lead-up to Federation. Civic monuments to national heroes were erected; an early example is Charles Summers' 1865 statue of the ill-fated explorers Burke and Wills, located in Melbourne.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, {{he began}} racing on asphalt ovals {{when he entered}} the American Speed Association (ASA) as well as {{part-time}} in the NASCAR Busch Series (now Xfinity Series). In the same year, Johnson won the ASA Pat Schauer Memorial Rookie title. One year later, he had two wins and finished third in the standings. In 2000, he was announced the driver for Herzog Motorsports in the Busch Series. During the season, he had a spectacular accident on lap 46 during the Lysol 200 at Watkins Glen when his brakes failed entering the first turn. He had to swerve quickly to the right to avoid the 86 of Dennis Demers, but went into the grass on the inside of turn one, then went back across the track, caught some air on the gravel trap before finally crashing head-on into the carafoam barriers {{at the far end of}} the turn while still more than 150+ MPH. Many feared that this accident could have resulted in career ending injuries or potentially have killed him, but he climbed out of the car unscathed and raised his fists in the <b>air</b> <b>like</b> he'd won the race, much to the delight of the crowd. Otherwise, in a rather uneventful season which featured one DNQ at Daytona and 6 top-10's, he finished tenth in the point standings. During the 2001 season, Johnson recorded one win, which was at Chicagoland Speedway, and finished eighth in the point standings. He also began racing in the Winston Cup Series (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) for Hendrick Motorsports. In the following season, Johnson left Herzog Motorsports to move to Hendrick Motorsports in the Winston Cup Series, driving the No. 48 Lowe's Chevrolet.|$|E

500|$|His bowling {{was smooth}} and effortless, with a {{classical}} action. He could bowl fast, but more often bowled at fast-medium pace. He could make the ball swing in humid weather, and deliver off-spin when conditions were suitable. However, Hammond was reluctant to bowl, particularly for Gloucestershire. Bill Bowes believed {{that he was a}} very good bowler who would not take it seriously. In his obituary, Wisden said that [...] "at slip he had no superior. He stood all but motionless, moved late but with uncanny speed, never needing to stretch or strain but plucking the ball from the <b>air</b> <b>like</b> an apple from a tree." [...] He was also able to field further away from the batsmen than was the norm, particularly in his younger days, as he could chase the ball quickly and had a very good throwing arm.|$|E
500|$|This airship that {{lifted a}} rider {{consisted}} of a cigar-shaped hydrogen balloon that looked like an inverted boat wrapped in netting.

500|$|Even if the Nazko swarm were {{a warning}} of a {{volcanic}} eruption, Hickson doubted {{it would turn}} out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes.

We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava [...] into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event.|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, most {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} Pteranodon would have taken fish by dipping their beaks into the water while in low, soaring flight. However, this was probably {{based on the assumption}} that the animals could not take off from the water surface. It is more likely that Pteranodon could take off from the water, and would have dipped for fish while swimming rather than while flying. Even a small, female Pteranodon could have reached a depth of at least [...] with its long bill and neck while floating on the surface, and they may have reached even greater depths by plunge-diving into the water from the <b>air</b> <b>like</b> some modern long-winged seabirds. In 1994, Bennett noted that the head, neck, and shoulders of Pteranodon were as heavily built as diving birds, and suggested that they could dive by folding back their wings like the modern gannet.|$|E
500|$|Following Anaximander, his pupil Anaximenes (c. 585–528/4) {{held that}} the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets are all made of fire. But whilst the stars are {{fastened}} on a revolving crystal sphere like nails or studs, the Sun, Moon, and planets, and also the Earth, all just ride on <b>air</b> <b>like</b> leaves because of their breadth. [...] And whilst the fixed stars are carried around in a complete circle by the stellar sphere, the Sun, Moon and planets do not revolve under the Earth between setting and rising again like the stars do, but rather on setting they go laterally around the Earth like a cap turning halfway around the head until they rise again. And unlike Anaximander, he relegated the fixed stars to the region most distant from the Earth. The most enduring feature of Anaximenes' cosmos was its conception of the stars being fixed on a crystal sphere as in a rigid frame, which became a fundamental principle of cosmology down to Copernicus and Kepler.|$|E
