60|$|No {{question}} as to which of the Clintons is the legitimate son of the captain and his wife has ever again troubled them. Edgar and Rupert {{know that they are}} equally dear to those at home, and all are happy in the knowledge that nothing henceforth can break the closeness of their tie, and that it can never be known which is the lawful heir of the estates. What is much more important to them both, neither of them can say which has the first claim on the love and affection of Captain <b>and</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> and of their sister.|$|E

60|$|On Sunday, Mr Clinton put on Sunday clothes, {{and heading}} the little {{procession}} formed by Mrs Clinton {{and the two}} children, went to church, carrying in his hand a prayer book and a hymn book. After dinner he took a little walk with his wife along the neighbouring roads, avenues and crescents, examining {{the exterior of the}} houses, stopping now and then to look at a garden or a well-kept house, or trying to get a peep into some room. Mr <b>and</b> <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> criticised as they went along, comparing the window curtains, blaming a door in want of paint, praising a well-whitened doorstep....|$|E
6000|$|Now {{it seemed}} to her that she cared no more for one than for the other, and that her best plan {{therefore}} was to place in the position of heir whichever of them was most likely to suit her purpose. But here, again, she was in a difficulty. If they resembled each other in no other point, they both looked thoroughly manly, straightforward, and honest lads, neither of whom would be likely to entertain any dishonourable proposition. Her intention had been to say to her son, [...] "You are not really the twin brother, as you suppose, of the other. Captain <b>and</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> do not know which of you two is their child." [...] She wondered whether they already knew as much as that. Probably they did. So many people had known of that affair at Agra, that Captain Clinton had probably told them himself. She would tell the boy, [...] "I am the only person in the world who can clear up the mystery. I have the key to it in my hand, and can place either you or the other in the position of sole heir to the estate. I shall expect to be paid a handsome sum from the one I put into possession. Remember, on one hand I can give you a splendid property, on the other I can show you to have been from the first a usurper of things you had no right to--an interloper and a fraud." ...|$|E

50|$|On January 19, Clinton {{visited the}} Arlington Cemetery {{to visit the}} graves of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy.

After kneeling at the graveside for a few moments, Mr. <b>and</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> each placed a white rose on the grave of Robert Kennedy, who was shot June 5, 1968, while campaigning for the presidency. Mr. Clinton then walked alone to John F. Kennedy's grave and placed another white rose on the marker. He knelt for several seconds before the grave of the man who was shot on Nov. 22, 1963. Clinton had met President Kennedy briefly as a teenager in 1963, and credits that encounter with leading him to enter public service.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} relay {{selection}} schemes in mobile communication system over Nakagami-m channel. To make {{efficient use of}} licensed spectrum, both single relay selection (SRS) scheme <b>and</b> multirelays selection (<b>MRS)</b> scheme over the Nakagami-m channel are proposed. Also, the intercept probability (IP) and outage probability (OP) of the proposed SRS <b>and</b> <b>MRS</b> for the communication links depending on realistic spectrum sensing are derived. Furthermore, this paper assesses the manifestation of conventional direct transmission scheme to compare with the proposed SRS <b>and</b> <b>MRS</b> ones based on the Nakagami-m channel, and the security-reliability trade-off (SRT) performance of the proposed schemes and the conventional schemes is well investigated. Additionally, the SRT of the proposed SRS <b>and</b> <b>MRS</b> schemes is demonstrated better than that of direct transmission scheme over the Nakagami-m channel, which can protect the communication transmissions against eavesdropping attacks. Additionally, simulation results show that our proposed relay selection schemes achieve better SRT performance than that of conventional direct transmission over the Nakagami-m channel...|$|R
50|$|As {{editor of}} Self magazine, Penney succeeded the founder, Phyllis Starr, {{who died of}} breast cancer. Wanting {{to pay tribute to}} Starr and knowing that breast cancer was nationally underfunded, Penney, working with Nancy Smith, the {{executive}} editor of Self, created the first pink ribbon with SI Newhouse Jr's, (owner of Conde Nast), permission. At a meeting {{on the same day that}} the ribbon was created, she called Evelyn Lauder, a friend and breast cancer survivor, to edit the first breast cancer issue of Self and to ask for her help in getting the pink ribbon to Estee Lauder customers. Lauder, then Sr VP of Estee Lauder, immediately responded positively and began to take the pink ribbon global through Estee Lauder sales counters. Lauder and Penney worked tirelessly to popularize the ribbon through the magazine and through the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which was founded by Lauder. Both Penney and Lauder were commended at the White House by President <b>and</b> <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ames {{occupied}} the house until 1878, {{when he retired}} due to health problems. He sold the house and his business interests to George Florida, {{who lived in the}} house along with two of his three sisters, his mother, and his aunt. They lived in the house until his death in 1936. Mr. <b>and</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> Stork bought the house in 1936. The Storks were interested in history and antiques, and they recognized the historical significance of the house. They resolved to preserve the house and to share it with school children, the community, and others interested in state and local history. The house was donated to the city of Rockford in 1986. [...] The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as the Ames-Florida House. [...] It was listed for its local significance in architecture, commerce, industry, and settlement for its associations with the founding of Rockford around the Ames-Florida mill.|$|E

The service was officiated by the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, a friend of Richard Nixon's, who called him [...] "one of the most misunderstood men, and I think he was one of the greatest men of the century." [...] Eulogies were delivered by Graham, Henry Kissinger, Senator Bob Dole, Pete Wilson, Governor of California, and President Clinton.
