40|$|Operational Modal Analysis relies {{upon the}} {{fundamental}} assumption that input is unmeasured {{and consists of}} a Gaussian white noise characterized by a flat spectrum in the bandwidth of interest. If this assumption is not fulfilled, the modal identification process may fail due to <b>spurious</b> <b>frequencies</b> appearing in response spectra. It is often possible to identify such non-structural frequencies, {{but they can also}} sometimes bias estimates. This is basically the case of spurious harmonics close to structural modes. About civil structures, <b>spurious</b> <b>frequencies</b> can be due to rotating machines but also to interaction with adjacent constructions, as discussed herein, where natural frequencies of a given structure are mixed together with those ones due to interaction with similar close structures; as a result, response spectra are characterized by several close peaks in a narrow bandwidth. An integrated use of output-only techniques is proposed to discriminate modal from <b>spurious</b> <b>frequencies</b> and applied to a real test case. ...|$|R

30|$|Primary {{frequency}} control is an automatic governor response {{in proportion to}} the <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> from the scheduled value. This response, also called frequency responsive reserve, is typically provided by a conventional generator with governor droop control to regulate its power output as a function of <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> and droop setting [50, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68]. A WTG’s primary frequency regulation resembles that of a conventional generator, which is usually activated within a few tens of seconds and sustained for up to 15 min once the grid <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> exceeds the allowable threshold [67]. It {{plays an important role in}} mitigating the steady-state <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> after inertial response until the secondary {{frequency control}} (automatic generation control, AGC) takes over to achieve zero frequency error in the steady-state condition.|$|R
40|$|In an {{electric}} power grid {{that has a}} high penetration level of wind, the power fluctuation of a large-scale wind power plant (WPP) caused by varying wind speeds deteriorates the system frequency regulation. This paper proposes a power-smoothing scheme of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) that significantly mitigates the system frequency fluctuation while preventing over-deceleration of the rotor speed. The proposed scheme employs an additional control loop relying on the system <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> that operates {{in combination with the}} maximum power point tracking control loop. To improve the power-smoothing capability while preventing over-deceleration of the rotor speed, the gain of the additional loop is modified with the rotor speed and <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation.</b> The gain is set to be high if the rotor speed and/or <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> is large. The simulation results based on the IEEE 14 -bus system clearly demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly lessens the output power fluctuation of a WPP under various scenarios by modifying the gain with the rotor speed and <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation,</b> and thereby it can regulate the <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> within a narrow range...|$|R

30|$|In {{contrast}} with Case 2, {{the case with}} the proposed method (Case 3) is faster in settling the oscillations of the tie-line power, and results in smaller <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> in Area 1.

However, as for Case 3, the frequency drop in Area 1 is limited to 0.012  Hz, and the maximum <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> of all the three areas does not exceed 0.016  Hz. It indicates that the proposed method (Case 3) has better comprehensive performance than the methods [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] in stabilizing the system frequency in all the areas. When there’s disturbance in Area 1, the DR resources in Area 2 and Area 3 can also provide strong support for frequency control in Area 1 (Fig.  4 h, i), so that the maximum <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> can be reduced.|$|R

30|$|These {{examples}} {{indicate that}} a very fast response reduces the maximum value of <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation.</b> However, if this very fast response is combined with a critically high delay, then the system becomes unstable. A larger t_r does not introduce negative damping for the same delays and allows the system to be stable for relatively large PRT values. The disadvantage of this method is that the maximum <b>frequency</b> <b>deviations</b> are larger and the resulting oscillations have increased settling times, compared to the case where an immediate full response is allowed. The best behaviour from the power system’s perspective seems to occur when a very fast response is combined with a minimal delay.

40|$|<b>Frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> is {{a common}} problem for power system signal processing. Many power system {{measurements}} are carried out in a fixed sampling rate assuming the system operates in its nominal frequency (50 or 60 Hz). However, the actual frequency may deviate from the normal value {{from time to time}} due to various reasons such as disturbances and subsequent system transients. Measurement of signals based on a fixed sampling rate may introduce errors under such situations. In order to achieve high precision signal measurement appropriate algorithms need to be employed to reduce the impact from <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> in the power system data acquisition process. This paper proposes an advanced algorithm to enhance Fourier transform for power system signal processing. The algorithm is able to effectively correct <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> under fixed sampling rate. Accurate measurement of power system signals is essential for the secure and reliable operation of power systems. The algorithm is readily applicable to such occasions where signal processing is affected by <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation.</b> Both mathematical proof and numerical simulation are given in this paper to illustrate robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Any mismatch between generation and demand causes the system frequency to deviate from its nominal value. Thus high <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> may lead to system collapse.

This newly developed control strategy combines the advantage of neural networks and fuzzy inference system and has simple structure that is easy to implement.

30|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} electrical parameters of power systems, frequency and its dynamic characteristic is crucial for power system operation and control [1]. Frequency dynamics interacts with many devices in power systems in two ways. First, the performance of many devices are affected by frequency, e.g., speed governor of synchronous generators, induction motors, power system stabilizer (PSS) with frequency as input, and reactance and susceptance of transmission lines or shunt components. Second, the dynamic behaviour of system frequency is also affected by those frequency-dependent devices. Besides, dynamic characteristic of frequency is a key factor influencing power system protection. Generators are protected against abnormal <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> with over-speeding and under-speeding protective relays. Under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) is an important resort to prevent power system collapse in the event of large generation deficit [2, 3]. The cooperation between the generating unit protective relays and UFLS is important for power system frequency stability [4]. Moreover, investigation into some blackouts indicates that large <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> is a main factor pushing power systems to the edge [5]. In the process of power systems restoration, <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> should be carefully restricted by gradually starting generators and loads to avoid large <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> and subsequent system failure [6]. Furthermore, with large scale of renewable energy integrated into power grids, power fluctuation from renewables will lead to continuous power system <b>frequency</b> fluctuation and <b>deviation</b> [7]. Primary and secondary frequency regulation have important effect on preventing <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation.</b> The participation of renewable energy generation in frequency regulation also plays an important role in frequency security, regulation, and control. Therefore, it is necessary to study the dynamic behaviour of power system frequency for improving the operation performance of modern power systems.|$|R
