5|$|Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese, {{a teenage}} refugee and admirer of John Connor and the Resistance. As portrayed by Michael Biehn in The Terminator, {{he was sent}} {{back in time to}} 1984 to protect Sarah Connor to ensure the {{survival}} of the human race, and fathered John with her. Yelchin said he wanted to portray Kyle as Biehn did <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> him appear weaker because it was a younger version of the character. The difference in his portrayal lies in showing Kyle as intense, but not concentrated until he joins the resistance proper. Yelchin tried to convey Kyle's intensity by focusing on how fast Biehn appeared when running in the original film.|$|E
5|$|The {{season was}} fairly active, with fifteen {{tropical}} cyclones forming. It {{was the first}} time since the 1971 season that there were no active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin during the month of June. The season was neutral, having neither an El Niño nor a La Niña. Three tropical cyclones during in the Atlantic Ocean in 1980were notable. Hurricane Allen was then the earliest Category5 hurricane on record and also devastated portions of the Caribbean Sea, Mexico, and the United States. Tropical Storm Hermine caused significant flooding in Mexico, which resulted in at least 38fatalities. Hurricane Jeanne was one of only four tropical cyclones at hurricane intensity to enter the Gulf of Mexico <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> landfall.|$|E
5|$|This season {{produced}} eight tropical depressions, {{of which}} five became named storms; two attained hurricane status, of which one {{became a major}} hurricane, a storm that ranks as a Category3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Hurricane Alberto {{was one of four}} storms to attain hurricane status in the Gulf of Mexico <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> landfall. The other three were Laurie of 1969, Henri of 1979, and Jeanne of 1980. However, rains from Alberto caused severe flooding, which killed 23 people in Cuba. Hurricane Debby was the only major hurricane of the season, peaking as a weak Category 4 over the open waters of the Atlantic basin. Tropical Storm Ernesto was the last storm of the season. It peaked in intensity on October 2 just below hurricane status. The storm dissipated the next day, 58 days before the official end of the season.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} {{writing the}} dialogue, Takumi was called into another meeting with Inaba, {{and was told}} to add a new gameplay mechanic to the investigations. Takumi {{wanted to keep the}} gameplay simple enough for his mother {{to be able to play}} it, and keep it focused on the core concept of finding lies; according to him, he immediately had a vision of the psyche lock system during the meeting with Inaba, but still asked for three days to come up with an idea. He found it easy to formulate the idea, but it took over a month to create the system; the biggest problem was how to visually represent the psyche locks. Takumi also drew storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consisted of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening. He also drew rough sketches of cut-in illustrations; it was only decided after all the text had been written what scenes would have illustrations made for them. While the game's opening features the judge, it was originally supposed to have featured a demon instead; this was because Takumi was playing Devil May Cry at the time, and had liked its opening. As Takumi wanted the first three Ace Attorney games to be part of one larger work, he did not want the first game to look outdated in comparison to later ones, so it was decided to keep the same graphics for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth throughout all their appearances, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> updates to them. The game's music was composed by Naoto Tanaka under the pseudonym Akemi Kimura.|$|E
25|$|In the Anguttara Nikaya (5:33), Buddha tells future wives {{that they}} should be obedient to their husbands, please them, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> them angry through their own desires. Furthermore, the Buddha offers advice to married women in the Anguttara Nikaya (7:59; IV 91-94), from the Pali (Theravada) canon, where he tells of seven types of wives—the first three types are destined for unhappiness, while the last four, as they are imbued with long term self-control, are destined to be happy. These latter wives are characterised as caretakers (motherly-wife), companions (friend-wife) and submissives (sister-wife and slave-wife)—the Buddha thus {{endorsed}} a variety of types of wives within marriage.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the first}} seven games of the 2012 season, the Bears became the first team in league history to return six {{interception}}s for touchdowns, with another interception by Brian Urlacher in Week 9 bringing the Bears closer to the record set by the 1961 San Diego Chargers. However, after the Bears missed the playoffs after starting the year 7–1, making the Bears {{the first team to}} start the season 7–1 <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs since the 1996 Washington Redskins, Smith was fired, and was eventually succeeded by Montreal Alouettes head coach Marc Trestman. On March 20, 2013, the Brian Urlacher era also came to an end when he and the Bears failed to agree on a new contract.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{entering}} {{the last week}} of the season with a three-game winning streak, the Patriots found themselves not controlling their own destiny. In addition to a Week 17 win, they also needed either a Miami Dolphins loss to win the AFC East, or a Baltimore Ravens loss to earn a wild card playoff berth. However, both Baltimore and Miami won, and the Dolphins, Ravens and Patriots all finished the season with identical 11–5 records. Miami qualified for the playoffs by winning the AFC East division over the Patriots on the fourth divisional tiebreaker (better conference record: 8–4 to 7–5). Baltimore qualified for the playoffs as a wild card team, defeating the Patriots on the second wild card tiebreaker (better conference record: 8–4 to 7–5). The Patriots thus became the first team since the 1985 Denver Broncos to finish with an 11–5 record <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|Whether Machiavelli is overstating {{issues and}} Piero had merely ordered a {{thorough}} accounting is unknown. Machiavelli can probably be trusted here {{since there was}} a rash of bankruptcies and bank failures in Florence shortly after Cosimo's death {{which led to a}} small recession. De Roover mentions, however, the war between Venice and the Ottoman Empire and the relevant firms' connections to that area as a possible factor as well. It is certain, however, that Piero tried to wind up the London branch and recover as much of the loans made to Edward IV as possible, ordered the Milan branch to loan less, instructed Tommaso Portinari of the Bruges branch {{to get rid of the}} galleys <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> any loans to secular rulers, and attempted to shut down the Venice branch which was no longer profitable. From the perspective of carrying out his policies, Piero faced a number of obstaclesit was always politically costly to demand that loans be repaid, particularly when made to monarchs and powerful nobles and such demands could cost Piero dearly close to home. The King of England had him over a barrel as the king could block any attempts to export English wool by the Medici, which was desperately needed by the bank for two reasons. English wool was the finest in the world; if Florence's artisans did not have a supply of English wool to weave, it could not sell its textile wares, and more importantly, could not employ the Florentine lower classes who specialized in textiles. Flemish wool had once served in English wool's place, but after the 1350s, it no longer had a market in Italy and was essentially not imported after 1400. Unemployment generated considerable political unrest and revolts, which would be aimed at Piero and the Medici since he and his family were seen as the true rulers of Florence. The second reason was that there was a systemic specie problem in the Medici bank in which hard currency flowed south to Italy from the northern countries, and the import of English wool was necessary to provide a conduit for currency to flow north and balance the books. So when King Edward IV demanded loans, the London branch had little choice but to oblige him if it wanted to continue to export English wool to Florence.|$|E
500|$|The {{test plant}} in Notodden started {{operation}} on 2 May 1905 {{as the first}} in the world to produce synthetic potassium nitrate. On 2 December 1905 Norsk Hydro-Elektrisk Kvælstofaktieselskab (now Norsk Hydro) was founded, and plans to start a new plant in Rjukan were initialized; moving closer to the source of power would improve efficiency <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> it possible for the newly independent Government of Norway to hinder construction of hydroelectric power by foreign investors—a major political issue at the time. Rjukanfos applied for permission to build a power line from Rjukan to Notodden, but on 18 June 1907 the Norwegian Parliament did not accept the application, despite an offer from Eyde that the state would receive escheat after eighty years, in part because the state would have to guarantee [...] for the project.|$|E

500|$|During its {{formative}} stage, a high-pressure area {{combined with}} the low pressure of Marco resulted in a tight pressure gradient which led to beach erosion and gale force winds on the Florida coast. In Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties, heavy surf generated by the combination of those systems caused [...] of beach erosion. Additionally, [...] of top sand were lost in that region. Further north, severe beach erosion caused the loss {{of as much as}} [...] of the dune line in Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie, and Martin counties. Other impact was minimal. Marco was one of few hurricanes to enter the Caribbean Sea <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> landfall. Also, Hurricane Hunter flights recorded volatile center structure with severe turbulence, extreme rainfall, and hail during a flight into the storm. Overall, Marco caused 14fatalities and approximately $8.2million in damage.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|Liam Neeson reprises {{his role}} as the voice of the lion Aslan. Aslan is [...] "more parental here, [...] lets the kids, well, make their own mistakes". Aslan's {{entrance}} was filmed as a dream sequence to emphasize his messianic nature, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> it reflect badly on his absence when Narnia is in turmoil. Although the character is considered C.S. Lewis' version of Jesus, Neeson [...] "see him more as the spirit of the planet – this living, breathing planet. That's what he stands for, for me; more what the native Americans would believe." [...] As Aslan has fewer action scenes than in the first film, the animators found it difficult to make him move interestingly. His pose had to be regal, but if he moved his head too much, he would remind viewers of a dog. As well as having his size increased by fifteen percent, Aslan's eyes were also changed to look less [...] "Egyptian". Many of his shots were finished at the last minute.|$|E

500|$|Michael Schur, co-creator of Parks and Recreation, said [...] "Boys' Club" [...] marked {{an attempt}} to better develop Andy Dwyer. Schur said, [...] "We {{definitely}} wanted to dimensionalize his character <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> him just a one-dimensional douchebag." [...] In the episode, Andy plays a tape of himself singing a song called [...] "Ann", which he wrote as a romantic ballad for her. Chris Pratt actually wrote and performed the song himself for the show, although {{he said in an}} interview, [...] "it really wasn't much". Pratt actually appeared on set naked while filming the scene in which he chases Lawrence through the streets without clothes on. Schur said the scene was written because Pratt [...] "loves taking his clothes off". It proved difficult to film the scenes with Pratt bathing in the children's pool because the bubbles disappeared so quickly that multiple takes were required. The scenes with Andy running naked through the streets with his crutches to get his boombox back were inspired by a real-life experience from the set. During filming, an announcement was made that specialty coffees were available for the cast and crew, and Pratt ran quickly after them with the crutches. Greg Daniels added it to [...] "Boys' Club" [...] because he found the experience extremely funny.|$|E
500|$|Nearly 41 million US viewers watched NBC's {{coverage}} of the event. Criticism was levelled at its decision to tape-delay this broadcast, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> a live version available even to cable and web users. [...] There were frequent interruptions by commercial breaks. Many US viewers looked for other ways to watch (such as the live BBC feed), despite both NBC and the IOC vowing {{to crack down on}} unauthorised streams. More significant criticism was levelled at NBC for cutting to a Ryan Seacrest interview with Michael Phelps during the 'memorial wall' tribute including commemoration of the victims of the 7/7 London bombings, which was seen as disrespectful and insensitive. An NBC spokesman said the network had left out that segment because its programming was [...] "tailored for the US audience". There was also criticism of commentators Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira for suggesting that the Queen had actually jumped out of a helicopter. Vieira and Lauer admitted to not knowing that Tim Berners-Lee was the inventor of the World Wide Web, as she commented [...] "If you haven't heard of him, we haven't either", before Lauer told the audience to Google him. These failings were picked up on Twitter during the broadcast with the hashtag #nbcfail. Commentary by Bob Costas and Lauer during the Parade of Nations was also criticised for their negative opinions about some countries' political environments and for leaving out information about the athletes, which was seen as [...] "smug American elitism". [...] It was noted that they spoke about some countries with [...] "outright condescension".|$|E
