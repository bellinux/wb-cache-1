5|$|Helped by Gilchrist's running <b>and</b> <b>quarterback</b> Kemp's passing, the Bills {{finished}} the 1964 {{season with a}} 12–2 record and won the AFL championship. The team won despite drama involving Gilchrist, who came into conflict with Saban frequently and asked to be traded on numerous occasions.

5|$|Buffalo {{received}} the ball first {{to begin the}} game, and returned the opening kickoff to their own 24-yard line. They were unable to move the ball in threeplays, and punted the ball to Connecticut. The Huskies took possession on their own 18-yard line and drove down the field with alternating rushes by running back Donald Brown <b>and</b> <b>quarterback</b> Tyler Lorenzen, earning two first downs. On 2nddownand5 from the UConn 49-yard line, Lorenzen was sacked by Buffalo's Sherrod Lott and fumbled; the ball was recovered by UConn right tackle Mike Hicks, allowing the Huskies to retain possession.

5|$|Florida State {{began work}} at its 30-yard line, again needing to just {{run down the}} clock to ensure victory. As before, however, Drew Weatherford took to the air, {{throwing}} a two-yard pass. Two rushing plays followed, but were stopped for little gain. Florida State again went three-and-out and had to punt. Two {{and a half minutes}} had been run off the clock, and Virginia Tech took over at its own 30-yard line after a seven-yard kick return. Unlike the two previous drives, however, Virginia Tech had almost no success on offense. A 10-yard holding penalty pushed the Hokie offense back to start the drive, <b>and</b> <b>quarterback</b> Marcus Vick was sacked for a loss to finish off the Tech possession. VT was forced to punt the ball back to Florida State, which took over at its 43-yard line with 6:21 remaining.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, {{former coach}} <b>and</b> <b>quarterback</b> William Skinner {{helped lead the}} {{formation}} of the Maryland Intercollegiate Football Association (MIFA) in order to improve the process of naming the state champions. Other teams involved included Baltimore City College, Gallaudet, Johns Hopkins, Washington College, and Western Maryland. The game against St. John's once again aroused controversy, and the MAC accused their opponent of hiring s from Lehigh. When Johns Hopkins canceled their game, Maryland arranged to play Georgetown instead. The Maryland team called the game with a 6–4 lead as darkness fell. However, the referee, Georgetown halfback Mike Mahoney, ruled it a forfeiture and awarded the win to Georgetown. Today, Maryland and Georgetown both count the game as a Maryland Agricultural win in their records.|$|E
