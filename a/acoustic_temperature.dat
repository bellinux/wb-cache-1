40|$|The {{objectives}} of the proposed research are to model, optimize, and control variable frequency microwave (VFM) curing of polymer dielectrics. With an increasing demand for new materials and improved material properties, there is a corresponding demand for new material processing techniques that lead to comparable or better material properties than conventional methods. Presently, conventional thermal processing steps can take several hours. A new thermal processing technique known as variable frequency microwave curing can perform the same processing steps in minutes without compromising the intrinsic material properties. Current limitations in VFM processing include uncertain process characterization methods, lack of reliable temperature measuring techniques, {{and the lack of}} control over the various processes occurring in the VFM chamber. Therefore, the proposed research addressed these challenges by: (1) development of accurate empirical process models using statistical experimental design and neural networks; (2) recipe synthesis using genetic algorithms; (3) implementation of an <b>acoustic</b> <b>temperature</b> sensor for VFM process monitoring; and (4) implementation of neural control strategies for VFM processing. and # 8194;Ph.

Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Program Solicitation DE-PS 26 - 02 NT 41422 and {{specifically}} addresses Technical Topical Area 2 - Gasification Technologies. The project team includes Enertechnix, Inc. {{as the main}} contractor and ConocoPhillips Company as a technical partner, who also provides access to the SG Solutions Gasification Facility (formerly Wabash River Energy Limited), host for the field-testing portion of the research. The objective of this project was to adapt acoustic pyrometer technology to make it suitable for measuring gas temperature inside a coal gasifier, to develop a prototype sensor based on this technology, and to demonstrate its performance through testing on a commercial gasifier. The project was organized in three phases, each of approximately one year duration. The first phase consisted of researching a variety of sound generation and coupling approaches suitable for use with a high pressure process, evaluation {{of the impact of}} gas composition variability on the <b>acoustic</b> <b>temperature</b> measurement approach, evaluation of the impact of suspended particles and gas properties on sound attenuation, evaluation of slagging issues and development of concepts to deal with this issue, development and testing of key prototype components to allow selection of the best approaches, and development of a conceptual design for a field prototype sensor that could be tested on an operating gasifier. The second phase consisted of designing and fabricating a series of prototype sensors, testing them in the laboratory, and developing a conceptual design for a field prototype sensor. The third phase consisted of designing and fabricating the field prototype, and testing it in the lab and in a commercial gasifier to demonstrate the ability to obtain accurate measurements of gas temperature in an operating gasifier. Following the completion of the initial 3 year project, several continuations were awarded by the Department of Energy to allow Enertechnix to conduct extended testing of the sensor at the Wabash River facility. In February, 2008 the sensor was installed on the gasifier in preparation for a long-term test. During the initial testing of the sensor a stainless steel tube on the sensor failed and allowed syngas to escape. The syngas self-ignited and the ensuing small fire damaged some of the components on the sensor. There was no damage to the gasifier or other equipment and no injuries resulted from this incident. Two meetings were held to identify the root causes of the incident-one at Wabash River and one at Enertechnix. A list of recommended improvements that would have addressed the causes of the incident was created and presented to the Department of Energy on May 2, 2008. However, the DOE decided not to pursue these improvements and terminated the project. This report describes all of the activities conducted during the project and reports the findings of each activity in detail. The investigation of potential sound generation and coupling methods led to the selection of a reflected shock method which has been developed into a functioning prototype device. The principles of operation of this device and its performance characteristics are described in the report. Modeling of the attenuation of sound by suspended particles and by interaction of the sound pulses with the high temperature syngas inside the gasifier was conducted and the predictions of those models were used to determine the required sound pulse intensity to allow the sound pulses to be detected after passage through the gasifier environment. These modeling results are presented in this report. A study of the likely spatial and temporal variability of gas composition inside the gasifier was performed and the results of that study was used to predict the impact of that variability on the accuracy of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>temperature</b> method. These results are reported here. A design for a port rodding mechanism was developed to deal with potential slagging issues and was incorporated into the prototype sensor. This port rodding mechanism operated flawlessly during the field testing, but because these tests were performed in a region of the gasifier that experiences little slagging, the effectiveness of the rodding mechanism in dealing with highly slagging conditions was not fully demonstrated. This report describes the design and operation of the automated Gasifier Acoustic Pyrometer (autoGAP) which was tested at the Wabash River facility. The results of the tests are reported and analyzed in detail. All of the objectives of the initial R&D project were achieved and a field prototype acoustic pyrometer sensor was successfully tested at the Wabash River gasifier plant...|$|E
40|$|Diagnostic {{ultrasound}} is a safe, {{inexpensive and}} highly portable real-time imaging modality for viewing the human body. For over two decades, lipid-coated fluorocarbon microbubble contrast agents {{have been developed}} to help improve the diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities of ultrasound, but they have certain limitations. Recently, {{it was found that the}} microbubbles can be condensed into superheated liquid nanodrops capable of being vaporized by external optical or acoustic triggers. The compact form and vaporization effects of these phase-shift nanodrops may offer advantages over microbubbles for a number of current and future therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The goal of this dissertation work was to study the molecular thermodynamics and interfacial phenomena of these superheated phase-shift nanodrops. In the first part of this work, a custom microscopy pressure chamber with control over temperature and pressure was used to observe microbubbles during condensation. Compression behaviors of fluorocarbon microbubbles constructed with lipid shells of varying acyl chain lengths were quantified over a broad temperature range. Microbubbles containing lipids of longer acyl chains were found to resist ideal compression and condensation. Dissolution was found to dominate as temperature approached the lipid main phase transition temperature, resulting in incomplete condensation. However, successful condensation of gas-filled microbubbles to liquid-filled nanodrops could be achieved at lower temperatures, and fluorescence microscopy showed that the lipid monolayer shell buckles and folds into surface-attached bilayer strands. The nanodrops were found to be remarkably stable when brought back to standard temperature and pressure. The temperature-pressure data were used to construct condensation phase diagrams to determine the thresholds for successful nanodrop formation. In the second part of this study, the superheated nanodrops were vaporized back into microbubbles by changes in temperature and pressure. A custom optical chamber with control over temperature and pressure was used to track the kinetics of condensation, vaporization and dissolution of microbubble suspensions with varying fluorocarbon core and lipid shell compositions. A simple model was used to extract kinetic rates from the optical data, and Arrhenius plots were used to determine activation energies. The activation energy for thermal vaporization was found to vary with lipid acyl chain length, and a simple model of lipid intermolecular forces was used to explain this effect. Additionally, thermal vaporization was found to occur near 90 % of the critical temperature of the fluorocarbon core, indicating that metastability of the superheated droplets was due to the low probability of homogenous nucleation rather than a Laplace overpressure. The superheated droplets could be reversibly vaporized and condensed to at least ten cycles, showing remarkable stability. In the final part of this study, the tunability of vaporization was examined through the mixing of fluorocarbon gases in droplet core. A clinical ultrasound imaging system was used to track vaporization as a function of temperature and mechanical index. Discrepancies were found in the vaporization thresholds owing to mass transfer; the high solubility of the lower fluorocarbon caused it to rapidly deplete. However, a successful <b>acoustic</b> <b>temperature</b> probe was demonstrated. The experimental data from all three parts of this study were examined and explained by conventional molecular thermodynamics theory, providing new insights into the behavior and properties of these novel theranostic agents...|$|E

The project team includes Enertechnix, Inc. {{as the main}} contractor and ConocoPhillips Company as a technical partner, who also provides access to the SG Solutions Gasification Facility (formerly Wabash River Energy Limited), host for the field-testing portion of the research. Since 1989 the U. S. Department of Energy has supported development of advanced coal gasification technology. The Wabash River and TECO IGCC demonstration projects supported by the DOE have demonstrated the ability of these plants to achieve high levels of energy efficiency and extremely low emissions of hazardous pollutants. However, a continuing challenge for this technology is the tradeoff between high carbon conversion which requires operation with high internal gas temperatures, and limited refractory life which is exacerbated by those high operating temperatures. Attempts to control internal gas temperature so as to operate these gasifiers at the optimum temperature have been hampered {{by the lack of}} a reliable technology for measuring internal gas temperatures. Thermocouples have serious survival problems and provide useful temperature information for only a few days or weeks after startup before burning out. For this reason, the Department of Energy has funded several research projects to develop more robust and reliable temperature measurement approaches for use in coal gasifiers. Enertechnix has developed a line of acoustic gas temperature sensors for use in coal-fired electric utility boilers, kraft recovery boilers, cement kilns and petrochemical process heaters. Acoustic pyrometry provides several significant advantages for gas temperature measurement in hostile process environments. First, it is non-intrusive so survival of the measurement components is not a serious problem. Second, it provides a line-of-sight average temperature rather than a point measurement, so the measured temperature is more representative of the process conditions than those provided by thermocouples. Unlike radiation pyrometers, the measured temperature is a linear average over the full path rather than a complicated function of gas temperature and the exponential Beer's law. For this reason, acoustic pyrometry is well suited to tomography allowing detailed temperature maps to be created through the use of multiple path measurements in a plane. Therefore, acoustic pyrometry is an attractive choice for measuring gas temperature inside a coal gasifier. The objective of this project is to adapt acoustic pyrometer technology to make it suitable for measuring gas temperature inside a coal gasifier, to develop a prototype sensor based on this technology, and to demonstrate its performance through testing on a commercial gasifier.
