5|$|As {{a result}} of Rubí's recommendations, Presidio de San Agustín de Ahumada was closed in 1771, leaving the Texas coast unoccupied except for La Bahía. In July 1772, however, the {{governor}} of Texas heard rumors that English traders were building <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>in</b> {{the area of the}} Texas coast that had been abandoned. The commander of La Bahía was sent to find the settlement, but saw no sign of other Europeans. His expedition did, however, discover that the San Jacinto River emptied into Galveston Bay and not into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} miners {{were able to}} reach <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>in</b> early 1990, {{the case of the}} UMWA vs. Pittston Coal Company did not end in 1990. The fines, over $60 million, did not come into {{bargaining}} until 1994 and Pittston agreed to drop most of the charges. However, since the case was now in the court system, many courts wanted the UMWA to be responsible for all of the fines. The UMWA appealed all fines against them and the case remained undecided for many years.|$|E
5|$|The Kettle Creek was {{inhabited}} by the Iroquois and the Delaware prior to European settlement. European explorers reached the watershed in the mid-1700s {{and the first}} settlers arrived in 1794. Most of the early settlers were farmers.

Overseen by William Radde and Charles Maine, Germania developed quickly between the 1850s and the 1870s. Slovaks began moving into the watershed in the early 1900s.|$|E

The area now known as Sheffield had seen human occupation since at least the last ice age, but significant growth in the settlements that are now incorporated into the city did not occur until the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|When Bounty {{returned}} to Tahiti, on 22 September, the welcome {{was much less}} effusive than previously. The Tahitians had learned from the crew of a visiting British ship {{that the story of}} Cook and Bligh founding <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>in</b> Aitutaki was a fabrication, and that Cook had been long dead. Christian worried that their reaction might turn violent, and did not stay long. Of the 16 men who had voted to settle in Tahiti, he allowed 15 ashore; Joseph Coleman was detained on the ship, as Christian required his skills as an armourer.|$|E

5|$|D'Ávila {{had plans}} to {{establish}} <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>in</b> Montejo's name near Puerto de Caballos, but knew it fell within the jurisdiction of Honduras, and that Cerezeda would never support such a move. In any case, the situation in Trujillo was too precarious for Cerezeda to support a major expedition. D'Ávila became embroiled in the factional politics of the town, taking the part of Diego Díaz de Herrera. After a time, he decided to leave Honduras, and took passage {{with the majority of}} his men on a ship that stopped at Trujillo, which took them back to Yucatán. A few of D'Ávila's men stayed and settled in Trujillo, where the situation continued to deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|In 1695, the Parliament of Scotland {{granted a}} charter to the Company of Scotland, which {{established}} <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>in</b> 1698 on the Isthmus of Panama. Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of New Granada, and afflicted by malaria, the colony was abandoned two years later. The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland — {{a quarter of}} Scottish capital {{was lost in the}} enterprise — and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, persuading the governments of both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries, rather than just crowns. This occurred in 1707 with the Treaty of Union, establishing the Kingdom of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 1879, a {{group from}} Leadville struck gold in the {{uppermost}} Roaring Fork valley below the pass. Four miles (6.4km) to the west, they established <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>in</b> the upper Roaring Fork Valley that eventually took the name Independence from the holiday on which it was established. The pass, the lake from which the Roaring Fork rises and another nearby mountain all took that name as well. The Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company, established to build a road through to the camps in the lower Roaring Fork Valley, improved the original path over the pass sufficiently enough by 1880 that horses {{could be used for}} the trip.|$|E

They knew how to dig and build wells, so the settlements didn't have to be located near bodies of water. Thirteen 2nd century wells with variously constructed timber lined walls were found at <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>in</b> Stanisławice, Bochnia County. Fields were being used for crop cultivation {{for a while and}} then as pastures, when animal excrement helped the soil regain fertility. Once iron share plows were introduced the fields were alternated between tillage and grazing.|$|E
