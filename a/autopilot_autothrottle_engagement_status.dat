40|$|Automated {{aircraft}} {{control has}} traditionally been divided into distinct functions that are implemented separately (e. g., <b>autopilot,</b> <b>autothrottle,</b> flight management); each function has its own fault-tolerant computer system, and dependencies among different functions are generally limited to the exchange of sensor and control data. A by-product of this federated architecture is that faults are strongly contained within the computer system of the function where they occur and cannot readily propagate to affect the operation of other functions...|$|R
5000|$|Both {{approaches}} {{were conducted}} in flight director mode, with the <b>autopilot</b> and <b>autothrottles</b> disengaged. There were no significant heading or altitude deviations from the prescribed approach course.|$|R
25|$|They are low wing, T-tail {{airplanes}} with cabin pressurization, {{powered by}} two rear mounted turbofans. The landing gear is fully retractable {{and designed to}} be operated on paved runways only. The glass cockpit includes four multi-function displays. The operation is made through a flight management system with <b>autopilot,</b> <b>autothrottle</b> and closed-loop control and monitoring of flight controls Fly-By-Wire. The aircraft are certified for Day, Night, VFR and IFR flights, and are approved for reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) airspace and flight into known icing conditions, extended flight over water, Category II ILS, operations at high altitude airports up to 13800ft and steep approach operations.|$|R
2500|$|The final enquiry report {{stated that}} [...] "after the base turn, {{approaching}} the landing course at 600 m with both <b>autopilot</b> and <b>autothrottle</b> disengaged, the aircraft started climbing up to 1300 m, rolled 360Â° over {{the left wing}} and collided with the ground".|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} aircraft longitudinal {{flight control}} system uses a generalized thrust and elevator command computation (38), which accepts flight path angle, longitudinal acceleration command signals, along with associated feedback signals, to form energy rate error (20) and energy rate distribution error (18) signals. The engine thrust command is developed (22) {{as a function of}} the energy rate distribution error and the elevator position command is developed (26) {{as a function of the}} energy distribution error. For any vertical flight path and speed mode the outerloop errors are normalized (30, 34) to produce flight path angle and longitudinal acceleration commands. The system provides decoupled flight path and speed control for all control modes previously provided by the longitudinal <b>autopilot,</b> <b>autothrottle</b> and flight management systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamentals}} of control integration for propulsion are reviewed giving practical illustrations of its use {{to demonstrate the}} advantages of integration. Attention {{is given to the}} first integration propulsion-control systems (IPCSs) which was developed for the F- 111 E, and the integrated controller design is described that NASA developed for the YF- 12 C aircraft. The integrated control systems incorporate a range of aircraft components including the engine, inlet controls, <b>autopilot,</b> <b>autothrottle,</b> airdata, navigation, and/or stability-augmentation systems. Also described are emergency-control systems, onboard engine optimization, and thrust-vectoring control technologies developed for the F- 18 A and the F- 15. Integrated flight-propulsion control systems are shown to enhance the thrust, range, and survivability of the aircraft while reducing fuel consumption and maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, NASA has {{conducted}} several experiments in integrated flight-propulsion control. Benefits have included improved maneuverability; increased thrust, range, and survivability; reduced fuel consumption; and reduced maintenance. This paper presents the basic concepts for control integration, examples of implementation, and benefits. The F- 111 E experiment integrated the engine and inlet control systems. The YF- 12 C incorporated an integral control system involving the inlet, <b>autopilot,</b> <b>autothrottle,</b> airdata, navigation, and stability augmentation systems. The F- 15 research involved integration of the engine, flight, and inlet control systems. Further extension of the integration included real-time, onboard optimization of engine, inlet, and flight control variables; a self-repairing flight control system; and an engines-only control concept for emergency control. The F- 18 A aircraft incorporated thrust vectoring integrated with the flight control system to provide enhanced maneuvering at high angles of attack. The flight research programs and the resulting benefits of each program are described...|$|R
40|$|Automated {{aircraft}} {{control has}} traditionally been divided into distinct "functions" that are implemented separately (e. g., <b>autopilot,</b> <b>autothrottle,</b> flight management); each function has its own fault-tolerant computer system, and dependencies among different functions are generally limited to the exchange of sensor and control data. A by-product of this "federated" architecture is that faults are strongly contained within the computer system of the function where they occur and cannot readily propagate to affect the operation of other functions. More modern avionics architectures contemplate supporting multiple functions on a single, shared, fault-tolerant computer system where natural fault containment boundaries are less sharply defined. Partitioning uses appropriate hardware and software mechanisms to restore strong fault containment to such integrated architectures. This report examines the requirements for partitioning, mechanisms for their realization, and issues in providing assurance for partitioning. Because partitioning shares some concerns with computer security, security models are reviewed and compared with the concerns of partitioning...|$|R
40|$|The STOLAND system {{includes}} air data, navigation, guidance, {{flight director}} (including a throttle flight director on the Augmentor Wing), 3 -axis <b>autopilot</b> and <b>autothrottle</b> functions. The 3 -axis <b>autopilot</b> and <b>autothrottle</b> control through parallel electric servos on both aircraft {{and on the}} augmentor wing, the system also interfaces with three electrohydraulic series actuators which drive the roll control surfaces, elevator and rudder. The system incorporates automatic configuration control of the flaps and nozzles on the augmentor wing and of the flaps on the Twin Otter. Interfaces are also provided to control the wing flap chokes on the Augmentor Wing and the spoilers on the Twin Otter. The STOLAND system has all the capabilities of a conventional integrated avionics system. Aircraft stabilization is provided in pitch, roll and yaw including control wheel steering in pitch and roll. The basic modes include altitude hold and select, indicated airspeed hold and select, flight path angle hold and select, and heading hold and select. The system can couple to TACAN and VOR/DME navaids for conventional radial flying...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{integrated}} {{control systems}} are studied. Such systems allow minimization of undesirable interactions while maximizing performance at all flight conditions. One such {{program is the}} YF- 12 cooperative control program. The existing analog air data computer, <b>autothrottle,</b> <b>autopilot,</b> and inlet control systems are converted to digital systems by using a general purpose airborne computer and interface unit. Existing control laws are programed and tested in flight. Integrated control laws, derived using accurate mathematical models of the airplane and propulsion system in conjunction with modern control techniques, are tested in flight. Analysis indicates that an integrated <b>autothrottle</b> <b>autopilot</b> gives good flight path control and that observers are used to replace failed sensors...|$|R
25|$|The {{crash was}} caused {{primarily}} by the aircraft's automated reaction which was triggered by a faulty radio altimeter. This caused the autothrottle to decrease the engine power to idle during approach. The crew noticed this too late to take appropriate action to increase the thrust and recover the aircraft before it stalled and crashed. Boeing has since issued a bulletin to remind pilots of all 737 series and BBJ aircraft {{of the importance of}} monitoring airspeed and altitude, advising against the use of <b>autopilot</b> or <b>autothrottle</b> while landing in cases of radio altimeter discrepancies.|$|R

40|$|Altitude {{deviations}} are {{the most}} common pilot error reported to the Aviation Safety Reporting System. Last year, altitude deviations were reported to the ASRS at the rate of about one per hour. The reporting pilot's narrative is usually our only source of information about what happened in these incidents. In a recent line-oriented, simulator study, twenty-two airline crews flew a realistic, two-hour mission in a DC- 9 and an MD- 88 aircraft.

25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} accident was the loss of spatial orientation by the crew and chiefly by the Captain who was piloting the aircraft during the landing phase. The plane banked left, overturned and went into a rapid descent. The loss of spatial orientation occurred in the night, while flying in the clouds, with <b>autopilot</b> and <b>autothrottle</b> switched off. Poor CRM and insufficient training for using the Western type of attitude indicators contributed to the accident.

40|$|A {{generalized}} automatic {{flight control}} system was developed which integrates all longitudinal flight path and speed control functions previously provided by a pitch <b>autopilot</b> and <b>autothrottle.</b> In this design, a net thrust command is computed based on total energy demand arising from both flight path and speed targets. The elevator command is computed based on the energy distribution error between flight path and speed. The engine control is configured to produce the commanded net thrust. The design incorporates control strategies and hierarchy to deal systematically and effectively with all aircraft operational requirements, control nonlinearities, and performance limits. Consistent decoupled maneuver control is achieved for all modes and flight conditions without outer loop gain schedules, control law submodes, or control function duplication...|$|R
40|$|The Total Energy Control System was {{developed}} and tested in September 1985 during five flights on the NASA Langley Transport System Research Vehicle, a modified Boeing B 737. In the system, the total kinetic and potential energy of the aircraft {{is controlled by the}} throttles, and the energy distribution is controlled by the elevator. A common inner loop is used for each mode of the autopilot, and all the control functions of a conventional pitch <b>autopilot</b> and <b>autothrottle</b> are integrated into a single generalized control concept, providing decoupled flightpath and maneuver control, and a coordinated throttle response for all maneuvers. No instabilities or design problems requiring gain adjustment in flight were found, and comparison with simulation results showed excellent path tracking...|$|R
40|$|Integrations {{trends in}} {{aircraft}} are discussed {{with an eye}} to manifestations in future aircraft designs through interdisciplinary technology integration. Current practices use software changes or small hardware fixes to solve problems late in the design process, e. g., low static stability to upgrade fuel efficiency. A total energy control system has been devised to integrate <b>autopilot</b> and <b>autothrottle</b> functions, thereby eliminating hardware, reducing the software, pilot workload, and cost, and improving flight efficiency and performance. Integrated active controls offer reduced weight and larger payloads for transport aircraft. The introduction of vectored thrust may eliminate horizontal and vertical stabilizers, and location of the thrust at the vehicle center of gravity can provide vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. It is suggested that further efforts will open a new discipline, aeroservoelasticity, and tests will become multidisciplinary, involving controls, aerodynamics, propulsion and structures...|$|R
40|$|Accidents {{attributable}} to in-flight {{loss of control}} are the primary cause for fatal commercial jet accidents worldwide. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) conducted a literature review to determine and identify the quantitative standards for assessing upset recovery performance. This review contains current recovery procedures for both military and commercial aviation and includes the metrics researchers use to assess aircraft recovery performance. Metrics include time to first input, recognition time and recovery time and whether that input was correct or incorrect. Other metrics included are: {{the state of the}} <b>autopilot</b> and <b>autothrottle,</b> control wheel/sidestick movement resulting in pitch and roll, and inputs to the throttle and rudder. In addition, airplane state measures, such as roll reversals, altitude loss/gain, maximum vertical speed, maximum/minimum air speed, maximum bank angle and maximum g loading are reviewed as well...|$|R
2500|$|The {{data from}} the flight {{recorder}} also showed that the same altimeter problem had happened twice during the previous eight landings but that on both occasions the crew had taken the correct action by disengaging the autothrottle and manually increasing the thrust. Investigations {{are under way to}} determine why more action had not been taken after the altimeter problem was detected. In response to the preliminary conclusions, Boeing issued a bulletin, Multi-Operator Message (MOM) 09-0063-01B, to remind pilots of all 737 series and Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) aircraft of the importance of monitoring airspeed and altitude (the [...] "primary flight instruments"), advising against the use of <b>autopilot</b> or <b>autothrottle</b> while landing in cases of radio altimeter discrepancies. Following the release of the preliminary report, Dutch and international press concluded that pilot inattention caused the accident, though several Turkish news publications still emphasized other possible causes.|$|R

40|$|A new {{guidance}} technique, {{referred to}} as 4 -D guidance, is being developed to improve the operation of future STOL aircraft transportation systems. 4 -D guidance refers to a technique of synthesizing a complex three-dimensional flight path from simple pilot inputs and flying the aircraft along the path according to an ATC specified time schedule. The two major elements of a 4 -D guidance system are the trajectory synthesizer and the control law for flying the aircraft along the synthesized trajectory using the aircraft's <b>autopilot</b> and <b>autothrottle.</b> Inputs to the trajectory synthesizer are the three-dimensional coordinates of waypoints, the turning radius, the speed range, the acceleration limits and the arrival time at time control waypoints. First the three-dimensional trajectory is computed using circular arcs and straight lines. Then the airspeed profile, compensated for wind, is calculated to achieve the desired arrival times. The pilot is informed if the arrival times cannot be achieved. The synthesized trajectory is stored as a time sequence of reference states and controls which the aircraft is forced to track using a linear feedback law...|$|R
40|$|The Total Energy Control System (TECS) is an {{integrated}} autopilot/autothrottle developed by BCAC that was test flown on NASA Langley's Transport System Research Vehicle (i. e., a highly modified Boeing B 737). This systems was developed using principles of total energy {{in which the}} total kinetic and potential energy of the airplane was controlled by the throttles, and the energy distribution controled by the elevator. TECS integrates all the control functions of a conventional pitch <b>autopilot</b> and <b>autothrottle</b> into a single generalized control concept. This integration provides decoupled flightpath and maneuver control, {{as well as a}} coordinated throttle response for all maneuvers. A mode hierarchy was established to preclude exceeding airplane safety and performance limits. The flight test of TECS took place as a series of five flights over a 33 -week period during September 1985 at NASA Langley.

40|$|The pilot-machine {{interface}} with cockpit automation {{is a critical}} factor in achieving the benefits of automation and reducing pilot blunders. To improve this interface, an automatic terminal approach system (ATAS) was conceived that can automatically fly a published instrument approach by using stored instrument approach data to automatically tune airplane radios and control an airplane <b>autopilot</b> and <b>autothrottle.</b> The emphasis in the ATAS concept is a reduction in pilot blunders and work load by improving the pilot-automation interface. A research prototype of an ATAS was developed and installed in the Langley General Aviation Simulator. A piloted simulation study of the ATAS concept showed fewer pilot blunders, but no significant change in work load, when compared with a baseline heading-select autopilot mode. With the baseline autopilot, pilot blunders tended to involve loss of navigational situational awareness or instrument misinterpretation. With the ATAS, pilot blunders tended to involve a lack of awareness of the current ATAS mode state or deficiencies in the pilots' mental model of how the system operated. The ATAS display provided adequate approach status data to maintain situational awareness...|$|R

Using this dataset, we gain better understanding of what speaker cues children can decode to find backchannel timing, and what type of nonverbal behaviors they produce to indicate <b>engagement</b> <b>status</b> as a listener. Applying our BOP model, we conducted two studies, within- and between-subjects, using our social robot platform, Tega. Behavioral and self-reported analyses from the two studies consistently suggest that children are more engaged with a contingent backchanneling robot listener.
