5|$|As {{the company}} expanded, it {{was subject to}} several legal issues {{regarding}} trademarks. Because of its use as <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> American law schools, {{one of the most}} prominent incidents of infringement in the United States occurred with the similarly named Burger King located in Mattoon, Illinois. Eugene and Elizabeth Hoots owned an ice cream shop in the city of Mattoon; due to the success of the store, in 1957 they expanded it with an additional shop in a former garage next to the original operation. Keeping with theme related to the name of the ice cream shop, Frigid Queen, they named their burger stand Burger King and registered their trademark with the state of Illinois in 1959. In 1962 The Hootses, with knowledge of the Federal trademark held by Burger King Corporation, added a second location in Charleston, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Other Triturus species only meet at narrow zones {{on their}} range borders. Hybridisation does occur {{in several of}} these contact zones, as shown by genetic data and {{intermediate}} forms, but is rare, supporting overall reproductive isolation. Backcrossing and introgression do however occur as shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis. In <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian crested newt were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern crested newt. The two marbled newt species {{can be found in}} proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both directions at some parts of the contact zone, and only {{in the direction of the}} southern marbled newt where that species had historically replaced the marbled newt (see also above, Glacial refugia and recolonisation).|$|E
