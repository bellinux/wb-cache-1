5|$|Silver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive {{explosive}} used in percussion caps, {{is made by}} {{reaction of}} silver metal with nitric acid {{in the presence of}} ethanol. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide, and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with <b>acetylene</b> gas in ammonia solution. In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.|$|E
5|$|Some silver {{compounds}} are very explosive, {{such as the}} nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and <b>acetylene</b> should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E
5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of <b>acetylene</b> in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E

40|$|The {{reactivity}} of open-shell titanium(III) complexes in organometallic catalysis {{is associated with}} many open questions, in particular regarding the electronic structure of catalytic intermediates and transition states. The unpaired electron density in principle allows for radical-type reactivity, {{while at the same}} time empty d orbitals allow more traditional cis-coordination insertion pathways. In this paper we investigated the (Cp*) 2 TiIII-catalyzed cross-dimerization of aliphatic and aromatic <b>acetylenes,</b> focusing on the {{reactivity of}} two different aliphatic <b>acetylenes</b> with a series of different aromatic <b>acetylenes.</b> The applied aliphatic <b>acetylenes</b> 1 a (4 -methylpent- 1 -yne) and 1 b (N,N-dimethyl-N-propargylamine) have the same size but different electron-accepting abilities. The better π-accepting substrate 1 b shows a higher reactivity and selectivity than substrate 1 a in the studied cross-dimerization reactions. Stronger π back-donation from the titanium-localized SOMO to the substrate thus seems to be a reasonable explanation for the improved selectivity of substrate 1 b. DFT calculations indeed suggest a stronger binding of substrate 1 b as compared to that of 1 a in the selectivity-determining steps of the reaction, thus leading to faster insertions and higher selectivities with substrate 1 b. ...|$|R

It was designed by Edmund Blacket in 1854 and established in 1857. Over the years the light source went through several changes, from oil wick, to kerosene, to <b>acetylene</b> gas, to electricity, and finally to solar power. The structures also went through various modifications, the major one being {{an increase in the}} lighthouse height and rebuilding of several structures, in 1928–1930.|$|E
5|$|Trace {{amounts of}} ammonia, <b>acetylene,</b> ethane, propane, {{phosphine}} and methane {{have been detected}} in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading {{to a series of}} hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.|$|E
5|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must {{be present in}} the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size. In addition to methane, large amounts of ethane and tholins as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, <b>acetylene</b> and high-mass alkanes (like propane) may be present, most likely created by photolysis of methane by solar radiation. The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of nitrogen ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level of nitrogen as on Pluto and Triton, where it composes more than 98percent of the crust. The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Dinitrogen {{is able to}} {{coordinate}} to metals in five different ways. The more well-characterised ways are the end-on M←N≡N (η1) and M←N≡N→M (μ, bis-η1), in which the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation. The less well-characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the triple bond, either as a bridging ligand to two metal cations (μ, bis-η2) or to just one (η2). The fifth and unique method involves triple-coordination as a bridging ligand, donating all three electron pairs from the triple bond (μ3-N2). A few complexes feature multiple N2 ligands and some feature N2 bonded in multiple ways. Since N2 is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide (CO) and <b>acetylene</b> (C2H2), the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in carbonyl compounds, although N2 is a weaker σ-donor and π-acceptor than CO. Theoretical studies show that σ donation is a more important factor allowing {{the formation of the}} M–N bond than π back-donation, which mostly only weakens the N–N bond, and end-on (η1) donation is more readily accomplished than side-on (η2) donation.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{detailed}} analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup, primarily their color. These first data showed {{a broad range of}} colors among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red. This suggested that their surfaces were composed {{of a wide range of}} compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons. This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of the volatile ices from their surfaces to the effects of cosmic rays. Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing. Jewitt and Luu's spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in color was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts. The radiation from the Sun is thought to have chemically altered methane on the surface of KBOs, producing products such as tholins. Makemake has been shown to possess a number of hydrocarbons derived from the radiation-processing of methane, including ethane, ethylene and <b>acetylene.</b>|$|E

These methodologies are remarkably general in scope and have proven to be extremely useful methods for the synthesis {{of a wide variety of}} hetero- and carbocycles. Thus, aryl and vinylic iodides with a nucleophilic substituent in the ortho or allylic position respectively, react with 1, 2 -dienes in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a chiral bisoxazoline ligand to afford five- and six-membered ring heterocycles and carbocycles in good yields and 46 to 88 % enantiomeric excess. The generality of this process has been demonstrated by the use of nucleophilic substituents as varied as tosylamides, alcohols, carboxylic acids and stabilized carbanions.
