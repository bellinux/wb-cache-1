5|$|After {{a meeting}} between Scott and Zaillian on another project, Zaillian brought the project up again with Scott, who decided {{he was ready to}} do it. Producer Brian Grazer <b>and</b> <b>Imagine</b> {{executive}} Jim Whitaker decided against pursuing George's attempt and to return to Zaillian's vision. In February 2006, Ridley Scott entered talks with the studio to take over American Gangster from George, returning to Zaillian's draft as the film's basis. Washington returned to his role as Lucas, and Russell Crowe was attached to star as Roberts. Crowe was drawn to the project based on his previous work with the director on Gladiator and A Good Year, while Washington wanted to work with Crowe again, after 1995's Virtuosity. Production was slated in summer 2006.|$|E
5|$|Development for {{the film}} {{initially}} began in 2000, when Universal Pictures <b>and</b> <b>Imagine</b> Entertainment purchased the rights to a New York magazine story about {{the rise and fall}} of Lucas. Two years later, screenwriter Steven Zaillian introduced a 170-page scriptment to Scott. Original production plans were to commence in Toronto for budget purposes; however, production eventually relocated permanently to New York City. Because of the film's rising budget Universal canceled production in 2004. After negotiations with Terry George, it was later revived with Scott at the helm in March 2005. Principal photography commenced over a period of five months from July to December 2006; filming took place throughout New York City and concluded in Thailand.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is {{proposed}} that real <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> movements activate identical neural networks. Cortical oscillatory activity {{is proposed}} {{as a mechanism}} through which distributed neuronal networks may bind into coherent ensembles and coupling of oscillators {{is used as a}} tool to investigate modulations of cortical connectivity. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test the hypothesis that, although the same brain network is involved in both real <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> movements, the functional connectivity within the network differs. To do so, we measured interregional coupling, quantified using coherence between scalp EEG electrodes, during different periods of a prehension task during real <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> movements. The results demonstrated a different pattern of coupling in the beta frequency range between electrodes overlying occipital and motor cortices during executed <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> movements. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the neural networks during real <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> movements are not identical...|$|R

25|$|Martin and Sugarman {{describe}} {{memory and}} imagination as two ontic (real) characteristics {{of human nature}} which are vital to humans' capacity for dialogue. According to Martin and Sugarman, it is through both that {{people are able to}} remember the conversations that “we furnished with the symbolic and relational tools we require to consider past experiences and previous learning, and to entertain future possibilities” because memory allows humans to reconstruct their past while imagination allows them “to project selves into the future”. In other words, when humans converse with others, they recall memories <b>and</b> <b>imagine</b> future possibilities to help themselves mentally construct potential ways for understanding themselves (self-interpretation) and their world, and their place in it, so they know how to relate to others.|$|E

25|$|Ward, a young {{traveling}} salesman of dry goods, {{was concerned}} over {{the plight of}} many rural Midwest Americans who were, he thought, being overcharged and under-served {{by many of the}} small town retailers on whom they had to rely for their general merchandise. He opened his first mail-order house in 1872. By heavy use of the railroads centered on Chicago, and by associating his business with the non-profit Patrons of Husbandry (the Grangers), Ward offered rural customers a far larger stock than generally available in small towns and at a lower price. Unlike local country merchants, Ward offered no bargaining and no credit. His free catalog, printed by the most modern methods, was widely mailed to customers, allowing them to see pictures of consumer goods <b>and</b> <b>imagine</b> how they might be used. Later, Ward used the Post Office's Rural Free Delivery service; he lobbied for a parcel post system that came about in 1906. The early 20th century was the heyday of mail orders and Ward's had become an American tradition, along with its rival Sears Roebuck.|$|E
25|$|Stories are {{effective}} educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember. Storytelling {{can be seen}} as a foundation for learning and teaching. While the storylistener is engaged, they are able to imagine new perspectives, inviting a transformative and empathetic experience. This involves allowing the individual to actively engage in the story as well as observe, listen and participate with minimal guidance. Listening to a storyteller can create lasting personal connections, promote innovative problem solving and foster a shared understanding regarding future ambitions. The listener can then activate knowledge <b>and</b> <b>imagine</b> new possibilities. Together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions. Because stories often have multiple layers of meanings, listeners have to listen closely to identify the underlying knowledge in the story. Storytelling is used as a tool to teach children the importance of respect through the practice of listening. As well as connecting children with their environment, through the theme of the stories, and give them more autonomy by using repetitive statements, which improve their learning to learn competence. It is also used to teach children to have respect for all life, value inter-connectedness and always work to overcome adversity. To teach this a Kinesthetic learningstyle would be used, involving the listeners through music, dream interpretation, or dance.|$|E

In 2002, screenwriter Steven Zaillian brought a 170-page script to director Ridley Scott, who expressed interest in making two films from it. However, Scott did not immediately pursue the project, choosing to make Kingdom of Heaven instead. In November 2003, Universal <b>and</b> <b>Imagine</b> entered negotiations with Brian De Palma to direct Tru Blu, with a script by Zaillian based on Frank Lucas. Zaillian interpreted the story as one of [...] "American business and race", focusing the script thematically on corporate business. Production was initially slated for a spring 2004 start. In March 2004, the studio entered new negotiations with Antoine Fuqua to direct, as well as Denzel Washington to star in the film as Frank Lucas. The following May, Benicio del Toro entered negotiations to star as Detective Richie Roberts, who brought down Lucas. Production of Tru Blu was reset to begin in early fall 2004, with the film slated for a release date of June 3, 2005. In September 2004, Dania Ramirez entered negotiations to join the cast of the film, now titled American Gangster.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of mental fatigue on the duration of actual <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> goal-directed arm movements involving speed-accuracy trade-off. Ten participants performed actual <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> point-to-point arm movements as accurately and as fast as possible, before and after a 90 -min sustained cognitive task inducing mental fatigue, and before and after viewing a neutral control task (documentary movie) that did not induce mental fatigue. Target width and center-to-center target distance were varied, resulting in five different indexes of difficulty. Prior to mental fatigue, actual <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> movement duration increased with the difficulty of the task, as predicted by Fitts' law. Mental fatigue task induced a 4. 1 +/- 0. 7 % increase in actual movement duration and a 9. 6 +/- 1. 1 % increase in imagined movement duration, independently of the index of difficulty. The trial-by-trial evolution of actual <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> movement duration remained stable with mental fatigue. The control task did not induce any change in actual <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> movement duration. The results suggested that movement was slowed in the presence of mental fatigue, maybe due to proactive changes occurring during the preparatory state of the movement, to preserve task success.
