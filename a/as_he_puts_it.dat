[...] {{after a series}} of people in the courtroom say [...] "Oh no!!" [...] in turn. The Kool-Aid Man then slowly backs out of the hole in the wall in embarrassment.

He also asks for full disclosure of all past clinical trial results, and a list of academic papers that were, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "rigged" [...] by industry, so that they can be retracted or annotated. He asks drug company employees to become whistleblowers, either by writing an anonymous blog, or by contacting him.|$|E
500|$|Lesser {{begins the}} section on [...] "Broadcasting" [...] {{relating}} {{the origin of the}} show's name. [...] <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "...We were forced to select the name we all liked the least". [...] Lesser reports that the show's premiere on November 10, 1969 was met with a large amount of acclaim and good reviews, but there were some negative reviews and criticism, which he recounts and addresses in great detail in the chapter entitled [...] "Criticism". [...] He includes the criticism of approximately thirty groups and individuals, and demonstrates the essence and range of their arguments.|$|E

500|$|Conatus is {{a central}} theme in the {{philosophy}} of Benedict de Spinoza (1632–1677). According to Spinoza, [...] "each thing, as far as it lies in itself, strives to persevere in its being" [...] (Ethics, part 3, prop. 6). Spinoza presents a few reasons for believing this. First, particular things are, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> modes of God, which means that each one expresses the power of God in a particular way (Ethics, part 3, prop. 6, dem.). Moreover, it could never be part of the definition of God that his modes contradict one another (Ethics, part 3, prop. 5); each thing, therefore, [...] "is opposed to everything which can take its existence away" [...] (Ethics, part 3, prop. 6, dem.). This resistance to destruction is formulated by Spinoza in terms of a striving to continue to exist, and conatus is the word he most often uses to describe this force.|$|E
500|$|Author Elliot Huntley views Living in the Material World as {{a concept}} album on which the material–spiritual [...] "quandary" [...] evident in the title track is [...] "eloquently expressed" [...] through the artwork's mix of {{religious}} symbolism and an inner-gatefold photograph that showed [...] " [...] band indulging in a gratuitously sumptuous feast". The stretch-limousine image was a detail taken from this photo, the concept for which reflected Harrison's view that the material world is not only related to money and possessions, but to [...] "everything which is gross, physical, or material {{as opposed to the}} subtle, astral or casual", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in I, Me, Mine when discussing the song. NME critic Bob Woffinden also commented on the symbolism of this picture showing [...] "Harrison with his musicians (Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Jim Keltner, Ringo – the usual lot) enjoying a hearty repast, passing the no-doubt vintage wine, while in the background the longest limousine in the world awaits their convenience".|$|E
500|$|Harrison taped {{the basic}} track for {{his version of}} [...] "Far East Man" [...] at Friar Park over August and September 1974, during {{sessions}} for his album Dark Horse. Having [...] "brushed up the lyrics a bit", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in I, Me, Mine, Harrison retained Newmark and Weeks from the sessions with Wood, and brought in keyboard player Billy Preston and saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott, both of whom would also be part of his all-American tour band. Leng describes [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "the first Harisong to tap into 1970s soul" [...] and notes the [...] "supreme soul credentials" [...] of Newmark, as the former drummer with Sly and the Family Stone, and Weeks, who had supplied the highly regarded basslines on Donny Hathaway Live (1972). Newmark later recalled of his and Weeks' first sessions for Harrison: [...] "We were completely thrilled {{to be asked to}} play on his record … It was the most exciting thing to happen to me. I had to keep pinching myself to remember it was real." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for USA Today, D'Angelo said of the album's title and its meaning, [...] "the myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung–in religious [...] ceremonies." [...] In {{an interview}} for Jet magazine, he stated that his intentions for recording the album were to express the power of music and artistic respect for it. The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. Voodoos press release discussed D'Angelo's concept, stating [...] "Lyrically, D'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was just to go farther. To get to that next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I'm hearing ... and the thing is, I'm just looking at Voodoo as just the beginning. I'm still developing and growing and still listening to that sound I hear inside my head ... So {{this is the first}} step".|$|E
500|$|After Wally goes AWOL for {{a second}} day, David is pressed into service. [...] He admits to Karros and the judge in {{chambers}} {{that he has never}} seen the inside of a courtroom. [...] Karros, in a moment of humanity, offers a deal: if David finishes the trial, she will not pursue sanctions against Finley & Figg. [...] Judge Seawright offers to help David through the trial and adds that Finley & Figg probably won't suffer from any malpractice lawsuits if the trial goes through. [...] David agrees to finish the trial but there is hardly any real case for him to present. Karros tears to pieces the main Finley & Figg expert witness: a Russian doctor of very questionable credentials and whose English is atrocious even after fifteen years in the U.S. The second expert, an equally shady pharmacologist, escapes without testifying, pocketing the $50,000 he got from Finley & Figg. Rueben Massey, Varrick's CEO, instructs Karros not to move for likely successful summary judgment, he is determined to have a jury clear Krayoxx of all charges and Varrick's public relations machine stands ready to trumpet this decision in all the media. Zinc declineS to cross-examine the row of expert witnesses that Varrick calls, all having impeccable credentials and David having no facts with which to shake their defense of Krayoxx. Rather, he spends the time studying Karros' methods, [...] "learning from a master", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in his own mind.|$|E
2500|$|In Tye's {{thought there}} is no {{question}} of qualia without information being contained within them; it is always [...] "an awareness that", always [...] "representational". He characterizes the perception of children as a misperception of referents that are undoubtedly as present for them as they are for grown-ups. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> they may not know that [...] "the house is dilapidated", but {{there is no}} doubt about their seeing the house. After-images are dismissed as presenting no problem for the Transparency Theory because, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> after-images being illusory, there is nothing that one sees.|$|E

2500|$|Alfred Harbage {{analyzes}} Shakespeare's [...] "sense of history" [...] <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it.</b> [...] This definitely centers {{itself on}} the idea of reflexivity, especially {{at the beginning of the}} poem, where Shakespeare shows the [...] "baggage" [...] that he enters his writing with.|$|E
2500|$|According to Smelser and Daivies, Kurowski's accounts, {{including}} Infantry Aces, {{celebrate the}} German soldiers who (in Kurowski's worldview) served their country honourably and fought valiantly against tremendous odds, {{only to return}} to Germany, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "wounded and broken, ashamed and beaten". They write that the author's aim is to restore their reputation and that he [...] "intends his books {{to act as an}} appropriate memorial to these men".|$|E

Ed Weatherby, son of Roy Weatherby says that the [...]270 Weatherby is his {{favorite}} caliber. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> there just isn't a better long-range deer caliber. He goes on to mention that it is also quite effective for elk, and pronghorn.|$|E
2500|$|Communication {{between human}} beings propels the {{evolution}} of a culture, he argues, but language also carries the histories, values, and aesthetics of a culture along with it. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "Language as culture is the collective memory bank of a people's experience in history. Culture is almost indistinguishable from the language that makes possible its genesis, growth, banking, articulation, and indeed its transmission {{from one generation to the}} next" [...] (15).|$|E
2500|$|Al-Khattab has {{two major}} concerns. Firstly, he wants all the non-Muslims off {{the lands of}} Muhammad. Secondly, he is {{concerned}} about the manner in which women are dressed. He doesn't want to see women dressed [...] "like whores", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> or [...] "bouncing around on television topless". When asked for his thoughts on the September 11 attacks, he traces the blame back {{to the creation of the}} state of Israel. He also takes the opportunity to advise Great Britain to [...] "take your forces off our lands; correct yourselves; fix your society; fix your women." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Hakuin's major {{concerns}} was {{the danger of}} what he called [...] "Do-nothing Zen" [...] teachers, who upon reaching some small experience of enlightenment devoted the rest of their life to, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "passing day after day in a state of seated sleep". Quietist practices seeking simply to empty the mind, or teachers who taught that a tranquil [...] "emptiness" [...] was enlightenment, were Hakuin's constant targets. In this regard he was especially critical of [...] followers of the maverick Zen master Bankei. He stressed a never-ending and severe training to deepen the insight of enlightenment and forge one's ability to manifest it in all activities. He urged his students to never be satisfied with shallow attainments, and truly believed that enlightenment was possible for anyone if they exerted themselves and approached their practice with real energy.|$|E
2500|$|Ivașcu was {{detained}} {{for a while}} in the same cell as another disgraced communist, Belu Zilber, with whom he became friends and later bitter rivals. In his account of their time together, Zilber claims that Ivașcu was being prepared as a false witness in a show trial of the former Social Democrats, including those who had aligned themselves with the PCdR. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej [...] "gave up on this plan. He discovered that it made more sense to appoint [...] as high dignitaries." [...] For a while, Ivașcu was held together with Adrian Marino, a fellow literary man and Călinescu disciple, within a cell that also housed Bessarabian inmates and militants of the Iron Guard. When Ivașcu began learning Russian with the Bessarabians, the Guardists were infuriated, and he very narrowly escaped a pummeling. Archival research carried out in 2006 indicates that Ivașcu turned informant for the Securitate, spying on his cell mates at Constanța, Jilava, and eventually Aiud.|$|E
2500|$|Lastly, {{a person}} can choose to embrace their own absurd condition. According to Camus, one's freedom– and the {{opportunity}} to give life meaning– lies in the recognition of absurdity. If the absurd experience is truly the realization that the universe is fundamentally devoid of absolutes, then we as individuals are truly free. [...] "To live without appeal," [...] <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> is a philosophical move to define absolutes and universals subjectively, rather than objectively. The freedom of humans is thus established in a human's natural ability and opportunity to create their own meaning and purpose; to decide (or think) for him- or herself. The individual becomes the most precious unit of existence, representing a set of unique ideals that can be characterized as an entire universe in its own right. In acknowledging the absurdity of seeking any inherent meaning, but continuing this search regardless, one can be happy, gradually developing meaning from the search alone.|$|E
