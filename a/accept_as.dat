5|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} radical in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in his resolve to achieve re-nomination, {{as he was}} convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt, one of the last links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking, a death Taft found hard to <b>accept</b> <b>as</b> his body was not recovered.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus re-instated Timothy Aelurus and Peter the Fuller {{to their}} sees, and by persuasion {{of the former}} issued (9 April 475) a {{circular}} letter (Enkyklikon) to the bishops calling them to <b>accept</b> <b>as</b> valid only the first three ecumenical synods, and reject the Council of Chalcedon. All bishops were to sign the edict. While most of the Eastern bishops accepted the letter, Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople refused, {{with the support of}} the population of the city, clearly showing his disdain towards Basiliscus by draping the icons in Hagia Sophia in black.|$|E
5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars {{have come to}} accept the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not <b>accept</b> <b>as</b> genuine was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed {{could not have been}} written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E

5|$|There were {{continuing}} {{disputes with}} the Americans over deep-sea fishing rights, and in early 1871, an Anglo-American commission {{was appointed to}} settle outstanding matters between the British (and Canadians) and the Americans. Canada was hoping to secure compensation for damage done by Fenians raiding Canada from bases in the United States. Macdonald was appointed a British commissioner, a post {{he was reluctant to}} <b>accept</b> <b>as</b> he realised Canadian interests might be sacrificed for the mother country. This proved to be the case; Canada received no compensation for the raids and no significant trade advantages in the settlement, which required Canada to open her waters to American fishermen. Macdonald returned home to defend the Treaty of Washington against a political firestorm.|$|E
5|$|This {{formulation}} {{requires that}} actions {{be considered as}} if their maxim {{is to provide a}} law for a hypothetical Kingdom of Ends. Accordingly, people have an obligation to act upon principles that a community of rational agents would <b>accept</b> <b>as</b> laws. In such a community, each individual would only accept maxims that can govern every member of the community without treating any member merely as a means to an end. Although the Kingdom of Ends is an ideal—the actions of other people and events of nature ensure that actions with good intentions sometimes result in harm—we are still required to act categorically, as legislators of this ideal kingdom.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Bersama, Maia and Mambo began {{to work on a}} second album, {{scheduled}} for a 2004 release. However, on 14 October 2004 Mambo announced she was leaving the group amidst widespread media coverage of her being pregnant outside of wedlock. Reports indicated that she may have left the group because of Maia's more dominant personality and conflicts between the two. Maia, left as {{the only member of the}} band, insisted that it was not dissolving, and would soon hold auditions for a new vocalist. As a temporary measure, several singers were contracted to perform with Maia, although not signed as members. Tia, a finalist in Akademi Fantasi Indosiar (AFI), came under consideration for the position, but was unable to <b>accept</b> <b>as</b> she was still contracted to AFI.|$|E

5|$|In August 1994, Parliament {{intended}} to amend Article 22H {{to restrict the}} President's powers thereunder to only non-constitutional bills which provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the President's discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. Because Article 5(2A) was not in force, a question arose {{as to whether the}} President had the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H. President Ong Teng Cheong stated that in the interest of testing out the system, he wished to have this question referred to the courts for a ruling, and that he would <b>accept</b> <b>as</b> correct whatever interpretation of Article 22H was given by the court. In response to his request, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution by Parliament for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|With {{the opening}} of the Platine rivers, Paraguay now found it {{possible}} to contract with European technicians and Brazilian specialists to aid in its development. Unhindered access to the outside world also enabled it to import more advanced military technology. During the greater part of the 1850s, the dictator Carlos López harassed Brazilian vessels attempting to freely navigate the Paraguay River. López feared that the province of Mato Grosso might become a base from which an invasion from Brazil could be launched. This dispute was also leverage with the Imperial government for acceptance of his territorial demands in the region. The nation also experienced difficulties in delimiting its borders with Argentina which wanted the whole Gran Chaco region: a demand which Paraguay could not <b>accept,</b> <b>as</b> this would entail surrendering more than half of its national territory.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 Lovitt was {{succeeded by}} Dr. Perry Nussbaum. Born in Toronto in 1908 and raised there, Nussbaum had {{attended}} a small Orthodox synagogue as a boy, and, after high school, worked as {{secretary for the}} Holy Blossom Temple's rabbi Barnett R. Brickner. With encouragement from Brickner, in 1926 he applied and was accepted into a combined eight-year rabbinic ordination and degree program at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati and University of Cincinnati. He graduated in 1933, Hebrew Union College's first Canadian graduate. He was the last member of his class to receive an offer of a position, {{so he had to}} <b>accept</b> <b>as</b> his first rabbinic posting a role at a Reform synagogue in Melbourne. This did not work out, as he was too inexperienced. Nussbaum subsequently served at a synagogue in Amarillo, Texas, and in 1937 accepted a position as a prison chaplain in Pueblo, Colorado, where he also worked as a part-time librarian at the local university, and taught public speaking. In 1941 he became rabbi of Temple Emanu-El in Wichita, Kansas, and in 1943 he joined the Chaplain Corps of the United States Army. He served in the Philippines, and eventually became a colonel in the United States Army Reserve.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{differences}} between streams on what constitutes an intermarriage, arising from their differing criteria for being Jewish {{in the first}} place.

25|$|Orthodox {{authorities}} {{require that}} conversions {{be performed in}} accord with traditional Jewish law and recognise only those conversions in which a convert accepts and undertakes to observe Jewish law as interpreted by Orthodox rabbis.

25|$|Adherents rely on pre-Christian, folkloric and ethnographic {{sources to}} a variety of degrees; many follow a spirituality which they <b>accept</b> <b>as</b> being entirely modern, while others attempt to {{reconstruct}} or revive indigenous, ethnic religions as found in historical and folkloric sources as accurately as possible. Academic research has placed the Pagan movement along a spectrum, with Eclecticism on one end and Polytheistic Reconstructionism on the other. Polytheism, animism and pantheism are common features in Pagan theology. Rituals take place in both public and in private domestic settings.|$|E
