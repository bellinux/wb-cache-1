500|$|Homer takes Maggie to a daycare and {{encourages}} her {{to enjoy a}} mural featuring Krusty the Clown {{to make her feel}} better while she is away from her parents. However, Krusty arrives to have the images of his face sandblasted from the mural, as his likeness is trademarked and used without his permission. This left Maggie upset and an outraged Homer shoves Krusty in retaliation, sending him flying into a wood chipper and shredded alive. Homer is later approached by two <b>advertising</b> <b>agents</b> who have heard of his deed and explain their plan to use celebrities' likenesses in advertising without issues over permission by simply killing the celebrities who refuse to lend their names to advertising. Homer is then hired as a celebrity assassin, taking out such famous faces as actor George Clooney, singer Prince, and astronaut Neil Armstrong. In Heaven, the dead celebrities are outraged by this and stage an attack on the living, with Homer as their main target. [...] Krusty's angel kills Homer, who gets revenge by locking [...] all the celebrities out of Heaven, leaving only himself and the apparently gay [...] Abraham Lincoln.|$|E

60|$|It may be {{presumed that}} Mr. Brown did not exactly follow the quotation, but the eloquence of Robinson had its desired effect. Mr. Brown did at last produce a sum of five hundred pounds, with which printers, stationers, and <b>advertising</b> <b>agents</b> were paid or {{partially}} paid, and Robinson again went to work.|$|E
60|$|At {{that time}} Brisket, on two {{successive}} days, was closeted with his proposed father-in-law, {{and it was}} evident to Robinson that after each of these interviews Mr. Brown was left in an unhappy frame of mind. At this time {{the affairs of the}} shop were not absolutely ruinous,--or would not have been so had there been a proper watch kept on the cash taken over the counter. The heaviest amounts due were to the stationer, printer, and <b>advertising</b> <b>agents.</b> This was wrong, for such people of course press for their money; and whatever hitch or stoppage there may be in trade, there should, at any rate, be no hitch or stoppage in the capability for advertising. For the goods disposed of by the house payments had been made, if not with absolute punctuality on every side, at any rate so fairly that some supply was always forthcoming. The account at the bank had always been low; and, though a few small bills had been discounted, nothing like a mercantile system of credit had been established. All this was wrong, and had already betrayed the fact that Brown, Jones, and Robinson were little people, trading in a little way. It is useless to conceal the fact now, and these memoirs would fail to render to commerce that service which is expected from them, were the truth on this matter kept back from the public. Brown, Jones, and Robinson had not soared upwards into the empyrean vault of commercial greatness on eagle's wings. There are bodies so ponderous in their nature, that for them no eagle's wings can be found. The firm had commenced their pecuniary transactions on a footing altogether weak and unsubstantial. They had shown their own timidity, and had confessed, by the nature of their fiscal transactions, that they knew themselves to be small. To their <b>advertising</b> <b>agents</b> they should never have been behindhand in their payments for one day; but they should have been bold in demanding credit from their bank, and should have given their orders to the wholesale houses without any of that hesitation or reserve which so clearly indicates feebleness of purpose.|$|E

6000|$|Wall Street was dead. There {{was no more}} {{buying and}} selling and speculating. Nobody had {{anything}} to buy or sell. There was nothing in which to speculate. [...] "Put the stock gamblers to work," [...] said Goliah; [...] "give those that are young, and that so desire, {{a chance to learn}} useful trades." [...] "Put the drummers, and salesmen, and <b>advertising</b> <b>agents,</b> and real estate agents to work," [...] said Goliah; and by hundreds of thousands the erstwhile useless middlemen and parasites went into useful occupations. The four hundred thousand idle gentlemen of the country who had lived upon incomes were likewise put to work. Then {{there were a lot of}} helpless men in high places who were cleared out, the remarkable thing about this being that they were cleared out by their own fellows. Of this class were the professional politicians, whose wisdom and power consisted of manipulating machine politics and of grafting. There was no longer any graft. Since there were no private interests to purchase special privileges, no bribes were offered to legislators, and legislators for the first time legislated for the people. The result was that men who were efficient, not in corruption, but in direction, found their way into the legislatures.|$|E
