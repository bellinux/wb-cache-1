25|$|Work by Helen Leach {{shows that}} Māori were using about 36 {{different}} food plants, although many required detoxification and long periods (12–24 hours) of cooking. D. Sutton's research on early Māori fertility found that first pregnancy occurred at about 20 {{years and the}} mean number of births was low, compared with other neolithic societies. The low number of births may have been due to the very low average life expectancy of 31–32 years. Analysis of skeletons at Wairau Bar showed signs of <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>life,</b> with many having had broken bones that had healed. This suggests that the people ate a balanced diet and enjoyed a supportive community that had the resources to support severely injured family members.|$|E

"Consider the lyrics: Prayed {{through the}} nights / Felt so alone / Suffered from {{alienation}} / Carried the weight {{on my own}} / Had to be strong / So I believed / And now I know I've succeeded / In finding the place I conceived. Well, just because you are young doesn't mean that you haven't had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>life.</b> It's been difficult for me, moving around so much, having to grow up by myself, basically on my own, my parents divorced. And I always felt kind of different from everyone else in my neighborhoods. I was a different person – ethnically. And sometimes {{that can be a}} problem. If you look a certain way everybody goes, 'White girl,' and I'd go, 'No, that's not what I am.'" ...|$|E

He and Carl Perkins became friends. Perkins said that [...] "I knew when I first heard Chuck that he'd been {{affected}} by country music. I respected his writing; his records were very, very great." [...] As they toured, Perkins discovered that Berry not only liked country music but also knew about as many songs as he did. Jimmie Rodgers was one of his favorites. [...] "Chuck knew every Blue Yodel and most of Bill Monroe's songs as well", Perkins remembered. [...] "He told me about how he was raised very poor, very tough. He had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>life.</b> He was a good guy. I really liked him." ...|$|E

500|$|Scientology {{spokeswoman}} Pat Harney called Lonsdale's apparent suicide [...] "awful" [...] {{and stated}} [...] "It's just unfortunate anybody feels {{they have to}} go to that length ... I wouldn't wish that on anybody." [...] Jerald Rowlett, a fellow Scientology critic and friend from Michigan, told The Tampa Tribune: [...] "In many ways Shawn was a hero to me ... He had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>life</b> and a history he knew Scientology would use to hurt him. And yet he still felt strongly enough to try to inform the public about the actions of Scientology." [...] On March 1, 2008, John Sweeney remembered Lonsdale and spoke about him on the BBC Radio 4 program, From Our Own Correspondent. Sweeney stated: [...] "Clearwater got that little bit more creepy recently, with the death - the police are treating it as suicide - of Shawn. When alive a Scientology spokesman said of him: 'He has no redeeming value to anyone, anywhere.' Well, he {{was a bit of a}} hero to me ... I for one mourn the loss - of a brave and singular American".|$|E
500|$|In May 1828, Taylor {{was called}} back to action, {{commanding}} Fort Snelling in Michigan Territory (now Minnesota) on the northern Mississippi River for a year, and nearby Fort Crawford for a year. After some time on furlough, when he expanded his landholdings, Taylor was promoted to colonel of the 1st Infantry Regiment in April 1832. At that time, the Black Hawk War was beginning in the West. Taylor campaigned under General Henry Atkinson to pursue and later defend against Chief Black Hawk's forces throughout the summer. The {{end of the war}} in August 1832 signaled the end of Indian resistance to U.S. expansion in the area, and the following years were relatively quiet. During this period Taylor resisted the courtship of his 17-year-old daughter Sarah Knox Taylor and Lieutenant Jefferson Davis, the future President of the Confederate States of America. [...] He respected Davis but did not approve of his daughter becoming a military wife, as he knew it was <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>life</b> for families. Davis and Sarah Taylor married in June 1835, but she died three months later of malaria contracted on a summer visit to Davis' sister in St. Francisville, Louisiana.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{versions}} of the same pilot episode titled [...] "Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye" [...] are in the archives with two different actors, Rye Billsbury and Howard Culver, playing Marshal [...] "Mark" [...] Dillon as the lead, not yet played by Conrad. Conrad {{was one of the last}} actors to audition for the role of Marshal Dillon. With a resonantly powerful and distinctive voice, Conrad was already one of radio's busiest actors. Though Meston championed him, Macdonnell thought Conrad might be overexposed. During his audition, however, Conrad won over Macdonnell after reading only a few lines. Dillon as portrayed by Conrad was a lonely, isolated man, toughened by <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>life.</b> Macdonnell later claimed, [...] "Much of Matt Dillon's character grew out of Bill Conrad." ...|$|E
2500|$|Those who {{recognised}} {{themselves in}} Jacques Anquetil liked his priority {{of style and}} elegance {{in the way he}} rode. Behind this fluidity and the appearance of ease was the image of France winning and those who took risks identified with him. Humble people saw themselves in Raymond Poulidor, whose face – lined with effort – represented the life they led on land they worked without rest or respite. His declarations, full of good sense, delighted the crowds: a race, even a difficult one, lasts less time than a day bringing in the harvest. A big part of the public therefore finished by identifying with the one who symbolised bad luck and the eternal position of runner-up, an image that was far from true for Poulidor, whose record was particularly rich. Even today, the expression of the eternal second and of a Poulidor Complex is associated with <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>life,</b> as an article by Jacques Marseille showed in Le Figaro when it was headlined [...] "This country is suffering from a Poulidor Complex".|$|E

2500|$|His {{withdrawal}} {{may have}} been at his father's behest. [...] While César-Auguste was pursuing his academic studies, he was, at his father's demand, also teaching privately and giving concerts. [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>life</b> for him, [...] [...] [...] and not made easier by the ill-tempered and even vindictive behavior of his father [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Concerts performed by young Franck (some with his brother on the violin, some including Franck's own compositions) were at first received well, but increasingly Nicolas-Joseph's commercial promotion of his sons antagonized the Parisian musical journals and critics. [...] César-Auguste's technical abilities as a pianist were acknowledged; his abilities as a composer were (probably justly at this point) felt to be wanting. [...] The whole situation was aggravated by what in the end became a feud between Nicolas-Joseph and Henri Blanchard, the principal critic of the Revue et Gazette musicale, who lost no opportunity to castigate the aggressive pretensions {{of the father and}} to mock the [...] "imperial" [...] names of the elder son. [...] This animosity, [...] "undoubtedly personal", may well have caused Nicolas-Joseph to decide that a return to Belgium was in order, and [...] in 1842 [...] "a peremptory order" [...] to young Franck compelled the latter to leave the Conservatoire and accompany him.|$|E
