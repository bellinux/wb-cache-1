During the bud break {{period of a}} grapevine's annual cycle, the Chablis region is vulnerable to springtime frost, from March to early May, which can compromise the crop yield.

2500|$|Working {{with limited}} {{aid of the}} U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Peruvian Government carries out {{alternative}} development programs in the leading coca-growing areas {{in an effort to}} convince coca farmers not to grow that crop. Although the government previously eradicated only coca seed beds, in 1998 and 1999 it began to eradicate mature coca being grown in national parks and elsewhere in the main coca growing valleys. In 1999 the government eradicated more than 150km² of coca; this figure declined to 65km² in 2000, due largely to political instability. The government agency [...] "Contradrogas", founded in 1996, facilitates coordination among Peruvian Government agencies working on counter-narcotics issues. [...] <b>Alternative</b> <b>crops,</b> however, are not economically comparable to coca.

2500|$|In {{recent years}} farmers have been {{producing}} <b>alternative</b> <b>crops</b> which are economically viable, and amongst these are organic farm crops. [...] Hemp and wool from sheep {{are the main}} areas of fibre production of Canada. [...] Wool production was on average 16,022,000pounds (7,267t) in the 1930s and 9,835,000 pounds (4,461t) in 1949. Fibre flax from flaxseed has been exported to the United Kingdom. Crop growers may supplement their income with beeswax and honey and learn beekeeping. Enterprising land owners have had success growing as well as packaging and marketing the sunflower seed. Crops are not only for human consumption but also for animal consumption, which opens a new market such as canary seed. Cuniculture, or rabbit farming, is another livestock enterprise. Cannabis is an important crop in some areas, making up 5% of British Columbia's GDP. According to BC Business Magazine, the crop is worth $7.5 billion to the province annually, and gives employment to 250,000 people.|$|E

Illinois ranks second in U.S. corn production with more than 1.5billion bushels produced annually.

40|$|Intensive field {{vegetable}} {{production is}} an important economic sector in Flanders. Several vegetable crops are harvested in a vegetative stage when high daily N uptake rates are achieved leaving behind soils with considerable N content. Vegetable crop residues take a particular position relative to arable crops due to often large amounts of biomass with a high N content left behind on the field. Vegetable crop residues {{have been found to}} mineralize rapidly even at low soil temperatures. These factors cause intensive vegetable rotations to be prone to nitrate leaching during winter. In order to obtain water quality objectives set by the nitrate directive three field experiments are set up to evaluate the potential of <b>alternative</b> <b>crop</b> rotations to reduce nitrate leaching during winter. The first <b>alternative</b> <b>crop</b> rotation examines the inclusion of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) in cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) rotations.
