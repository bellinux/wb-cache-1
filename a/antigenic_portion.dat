40|$|Basement {{membrane}} antigen was localized in murine parietal {{yolk sac}} cells using the peroxidase-labeled antibody technic. In these cells the antigen can be localized {{in the rough}} endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear space. In spite of the proven ability of the antibody to permeate all cell compartments, the antigen was never localized within elements of the Golgi complex. These {{findings suggest that the}} rough endoplasmic reticulum of the parietal yolk sac cells is responsible for the synthesis of the <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> of the basement membrane molecule. At the present time there is no evidence implicating the Golgi complex in the synthesis or intracellular transport of the <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> of basement membrane...|$|E
40|$|The {{monoclonal}} paraprotein from {{a typical}} case of scleromyxedema was isolated and characterized. The isolated paraprotein {{was of the}} IgG-lambda class, with a molecular weight of approximately 110, 000 daltons compared with 160, 000 daltons for normal IgG. Immunochemical studies indicated that the paraprotein was an incomplete IgG molecule which was missing a significant <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> of the Fd fragment.

40|$|During infection, the {{intestinal}} protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia undergoes continuous antigenic variation which {{is determined by}} diversification of the parasite's major surface antigen, named VSP (variant surface protein). One member from this protein family, VSP H 7, is expressed by G. lamblia clone GS/M- 83 -H 7. In the present study, we characterised a highly <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> of VSP H 7 which is positioned inside a 130 amino acid C-terminal region of the protein. This region overlaps with a cysteine-rich motif that is rather conserved within the VSP family. Detailed molecular dissection of the <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> monitored a 12 amino acid peptidyl structure which constitutes a non-conformational epitope of VSP H 7. In the murine host, this epitope is recognised relatively early (before day 10 p. i.) during infection and stimulates a strong intestinal immunoglobulin A response. At late infective stages (after day 10 p. i.) this immune reaction is progressively complemented by reactions against 'late' antigenic epitopes which are also located inside the 130 amino acid <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> but in closer proximity to the C-terminal end of VSP H 7 than the 12 amino acid epitope. Both the high antigenicity and the conserved character suggest that the 12 amino acid epitope is a key factor within the immunological interplay between G. lamblia and the experimental murine host...|$|E
40|$|Humans and {{experimental}} animals infected with tubercle bacilli may have detectable circulating antibody {{to a number}} of bacterial antigens as well as delayed skin sensitivity to tuberculin (1). Their significance during disease or their possible role in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, however, is not clearly understood. Two factors in particular have prevented this understanding: (a) relatively few of the chemical constituents of the tubercle bacillus which are responsible for the induction of circulating antibodies in infected individuals have been characterized with certainty, and (b) a sensitive, primary binding type of test procedure to detect and quantitate small amounts of antibody to <b>antigenic</b> <b>portions</b> of the tubercle bacillus has not been developed. A variety of serological methods have been applied to demonstrate the presence of antibodies in anlmals and humans infected with the tubercle bacillus. These include complement fixation, agar diffusion, hemagglutination, the Coombs indirect agglutination methods, and immunoelectrophoresis (2). None of these tests has been completely successful, and all have limitations i...|$|R
40|$|From {{the cell}} {{envelope}} preparation of Sphingomonas paucimobilis two membrane fractions with different densities {{were separated by}} sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The high-density fraction contained several major proteins, phospholipids, and glycosphingolipids, which are the only glycolipids of this lipopolysaccharide-lacking gram-negative bacterium. The low-density fraction showed many minor bands of proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and NADH oxidase activity was localized in this fraction. Combined with morphological data of vesicles formed by these membrane fractions, the high-density and low-density fractions were proposed to be an outer membrane and a cytoplasmic membrane, respectively. The localization of the glycosphingolipid was investigated also by means of immunoelectron microscopic analysis using a glycosphingolipid-specific antibody. The glycosphingolipid was shown to localize at the cell envelope, and the <b>antigenic</b> sugar <b>portion</b> was exposed to the bacterial cell surface. From these results the glycosphingolipid was assumed to have a function {{similar to that of}} the lipopolysaccharide of other gram-negative bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Purified H- 2 b and H- 2 a {{molecules}} {{were bound}} to egg lecithin liposomes by a detergent dialysis procedure. Analysis of the liposomes indicated that only 30 - 50 % of bound H- 2 b is oriented with the hydrophilic, <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> of the molecule toward {{the outside of the}} liposome. Saturation of the liposomes occurred at a ratio of 64 molecules of egg lecithin per molecule of H- 2 b. Liposomes containing H- 2 molecules were capable of stimulating spleen cells from primed donors to produce specific, alloreactive, cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro. Stimulation was dependent on adherent cells present in the responder spleen cells. Optimal stimulation occurred with highly saturated liposomes and at a ratio of 4 - 8 micrograms of H- 2 b per 8 X 10 (6) responder cells...|$|E
40|$|The 60, 000 -molecular-weight cysteine-rich outer {{membrane}} protein (OMP 2) from Chlamydia trachomatis {{participates in the}} disulfide-mediated outer-membrane organization unique to this organism. In addition, this protein is a primary focus of the host immune response. We cloned and sequenced the gene for OMP 2 from C. trachomatis serovar L 2. A lambda gt 11 recombinant that expressed an <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> of this protein was selected by antibody screening and provided a probe for the selection in lambda 1059 of a clone containing the entire gene. DNA sequencing of this clone identified one open reading frame of 1, 641 base pairs, starting with a methionine codon and coding for a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 58, 792. Amino-terminal protein sequencing {{and analysis of the}} translated DNA sequence demonstrated that processing at alternate signal peptide cleavage sites accounts for the molecular-weight polymorphism of this protein. The mature proteins had a net positive charge and contained 24 cysteine residues...|$|E
40|$|A {{construct}} containing approximately 2500 base pairs (bp) of 5 ' upstream {{and approximately}} 700 bp of 3 ' downstream sequence {{was used to}} drive the expression of an intronless human K 14 gene in vitro and in vivo. To track {{the expression of the}} gene, a small sequence encoding the <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> of neuropeptide substance P was inserted in frame 5 ' to the TGA translation stop codon of the gene. Surprisingly, this gene was expressed promiscuously {{in a wide variety of}} cultured cells transiently transfected with the construct. In contrast, when introduced into the germ line of transgenic mice, the construct was expressed in a fashion analogous to the endogenous K 14 gene [...] namely, in the basal layer of stratified squamous epithelia. Our results suggest that some regulatory mechanism is overridden as a consequence of transient transfection but that sequences that can control proper K 14 expression are present in the construct. The appropriate tissue-specific and differentiation-specific expression of K 14. P in transgenic mice is an important first step in characterizing a promoter that could be employed to drive the foreign expression of drug-related genes in the epidermis of skin grafts...|$|E
40|$|Background: Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) {{exhibits}} {{a high degree}} of clinically relevant phenotypic diversity. Strains vary widely in terms of antibiotic resistance (AbR), clinical severity, and transmission rate. Currently, strain identification is achieved by emm typing (direct sequencing of the genomic segment coding for the <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> of the M protein) or by multilocus genotyping methods. Phenotype analysis, including critical AbR typing, is generally achieved by much slower and more laborious direct culture-based methods. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compare genotype identification (by emm typing and PCR/ESI-MS) with directly measured phenotypes (AbR and outbreak associations) for 802 clinical isolates of GAS collected from symptomatic patients over a period of 6 years at 10 military facilities in the United States. All independent strain characterization methods are highly correlated. This shows that recombination, horizontal transfer, and other forms of reassortment are rare in GAS insofar as housekeeping genes, primary virulence and antibiotic resistance determinants, and the emm gene are concerned. Therefore, genotyping methods offer an efficient way to predict emm type and the associated AbR and virulence phenotypes. Conclusions/Significance: The data presented here, combined with much historical data, suggest that emm typing assays and faster molecular methods that infer emm type from genomic signatures could be used to efficiently infer critica...|$|E
40|$|The immunizing {{capacity}} of various plague antigenic preparations for mice, monkeys, and man depends {{to a large}} extent on their Fraction I content (Baker et al., 1952; Chen et al., 1952). Fraction I is the designation given to that water-soluble <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> of the plague bacillus that is soluble at 25 per cent saturated ammonium sulfate and precipitated at 33 per cent saturation. It appears to consist of two immunologically identical, but chemically different, fractions, IA and IB. Fraction IA is a protein-carbohydrate complex; Fraction IB is entirely protein (Baker et al., 1952). Since the present preparations for immunizing man against plague were found to be low in Fraction I and since present methods of preparing Fraction I are complicated and costly, involving growth of a virulent strain of Pasteurella pesti 8 on a complex protein agar medium and subse-quent extraction and fractionation (Baker et al., 1947, 1952), simplified methods of growing P. pesti 8 and of producing a preparation of high Fraction I content were sought. Evidence also to be presented indicates that Fraction I is the envelope substance of P. pestia described by Rowland (1914) and SchQtze (1932 a). Since this is in disagreement with the findings of Amies (1951) to the effect that the one important antigen of Pasteurella pestis is a capsular substance which requires vigorous physical or chemical procedures to remove it from the cells, several pertinent experiments of his were repeated...|$|E
40|$|Fc-fusion technologies, {{in which}} {{immunoglobulin}} Fc is genetically fused to an antigenic protein, {{have been developed}} to confer antibody-like properties to proteins and peptides. Mammalian IgG Fc fusion exhibits improved antigen-induced immune responses by providing aggregates with high avidity for the IgG Fc receptor and salvaging the <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> from endosomal degradation. However, whether the linked chicken IgY Fc fragment shares similar characteristics to mammalian IgG Fc remains unclear. In this study, we linked the chicken IgY Fc gene to the outer membrane protein A (ompA) of Borderella avium through overlapping PCR. The fusion gene was cloned into the pPIC 9 plasmid to construct the recombinant Pichia pastoris transformant expressing the ompA–Fc fusion protein. The effects of the linked Fc on macrophage vitality, activity, efficiency of antigen processing, and immune responses induced by the fused ompA were investigated. Furthermore, the effect of Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide (TPPPS), an immunomodulator, on chicken macrophage activation was evaluated. TPPPS was also used as an adjuvant to investigate its immunomodulatory effect on immunoresponses induced by the fused ompA–Fc in chickens. The pinocytosis, phagocytosis, secretion of nitric oxide and TNF-α, and MHC-II molecular expression of the macrophages treated with the fused ompA–Fc were significantly higher than those of the macrophages treated with ompA alone. The addition of TPPPS to the fused ompA–Fc further enhanced macrophage functions. The fused ompA–Fc elicited higher antigen-specific immune responses and protective efficacy compared with ompA alone. Moreover, the fused ompA–Fc conferred higher serum antibody titers, serum IL- 2 and IL- 4 concentrations, CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte transformation rate, and protection rate compared with ompA alone. Notably, the prepared TPPPS adjuvant ompA–Fc vaccines induced high immune responses and protection rate. The linked Fc and TPPPS adjuvant can remarkably enhance macrophage functions and specific immune responses. This study provides new perspectives to improve the immune effects of subunit vaccines for prevention of poultry diseases...|$|E
40|$|A {{recombinant}} DNA {{vaccine to}} IHNV was prepared and tested in field trials at Clear Springs Trout Company's Box Canyon Hatchery in Buhl, Idaho {{this year in}} Phase III of the project. The vaccine under consideration in these field trials consisted of lysed bacteria that contained a plasmid which expressed an <b>antigenic</b> <b>portion</b> of the IHNV glycoprotein. In addition, laboratory trials with a bacterial expressed viral nucleoprotein indicated that this served as an immune adjuvant. Therefore, {{a decision was made}} to conduct these field trials on a vaccine containing both IHNV glycoprotein and IHNV nucleoprotein. Original plans to conduct the field trial at Dworshak National Fish Hatchery were canceled because a management decision was made by Dworshak Fish and Wildlife personnel to rear steelhead salmon eggs from IHNV positive parents at Kooskia National Fish Hatchery. This decision, which was made without prior notification to us, resulted in some discussion at the IHNV committee meeting convened by the Fish and Wildlife Service in Moscow, Idaho on April 27, 1989. At that time, the authors dismay at this decision was voiced and the prediction that an outbreak of IHNV would occur at Kooskia was made. In less than a week, a massive IHNV outbreak did occur at Kooskia and plans to run a field trial at this facility had to be discarded. An alternative site was found at the Box Canyon Hatchery site of Clear Springs Trout Company. Dr. Robert Busch, Director of Research and Development for Clear Springs Trout Company, offered the use of the site. In preparation for the site change they consulted Mary Buckman, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife statistician, and they obtained a sample of the IHN virus present at Box Canyon. The Box Canyon virus isolate was typed by reactivity with monoclonal antibodies by Dr. Sandra Ristow at Washington State University. There was insufficient time to examine the vaccine efficacy with the Box Canyon virus isolate in laboratory trials and they had to prepare for field trials without this supporting data. In addition, they had to make numerous changes in the vaccination schedule and {{in the design of the}} challenge to accommodate the new site. Most importantly, an application for a change in site had to be approved by the Idaho State Veterinarian and the Veterinary Biologics Group at the USDA National Office in Hyattsville, Maryland. A new work plan was formulated, approvals were obtained, the demands for statistical analyses were satisfied in the new work plan, and 20, 000 rainbow trout fry were vaccinated on July 19, 1989. The following is a summary of the results of the work that was initiated at Box Canyon Hatchery...|$|E
