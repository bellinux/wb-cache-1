40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence {{continues}} to accumulate that oxidative stress is etiologically {{important in the}} pathogenesis of age-related maculopathy (ARM) and that appropriate antioxidants of dietary origin may protect against this condition. OBJECTIVE: Risk factors for ARM may be classed as established or putative. We report a study designed to investigate whether such risk factors are associated with <b>a</b> dietary <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> antioxidants relevant to retinal health. DESIGN: Dietary, anthropometric, and sociodemographic details relating to 828 healthy Irish subjects aged 20 - 60 y were recorded in a cross-sectional fashion and analyzed for associations between risk factors for ARM and dietary intake of relevant nutrients. RESULTS: Of the established risk factors for ARM, increasing age was associated with <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> dietary zeaxanthin (P < 0. 05) and tobacco use with <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> dietary vitamin C (P < 0. 05). Of the putative risk factors for ARM, alcohol consumption was associated with <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> dietary alpha-linoleic acid (P < 0. 05), and female sex was associated with <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> dietary zinc (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: We showed that several variables related to risk for ARM are associated with <b>a</b> relative dietary <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> key nutrients. Our finding that age, {{the most important and}} universal risk factor for ARM, is associated with <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> dietary zeaxanthin, is an important finding that warrants further investigation...|$|R

The immediate problem after VJ Day was <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to {{the southern end of}} the peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.|$|E
