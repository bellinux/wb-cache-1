5|$|The bassoon sustains its B {{from the}} final chord of the first {{movement}} before moving up a semitone to middle C. This serves as a key change from the E minor opening movement into the lyrical C major slow movement. The movement is in ternary form and is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's own Songs Without Words. The theme to the darker, middle section in A minor is first introduced by the orchestra before the violin then takes up both the melody and the accompaniment simultaneously. The tremulous accompaniment requires nimble dexterity from the soloist before the music returns to the main lyrical C major theme, this time leading towards <b>a</b> <b>serene</b> conclusion.|$|E
5|$|II. Andantino in F-sharp minor, A–B–A form. The A section {{presents}} a sparse, lamenting, poignant melody, full of sighing gestures (portrayed by descending seconds). This theme, despite its vastly different character, references the opening {{bars of the}} Allegro, an aforementioned source {{of much of the}} sonata's material – the Andantino's first measure shares with the fanfare a second-beat bass note 'echo' after the downbeat on A, creating an audible rhythmic affinity; additionally, the quiet close of the A theme features the fanfare's characteristic pattern of stepwise thirds in the middle voices enclosed between tonic octaves. The middle section is of an improvisatory, fantasia-like character, with extremely harsh modulations and sonorities, culminating in C-sharp minor with fortissimo chords. The chromaticism, triplet emphasis, and modulatory patterns of this section are all reminiscent of the developments nested within the Allegro's exposition. After the C-sharp minor climax (according to Fisk, a key of great importance in the cycle due to its relation to Der Wanderer), a recitative section with startling sforzando outbursts emphasizing an ascending minor second leads to <b>a</b> <b>serene</b> phrase in the major mode (C-sharp major), which in turn leads (as the dominant of F-sharp minor) back to the A section, here somewhat transformed, with new accompanimental figuration. The final bars of the movement feature rolled chords that prefigure the opening of the following Scherzo.|$|E

A disembodied entity named Elohim instructs the android {{to explore the}} worlds he has created for it, and to solve the various puzzles to collect sigils, but warns it not to climb a tower at the centre of these worlds.

Some AIs it encounters act as Messengers, unquestioningly serving Elohim and guiding the android through the puzzles. Messages left by other AIs present varying views of the artificial worlds and of Elohim, with some stating that Elohim's words should be doubted, while the Milton Library Interface, a text conversation program found on various computer terminals, encourages the android to defy Elohim's commands.|$|E

25|$|Reed Hall was {{the main}} {{building}} at Dixmont and was named after the first superintendent of Dixmont, Dr. Joseph A. Reed. It was typical of other Kirkbride facilities with the exception that the outermost wings swept forward instead of to the rear in the typical V-shape. This was to afford {{a better view of}} the river valley and better airflow, which was said to be more calming to the patients in keeping with the want of <b>a</b> <b>serene</b> setting. Early on, It had gas lighting, a central hot air system for heat, and more than ample supply of water from the Ohio River. Construction of the west wing was not complete until 1868, at which time construction of the east wing began. The center section of the building contained the front lobby, administrative offices, and chapel. This was mostly destroyed by fire in 1995.|$|E
500|$|Early Argentine historians {{described}} Mariano Moreno as {{the leader}} of the Revolution and a great historical man. Later liberal historians would embellish this portrayal even more. An example of this tendency is La Revolución de Mayo y Mariano Moreno by Ricardo Levene. Biographers would describe him as <b>a</b> <b>serene</b> statesman, a notable economist, a decided democrat, and a great leader. For those historians, Moreno would have been an anglophile, and [...] "The Representation of the Hacendados", the government platform of the May Revolution.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick scholar Michel Ciment, {{discussing}} Kubrick's {{attitude toward}} human aggression and instinct, observes: [...] "The bone cast {{into the air}} by the ape (now become a man) is transformed {{at the other extreme}} of civilization, by one of those abrupt ellipses characteristic of the director, into a spacecraft {{on its way to the}} moon." [...] In contrast to Ciment's reading of a cut to <b>a</b> <b>serene</b> [...] "other extreme of civilization", science fiction novelist Robert Sawyer, speaking in the Canadian documentary 2001 and Beyond, saw it as a cut from a bone to a nuclear weapons platform, explaining that [...] "what we see is not how far we've leaped ahead, what we see is that today, '2001', and four million years ago on the African veldt, it's exactly the same—the power of mankind is the power of its weapons. It's a continuation, not a discontinuity in that jump." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Safdie, the {{building}} [...] "is by definition the physical symbol {{of peace in}} the capital's skyline" [...] and needed to convey the spirit of peace. [...] Safdie stated: [...] "I'm not one who believes in overt symbolism, but my sense of a building dedicated to peace {{was a sense of}} the lightness of being,...It should be <b>a</b> <b>serene</b> building. It should not be an aggressive building. It should be full of light." [...] Safdie achieved this by designing a glass curtain wall facing the Lincoln Memorial and a billowing glass ceiling. [...] The ceiling is one of {{the building}} elements in common with Safdie's design for the Yitzhak Rabin Center in Israel. [...] The [...] thick roof is made of 1,482 white glass panels and supported by steel frames while the interior of the roof is covered by a translucent plastic film.

500|$|The {{canonical}} {{image of}} Mariano Moreno {{is the one}} from the portrait Mariano Moreno en su mesa de trabajo (...) [...] It {{was done by the}} Chilean artist Pedro Subercaseaux during the centennial of the May Revolution in 1910. The historian Adolfo Carranza asked him to design various allegorical pictures of the event. Carranza belonged to the mainstream line of historians who professed great admiration for Moreno, who he described as follows: [...] "He was the soul of the government of the revolution of May, his nerve, the distinguished statesman of the group managing the ship attacked the absolutism and doubt, anxious to reach the goal of his aspirations and his destiny. Moreno was the compass and that also grabbed the helm, as he was the strongest and the ablest of those who came to direct it". He asked for a picture that was consistent with this image. The portrait depicts him as a friendly man with an open and round face, a wide forehead, and <b>a</b> <b>serene</b> look. Subsequent interpretations, like those of Antonio Estrada, would follow this style, as would portraits of other members of the Junta. However, as this portrait was made a hundred years after the death of the subject, with no known depictions done during his lifetime, it was thus based on the artist's imagination. It was known that Moreno had clearly visible smallpox scars from the age of eight, but not {{to the point where they}} disfigured his face.|$|E
