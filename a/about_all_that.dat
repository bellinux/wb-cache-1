Six hundred of the evacuees succumbed to their injuries or illnesses before they could receive sufficient medical care. Three thousand more required lengthy hospitalization or recuperation. After receiving word of {{the completion of the}} operation, Yamamoto commended all the units involved and ordered Kondo to return to Truk with his warships. The 2nd and 38th Divisions were shipped to Rabaul and partially reconstituted with replacements. The 2nd Division was relocated to the Philippines in March 1943 while the 38th was assigned to defend Rabaul and New Ireland. The 8th Area Army and Southeast Area Fleet reoriented their forces to defend the central Solomons at Kolombangara and New Georgia and prepared to send the reinforcements, mainly consisting of the 51st Infantry Division, originally detailed for Guadalcanal to New Guinea. The 17th Army was rebuilt around the 6th Infantry Division and headquartered on Bougainville. A few Japanese stragglers remained on Guadalcanal, many of whom were subsequently killed or captured by Allied patrols. The last known Japanese holdout surrendered in October 1947.|$|E

Heskey {{was reported to}} have said he was considering leaving Villa during the January 2010 transfer window, to help ensure he would be chosen for the England team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, to which manager Martin O'Neill responded by saying [...] "There are players at this club with England ambitions. I wouldn't be overly concerned <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> yet." [...] However, Heskey later denied he was seeking to leave Villa. O'Neill told him to [...] "build up a head of steam" [...] in February 2010, saying he was concerned that Heskey's injuries were denying him from producing his best form.

Mauboy's management saw the group as a [...] "perfect learning curve" [...] <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was positive and negative in the music industry. Together, they released their second studio album, New Attitude in November, and the album's lead single, [...] "Turn Me Loose". After things went downhill for the group following the song's release, Mauboy went to the studio to begin working on her debut solo album Been Waiting, because {{she wanted to be a}} solo artist and it was always on her mind to become one. Mauboy began writing songs with Adam Reily, Israel Cruz, Brooke McClymont, and Audius Mtawarira. In June 2008, Mauboy told The Jakarta Post that her debut solo single would be released in August, with the album planned for a September release. Two months later, it was announced that Mauboy had left the Young Divas to resume her solo career.|$|E

I thought it represented us as people, musically, {{a lot more than}} Tweez did. That's about it. It seemed like when we were around, and actively playing and stuff, that people's responses to us were fairly ambivalent. I thought it was funny when the press picked up on it. For an independent release, it had a strange sort of audience and kept selling three or four years after we recorded it; it still sells more copies than when it first came out." [...] Touch and Go founder Corey Rusk said that Spiderland is [...] "like an icon now. But when it came out, nobody cared! The band had broken up by the time the album came out, and it really didn't sell particularly well or get written <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> much in the year it was released. But it was a revolutionary, groundbreaking record, and it's one of the few instances where people catch up to it later on."

500|$|After signing to DGC Records, Nirvana reconvened with Vig in May 1991 {{to work on}} {{its major}} label debut, Nevermind, at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California. Between the sessions, bassist Krist Novoselic {{simplified}} the bassline; he said, [...] "I enriched the bass-playing a little more but that was <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> we changed." [...] The recording session for [...] "Lithium" [...] {{was one of the}} most arduous for Vig and the group at Sound City. The band repeatedly sped up while recording the song, so Vig resorted to using a click track to maintain a consistent tempo. The producer suggested that new drummer Dave Grohl use simpler fills and patterns for the song, which resulted in a satisfactory instrumental take. Cobain's guitar track was more difficult to record. [...] "Kurt wanted to be able to play the guitar very [...] [...] [...] not methodical—it needed to have this space," [...] Vig recalled. [...] "It had to be relaxed." [...] Every time Cobain sped up, Vig called for another take. During the first day of recording the song, Cobain became so frustrated at the slow progress that the band instead began playing an instrumental jam it had been working on. Vig recorded the jam, later titled [...] "Endless, Nameless" [...] and it was inserted as a hidden track at the end of Nevermind.|$|E

[...] Following its release, the band faced allegations of advocating the use of recreational drugs from Bill Gavin's Record Report, a weekly newsletter circulated to U.S. radio stations. [...] This resulted in [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] being banned {{in a number of}} states within a week of the report being published, a factor which contributed to the single's failure to break into the Billboard Top 10. The Byrds and their publicist, Derek Taylor, countered by strenuously denying that the song was drug-related, with Taylor issuing an indignant press release unequivocally stating that the song was about the band's trip to England and not drug use. [...] However, by the early 1980s, both Crosby and Clark were prepared to admit that the song was not entirely as innocent as they had originally declared, with the former stating [...] "Of course it was a drug song! We were stoned when we wrote it." [...] Clark was less blunt, explaining in interview that [...] "it was about a lot of things. It was about the airplane trip to England, it was about drugs, it was <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>that.</b> A piece of poetry of that nature is not limited to having it have to be just about airplanes or having it have to be just about drugs. It was inclusive because during those days the new experimenting with all the drugs was a very vogue thing to do." ...|$|E
