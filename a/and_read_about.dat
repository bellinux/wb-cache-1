5|$|Hutton {{was born}} on 23 June 1916 in the Moravian {{community}} of Fulneck, Pudsey, the youngest of five children to Henry Hutton and his wife Lily (née Swithenbank). Many of his family were local cricketers and Hutton soon became immersed in the sport, which he both played <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> with enthusiasm. He practised in the playground of Littlemoor Council School, which he attended from 1921 until 1930, and at Pudsey St Lawrence Cricket Club, which he joined as a junior. At the age of 12, {{he made his first}} appearance for Pudsey St Lawrence's second eleven and by 1929 had reached the first team. Locals encouraged him to meet the Yorkshire and England cricketer Herbert Sutcliffe, a neighbour, from whom Hutton received coaching in Sutcliffe's garden. Sutcliffe was impressed by the young batsman, and commended him to Yorkshire as a good prospect.|$|E
500|$|Paula Findlen, {{writing in}} the Cambridge History of Science, asserts that Natural history was an ancient form of {{scientific}} knowledge, most {{closely associated with the}} writings of the Roman encyclopedist Pliny the Elder... His loquacious and witty Historia naturalis offered an expansive definition of this subject. [...] broadly described all entities found in nature, or derived from nature, that could be seen in the Roman world <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> in its books: art, artifacts, and peoples as well as animals, plants, and minerals were included in his project. Findlen contrasts Pliny's approach with that of his intellectual predecessors Aristotle and Theophrastus, who sought general causes of natural phenomena, while Pliny was more interested in cataloguing natural wonders, and his contemporary Dioscorides explored nature for its uses in Roman medicine in his great work De Materia Medica.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} was very {{different}} from what was eventually published because he removed parts he felt were too sensational or dramatized. In the first draft, the story was told entirely {{from the point of view}} of Elmer, an intelligent chicken who is also an actor. Influenced by David Beauchard’s Epileptic and David Mazzucchelli’s City of Glass, Alanguilan altered the story's structure to focus on Elmer's son, Jake. Alanguilan also drew on an event from his teenage years, when he found his father's diary <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> the death of Gerry's uncle Dennis. The new format turned the story into one about Alanguilan, his parents, and his [...] "fears of losing them as they get older." [...] The original opening scene was a human attacking a chicken before being revealed as a film production. Alanguilan believed the scene was too much of a gimmick and moved it to the middle of the book.|$|E

500|$|He was a cricket enthusiast, {{taking his}} bat {{with him when}} {{evacuated}} during the Blitz. In 1971, he told Mel Gussow: [...] "one of my main obsessions in life is the game of cricket—I play and watch <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> it all the time." [...] He {{was chairman of the}} Gaieties Cricket Club, a supporter of Yorkshire Cricket Club, and devoted a section of his official website to the sport. One wall of his study was dominated by a portrait of himself as a young man playing cricket, which was described by Sarah Lyall, writing in The New York Times: [...] "The painted Mr. Pinter, poised to swing his bat, has a wicked glint in his eye; testosterone all but flies off the canvas." [...] Pinter approved of the [...] "urban and exacting idea of cricket as a bold theatre of aggression." [...] After his death, several of his school contemporaries recalled his achievements in sports, especially cricket and running. [...] The BBC Radio 4 memorial tribute included an essay on Pinter and cricket.|$|E
500|$|In February 1969 Gil and Veloso {{were arrested}} by the Brazilian {{military}} government, brought from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro, and spent three months in prison and another four under house arrest, before being freed {{on the condition that}} they leave the country. Veloso was the first to be arrested; the police moved to Gil's home soon afterward. Veloso had directed his then-wife Andréa Gadelha to warn Gil about the possibility of arrest, but Gil was eventually brought into the police van along with Veloso. They were given no reason or charge for their arrest. Gil believes that the government felt his actions [...] "represent a threat , something new, something that can't quite be understood, something that doesn't fit into any of the clear compartments of existing cultural practices, and that won't do. That is dangerous." [...] During his prison sentence, Gil began to meditate, follow a macrobiotic diet, <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> Eastern philosophy. He composed four songs during his imprisonment, among them [...] "Cérebro Electrônico" [...] (Electronic Brain), which first appeared on his 1969 album Gilberto Gil 1969, and later on his 2006 album Gil Luminoso. Thereafter, Gil and Veloso were exiled to London, England after being offered to leave Brazil. The two played a last Brazilian concert together in Salvador in July 1969, then travelled to Portugal, Paris, and finally London. He and Veloso took a house in Chelsea, sharing it with their manager and wives. Gil was involved in the organisation of the 1971 Glastonbury Free Festival and was exposed to reggae while living in London; he recalls listening to Bob Marley (whose songs he later covered), Jimmy Cliff, and Burning Spear. He was heavily influenced by and involved with the city's rock scene as well, performing with Yes, Pink Floyd, and the Incredible String Band. However, he also performed solo, recording Gilberto Gil (Nêga) while in London. In addition to involvement in the reggae and rock scenes, Gil attended performances by jazz artists, including Miles Davis and Sun Ra.|$|E
2500|$|Josephine's father Henry {{struggled}} {{to make a living}} in New York City <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> the growing city of San Francisco. Henry moved the family to San Francisco in 1868 when Josephine was 7. They traveled via ship to Panama, went over the Isthmus of Panama, and caught a steamship to San Francisco. They arrived while the city was recovering from the disastrous earthquake of October 21, 1868. Upon their arrival, her father found a highly stratified Jewish community. On the inside were the German Jews and on the outside were the Polish Jews. [...] The German Jews were usually more affluent, better educated, and spoke German while the Polish Jews, who spoke Yiddish, were typically peddlers and much more religious. Henry found work as a baker.|$|E

2500|$|Top-ranked LSU {{defeated}} sixth-ranked, rival Ole Miss, 14–0 {{in a game}} {{dominated by}} defense and penalties. 68,000 fans packed Tiger Stadium to watch the Tigers win their first game against the Rebels since 1950. Ole Miss was LSU's most bitter rival at the time, and fans who heard <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> the Chinese Bandits and Billy Cannon wanted to see them first-hand. [...] "It's not a rivalry because somebody says it is," [...] said Cannon, [...] "or because you've been playing against a team for a long time. It's a rivalry when two good teams meet and either one could walk out the winner. This was a rivalry." [...] Banners were strung around the LSU campus with the words [...] "Go to Hell, Ole Miss." [...] Later, a plane dropped leaflets on campus that read [...] "Go to Hell, LSU." [...] Some thought Dietzel was responsible, hoping to fire up his team for the game, but he denied responsibility.|$|E

If people keep talking <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> <b>about</b> diseases they will get them, and if they keep talking <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> <b>about</b> crimes they will find that iniquity is catching, the same as some other things.

Then you might write something which would be interesting." ...|$|R

We flew up, and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed us Fred and the students singing away down below. It was the most romantic thing I ever saw--the river, the bridge of boats, the great fortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of stone.|$|E
