40|$|Systems {{to provide}} {{pensions}} {{need to be}} adjusted from time to time. This is true of public systems and is also true of private systems. Sometimes the need arises from a mismatch between finances and benefits under existing rules. Sometimes the need arises from a mismatch between system design and the social needs that pensions are trying to meet. Today, I will begin by discussing pension insurance reform in general terms. Then I will turn to some specific issues here in Germany, including the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> for the age of retirement and the determination of survivor benefits for the elderly. Given the need for periodic reform, {{there are two basic}} questions. How frequently is changing the system likely to be seriously considered? And what circumstances are likely to shape the actions or inactions at such times? For a public system, these are questions of political economy, of the interaction between the workings of the pension system and the political process. 2 I start with two presumptions. First, a system to provide retirement income should not be changed very often. And second, when it i...|$|E

With this as a background, the use to which these estimates is made in developing legislation is described, with emphasis on the current financing problems. Finally, various possible solutions to these problems are discussed. These solutions involve either increasing the income of the program or decreasing {{the rate of growth}} of its outgo. Increased income could be derived by increasing the payroll tax rates, by injecting general revenues (either directly or indirectly, such as taxing Social Security benefits and putting the proceeds in the trust funds or financing part of all of the Hospital Insurance program from general revenues and moving some of its payroll tax rate to the cash-benefits program), or by covering government employees who are not now covered.

Although one of the main objectives of the German labour market reforms was to improve the matching processes on the labour market, {{there are only a few}} studies that elucidate the direction and structure of the reform effects on job matching.

Furthermore, it was not known whether the reform effects covered the entire labour market or only parts of it.

40|$|The {{so called}} actuarial <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> public pension <b>benefits</b> to the {{retirement}} age are quite controversial in the German retirement insurance system. This article aims {{to shed light on}} the technical details in order to help our readers to determine for themselves what the "right" adjustments are. This depends, as so often, on the view of the beholder. Judged from the view of a public retirement insurance, which applies a very low discount rate, the German adjustments are indeed about actuarially correct. All other points of view, however, require substantially higher adjustments than currently legislated. To be incentive neutral, the actuarial adjustments should be at least 50 % higher since workers are likely to use discount rates which are at least as high as the capital market interest rate and probably much higher. Higher adjustments are also implied by economic growth and majority voting considerations. ...|$|R

Using a horizontal equity index, we also compare the different systems' performance {{in terms of how}} neighboring generations are treated. While the actual Swedish system smoothes stochastic fluctuations more than any other and produces the highest degree of horizontal equity, it does so by accumulating a buffer stock of assets that alleviates the need for frequent <b>adjustments.</b> In terms <b>of</b> social welfare, this accumulation of assets leads to a lower average rate of return that more than offsets the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> risk reduction, leaving systems with more frequent adjustments that spread risks broadly among generations as those most preferred. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the correlation of}} higher-order coping strategies of tenacious goal pursuit and flexible goal adjustment with adjustment after rehabilitation in spinal cordinjury. Design: Cross-sectional correlational study. Subjects/patients: All 397 eligible patients entered for spinal cord rehabilitation between 1999 and 2009 were contacted and 130 (33 %) agreed to complete a self-report questionnaire. Methods: Partial correlations were computed between tenacious goal pursuit and flexible goal adjustment and affective and cognitive psychological adjustment. Demographics, spinal cord injury related variables, social support and coping were used as control variables. Results: After controlling for relevant demographic, medical and social support indices, partial correlations between tenacious goal pursuit and indices of adaptation were not significant. Significant partial correlations were observed between flexible goal <b>adjustment</b> and each <b>of</b> the indices <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> (r = – 0. 33, – 0. 42, 0. 51, – 0. 38, respectively, for depression, anxiety, acceptance, and helplessness) after controlling for all relevant variables in the model.
