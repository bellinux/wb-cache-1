The members of the band first claimed that they found the name {{suitable}} because they frequently quarreled about the composition of the lyrics in their songs, but they have since stated they are usually on good terms while composing music and acknowledges contributions from all of its members. The band has had no permanent bassist since Caleb, instead employing touring bassists on a temporary basis. The current bassist is Jason Hardin, who has been touring with the band since 2014.|$|E

500|$|Morrison {{returned}} to the A studios between June and August to record the remaining six tracks that featured on the album. For this second session Dahaud Shaar filled the role of engineer, though Shaar did not remember Morrison giving the job to him: [...] "Elliot {{thought he was going}} to be the co-producer, but then again I never saw him calling takes or <b>asking</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> change parts ... I didn't consider myself co-producer. Van would ask me questions and I would give him answers, but it was never a defined role." [...] Morrison felt unsatisfied with some of the final recordings, and notably reworked the song [...] "Street Choir" [...] shortly before studio work concluded.|$|E
500|$|... "Earth Song" [...] is a ballad that {{incorporates}} elements of blues, gospel and opera. In the socially conscious track, Jackson issues a wakeup-call about the dire situations that mankind has caused and is facing, ranging from war to devastation to animals and earth itself. [...] The song reveals {{itself to be}} highly spiritual at the end where Jackson calls on people to remember the earth is their inheritance from God via their ancestor Abraham. [...] "What about death again" [...] reminds all to think about eternal death, <b>asking</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> check their heart for repentance, or {{to see if they}} really cared at all. Having disfellowshipped himself from Jehovah's Witnesses, Jackson simplified his faith to focus on the Biblical Jesus Christ until his death.|$|E
500|$|Duvall {{had always}} wanted to play a country singer, and Foote was rumored to have written the role of Mac Sledge {{specifically}} for him. Foote denied the claim, claiming he found it too constraining to write roles for specific actors, although he did hope Duvall would be cast in the part. Tender Mercies became a very important personal project for Duvall, who contributed a significant number of ideas for his character. In preparing for the role, he spent weeks roaming around Texas, speaking to strangers to find the right accent and mannerisms. He also joined a small country band and continued singing with them every free weekend while the film was being shot. In total, Duvall drove about [...] to research the part, often <b>asking</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> speak into his tape recorder so he could practice their inflections and other vocal habits.

500|$|Myrie-Williams joined League Two side Port Vale on loan on 24 November, {{joining the}} club until January 2012.

He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored one goal in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E
