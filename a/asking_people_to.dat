25|$|Ben Wysocki, {{a former}} bandmate of Isaac Slade, joined as drummer and later, Dave Welsh, who was another former bandmate of Slade and Wysocki, was added as lead guitarist to the band.

The members of the band first claimed that they found the name {{suitable}} because they frequently quarreled about the composition of the lyrics in their songs, but they have since stated they are usually on good terms while composing music and acknowledges contributions from all of its members. The band has had no permanent bassist since Caleb, instead employing touring bassists on a temporary basis. The current bassist is Jason Hardin, who has been touring with the band since 2014.|$|E

500|$|Morrison {{returned}} to the A studios between June and August to record the remaining six tracks that featured on the album. For this second session Dahaud Shaar filled the role of engineer, though Shaar did not remember Morrison giving the job to him: [...] "Elliot {{thought he was going}} to be the co-producer, but then again I never saw him calling takes or <b>asking</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> change parts ... I didn't consider myself co-producer. Van would ask me questions and I would give him answers, but it was never a defined role." [...] Morrison felt unsatisfied with some of the final recordings, and notably reworked the song [...] "Street Choir" [...] shortly before studio work concluded.|$|E
500|$|... "Earth Song" [...] is a ballad that {{incorporates}} elements of blues, gospel and opera. In the socially conscious track, Jackson issues a wakeup-call about the dire situations that mankind has caused and is facing, ranging from war to devastation to animals and earth itself. [...] The song reveals {{itself to be}} highly spiritual at the end where Jackson calls on people to remember the earth is their inheritance from God via their ancestor Abraham. [...] "What about death again" [...] reminds all to think about eternal death, <b>asking</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> check their heart for repentance, or {{to see if they}} really cared at all. Having disfellowshipped himself from Jehovah's Witnesses, Jackson simplified his faith to focus on the Biblical Jesus Christ until his death.|$|E
500|$|Duvall {{had always}} wanted to play a country singer, and Foote was rumored to have written the role of Mac Sledge {{specifically}} for him. Foote denied the claim, claiming he found it too constraining to write roles for specific actors, although he did hope Duvall would be cast in the part. Tender Mercies became a very important personal project for Duvall, who contributed a significant number of ideas for his character. In preparing for the role, he spent weeks roaming around Texas, speaking to strangers to find the right accent and mannerisms. He also joined a small country band and continued singing with them every free weekend while the film was being shot. In total, Duvall drove about [...] to research the part, often <b>asking</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> speak into his tape recorder so he could practice their inflections and other vocal habits. Upon finding one man with the exact accent he wanted, Duvall had him recite the entire script into the recorder.|$|E

500|$|After his diagnosis, Sutton began {{participating}} in charity events with the Teenage Cancer Trust, and later {{started his own}} website and blog in January 2013. At the same time, he began fundraising for the trust, with an initial goal of ¬£10,000. Following unexpected support, the goal was raised to ¬£100,000 and ¬£500,000 the same year, before being raised to ¬£1,000,000 in March 2014 and went over the ¬£4,000,000 mark {{by the end of}} May 2014. During his fundraising campaign, Sutton was supported by several celebrities, most notably Jimmy Carr, Jonathan Ross and Jason Manford.

500|$|Myrie-Williams joined League Two side Port Vale on loan on 24 November, {{joining the}} club until January 2012.

In his next appearance for the club, he scored the equalising goal in a 2‚Äì1 win at Dagenham & Redbridge, when he [...] "blasted in" [...] a [...] "25-yard blockbuster"‚Äì fellow Stevenage loanee Madjo went on to score the winning goal. Myrie-Williams' effort was Vale's first goal in 502 minutes (more than five games) of football.

He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored one goal in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E

Then, that evening, they were to post flyers and posters throughout their city for the Kony 2012 campaign. The turnout for the event worldwide was much smaller than initially expected, with no organized spots officially announced and much fewer people attending than had pledged to attend.
