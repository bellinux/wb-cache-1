500|$|Chickens are medium-sized, chunky {{birds with}} an upright stance and characterised by fleshy red combs and wattles on their heads. Males, known as cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, {{and have more}} exaggerated plumage than females (hens). Chickens are gregarious, omnivorous, ground-dwelling birds that in their natural {{surroundings}} search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates, and other small animals. They seldom fly except {{as a result of}} perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached. Today's domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is mainly descended from the wild red junglefowl of Asia, with some additional input from [...] grey junglefowl. Domestication is believed to have taken place between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago, and what are thought to be fossilized chicken bones have been found in northeastern China dated to around 5,400 BC. Archaeologists believe domestication was originally for the purpose of cockfighting, the male bird being a doughty fighter. By 4,000 years ago, chickens seem to have reached the Indus Valley and 250 years later, they arrived in Egypt. They were still used for fighting and were regarded as symbols of fertility. The Romans used them in divination, and the Egyptians made a breakthrough when they learned the difficult technique of <b>artificial</b> <b>incubation.</b> Since then, the keeping of chickens has spread around the world for the production of food with the domestic fowl being a valuable source of both eggs and meat.|$|E

The rearing lasts until the fry can survive the climatic risks in a natural environment. The research dealt mainly with larval rearing in small ponds in which biomass is qualitatively controlled.

40|$|Incubation {{temperature}} influences hatchling phenotypes such as sex, size, shape, color, behavior, and locomotor {{performance in}} many reptiles, {{and there is}} growing concern that global warming might adversely affect reptile populations by altering frequencies of hatchling phenotypes. Here I overview a recent theoretical model used to predict hatchling sex of reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination. This model predicts that sex ratios will be fairly robust to moderate global warming as long as eggs experience substantial daily cyclic fluctuations in incubation temperatures so that embryos are exposed to temperatures that inhibit embryonic development {{for part of the}} day. I also review studies that examine the influence of incubation temperature on posthatch locomotion performance and growth because these are the traits that are likely to have the greatest effect on hatchling fitness. The majority of these studies used <b>artificial</b> constant-temperature <b>incubation,</b> but some have addressed fluctuating incubation temperature regimes. Although the number of studies is small, it appears that fluctuating temperatures may enhance hatchling locomotor performance. This finding should not be surprising, given that the majority of natural reptile nests are relatively shallow and therefore experience daily fluctuations in incubation temperature...|$|R

His communism is all for the convenience of his Syphogrants and Tranibores, those gentlemen of gravity and experience, lest one should swell up above the others.

40|$|The {{action of}} a series of tetraphenylborate ion (TPB) {{derivatives}} on yeast cells was studied by electro-rotation of the pre-treated cells. TPB derivatives in which all four phenyl groups were substituted with fluorine, chlorine or trifluoromethyl were much more toxic than the unsubstituted compound, the effect increasing dramatically with increasing size of substituents.

An overview of the biogeochemical importance of H 2 O 2 in seawater is presented in Chapter One. The use of both flow injection and chemiluminescence based methods are also reviewed. Chapter Two {{describes the}} type of analytical instrumentation used in both flow injection and chemiluminescence methods. Each component is described and its suitability to the FI-CL method discussed. Two detection systems; photomultiplier tube and photodiode, and two flow cell designs; coiled glass and lamina, were compared for their suitability to the method. A charge coupled device was used to obtain the CL spectra of the luminol CL reaction and automation of the FI manifold is also described. Chapters Three and Four describe the optimisation of the FI-CL method and its suitability to the determination of H 2 O 2 in natural waters (river, estuarine and sea). Matrix efifects are investigated and a standard addition procedure described. The analytical figures of merit for H 2 O 2 determination include a limit of detection of 10 nM and a linear range of 10 - 500 nM. The application of the fully optimised method to the in situ determination of H 2 O 2 in the western Mediterranean is described in Chapter Five.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{development}} of fish culture technology in Victorian Britain. Fish culture included <b>artificial</b> propagation (breeding, <b>incubation</b> and rearing) of fish, {{as well as the}} other material practices, forms of regulation, social organisation and discourses that constituted freshwater fisheries conservation in Britain, circa 1830 – 1870. The approach taken is based in both the sociology of science and technology and social history. Fish culture is viewed as an innovative reproductive technology, and positioned as part of the “preHhistory” of modern reproduction. Focusing on the generative interactions of the social and piscine worlds of fish culture, empirical analyses of the social relations or social order of a technology, and its coHconstitution with the society of which it was part are conducted. Focus is also placed specifically on social conflicts of different kinds. These conflicts emerged out of existing social and economic tensions connected to the fisheries and the scientific study of fish – which were themselves connected to wider economic, demographic and political developments in British society in which social hierarchies of different kinds were being challenged and thus also defended and remade. Empirical case studies focus on these conflicts as socio-technical processes involving rivalry over scarce goods – ideal and material – and, specifically, how they were resolved or ameliorated such that social orders were achieved, modified and reproduced. The thesis is positioned as a contribution to the social studies of reproduction, to science and technology studies, and to the substantive sociological and historical understanding of a socio-technical practice of historical interest and, in the form of modern aquaculture, of growing contemporary importance...|$|R

In eggs in which movement of the sperm nucleus after entry is blocked with cytochalasin D, the sperm aster is formed at the site where the calcium wave had previously started. This indicates that the calcium wave starts where the sperm enters. In 70 % of the eggs, the calcium wave starts in the animal hemisphere, which confirms previous observations that there is a preference for sperm to enter this part of the egg (Speksnijder, J. E., L.

40|$|Selective {{pressures}} {{imposed by}} pathogenic microorganisms to embryos have selected in hosts for {{a battery of}} antimicrobial lines of defenses that includes physical and chemical barriers. Due to the antimicrobial properties of volatile compounds of green plants and of chemicals of feather degrading bacteria, the use of aromatic plants and feathers for nest building has been suggested as one of these barriers. However, experimental evidence suggesting such effects is scarce in the literature. During two consecutive years, we explored experimentally {{the effects of these}} nest materials on loads of different groups of bacteria (mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus) of eggshells in nests of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the incubation period. This was also explored in <b>artificial</b> nests without <b>incubation</b> activity. We also experimentally increased bacterial density of eggs in natural and artificial nests and explored the effects of nest lining treatments on eggshell bacterial load. Support for the hypothetical antimicrobial function of nest materials was mainly detected for the year and location with larger average values of eggshell bacterial density. The beneficial effects of feathers and plants were more easily detected in artificial nests with no incubation activity, suggesting an active role of incubation against bacterial colonization of eggshells. Pigmented and unpigmented feathers reduced eggshell bacterial load in starling nests and artificial nest boxes. Results from artificial nests allowed us to discuss and discard alternative scenarios explaining the detected association, particularly those related to the possible sexual role of feathers and aromatic plants in starling nests. All these results considered together confirm the antimicrobial functionality mainly of feathers but also of plants used as nest materials, and highlight the importance of temporally and geographically environmental variation associated with risk of bacterial proliferation determining the strength of such effects. Because of costs associated to nest building, birds should adjust nest building effort to expected bacterial environments during incubation, a prediction that should be further explored.

40|$|Yellow dwarf {{of onions}} is a {{transmissible}} virus disease, of the mosaic group. The virus overwinters in the infected onion bulbs and in volunteer onion plants that live over {{winter in the}} fields. It probably is neither seed nor soil borne. Yellow dwarf symptoms are characterized by yellowing and crinkling of the leaves, which become more or less flat and droop over in the advanced stages. Flower stalks of infected mother on ion plants become yellow, twist, and curl and are shorter than normal plants. Masking of yellow dwarf symptoms occurs quite commonly in infected onion plants, and these plants {{are a source of}} inoculum for infecting healthy plants; bulbs from the plants masking symptoms when regrown produce infected plants that show disease symptoms. Plants grown from infected onion sets and those that become infected early in the growing season produce under-developed bulbs of little commercial value. Onion plants having masked infection throughout their growth period produce apparently normal plants and yields. Infected mother onion plants produce normal seed, but the seed yield is about 30 percent less than from healthy plants. Yellow Dwarf is transmissible by artificial inoculation and insect vectors. By <b>artificial</b> inoculations the <b>incubation</b> period is usually about 10 days. Onion bulbs hypodermically inoculated with juice extracted from the fleshy and dry scale leaves of infected onion bulbs failed to show infection. Inoculations made during retarded growth periods either fail to infect the plants or the symptoms are not manifested during the current growth period. Signs of the disease appear when the bulbs of such infected plants are regrown. The virus extracted from yellow dwarf infected onion leaves that mask the symptoms is infective. Yellow dwarf virus was transmitted under controlled conditions by the bean aphid (Aphis rumiscis Linn.), corn leaf aphid (Aphis maidis Fitch.), and the apple grain aphid (Rhopalosiphum prunifoliae Fitch). The yellow dwarf virus was inactivated when the viriferous juice was stored in vitro at 29 ° C. for a period of 112 hours. When infected onion leaves were stored in the open, at 29 ° C. for 100 hours, juice extracted from the leaves was non-infective. The infectivity of the virus was only slightly retarded when viriferous juice was heated 10 minutes at 70 ° C. At 75 ° C. for 10 minutes, 55 percent of the original virulence of the virus was lost. At 80 ° C. for 10 minutes, the virus was inactivated. With 10 -minute exposures the critical thermal point for the yellow dwarf virus lies between 75 and 80 ° C. Exposures as low as - 14 ° C. for 6 hours failed to inactivate yellow dwarf virus. Inoculations with dilutions of 1 - 10, 240 and above failed to infect any of the onion plants. Yellow dwarf virus inoculated into Chinese sacred lily (Narcissus tazetta L.) bulbs, Jonquil (Narcissus jonquilla L.) bulbs and shallots (Allium sativum L.) visibly infected 60, 30 and 90 percent of the plants, respectively. Inoculations with other plant viruses, including mosaic of Chinese sacred lily (Narcissus tazetta L.) and Jonquil (Narcissus jonquilla L.) failed to infect onion plants. Only one (Riverside Sweet Spanish) of thirty-six onion varieties tested seemed to be markedly resistant. The combined effect of indexing all growing stocks of onion bulbs, producing the planting stock of bulbs in areas free from yellow dwarf and roguing out the infected volunteer onions in the fields reduced the percentage of yellow dwarf infection in the district from 40 percent in 1928 to a trace in 1933 and 1934...|$|R

The oldest known kakapo, [...] "Richard Henry", was thought to be 80 {{years old at the time}} of his death in December 2010. In 2006, the Kakapo Recovery Programme presented a new management plan that would run from 2006 to 2016. The key goals of this plan are to increase the female population to at least 60 by 2016, increase genetic diversity (since the low number of individuals can be expected to result in inbreeding depression), maintain or restore a sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the kakapo population, and maintain public awareness and support.|$|E
50|$|Chickens are medium-sized, chunky {{birds with}} an upright stance and characterised by fleshy red combs and wattles on their heads. Males, known as cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, {{and have more}} exaggerated plumage than females (hens). Chickens are gregarious, omnivorous, ground-dwelling birds that in their natural {{surroundings}} search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates, and other small animals. They seldom fly except {{as a result of}} perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached. Today's domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is mainly descended from the wild red junglefowl of Asia, with some additional input from grey junglefowl. Domestication is believed to have taken place between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago, and what are thought to be fossilized chicken bones have been found in northeastern China dated to around 5,400 BC. Archaeologists believe domestication was originally for the purpose of cockfighting, the male bird being a doughty fighter. By 4,000 years ago, chickens seem to have reached the Indus Valley and 250 years later, they arrived in Egypt. They were still used for fighting and were regarded as symbols of fertility. The Romans used them in divination, and the Egyptians made a breakthrough when they learned the difficult technique of <b>artificial</b> <b>incubation.</b> Since then, the keeping of chickens has spread around the world for the production of food with the domestic fowl being a valuable source of both eggs and meat.|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{preserving}} and increasing endangered stocks of white-clawed crayfish, research on juvenile production has been carried out. Advantages in application of newly developed techniques of egg storage, transport and <b>artificial</b> <b>incubation</b> techniques are discussed. Eggs can be removed from maternal pleopods {{during the early stages}} of embryonic development and placed in <b>artificial</b> <b>incubation</b> devices. This practice avoids egg losses caused by aggressive contacts, female disease or death and the production of stage- 2 juveniles in different batches by means of temperature manipulation. Furthermore transmission of pathogens from broodstocks to offspring can be minimised. Egg storage and transport have some advantages in the artificial reproduction of crayfish. Firstly, embryonic development continues under storage conditions and thus water and human effort can be saved during this period. Temperature plays an important role on both efficiency rates and duration of embryogenesis. Secondly, egg transport could facilitate restocking programs, as {{there is no need to}} move berried females to other habitats. To sum up, the combined use of <b>artificial</b> <b>incubation</b> and storage/transport techniques could have important applications to the development of astacid crayfish culture.

The method of incubation is practically the same as that described in the Agrodok Series No. 34, pages 23 - 28 with one small difference; the eggs have to be turned twice, once in the morning and once in the evening.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} study on wild sparrows <b>artificial</b> <b>incubation</b> and feeding in order to search effect methods on biological pests preventing, aimed at minimizing use of pesticides and reaching to harmonious development between ecological environment and economy. Moreover, it plays a positive role on local eco-environment protection and income gaining of fruits farmers. Total 162 sparrow eggs were collected to study {{the influence of the}} temperature and humidity on hatchability of the fertilized eggs from the sparrows. The sparrow eggs were sorted to three groups randomly, each group was 54 eggs. Then 60 chick sparrows aged 1 day old were selected from <b>artificial</b> <b>incubation</b> nestles as samples to study the effect of different feeds on body weight and length. The sparrows were assigned to two groups randomly, experimental and control groups, the test group fed with Tenebrous, the control group fed with feed. The results show: the hatchability of the sparrows’ fertilized eggs is relatively high when the temperature was 38. 0, 37. 6 and 37. 2 °C and the incubator humidity was 62, 55 and 67 % at the early stage, the medium-term and the latter of incubation, respectively. The results of artificial feeding experiment show that compared with the control group, the average daily gain of sparrows in experimental group is higher significantly by 8. 65 % (p 0. 05) on the body length.
