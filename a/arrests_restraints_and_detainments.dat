5000|$|The householders, due to {{the absence}} of all sinful {{activities}} during the period of meditation (sāmāyika), observe great vows, although the conduct-deluding karmas remain in operation. According to Achārya Pujyapada's Sarvārthasiddhi: The preposition ‘sam’ means one state of being. For instance, ghee becomes one with the thing mixed. To become one is samaya. That, which has oneness as its object, is sāmāyikam. One attains the great vows when one practises sāmāyika (concentration) at a particular place and time, since one is free from minute and gross injury and so on. It is argued that it would be perfect <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> discipline (sanyan). But it is untenable, as there is the presence of karmas or passions which <b>arrest</b> complete <b>restraint.</b> In that case these should not be called great vows. No. These are called great vows figuratively.|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide insight on Youth Care Workers perception of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion as interventive techniques and if the use or non-uses of those techniques affect the workers job satisfaction. The study used 29 respondents, ages 22 to 42 both male and female in which some used <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion techniques and the others did not. To obtain the findings, comparative analyses of several variables were observed such as; workers perceived satisfaction with their job, workers job satisfaction, workers perception of <b>restraints,</b> <b>and</b> workers perception of seclusion. In addition it is exploratory in that the results will provide important baseline information regarding Youth Care Workers perception of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion as interventive strategies among adolescents in residential treatment facilities. A self-administered questionnaire was given to Youth Care Workers that work at a facility that uses <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion techniques and facility that does not use <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion techniques. The questionnaire consisted of forty-three questions that addressed Youth Care Workers perception of restraint, seclusion, job satisfaction and level ofjob satisfaction. The study hypothesis stated that there would be a significant difference between Youth Care Workers perception of the use <b>and</b> non-use of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion as interventive strategies among adolescents in residential treatment facilities and the effects of the use or non-use on job satisfaction. This study hypothesis was rejected because the results revealed that according to the responses of the respondents, there was no significant difference in the Youth Care Workers perception of restraints, perception of seclusion, perception of job satisfaction or level of job satisfaction. Due to the small sample of respondents, a significant difference was difficult to establish. However, there is room for further research regarding <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion and the effects these interventive techniques may have on job satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> {{seclusion}} in the American psychiatric setting has a rich history—rich in medical, ethical, legal, {{and social}} controversy. For centuries, {{mental health care}} providers used movement restrictions and solitary confinement to manage psychiatric patients. Superintendents of eighteenth and early nineteenth century insane asylums and other institutions of confinement believed that strait-waistcoats, “tranquilizer chairs,” “maniac beds,” chains, shackles, and “quiet rooms” deescalated agitation and promoted self-control. Reforms beginning {{in the nineteenth century}} helped make some psychiatric institutions more humane, in part because staff members were trained to find ways to calm potentially violent patients without imposing holds or isolation. With the advent of Freud’s psychoanalysis, advances in microbiology {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries, as well as the explosion of psychotropic drugs in the latter half of the twentieth century, many traditional uses of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion became unnecessary. Federal and state legislatures and administrative agencies responded to these philosophical, scientific, and medical developments by restricting <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion to emergency situations and forbidding their imposition as a means of coercion, discipline, or convenience. Although <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion are used less frequently in the twenty-first century, they persist as methods of behavior management. A number of recent injuries and deaths associated with these interventions have refueled the dialogue regarding their appropriate use, bringing centuries old questions to the fore. Some stakeholders, who believe that the use of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion are evidence of patient warehousing, institutional abuse and neglect, and human rights violations, support legislation that would further reduce <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion use or eliminate it altogether. Other stakeholders, who believe that <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion can be used to prevent violent or assaultive patients from harming themselves and others, are questioning the scientific basis, cost, and feasibility of restraint-and-seclusion-free initiatives. In recent legislative sessions, federal and state lawmakers have attempted to respond to these seemingly irreconcilable concerns. Many commentators believe that heightened awareness of inappropriate <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion practices and more intense education and regulation will resolve these concerns. I argue instead that the psychiatric <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion controversy resists legislative solution because it is a function of more fundamental problems relating to mental health care access and finance. The controversy persists because of these practical problems, and because the use of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion implicate seemingly competing goals of patient safety and individual autonomy and, more broadly, the philosophical doctrines of legalism and medicalism...|$|R
40|$|Background: Behaviour support plan (BSP) {{quality is}} known to be an {{important}} aspect of the support provided to people with disability who show challenging behaviours and has been found to lead to reductions in challenging behaviour. Preliminary evidence suggests that quality of plans is associated with reductions in the use of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion. Method and materials: Quality of a sample of behaviour support plans was assessed using the Behaviour Support Plan – Quality Evaluation II (BSP-QE II) Guide (Browning Wright, Saren & Mayer, 2003). Episodes of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion before and during implementation of plans were examined by comparing <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion use between individuals with high quality versus low quality plans. Results: Compared to individuals with low quality plans, individuals with high quality plans were found to be subjected to less <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion over time, while those with low quality plans were subjected to increases. With the exception of one quality component, all components in high quality plans were found to be associated with decreases in <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion use. Conclusions: The results support earlier preliminary findings that quality of behaviour support plans are associated with reductions in restrictive intervention use. The findings are important because they suggest that increasing quality of behaviour support plans may lead to decreases in <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion over time...|$|R

"Accessible summary While the decision to use <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion was not taken lightly, nurse participants felt that there were no effective alternatives to the use of these measures. Adverse interpersonal, physical and practice environments contributed to the onset of aggression in old age psychiatry inpatient settings. Policies to reduce or eliminate the use of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion need to take account of wide-ranging strategies to deal with aggression, including the provision of appropriate education and support and addressing ethical and workplace cultural issues associated with these practices. Abstract <b>Restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion are often ineffective and can affect patients adversely. In this study, we explored nurses' experiences of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion in short-stay acute old age psychiatry inpatient units and how these experiences underpin resistance to eliminating these practices. Qualitative interviews were conducted with nurses in three old age psychiatry units in Melbourne, Australia. The results provide one overarching theme, lack of accessible alternatives to <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion, indicating that nurses believe there are no effective, accessible alternatives to these practices. Three related themes contribute to this perception. First, an adverse interpersonal environment contributes to <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion, which relates to undesirable consequences of poor staff-to-patient relationships. Second, an unfavourable physical environment contributes to aggression <b>and</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion use. Third, the practice environment influences the adoption of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion. The findings contribute to the limited evidence about nurses' experiences of these practices in short-stay old age psychiatry, and how account needs to be taken of these experiences and contextual influences when introducing measures to address these practices. Policies addressing these measures need to be accompanied by wide-ranging initiatives to deal with aggression, including providing appropriate education and support and addressing ethical and workplace cultural issues surrounding these practices...|$|R
