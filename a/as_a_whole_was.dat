5|$|Though {{sometimes}} productive, no {{nineteenth century}} iron mine on the Brendon Hills was profitable and the venture <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> financially ruinous. Furthermore, the industry <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> prone to boom and bust, {{with a sharp}} decline from the early 1880s. The railway continued in operation {{after the end of}} mining, although it had lost its primary traffic. A second-hand Robey semi-portable steam engine was installed {{at the head of the}} incline to power the drums, hauling wagons up in the absence of a regular downhill flow.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} months of the war, airmen and {{anti-aircraft}} soldiers saw only sporadic combat; it was on 10May 1940, when Germany commenced the drive into the west, that the Swiss army <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> mobilized a second time. At the onset of the campaign, German military aircraft first violated Swiss airspace.|$|E
5|$|Kylsart appealed his {{conviction}} on count 3 and was bailed pending the appeal.

5|$|On 9 November 2005, Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's {{leadership}} launched coordinated {{explosions in}} three hotel lobbies in Amman, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. Jordan's security <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> dramatically improved after the attack, and no major terrorist attacks {{have been reported}} since then.|$|E
5|$|On October 2010, these {{versions}} {{were given}} alphanumeric designations with the INS/GPS version becoming the SBU-38 (SBU=Smart Bomb Unit), the INS/GPS/IIR version becoming the SBU-54 and the INS/GPS/SALH version becoming the SBU-64; the system <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> renamed Hammer {{to make it}} more appealing to export customers.|$|E
5|$|This first castle {{was used}} only briefly {{and seems to}} have been {{abandoned}} {{by the middle of the}} 12th century.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} industry <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. It {{was expected that}} any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|E
5|$|Johnson and Olmos each {{received}} a further nomination {{in their respective}} categories, with Johnson losing a 1986 nomination to Edward Woodward as The Equalizer Robert McCall; and Olmos missing out on the 1988 award to both John Gielgud and Barry Bostwick for their work on the miniseries War and Remembrance. The series <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> nominated for the Best Television Series– Drama award twice, losing to Murder, She Wrote in 1985 and L.A. Law in 1986.|$|E
5|$|St. John's, and the {{province}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>was</b> gravely affected in the 1990s {{by the collapse}} of the northern cod fishery, which had been the driving force of the provincial economy for hundreds of years. After a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation, the city's proximity to the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and commercial development. As a result, the St. John's area now accounts for about half of {{the province}}'s economic output.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Chancery could grant three {{possible}} remedies– specific performance, injunctions and damages. The remedy of specific performance is, in contractual matters, an order {{by the court}} which requires the party in breach of contract to perform his obligations. The validity of the contract <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> not normally considered, only whether there was adequate consideration and if expecting the party that breached the contract {{to carry out his}} obligations was viable. Injunctions, on the other hand, are remedies which prevent a party from doing something (unlike specific performance, which requires them to do something). Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, the Court of Chancery was the only body qualified to grant injunctions and specific performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{center of}} the city {{contained}} several reinforced concrete buildings and lighter structures. Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense collection of small timber-made workshops set among Japanese houses. A few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. The houses were constructed of timber with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings were also built around timber frames. The city <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> highly susceptible to fire damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{agencies}} and individuals {{associated with the}} UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work. Two Secretaries-General, Dag Hammarskjöld and Kofi Annan, were each awarded the prize (in 1961 and 2001, respectively), as were Ralph Bunche (1950), a UN negotiator, René Cassin (1968), {{a contributor to the}} Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull (1945), the latter {{for his role in the}} organization's founding. Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the International Labour Organization in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, the International Atomic Energy Agency (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981, becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice. The UN <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> awarded the prize in 2001, sharing it with Annan.|$|E

5|$|Although {{historically}} Metro has had {{a significantly}} lower crime rate than any comparable transit system in the United States, crime on Metro <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> rising in the late 2000s. Crime on the transit system began spiking in 2008 and 2009. Robbery rose by 30 percent to 581 incidents in 2008, {{and in the first}} four months of 2009 rose another 28.3 percent to 240 robberies. Crime on the Green Line continued to be high: Gallery Place–Chinatown had the most robberies of any station throughout the Metro system, followed by Anacostia (25 percent fewer than Gallery Place) and L'Enfant Plaza (20 percent fewer than Anacostia). Crime by juveniles (generally robbery, or assault) also continued to be a serious issue for Metro, with more than 260 juvenile arrests {{in the first nine months}} of 2009, and Metro Transit Police continued to engage in large numbers of high-visibility patrols. Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place–Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue continued to be trouble spots, and Metro added Metro Center to the list in 2009.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{proved that}} the fault lay {{in the construction of}} the bomb's tail; breaking up on impact, a 'safed' bomb would have its arming wire removed, rendering it 'unsafe' and detonating the weapon. Modifications were made to solve the problem, but the damage had been done; the safety issues, increased maintenance costs compared to conventional bombs, the fact that the bomb's guidance system required clear-day use only, rendering the bombers vulnerable to enemy fighters, and required that the weapon be released at a prime altitude for the aircraft to be in danger from enemy flak. These combined with the weapon's poor reliability – only six of twenty-eight bombs dropped successfully destroyed their targets – to result in the production order being canceled by the USAF; following this, the Tarzon program <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> terminated in August 1951.|$|E
5|$|As {{minister}} {{in charge of}} the Four Year Plan, Göring became concerned with the lack of natural resources in Germany, and began pushing for Austria to be incorporated into the Reich. The province of Styria had rich iron ore deposits, and the country <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met on 12 February 1938 with Austrian chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming. The Nazi party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the plebiscite, Göring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state Wilhelm Miklas to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March and the plebiscite was cancelled. By 5:30 the next morning, German troops that had been massing on the border marched into Austria, meeting no resistance.|$|E

5|$|Dartmouth's {{medical school}} {{was founded in}} 1797 as the fourth medical school in the United States, {{following}} the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (founded 1765), the medical school of King's College (now Columbia University) (1767), and Harvard Medical School (1782). The founder was Nathan Smith, a Harvard University and University of Edinburgh Medical School educated physician from Cornish, New Hampshire. Noting the dearth of medical professionals in the rural Connecticut River Upper Valley area, Smith petitioned the Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College in August 1796 to fund {{the establishment of a}} medical school to train more physicians for the region. Though Dartmouth College <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> financially strapped, the Board approved the request, and Smith began lecturing on November 22, 1797.|$|E
5|$|Financially the Militia was {{neglected}} also. Despite the upturn in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time. As the situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double {{the strength of the}} Militia as war clouds began to loom on the horizon, and late in the year a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and the nation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Germany and Europe <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>was</b> {{almost totally}} {{dependent}} {{on foreign oil}} imports. In an attempt to resolve the persistent shortage, in June 1942 Germany launched Fall Blau (Case Blue), an offensive against the Caucasian oilfields. The Red Army launched a counter-offensive on 19 November and encircled the Axis forces, who were trapped in Stalingrad on 23 November. Göring assured Hitler that the 6th Army could be supplied by air, but {{this turned out to}} be infeasible. Hitler's refusal to allow a retreat led to the deaths of 200,000 German and Romanian soldiers; of the 91,000 men who surrendered in the city on 31 January 1943, only 6,000 survivors returned to Germany after the war. Soviet forces continued to push the invaders westward after the failed German offensive at the Battle of Kursk and by the end of 1943 the Germans had lost most of their territorial gains in the east.|$|E
