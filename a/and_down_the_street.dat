5|$|During the 18th century, {{the street}} {{began to be}} popular with the bourgeoisie living around Mayfair. Shop owners let out their upper storeys for {{residential}} purposes, attracting lodgers such as Jonathan Swift, George Selwyn, William Pitt the Elder and Laurence Sterne. In 1784, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, an active socialite, demanded that people boycott Covent Garden as its residents had voted against Whig member of parliament Charles James Fox. This had caused him to lose his seat in parliament, leading to {{the dissolution of the}} Fox–North Coalition. She insisted people should look for nearer shopping streets, and encouraged people to go to Bond Street. Consequently, the street became a retail area for people living in Mayfair. By the end of the century, an upper-class social group known as the Bond Street Loungers had appeared, wearing expensive wigs and parading up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> in a pretentious manner.|$|E

25|$|Others would sashay up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> {{looking to}} hook half-drunk sailors, American GIs and other foreigners on R, {{for an hour}} of {{profitable}} intimacy. Not only would these clients get the thrill of sex with an exotic oriental, {{there would be the}} added spice of transgressing gender boundaries in a seamy hovel.|$|E
60|$|To a {{profound}} scholar like myself, {{the presence of}} these young women, many of them most attractive, flittering up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Oxford in their caps and gowns, is very distressing.|$|R

"They marched up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> waving flags {{with the}} World's University colors--ultra-marine and blue--and they {{certainly}} made a lively place of Floresville.

60|$|The townspeople {{themselves}} {{were in a}} panic, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> ran Filipinos <b>and</b> Chinese, some with their household effects piled high on their backs.

25|$|Scenes in Goodfellas were filmed on Alfred Lane, off Quaker Ridge Road <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from Albert Leonard Middle School.

Saturday evenings were spent with the cinema crowds in Leicester Square. He would go to bed at 12:30 am after saying a prayer. [...] "Quite a good prayer, unselfish too", he told the Sunday Times. [...] "It is a sort of {{acknowledgment}} of God, just in case there happens to be one." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe. The first was Olivia's {{discovery}} that Peter was sleeping with Fauxlivia and her reaction— going through all of her clothes in disgust; the second related to her comment to Peter that she couldn't [...] "believe that you didn't know it was me." [...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I love those scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your own bedroom , {{but when you get}} on set you have so many different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing this quiet scene where I have to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV teaches you -– to just go with it very quickly." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1959, Brown {{moved to}} Manhattan. “If you aspired toward {{becoming}} an artist {{you had to}} go to New York.” Brown spent the next few months “walking up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of <b>the</b> city, visiting every gallery” and “devouring” every art magazine or text about art he could find.|$|R

2500|$|At this, Karolina {{ran from}} the funeral parlor {{screaming}} [...] "My Elsie is dead. She was murdered, murdered." [...] Her husband and Det. Zelasky tried to calm her, but in her extreme distress she began running up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> drawing a crowd of curious onlookers. She insisted she had known for three weeks that the [...] "gypsies" [...] had killed Elsie. Frank consoled her and assisted her boarding a trolley car for home.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1985 interview, {{when asked}} what caused his change of opinion, Hynek responded, [...] "Two things, really. One was the {{completely}} negative and unyielding attitude of the Air Force. They wouldn't give UFOs the chance of existing, {{even if they were}} flying up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> in broad daylight. Everything had to have an explanation. I began to resent that, even though I basically felt the same way, because I still thought they weren't going about it in the right way. You can't assume that everything is black no matter what. Secondly, the caliber of the witnesses began to trouble me. Quite a few instances were reported by military pilots, for example, and I knew them to be fairly well-trained, so this is when I first began to think that, well, maybe there was something to all this." ...|$|E
