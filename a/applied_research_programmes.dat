It is also commonly, though informally, acknowledged that the technical, taxonomic literature of all organismal groups is littered with examples of inconsistent and incorrect identifications. This is due to a variety of factors, including taxonomists being insufficiently trained and skilled in making identifications (e.g., using different rules-of-thumb in recognizing the boundaries between similar groups), insufficiently detailed original group descriptions and/or illustrations, inadequate access to current monographs and well-curated collections and, of course, taxonomists having different opinions regarding group concepts. Peer review only weeds out the most obvious errors of commission or omission in this area, and then only when an author provides adequate representations (e.g., illustrations, recordings, and gene sequences) of the specimens in question.|$|E

40|$|CTA's newly-appointed Director Dr Rodney D Cooke, {{who is from}} Britain, took up {{his duties}} on a {{continuing}} basis in August. Two months earlier he had joined the Centre {{to participate in the}} 1995 annual Advisory Committee meeting and the subsequent CTA seminar on 'The Future Role of Information for Rural Development in ACP Countries' which was held in Montpellier, France. Here Spore provides some background information about Dr Cooke and his initial observations on the challenges now facing the Centre. CTA's new Director arrives at a critical juncture: various internal and external evaluations of CTA's activities have recently been completed and the Montpellier seminar has highlighted some of the expected trends in the next ten years concerning the role of information in rural development. Dr Cooke observed on his arrival in August that 'there are many opportunities and challenges which should enable CTA to further strengthen its services to ACP countries in support of their agriculture and rural development objectives. ' Dr Cooke is well-placed to address these challenges. Since obtaining a PhD in protein chemistry and enzymology from the University of Bristol, UK, he has gained twenty-two years of experience in different aspects of the renewable natural resources sector and rural development in the tropical world. Initially, he worked for the former Tropical Products Institute of the UK as a Project Leader and Programme Manager, where he was concerned with various applied and adaptive research and technical cooperation programmes concerning post-harvest technologies and agro-industrial development; he was also involved in long-term and short-term overseas assignments in Latin America, Africa and Asia. In consequence, his second language is Spanish. Dr Cooke has a knowledge of Portuguese. but with a Brazilian flavour, and is fluent in French {{partly as a result of}} his earlier involvement in European-based projects. These activities led him to work with national, regional and international centres, and in Africa this involved work in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Zambia and Sudan. From 1989 to 1992 Dr Cooke spent much of his time in the UK as a Deputy Director of Britain's Natural Resources Institute (NRI). A major preoccupation was the need to strengthen mid-term planning processes as that institute became the executive agency of the UK Government's Overseas Development Administration (ODA). Dr Cooke was also responsible for NRI's Finance and Central Services Division. From 1992 to 1995 he headed the Natural Resources Management Division, which covered the institute's technical cooperation and <b>applied</b> <b>research</b> <b>programmes</b> in resource assessment and farming systems: forestry, livestock production, agronomy and cropping systems, natural resources assessment methodologies (remote sensing and GIS approaches) and socio-economic aspects. One of his major responsibilities was to develop and strengthen the institute's partnerships with organizations in the developed and developing worlds. Dr Cooke has authored or coauthored over 60 scientific and technical publications. Key issues which Dr Cooke will be, considering with his staff in the coming months are the changing : characteristics and diversity of local, national and regional agricultural system organizations and their evolving requirements for information; the greater emphasis being placed on communication, i. e. two-way exchanges between organizations, beneficiaries and partners rather than the more usual picture of information flow in one direction; the broader need for information as an aid to decision-making, instead of information simply to advance knowledge and understanding; and the enhanced need for a technology 'foresight' role encompassing both the changing picture of ACP needs and also the rapid development of alternative technologies and products.

40|$|Rocky shores {{occur at}} the {{interface}} {{of the land and}} sea. Typically they are open ecosystems, with steep environmental gradients. Their accessibility to man has rendered them susceptible to a variety of impacts since prehistoric times. Access can be regulated, however, and they are more amenable to management than open ocean habitats. This review uses examples from throughout the world to demonstrate the extent to which rocky shores have been, and are currently, affected by pollution (examples used are endocrine disrupters, oil, eutrophication), over-collection of living resources, introduced alien species, modification of coastal processes (coastal defences, siltation) and global change (climate, sea level). These impacts are put into the context of natural fluctuations in time and variability in space of both the environment and the organisms. The relative magnitudes of some anthropogenic disturbances differ between the industrialized, developed world and the developing world. For example, in developed, industrialized countries pollution based impacts should diminish over the next 25 years due to improved regulation and a reduction in older 'dirtier' heavy industry. Conversely, in many developing countries pollution will increase as a consequence of growth in the human population and industrialization. Except for large-scale disasters such as oil spills, pollution tends mainly to influence embayed coastlines. Chronic effects such as eutrophication can have broader-scale impacts over whole coastlines and elevated nutrient levels have also been implicated in a trend of increasing frequency of catastrophic kills due to harmful algal. Direct removal of living resources has had major effects on coastlines at both local and regional scales and is likely to increase over the next 25 years, especially in developing countries where rapidly expanding human populations will put further pressure on resources. Impacts from recreational activities are likely to increase with greater leisure time in wealthier regions of the world, and cheaper travel will spread these impacts to poorer regions. Invasions by alien species have increased in frequency during the last 20 years leading to some dramatic effects on native assemblages. Problems associated with alien species, especially pathogens, will continue to increase over the next few decades. The proportion of the coastline modified by artificial structures (breakwaters, seawalls, groynes) will increase because of coastal development and defences against sea-level rise and the greater frequency of storms. This will increase connectivity between areas of rocky habitat. Siltation will continue to increase due to urbanization of catchments and estuaries, and changes in agricultural practice. This may have considerable impacts at local and regional scales, favouring sediment tolerant organisms such as turf algae and anemones. In the future, greater frequency of environmental extremes is likely, including large-scale events such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Global change in temperature, sea-level rise and increases in the frequency of storms will affect rocky shores throughout the world, but this will occur over long time scales; over the next 25 years most of the responses by rocky shore communities will mostly be quite subtle. Thus rocky shores will be subject to increasing degradation over the next 25 years. They are, however, less vulnerable than many other aquatic habitats due to their hard substratum (rock), their relative lack of large biogenic structures and to their generally open nature. They are also remarkably resilient, and rec Their susceptibility to both terrestrial and marine disturbances does make them more vulnerable than sublittoral and offshore habitats. There are considerable gaps in knowledge, particularly of certain microhabitats such as crevices, boulders, sand-scoured areas and rock pools. These have been much less studied than more accessible assemblages on open, freely draining rock. More research is needed to establish the effects of increasing sediment loads, ultraviolet radiation and introduced species on rocky shore communities. Strategic and <b>applied</b> <b>research</b> <b>programmes</b> should integrate field experiments and carefully selected monitoring programmes to verify management regimes. Hindcasting from the palaeo-record would be valuable, to compare rates of predicted change with periods when change was rapid in the past. This information could, in principle, be used to help conserve rocky shores through networks of marine protected areas and a general reduction of environmental pollution...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. Background: The UK lags behind many European countries in terms of cancer survival. Initiatives to address this disparity have focused on barriers to presentation, symptom recognition, and referral for specialist investigation. Selection of patients for further investigation has come under particular scrutiny, although preferences for referral thresholds in the UK population have not been studied. We investigated preferences for diagnostic testing for colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers in primary-care attendees. Methods: In a vignette-based study, researchers recruited individuals aged at least 40 years attending 26 general practices in three areas of England between Dec 6, 2011, and Aug 1, 2012. Participants completed up to three of 12 vignettes (four for each of lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers), which were randomly assigned. The vignettes outlined a set of symptoms, the risk that these symptoms might indicate cancer (1 %, 2 %, 5 %, or 10 %), the relevant testing process, probable treatment, possible alternative diagnoses, and prognosis if cancer were identified. Participants were asked whether they would opt for diagnostic testing {{on the basis of the}} information in the vignette. Findings: 3469 participants completed 6930 vignettes. 3052 individuals (88 %) opted for investigation in their first vignette. We recorded no strong evidence that participants were more likely to opt for investigation with a 1 % increase in risk of cancer (odds ratio [OR] 1 · 02, 95 % CI 0 · 99 - 1 · 06; p= 0 · 189), although the association between risk and opting for investigation was strong when colorectal cancer was analysed alone (1 · 08, 1 · 03 - 1 · 13; p= 0 · 0001). In multivariable analysis, age had an effect in all three cancer models: participants aged 60 - 69 years were significantly more likely to opt for investigation than were those aged 40 - 59 years, and those aged 70 years or older were less likely. Other variables associated with increased likelihood of opting for investigation were shorter travel times to testing centre (colorectal and lung cancers), a family history of cancer (colorectal and lung cancers), and higher household income (colorectal and pancreatic cancers). Interpretation: Participants in our sample expressed a clear preference for diagnostic testing at all risk levels, and individuals want to be tested at risk levels well below those stipulated by UK guidelines. This willingness should be considered during design of cancer pathways, particularly in primary care. The public engagement with our study should encourage general practitioners to involve patients in referral decision making.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Cancer Research UK/Nature Publishing Group via the DOI in this record. BACKGROUND: This {{prospective}} cohort study aimed to identify symptom and patient factors that influence time to lung cancer diagnosis and stage at diagnosis. METHODS: Data relating to symptoms were collected from patients upon referral with symptoms suspicious of lung cancer in two English regions; we also examined primary care and hospital records for diagnostic routes and diagnoses. Descriptive and regression analyses were used to investigate associations between symptoms and patient factors with diagnostic intervals and stage. RESULTS: Among 963 participants, 15. 9 % were diagnosed with primary lung cancer, 5. 9 % with other thoracic malignancies and 78. 2 % with non-malignant conditions. Only half the cohort had an isolated first symptom (475, 49. 3 %); synchronous first symptoms were common. Haemoptysis, reported by 21. 6 % of cases, was the only initial symptom associated with cancer. Diagnostic intervals were shorter for cancer than non-cancer diagnoses (91 vs 124 days, P= 0. 037) and for late-stage than early-stage cancer (106 vs 168 days, P= 0. 02). Chest/shoulder pain was the only first symptom with a shorter diagnostic interval for cancer compared with non-cancer diagnoses (P= 0. 003). CONCLUSIONS: Haemoptysis is the strongest symptom predictor of lung cancer but occurs in only a fifth of patients. Programmes for expediting earlier diagnosis need to focus on multiple symptoms and their evolution.
