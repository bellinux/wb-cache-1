40|$|Immune {{activation}} {{is central}} to many immune disorders. Clinical investigations have shown that immune activation can be quantified by measurements of soluble immune <b>activation</b> <b>products</b> in serum. Most in vitro studies of these immune <b>activation</b> <b>products</b> have focused on single products. In this study the specific cell sources and the major lymphokines inducing multiple <b>activation</b> <b>products</b> were investigated. In vitro addition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or IL- 2 stimulated {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} to produce neopterin, beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 -M) and soluble IL- 2 receptor (sIL- 2 R). These two lymphokines can act independently, because neutralizing antibodies to one of the lymphokines did not block the inducing activity of the other. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was also investigated and shown to be a less powerful inducer than IL- 2 or INF-gamma. Separated lymphoid subpopulations responded differently to specific lymphokines. Monocytes produced only neopterin and only in response to INF-gamma. T cells released beta 2 -M and sIL- 2 R in response to IL- 2. B cells, however, were capable of producing all three immune <b>activation</b> <b>products.</b> Neopterin production in B cells was induced by either INF-gamma of IL- 2, indicating that B cells have additional mechanisms for responding to lymphokines. To investigate whether these in vitro findings also occur in vivo, sera from patients who had received either rIL- 2 or INF-gamma treatment were tested. INF-gamma administration led to substantial increases in serum neopterin but only a moderate beta 2 -M increase and no increase in the serum sIL- 2 R levels. rIL- 2 administration caused a substantial increase of all three serum immune <b>activation</b> <b>products,</b> consistent with our in vitro findings. The results confirm that increased serum levels of soluble immune <b>activation</b> <b>products</b> are indicators of increased cytokine production by lymphocytes and monocytes and also that B cells can be a prominent source of immune <b>activation</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract The endothelial layer {{represents}} a continuous physical barrier that controls coagulation and allows selective passage of soluble molecules and circulating cells across the vessel wall into the tissue. The functional {{activity of the}} endothelial cells {{may be influenced by}} their interaction with components of the complement system. In this review we shall discuss the complex interplay that can be established between the endothelium and complement proteins or <b>activation</b> <b>products.</b> Endothelial cells may also secrete several complement components which contribute to the circulating pool. This process can be regulated by cytokines and other pro-inflammatory stimuli. In addition, complement <b>activation</b> <b>products</b> stimulate endothelial cells to acquire a pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant status. Expression of regulatory molecules on the cell surface provides protection against an undesired attack by complement <b>activation</b> <b>products.</b> Unrestricted complement <b>activation</b> under pathological conditions may lead to structural and functional changes of the endothelium resulting in vascular disease...|$|R

40|$|A list of fission <b>products</b> and <b>activation</b> <b>products</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} for possible adoption as an official table of relevant isotopes for CTBT use. It is our understanding {{that the purpose of}} this list is to discriminate Level 4 spectra from Level 5 spectra in the decision logic diagram. The current understanding is that a single short-lived, relevant isotope that is atypical for a station would cause a spectrum to be marked as Level 4. A second relevant isotope would cause a spectrum to be marked as Level 5, which would perhaps require a sample to undergo additional laboratory conflation measurements. The list consists of a very comprehensive set of fission <b>products</b> and <b>activation</b> <b>products.</b> We have examined the list for accuracy and have also flagged potential problems with members of the list. in our opinion, several of these isotopes have serious problems and many have no practical chance of ever being the first or second detected isotopes. We are not arguing whether or not these isotopes might be seen in a large atmospheric test. On the other hand, there may be no harm associated with having a long list. The issue of <b>activation</b> <b>products</b> is different. Some <b>activation</b> <b>products</b> are indicative of the soil or rock composition in the vicinity of an explosion. Others may only be dependent on materials in the weapon or in the support structures. We don't think that a great deal of analysis of these isotopes by the CTBTO should be encouraged. In any case, if particulate <b>activation</b> <b>products</b> are in the atmosphere, fission products should be even more prevalent, thus removing the need for an activation list component...|$|R

50|$|Fission {{products}} and actinides produced by neutron absorption of nuclear fuel itself are normally {{referred to by}} those specific names, and <b>activation</b> <b>product</b> reserved for products of neutron capture by other materials, such as structural components of the nuclear reactor or nuclear bomb, the reactor coolant, control rods or other neutron poisons, or materials in the environment.

50|$|Neutron {{activation}} is {{the process}} in which neutron radiation induces radioactivity in materials, and occurs when atomic nuclei capture free neutrons, becoming heavier and entering excited states.

Thus, the process of neutron capture, even after any intermediate decay, often results {{in the formation of}} an unstable <b>activation</b> <b>product.</b> Such radioactive nuclei can exhibit half-lives ranging from small fractions of a second to many years.|$|E

40|$|Properties and {{characteristics}} of fly ash- or slag-based geopolymers have been extensively explored but comparatively less information is available for natural pozzolan-based geopolymers. The present work focuses on microstructural characteristics of natural pozzolan-based geopolymers activated by sodium hydroxide and a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate. Synchrotron XRD and SEM-EDS studies combined with compressive strength tests successfully demonstrate the feasibility {{of the use of}} natural pozzolan for sustainable construction material. It is concluded that the geopolymers have sufficient strength as structural materials and matrices contain C-S-H like crystal as well as zeolites of hydroxysodalite and zeolite Y. Two zeolites of hydroxysodalite and zeolite Y are found as the main <b>activation</b> <b>products</b> in sodium hydroxide activation. Substitution with sodium silicate solution yields higher compressive strength and a denser microstructure with dominant <b>activation</b> <b>products</b> of C-S-H like crystal, zeolite Y, and phillipsite.
