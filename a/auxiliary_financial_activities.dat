40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{issues in the}} {{regulation}} {{of a range of}} non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), categorized as Other Financial Intermediaries (OFIs). OFIs refer to those financial corporations that are primarily engaged in financial intermediation—that is, corporations that channel funds from lenders to borrowers through their own account or in <b>auxiliary</b> <b>financial</b> <b>activities</b> that are closely related to financial intermediation—but are not classified as deposit takers (IMF 2004 a). 1 OFIs include insurance corporations; pension funds; securities dealers; investment funds; finance, leasing, and factoring companies; and asset management companies. This chapter discusses considerations in assessing the regulation and supervision of OFIs (other than insurance companies and security market intermediaries) generally, with a focus on specialized finance institutions, leasing and factoring companies, and pension funds. Although OFIs are often dwarfed by commercial banks in terms of volume of business and size of assets, OFIs should receive adequate attention during the assessment process for various reasons. OFIs play an important developmental role through their activity in areas and markets where the presence of commercial banks is not fully felt. Moreover, the development of OFIs could increase bank competition, which could lead to greater access to finance. In many countries, pension funds are major contractual savings institutions with a significant effect on financial markets and the macroeconomy. Specialized financial institutions (such as thrifts, building societies, and mortgage institutions) have emerged in many countries to carry out real estate finance. However, in many countries, other than their specialization in housing finance, those institutions ar...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{differentiate}} {{the effects of}} diversity decrease from the diminishing <b>financial</b> <b>activity,</b> we carried out {{a study on the}} comparison of the <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> trends of churners and non-churners. To this end, we aggregated overall <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> of each customer into monthly bins and applied a linear fitting to his/her monthly <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> levels (in terms of both number of transactions and spending amount). We then considered the slope of the fitted line as a feature for predicting the churning decision of each customer. The slope values for churners and non-churners are shown in Fig. S 8 of Additional file  8. Based on the prediction tests that we performed with a single-node Decision Tree classifier trained with <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> trends of the customers, we found out that the predictive performance of <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> trends in terms of expenditure amounts was similar to that of demographic features (0.52 AUROC score), and it was statistically significantly worse than the performance of STC behavioral features in general (t(7)= 28.02, p***< 0.001). The performance based on activity trends in terms of transaction counts was relatively better than the demographic features (0.65 AUROC score); however, it was also significantly worse than the performance of the STC behavioral features (t(7)= 13.73, p***< 0.001). From the results, we confirm that STC behavioral features capture the signal of customer’s churning behavior more precisely than a simple feature of inactivation trend of credit card usage.|$|R

40|$|The finance-growth nexus is discussed, and a {{framework}} for empirical analysis is formulated. Based on data for 93 countries from 1960 - 1990, a growth equation is estimated. It includes the standard regressors {{as well as a}} new proxy for <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> and interaction effects of the latter with catching-up, education, and physical capital accumulation. <b>Financial</b> <b>activity</b> generally has a positive impact on economic growth. Then, the countries are ranked with respect to their degree of corporatism, institutional quality, democracy, market orientation and characteristics of their financial systems. The sample is split according to these control variables. It is shown that the finance-growth nexus is indeed contingent on socio-economic factors. Specifically, the growth effect of a given level of <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> is higher in more law enforcing and more corporatist countries, whereas the results are inconclusive with respect to democracy, market orientation and <b>financial</b> structure. <b>Financial</b> <b>activity,</b> economic growth, cross-country regressions, institutional quality, market orientation,...|$|R

40|$|The initial {{provisions}} concerning CFC-legislation {{were introduced}} 1990 {{and has since}} been subject to several revisions and adaptations. The fundamental purpose of the CFC-legislation is to prohibit and prevent tax evasion undertaken by such companies that own other foreign companies where generated income is subject to low rates of taxation. The CFC-legislation aims to provide the Swedish government with an op-portunity to tax this income. This is important {{in order to prevent}} tax avoidance and preserve the integrity of the system of taxation within Sweden. In order for the CFC-legislation to be as effective as possible there must exist a clear way of defining which activity that is to be regulated within its scope. There are several types of income re-gulated within the scope of CFC-legislation. An extensive part of the market consists of such activity that can be labeled as <b>financial</b> <b>activity.</b> <b>Financial</b> income is an impor-tant part of corporate finance and as such demands a clear definition. The CFC-legislation contains several provisions pertaining to income that may not be ex-empted from CFC-taxation. Such income is mainly derived from <b>financial</b> <b>activity.</b> This <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> may be defined as pertaining to a bank or financial entity which operates in a professional and independent way. There is however a third category of <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> merely designated as “other financial activity”, according to the wording of the legislation. This gives rise {{to the question of what}} the definition of “other finan-cial activity” is and how it should be interpreted. This thesis aims to define what this abstract prerequisite for CFC-taxation of <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> means. This will be done with an emphasis on what constitutes an ordinary <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> according to Swe-dish Law and how this is to be seen in contrast to “other financial activity” The basic concepts of the definition of <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> many times mirrors the definition of “other financial activity”. A comparison and deeper analysis of different types of finan-cial activity is therefore required in order to provide a correct and clear answer...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on the geography of <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> in order to assess the role of financial centres. While there is widespread concern that rapid technological progess especially in communication and information technologies will ultimately lead to a delocalization of <b>financial</b> <b>activity,</b> the role of financial centres depends delicately on their success in generating local externalities. On the basis of empirical evidence on recent developments in world financial markets, it is argued that the ability of financial centres to attract <b>financial</b> <b>activity</b> in information sensitive securities will be crucial for their future role. To the extent that information is localized and market access is costly, financial centres perform an important role in aggregating local information. Therefore a reduction of global market access and information costs may increase global demand for local securities, and even strengthen the role of certain financial centres. Furthermore, complementarities between informationally sensitive and less sensitive <b>financial</b> <b>activities</b> may also attract footloose <b>activities</b> to <b>financial</b> centres. financial centres; information sensitivity; local information; market access costs; thick market externalities...|$|R
