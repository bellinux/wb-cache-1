50|$|The red-billed teal (<b>Anas</b> <b>erythrorhyncha)</b> is a dabbling duck {{which is}} an {{abundant}} resident breeder in southern and eastern Africa typically south of 10° S. This duck is not migratory, but will fly great distances to find suitable waters. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms large flocks.|$|E
40|$|Thirty-four {{species of}} {{gastrointestinal}} helminths {{were found in}} 25 Anas undulata, 21 <b>Anas</b> <b>erythrorhyncha,</b> ten Anas capensis and seven Anas smithii collected at Barberspan, South Africa. Excluding four new taxa, 11 new African records, and 14, 11, 12 and nine new host records were established for Anas undulata, <b>Anas</b> <b>erythrorhyncha,</b> Anas capensis and Anas smithii, respectively. The helminth community included 13 cosmopolitan species, seven species known only from the holarctic, one species known only from the south Pacific and 13 new or unidentified species {{that appear to be}} restricted to Africa. The infection levels of the common helminth species in the mainly carnivorous Anas capensis and Anas smithii, were generally much higher than those of species infecting Anas undulata or <b>Anas</b> <b>erythrorhyncha.</b> The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

40|$|Highly mobile {{species are}} {{difficult}} to monitor. It is often unclear from abundance estimates whether a population is genuinely declining or simply elsewhere. If the spatial and temporal scales of monitoring are inadequate, the data will only be useful if the signal is very strong (i. e. the change in population size is large). We explored the ability of three major databases – the Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP), the Coordinated Waterbird Counts (CWAC) and the South African Bird Ringing Unit (SAFRING) – to reveal the movement patterns of a highly mobile African waterbird, the Red-billed Teal <b>Anas</b> <b>erythrorhyncha.</b> Only ring recovery data provided clear evidence of long-distance movement. All three data sets were compromised to varying degrees by methodological biases and spatial and/or temporal resolutions that prevented the detection of movement patterns. By incorporating abundance estimates, increasing and quantifying sampling effort, and extending coverage at the data collection stage, the potential for these data sets to contribute {{to our understanding of}} bird movements could be greatly improved. Monitoring programmes for mobile species must be tested at an early stage to assess their ability to explain spatial and temporal population variation at the scales at which such variation occurs...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{widespread}} and {{increasing use of}} solar-powered satellite transmitters to tag wild birds, there are few published articles that detail how transmitters should be attached to different species and even fewer assessments of the overall field success of telemetry projects. The scarcity of this information {{makes it difficult to}} plan and budget for telemetry projects effectively. In this paper we present relevant information from a study involving a total of 47 individual ducks of two Afrotropical anatid species, Egyptian Goose Alopochen aegyptiaca and Red-billed Teal <b>Anas</b> <b>erythrorhyncha,</b> using solar-powered GPS satellite transmitters of two different sizes (30 g and 22 g respectively) at three very different southern African sites (Strandfontein wastewater treatment works in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, Barberspan Nature Reserve in the North West Province of South Africa, and Lake Manyame in north-central Zimbabwe). We present a full description of harness design and attachment and a survivorship analysis of the transmitters. Our results suggest that the 30 g units last longer than the 22 g units, with approximately 60 % and 30 % respectively of these PTTs lasting longer than a year; 45 % and 5 % respectively lasting longer than two years; and 20 % and 0 % respectively lasting longer than three years. We strongly encourage the publication of comparable data sets so that future studies that rely on telemetry data can be planned with a realistic set of assumptions and limitations in mind...|$|E
40|$|Aim: We present {{elements}} of a new conceptual framework for the unification of biogeography and movement ecology, and demonstrate {{the value of the}} new framework using a case study of two species of Afrotropical duck (Anatidae) across a latitudinal gradient. Location: Southern Africa. Methods: The first part of the paper rests on logic and philosophy. For the second (case study) section, we used data from up to 3 years of satellite telemetry for 26 individuals of two species of Afrotropical duck, the Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca) and red-billed teal (<b>Anas</b> <b>erythrorhyncha),</b> from three different populations with moulting sites spread across 17 degrees of latitude. We compared quantitative measures of movement patterns using principal components analysis and boxplots. Results: We argue that unpacking the concept of dispersal into the fundamental {{elements of}} movement (internal drivers, external drivers, navigation capacity, and motion capacity) provides a more solid basis for contrasting competing hypotheses in biogeographical studies. We found, surprisingly, that red-billed teal, a 'highly nomadic' species, moved with a relatively high degree of consistency at each of our three study latitudes, while Egyptian geese, a 'resident' species, showed latitude-dependent variation in their movements. However, much of the latitude-related variation for Egyptian geese was driven by their annual moult migrations, rather than directly by fluctuations in resource availability. Internal factors appear to dominate movements and probably determine the species ranges of both of our study species. Main conclusions: The integration of biogeography and movement ecology, through a more sophisticated view of mechanisms formerly lumped together under 'dispersal', offers a fertile area for further research. The biogeography of Afrotropical ducks appears to be strongly influenced by internal factors. Biogeographical patterns in this taxon may thus be best understood (and modelled) as a long-term response to environmental stochasticity, rather than as a deliberate selection of optimal habitat. Latitudinal comparisons emerge as a valuable way of gaining insights into the drivers of movement for widespread species...|$|E
40|$|Examination of the {{helminth}} {{communities in}} 25 yellow-billed ducks (Anas undulata), 21 red-billed ducks (<b>Anas</b> <b>erythrorhyncha),</b> ten Cape teal (Anas capensis) and seven Cape shovellers (Anas smithii) that had overwintered at Barberspan, revealed differences in community structure. Infracommunities in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks {{were characterized by}} low diversity and high eveness, and generally consisted of less than 100 helminths per duck. Similarity values (mean percent similarity and mean Jaccard's coefficients) were low. In contrast, infracommunities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers were more diverse, displayed low eveness values and consisted of far greater numbers of helminths. Mean similarity values for the infracommunities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers were much higher than those in yellow-billed or red-billed ducks. The component communities in all four duck hosts were species rich. Those in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks, however, consisted predominantly of satellite species and no core species were present, whereas those in Cape teal and Cape shoveller included several core species. Cape teal and Cape shovellers each had a group of recurrent species but {{there was not much}} of a tendency for species to co-occur in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks. Multivariate analysis revealed a greater similarity between the communities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers than between the latter and the communities in yellow- billed or red-billed ducks. Communities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers could be distinguished from each other by {{the presence or absence of}} particular cestode species. The communities in these two species could be distinguished from those in yellow-billed or red-billed ducks by a suite of cestode species that was absent in the latter two. Two recurrent groups, consisting of eight and two species, were identified in the compound community. Each group consisted of species found predominantly in Cape teal and Cape shovellers. Patterns seen in the helminth communities of the various hosts reflected differences in diet, but other factors, including feeding behaviour, spatial segregation and host specificity, may also have had an effect.

40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} and mechanisms governing animal movement {{is a fundamental}} goal in ecology. Processes driving movement can occur across multiple spatiotemporal scales and have important consequences for the structure and dynamics of populations, communities and ecosystems. The study of movement provides insights into the ecological resources and habitats necessary for persistence of species and communities. It also provides a theoretical and applied basis from which to formulate informed conservation plans. Waterbirds in semiarid southern Africa are an ideal study group for understanding interactions between movement and environmental factors because they exhibit {{a wide range of}} movement strategies and are located within a landscape in which resources are characterised by high levels of spatiotemporal variability. Emphasis has been placed on understanding movement phenomena from individually-tracked animals, but cases which consider this approach in conjunction with traditional community ecology perspectives are rare. In this thesis I explored questions of movement in both individuals and communities, and argue that an integrated multi-scale approach is necessary to advance our broader understanding of movement in waterbirds. In {{the first part of the}} study I addressed an individual-level movement perspective. I used fine-scale telemetry data from 35 individually tracked Egyptian Geese Alopochenaegyptiaca and Red-billed Teal <b>Anas</b> <b>erythrorhyncha</b> with novel analytical techniques to explore questions of trade-offs in habitat selection, functional responses and whether movement responses to landscape resources are reactive or prescient. My findings suggested that, at the home-range scale, both forage optimisation and predation risk were limiting factors of movement and habitat selection of Egyptian Geese. I also showed for the first time that waterbirds exhibit functional responses in relation to changes in the availability of habitat types. I subsequently showed that the proximate drivers of waterfowl movement are the dynamics of rainfall and primary productivity. Egyptian Geese and Red-billed Teal were able to perceive and respond to temporal shifts in resource conditions prior to habitat patch occupation. This in turn suggested that their movements in semi-arid landscapes are underpinned by an intimate knowledge of the local environment and that waterfowl exhibit a complex behavioural movement strategy. In the second part of the study I used waterbird count data collected from wetlands in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to address the community-level movement perspective...|$|E
