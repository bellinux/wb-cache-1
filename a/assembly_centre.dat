500|$|One of the {{potential}} candidates during the 2005 presidential election was Andrew Kuan, then running his own executive search firm, Blue Arrow International. He had been a grassroots leader in Pasir Ris and a PAP member, as well as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) and the Hyflux joint venture. Kuan was thrust into the media limelight after announcing his bid. While Kuan was financially sound, reports reflecting a range of reactions towards his bid surfaced. Whereas some saw him as [...] "conceited" [...] and [...] "arrogant", there were others who spoke of him warmly. This was followed by reports of him having been ousted from his position as chairman of his condominium's management committee in May 2001. Reports of Kuan's performance from his former employers also surfaced. JTC reported that Kuan had needed more [...] "handholding" [...] than was appropriate for a CFO and {{had been asked to}} resign thrice. Kwan asserted that his performance had been rated [...] "good" [...] for eight months and had received performance bonuses. Another former employer, Inderjit Singh, a PAP Member of Parliament and founder of United Test & <b>Assembly</b> <b>Centre,</b> said Kuan's performance as a consultant had been unsatisfactory. Kuan lodged a defamation suit against Singh, but eventually withdrew it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} main runway, then designated 06/24 {{and initially}} [...] in length, opened on 17 May 1937 when the airport {{was used as}} an RAF base and a military aircraft <b>assembly</b> <b>centre.</b> It was extended in stages from 1952, reaching its current length in 1981 to attract long-haul international traffic. As demand and aircraft movements both increased during the mid-1990s, mainly due to the newly completed Terminal 2, the airport studied the option of a second full-length runway. A consultation process began and planning permission was approved in 1997, with construction work starting the same year.|$|E

50|$|Lunghua Civil <b>Assembly</b> <b>Centre</b> was {{originally}} the Kiansu Middle School. It was located on Minghong Road {{about three miles}} (5 km) from Shanghai Longhua Airport. (Pre-WWII documents use the alternate spellings of Lunghua and Lunghwa; the modern anglicized spelling of the town is Longhua.) The school was damaged in the Second Sino-Japanese War and was empty until it was designated as a Civil <b>Assembly</b> <b>Centre.</b> It was then used from 1943 to intern 1,988 people.|$|E

50|$|In 1937 the Japanese army {{occupied}} the Chinese-administered districts of Shanghai. With {{the outbreak of}} the Pacific War in 1941, the foreign concessions were occupied, with European and American nationals eventually interned in 1943. In April 1943, Mathews and his wife, Violet, were interned in the Lunghua Civilian <b>Assembly</b> <b>Centre,</b> seven miles southwest of Shanghai.

The GDAC is hosted at the British Oceanographic Data Centre and a dedicated committee with international representation oversees it.|$|E
5000|$|Desgrange {{created a}} {{committee}} {{for physical education}} {{at the start of}} the first world war and trained several thousand soldiers to prepare them for the Front. Despite his age - he was already more than 50 - Desgrange then enrolled as a soldier himself. He presented himself at an <b>assembly</b> <b>centre</b> at Autan, distinctive for his grey hair and the Légion d'honneur pinned to his chest, and went to war as a poilu, an ordinary soldier. He won the Croix de guerre in combat and continued to write for L'Auto but under the name [...] "Desgrenier". Desgrenier is a play on words. Desgrange translates loosely as Barnes in English; the slight change turned his name into Lofts.|$|E
5000|$|The site of {{the camp}} is {{southwest}} of the Shanghai Botanical Garden. It is {{on the corner of}} Baise Road (百色路) and North Longchuan Road (龙川北路), currently the site of Shanghai High School. The Botanical Garden is southwest of Longhua Airport; both of these are clearly identified on satellite images. Satellite images show that there are buildings on the site in the [...] "same" [...] location as the Civil <b>Assembly</b> <b>Centre</b> buildings. The {{site of the}} camp is now enclosed by housing, but can be identified by the rectangular area (once Buildings A, B and C) and trees.

50|$|These 302 {{passengers}} were also European repatriates, mostly British, {{who had spent}} between three and four years in various Japanese concentration camps. They had been rescued from the Weihsien Civil <b>Assembly</b> <b>Centre</b> at what is now Weifang city, Shandong Province, on 17 August 1945 by 7 US paratroopers of the Duck Mission, only two days after VJ Day. In Hong Kong the {{passengers were}} {{handed over to the}} British forces, and repatriated to their home countries {{in the next few months}} by RAPWI. On this passage, when the Geneva had to skirt the outside of the Island of Taiwan, then Formosa, because the Formosa Straights had not yet been swept for mines, she struck an even worse typhoon on 9 October 1945, which virtually destroyed the US base at Okinawa. She had a destroyer escort ahead of her, but the 100 ft waves meant they only caught sight each other every five or ten minutes. By the grace of God both survived.|$|E
50|$|During the Second World War, {{a number}} of deep-level shelters were built beneath London tube {{stations}} {{for the protection of}} the public and military from German bombing. The shelter underneath Goodge Street tube station was completed in 1942 and has two above ground entrances, one on the north side of Chenies Street on the island between Chenies Street and North Crescent, and another nearby on the western side of Tottenham Court Road, next to the American International Church. There is also access from within Goodge Street tube station. The Goodge Street shelter was used by the US Army Signal Corps during the preparations for D-Day. After the war the shelter was used as an <b>assembly</b> <b>centre</b> for troops travelling to or from overseas bases. In 1956 a fire broke out in the shelter that required the attendance of twelve fire engines. Firemen tackled the blaze from each of the three entrances in teams of 30 using breathing apparatus. Seven were sent to hospital but no deaths were reported. Today the structure is used for archival storage.|$|E
50|$|It was {{not until}} the early Abbasid period that Tarsus, by then lying in ruins, was once more reoccupied and refortified, this time as an {{advanced}} strongpoint within the fortified zone of the al-ʿAwāṣim, stretching from Tarsus northeast to Malatya, and as an <b>assembly</b> <b>centre</b> for expeditions against the Byzantine Empire. The first attempt was undertaken by al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba al-Ta'i in 778/9, but it was apparently unsuccessful, and the city was not fully restored until 787/8, by Faraj ibn Sulaym on the orders of Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786-809). 3,000 Khurasanis and 2,000 Syrians (a thousand each from Antioch and al-Massisa) were given houses and land in the new fortress city. Tarsus was apparently recovered by the Byzantines soon after, at some point {{at the turn of the}} century. The city probably remained in Byzantine hands during the Abbasid civil war of the Fourth Fitna, but returned to Muslim control by 830, when Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813-833) recommenced offensive campaigns against Byzantium, using the city as a base.|$|E

30|$|For {{experiments}} that measure electrical resistance {{of a sample}} at room temperature, the ZrO 2 sleeve contains two MgO rods that squeeze a sample of thin needle-like dimensions at the <b>assembly’s</b> <b>centre.</b> Two copper ribbons are placed along {{the outside of the}} MgO rods to electrically connect the sample with the two opposite surfaces of the octahedral assembly and close the electrical path from the top {{to the bottom of the}} module trough the sample (Fig.  3 a). An ohmmeter measures the electrical resistance between the top and bottom of the module in situ during sample compression.|$|R
