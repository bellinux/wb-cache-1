40|$|The {{photochemistry}} of {{a molecular}} pentad {{composed of a}} central anthraquinone (AQ) acceptor flanked by two Ru(bpy) 32 + photosensitizers and two peripheral triarylamine (TAA) donors was investigated by transient IR and UV–vis spectroscopies {{in the presence of}} 0. 2 M p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) in deaerated acetonitrile. In ∼ 15 % of all excited pentad molecules, AQ is converted to its hydroquinone form (AQH 2) via reversible intramolecular electron transfer from the two TAA units (τ = 65 ps), followed by intermolecular proton transfer from TsOH (τ ≈ 3 ns for the first step). Although the light-driven <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> equivalents occurs through a sequence of electron and proton transfer steps, the resulting photoproduct decays via concerted PCET (τ = 4. 7 μs) with an H/D kinetic isotope effect of 1. 4 ± 0. 2. Moreover, the reoxidation of AQH 2 seems to take place via a double electron transfer step involving both TAA+ units rather than sequential single electron transfer events. Thus, the overall charge-recombination reaction seems to involve a concerted proton-coupled two-electron oxidation of AQH 2. The comparison of experimental data obtained in neat acetonitrile with data from acidic solutions suggests that the inverted driving-force effect can play a crucial role for obtaining long-lived photoproducts resulting from multiphoton, multielectron processes. Our pentad provides the first example <b>of</b> light-driven <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> equivalents stabilized by PCET in artificial molecular systems without sacrificial reagents. Our study provides fundamental insight into how light-driven multielectron redox chemistry, for example the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 or the oxidation of H 2 O, can potentially be performed without sacrificial reagents...|$|R

30|$|Recently, it {{has been}} proved that another factor {{affecting}} the sequence of metals is the reactants concentration [18]. The reason is not only due to the well-known dependence of chemical kinetics on concentration {{but also to the}} compartmentalization of the reaction media. The fact that reactants are trapped inside micelles causes the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> slower <b>reduction</b> reactants in the micelles, which favors the chemical reaction like a cage effect: if concentration <b>of</b> the slower <b>reduction</b> metal salt increases, chemical reduction will be faster, giving rise to a smaller difference between both reduction rates. As a consequence, nanoparticle structure is critically modified, because if both reductions are more simultaneous, a better mixed alloy is obtained.|$|R

The exact mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Here {{we report that}} axon-promoting factors elicited a retrograde transport-dependent removal of proteasomes from nascent axon terminals, thereby increasing protein stability at axon tips. Such an effect occurred through phosphorylation of a dynein-interacting proteasome adaptor protein Ecm 29. During the transition from immature neurites to nascent axons in cultured hippocampal neurons, live-cell imaging revealed a significant increase of the retrograde axonal transport of fluorescently labeled 20 S proteasomes. This retrograde proteasome transport depended on neuron stage and increased with axon lengths. Blockade of retrograde transport caused <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> proteasomes, <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> axon growth, and attenuation of growth-associated Par 6 at the axon tip of newly polarized neurons.

Moreover, naringin significantly reduced the diabetes-induced chromosomal instability in somatic and germinal cells in a dose-dependent manner.

One of the main systems to protect cells from the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> damaged proteins is the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In the present study, we aimed {{to find out whether}} exposure of alveolar epithelial cells to CS induces an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response by <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> damaged proteins that are inefficiently degraded by the proteasomes. The hypothesis was tested in a human alveolar epithelial cell line (A 549) exposed to gas-phase CS. Exposure to gas-phase CS for 5 min caused an increase in the amount of ubiquitin-protein conjugates within 4 h. Cigarette smoke exposure also induced the ER stress response marker eIF 2 alpha, followed by a significant <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> nascent protein synthesis and increase in the level of free intracellular amino acids. Moreover, CS exposure significantly reduced all three proteasomal activities (caspase-, trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like activity) within 4 h, which was still present after 24 h. It can be concluded that gas-phase CS induces ER stress in A 549 alveolar epithelial cells, leading to inadequate protein turnover caused by an <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> damaged proteins, <b>reduction</b> in nascent protein synthesis and inhibition of the proteasome.

Drosha RNase III catalyzes the first excision event, the release in the nucleus [11 – 13] of a hairpin RNA (pre-miRNA), which is followed by export of the pre-miRNA to the cytoplasm [14 – 16] and further processing by Dicer to mature miRNAs [17 – 22].

40|$|Asian grapevine rust (Phakopsora euvitis) is {{a serious}} disease, which causes severe leaf {{necrosis}} and early plant defoliation. These symptoms are unusual for a strict biotrophic pathogen. This work was performed to quantify the effects of P. euvitis on photosynthesis, carbohydrates, and biomass <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> grapevine. The <b>reduction</b> in photosynthetic efficiency of the green leaf tissue surrounding the lesions was quantified using the virtual lesion concept (β parameter). Gas exchange and responses of CO 2 assimilation to increasing intercellular CO 2 concentration were analyzed. Histopathological analyses and quantification of starch were also performed on diseased leaves. Biomass and carbohydrate accumulation were quantified in different organs of diseased and healthy plants. Rust reduced the photosynthetic rate, and β was estimated at 5. 78, indicating a large virtual lesion. Mesophyll conductance, maximum rubisco carboxylation rate, and regeneration of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate dependent on electron transport rate were reduced, causing diffusive and biochemical limitations to photosynthesis. Hypertrophy, chloroplast degeneration of mesophyll cells, and starch accumulation in cells close to lesions were observed. Root carbohydrate concentration was reduced, even at low rust severity. Asian grapevine rust dramatically reduced photosynthesis and altered the dynamics <b>of</b> production and <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> carbohydrates, unlike strict biotrophic pathogens. The reduction in carbohydrate reserves in roots would support polyetic damage on grapevine, caused by a polycyclic disease...|$|R
40|$|Hydroponically-grown {{seedlings}} {{of thirteen}} commercial tomato cultivars and breeding lines {{were exposed to}} 0 (control) and 200 mM NaCl (salt stress) for ten days. Salt tolerance was evaluated based on visual appearance of plant damage and the plants were assigned the scale from 1 (most tolerant) to 4 (most sensitive). The salinity scales ranged from 1. 00 - 3. 75. All genotypes responded to salt by an <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> Na +, <b>reduction</b> in K +, Ca 2 +, N and shoot/root dried weight and a small increase in P. Salinity tolerance scales, ion concentration and shoot/root dried weight differed greatly among tomato genotypes. Highest correlation was found between salinity tolerance scale classes and the reduction in root dried weight, followed by the reduction in shoot dried weight, Na + concentration, Ca 2 + /Na + and K + /Na + ratios. The amount of N and P content did not correlate with salinity scale classes. In general, Na + concentration and the reduction in root/shoot dried weight were the most reliable parameters useful for screening salt tolerance of tomato at the vegetative stage...|$|R

40|$|Collagen-based {{biomaterials}} {{have found}} various {{applications in the}} biomedical field. However, collagen-based biomaterials may induce cytotoxic effects. This study evaluated possible cytotoxic effects of (crosslinked) dermal sheep collagen (DSC) using a 7 -d-methylcellulose cell culture with human skin fibroblasts. Noncrosslinked DSC (NDSC), hexamethylene-diisocyanate-crosslinked DSC (HDSC), and glutaraldehyde-crosslinked DSC (GDSC), their extracts (1 x 10 d to 4 x 10 d extracts), or the corresponding extracted DSC samples were tested. Cell growth was evaluated by cell counting, while cell morphology was assessed by light microscopy and transmission-electron microscopy. Both GDSC and, to a lesser extent, HDSC, induced cytotoxicity, observed as inhibited cell growth and deviant cell morphology. The deviant morphology consisted <b>of</b> extensive <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> lipid, <b>reduction</b> in the amount and dilatation of rough endoplasmatic reticulum, increased inclusions of cell remnants, and relatively rounded cell membranes. With HDSC, both primary cytotoxicity, due to extractable products from the material, and secondary cytotoxicity, possibly due to a release of cytotoxic products resulting from enzymatic cell-biomaterial interactions, could be discriminated. With GDSC, however, no clear distinction between primary and secondary cytotoxicity could be made. With NDSC, only primary cytotoxicity, measured as low inhibition of cell proliferation, but without deviant morphology, was observed. These remarkable differences in cytotoxicity are discussed in relation to residual agents and specific crosslinks present in DSCs {{as a consequence of}} processing and the crosslinking agents used. The residual agents and the specific crosslinks give rise to differences in direct release of products and in sensitivity to hydrolysis and enzymatic breakdown...|$|R
40|$|Cell wall {{anchored}} virulence {{factors are}} critical for infection and colonization of the host by Gram-positive bacteria. Such proteins have an N-terminal leader sequence and a C-terminal sorting signal, composed of an LPXTG motif, a hydrophobic stretch, and a few positively charged amino acids. The sorting signal halts translocation across the membrane, allowing sortase to cleave the LPXTG motif, leading to surface anchoring. Deletion of sortase prevents the anchoring of virulence factors to the wall; the effects on bacterial physiology however, have not been thoroughly characterized. Here we show that deletion of Streptococcus pyogenes sortase A leads to <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> sorting intermediates, particularly at the septum, altering cellular morphology and physiology, and compromising membrane integrity. Such cells are highly sensitive to cathelicidin, and are rapidly killed in blood and plasma. These phenomena are not a loss-of-function effect caused {{by the absence of}} anchored surface proteins, but specifically result from the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> sorting intermediates. <b>Reduction</b> in the level of sorting intermediates leads to a return of the sortase mutant to normal morphology, while expression of M protein with an altered LPXTG motif in wild type cells leads to toxicity in the host environment, similar to that observed in the sortase mutant. These unanticipated effects suggest that inhibition of sortase by small-molecule inhibitors could similarly lead to the rapid elimination of pathogens from an infected host, making such inhibitors much better anti-bacterial agents than previously believed...|$|R
40|$|The binding of [3 H]-nitrendipine to intact, {{electrically}} driven isolated left atria of guinea-pigs {{was investigated}} over the concentration range 10 (- 10) M to 3 X 10 (- 5) M. A high affinity binding site saturable in the nM range {{as found in}} ventricular homogenates could not be detected. Instead the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> nitrendipine in intact atria {{was found to be}} proportional to the concentration from 10 (- 10) M to 10 (- 6) M; beyond 10 (- 6) M the binding started to become saturated. Nitrendipine was highly accumulated in atrial tissue. The cell:medium ratios amounted to about 120 in the range from 10 (- 10) M to 10 (- 6) M. The concentration-response curve for the negative inotropic action of nitrendipine yielded an ED 50 of 3 X 10 (- 7) M, thus lying within the range <b>of</b> concentration-proportional <b>accumulation.</b> The <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the contractile force proceeded faster (t 1 / 2 less than 10 min) than the uptake process t 1 / 2 approximately 40 min) suggesting that it is the binding of nitrendipine into a superficial compartment, which interferes with the excitation-contraction coupling. The results suggest that the high concentration of nitrendipine present in hydrophobic cellular compartments such as the plasmalemma might be involved in its pharmacological action...|$|R

Plants (three months old) were grown in aerated nutrient solutions under greenhouse conditions. <b>Reduction</b> <b>of</b> nitrate was estimated {{both in the}} leaves and in the roots by: (a) <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> nitrite in vitro, (b) <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> nitrite in vivo and (c) disappearance of nitrate in vivo.

Lowering root temperature had no marked effect {{on the distribution of}} nitrate reductase activity in the plant; increasing nitrate concentration in the shoot, however, markedly increased leaf nitrate reduction. The relatively low level of nitrate reductase in leaves appears to be caused mainly by a limitation of nitrate transport from root to shoot.
