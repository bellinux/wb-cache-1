5|$|Thinly populated, {{far from}} the colonial capital of Rio de Janeiro (which {{exercised}} little actual control), Rio Grande do Sul was often the target of invasions from its neighboring Hispanic-American colony, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (later Argentina). Because the captaincy had to be self-sufficient, the inhabitants of Rio Grande do Sul led lives as merchants, farmers or ranchers, while often also serving as soldiers or militiamen. Owners of large landholdings such as Marques de Sousa's father and grandfather provided food, equipment and protection for themselves and families living in areas under their control. Their private defense forces consisted primarily of laborers who were drafted as soldiers.

40|$|Cepheus E is {{the site}} of an {{exceptional}} example of a protostellar outflow with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>young</b> dynamical <b>age</b> and extremely high near infrared luminosity. We combine molecular spectroscopic data from the submillimeter to the near infrared in order to interpret the rotational excitation of CO and the ro-vibrational excitation of H 2. We conclude that C-type shocks with a paraboloidal bow shock geometry can simultaneously explain all the molecular excitations. Extinction accounts for the deviation of the column densities from local thermodynamic equilibrium. A difference in the extinction between the red and blue-shifted outflow lobes may account for the measured flux difference. The outflow is deeply embedded in a clump of density 10 ^ 5 cm^- 3, yet a good fraction of atomic hydrogen, about 40...|$|R
