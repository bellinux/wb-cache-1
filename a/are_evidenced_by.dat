5|$|The {{earliest}} {{signs of}} human activity in Leigh <b>are</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> a Neolithic stone axe found in Pennington and a bronze spearhead from south of Gas Street. A single Roman coin was found at Butts in Bedford. After the Roman departure from Britain, and {{into the history of}} Anglo-Saxon England, nothing was written about Leigh. However evidence for the presence of Saxons in what was a sparsely populated and isolated part of the country is provided by local township place names that incorporate the Old English suffix leah, such as Leigh, Tyldesley, Shakerley and Astley.|$|E

500|$|Modern {{scholarly}} {{theories of}} the Magyars' pagan religious beliefs and practices are primarily based on reports by biased medieval authors and prohibitions enacted during the reigns of Christian kings. Both Christian and Muslim sources say the Magyars worshipped forces of nature. They gave offering to trees, fountains, and stones, and made sacrifices at wells; these <b>are</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the prohibition of such practices {{during the reign of}} Ladislaus I of Hungary in the late [...] In accordance with the custom of the peoples of the Eurasian steppes, the pagan Magyars swore oaths on dogs, which were bisected to warn potential oathbrakers of their fate. Simon of Kéza also wrote about the sacrifice of horses. According to the Gesta Hungarorum, the seven Magyar chiefs confirmed their treaty [...] "in pagan manner with their own blood spilled in a single vessel".|$|E

Jacob Svetoslav's continuing ties to his Russian homeland <b>are</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> his request to the Bulgarian patriarch. Jacob requested the making of a copy of the Nomocanon which was then sent to Cyril III, the Metropolitan of Kiev. It was supplemented by a letter from Jacob in which the noble calls the metropolitan [...] "the bishop of the entire Russian land... of my ancestors". The copy finishes with a passage in which Jacob is called a [...] "Bulgarian despot". He also minted his own coins bearing the imperfect images of Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki or Jacob himself, dressed as a warrior wearing a helmet and holding a sword.|$|E

[...] As the years passed, his style evolved, becoming looser and more interpretive, moving from realistic to expressionist exuberance. [...] His mosaics and watercolors convey {{his passion for}} light and color, and his sculptures provide excellent examples of captured and arrested motion…His interest in politics, philosophy, and religion <b>are</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> themes and motifs that are represented and repeated in a multiplicity of genres and mediums.” ...|$|E

[...] Among the improvements cited and proposed were increasing the broadcast power of WJZ and KDKA to 50,000 watts each, adding new stations to the group such as WEAN, WICC and WEBR, adding a Pacific Coast network (with KGO, KECA, KFSD, KEX, KJR and KGA) and expanding the daytime power of such stations as KOIL, KWK and KSO. [...] This ad campaign, in a booklet tipped into the book, also showed a lengthy list of sponsors that had purchased Blue Network time.

2500|$|While little {{recorded}} information exists for this period, Viking interments are dated to the High Middle Ages. [...] By royal decree, detailed church records {{began to be}} kept by the latter 17th century {{in the form of}} births, deaths, baptisms and annual household censuses. [...] For the entire Hulterstad district, these archives were prepared and maintained at the Hulterstad Church. [...] These records form a basis of estimating the population and lifespans of Alby residents {{at the end of the}} 17th century, since the records of Alby were kept distinct from other villages within the Hulterstad district. [...] The late 17th century village population has been estimated at 35 to 60 individuals with life expectancy approximately 45 years. [...] The oldest surviving buildings in Alby date to the 16th century; ironically they are Malmhouses, homes created for housing the poor and landless; in fact, these homes were built to very high standards of that early era and consist of heavy timber construction and interior fireplaces. [...] The social and cultural values of early Swedes <b>are</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the willingness of the landed citizens to fund quality housing for the poorer members of the community as early as the 16th century; moreover, this is an early proof of the industriousness of the poor to build substantial housing on land they did not own.|$|E
