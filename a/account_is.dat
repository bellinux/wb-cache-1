5|$|According to Theissen and Merz, it {{is common}} for {{extraordinary}} charismatic leaders, such as Jesus, to come into conflict with their ordinary families.

After Jesus' death, many members of his family joined the Christian movement. Jesus' brother James became a leader of the Jerusalem Church.|$|E
