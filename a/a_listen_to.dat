500|$|The band {{began working}} on the track in 2011, with vocalist and guitarist Win Butler noting, [...] "We {{recorded}} {{a little bit in}} Louisiana with the Haitian percussionists [...] and we kind of lived with that. It's an incredibly long process." [...] Regular Arcade Fire collaborators Owen Pallett and Colin Stetson provided instrumental parts, alongside English musician David Bowie who provided vocals for the song. Regarding Bowie's guest appearance on the track, multi-instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry noted, [...] "It was just after The Next Day had come out. He basically just came by the studio in New York while we were mixing, just to have <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the stuff we were doing. He offered to lend us his services because he really liked the song. In fact, he basically threatened us – he was like, 'If you don't hurry up and mix this song, I might just steal it from you!' So we thought, well why don't we go one better, why don't you sing on our version? Thankfully he obliged, and we were really happy about that." ...|$|E

In May 2016 Braithwaite recalled [...] "I rang Simon Hussey, who was producing Rise, and said, 'Simon, you've gotta listen to this. I'll {{bring it in}} tomorrow and I reckon we could do a version in the vein of 'As the Days Go By' from the first album, Edge. Anyway, I brought it in and they had <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> it." [...] He acknowledged that [...] "you have to give credit to , who then took [...] version {{and turned it into}} more accessible pop, maybe. There's no doubt: I love it. I will fight for it, I will stick up for it. I know {{at the end of the}} day it's not mine." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film's title {{refers to}} one of the trucks, which has the name [...] "Sorcerer" [...] painted across the hood (the other is named [...] "Lazaro"); there is no supernatural or magical {{character}} or event. As director William Friedkin went location scouting in Ecuador and researched the peculiar ornaments on cargo trucks he had seen there, he noticed there were names painted on them, which ranged from relatives to mythological references. First the director came up with the name Lazaro after Lazarus. Then after some time struggling to think on another moniker, <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the Miles Davis album Sorcerer served as an inspiration to name the other truck, though the word was painted in French: [...] "Sorcier". Friedkin then decided to change his working title Ballbreaker for Sorcerer, which he described as [...] "an intentional but ill-advised reference to The Exorcist".|$|E

5000|$|At {{that point}} in time we were still on Jonathan King's label, but struggling.

I said come and have <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> what we've done, come and have <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> this track. And they came up and they freaked, and they said, [...] "This is a masterpiece. How much money, what do you want? What sort of a contract do you want? We'll do anything, we'll sign it." [...] On the strength of that one song, we did a five-year deal with them for five albums and they paid us a serious amount of money.|$|E

5000|$|For Primortal {{the band}} worked with {{producer}} Sterling Winfield (Pantera, Mercyful Fate).

5000|$|The song, alike {{the album}} itself, {{received}} very positive reviews, with SPIN noting that:It On" [...] takes a more raw, experimental approach to songwriting, and offers fans <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> a first: Cave {{as a primary}} guitarist.

5000|$|According to Stewart, at {{the time}} of {{recording}} The Original Soundtrack the band was already being courted by Mercury Records (part of the Phonogram group) to leave Jonathan King's small UK Records label, where they were struggling financially. He said: [...] "I rang them. I said come and have <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> what we've done, come and have <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> this track. And they came up and they freaked, and they said, 'This is a masterpiece. How much money, what do you want? What sort of a contract do you want? We'll do anything.' On the strength of that one song, we did a five-year deal with them for five albums and they paid us a serious amount of money." [...] Despite impressing their new label with the track, Phonogram felt that it was not suitable for release as a single due to its length, and released [...] "Life Is a Minestrone" [...] as the first single from The Original Soundtrack instead. However, many influential figures in the music industry were demanding that [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] be released as a single, and Mercury eventually bowed to the pressure and released it as the second single from the album. The band were forced to edit the track down to four minutes for radio play, but once it charted, pressure from the public and the media caused the radio stations to revert to playing the full version.|$|E
