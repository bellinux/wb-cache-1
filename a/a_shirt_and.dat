5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, knitted <b>a</b> <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E

The club also holds arrangements with various other partners, such as Marston's Pedigree and BBC London 94.9.|$|E
25|$|He {{instituted a}} series of {{socio-economic}} reforms that produced mixed results. Though he was a Jamaican from an elite family, Manley's successful trade union background helped him to maintain {{a close relationship with}} the country's poor majority, and he was a dynamic, popular leader. Unlike his father, who had a reputation for being formal and businesslike, the younger Manley moved easily among people of all strata and made Parliament accessible to the people by abolishing the requirement for men to wear jackets and ties to its sittings. In this regard he started a fashion revolution, often preferring the Kariba suit, a type of formal bush or safari jacket with trousers and worn without <b>a</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> tie.|$|E

25|$|Between 1947 and 1979, a major uniform change {{took place}} for Victorian Police officers. The bobby helmet was {{replaced}} by a black cloth peak cap, a silver police badge was introduced along with white shirts and ties for the general police officers. In 1963, a white pith helmet with a puggaree hatband and a hand-held radio were added to the Victoria Police general duties officers. Along with a new uniform, Victoria Police also introduced the first uniform for women. The uniform for females featured a knee-length skirt, a button-up jacket, <b>a</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> tie, tights, and peak hats made to fit a lady's hairstyle. Starting with 1972 until 1986, female police officers also carried handbags custom-made to hold batons and firearms.|$|E
25|$|His costume was {{unveiled}} on July 27, 2005. He generally wears either a dark brown (with blue pinstripes) or a blue (with rust red pinstripes) four-buttoned suit, <b>a</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> a tie, a light brown faux-suede overcoat (which he claims {{was given to}} him by Janis Joplin), and different coloured pairs of Converse All-Star sneakers, depending on his suit. According to an interview on Parkinson, David Tennant and Russell T Davies got the idea for the Tenth Doctor's costume from an outfit Jamie Oliver had worn on Parkinson just after Tennant had taken the role. David Tennant has commented that he would vary the combination of the buttons he fastened on his jacket in different episodes. Tennant thought the look was very geek chic.|$|E
25|$|There is a sixth form at Kennet for {{students}} who wish {{to continue their education}} after the age of 16.

There is also a section of the library provided for sixth form use only. There is no set uniform; instead a dress code is set. Boys must wear <b>a</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> tie, and girls must dress in smart office wear. The European Computer Driving Licence qualification can be studied with any sixth form course. Some sixth formers are appointed house captains after an application and selection process by the heads of houses.

25|$|On January 1, 1985, {{another victim}} was found near Jellico, Tennessee, in Campbell County on interstate 75. Although her murder {{occurred}} three days before, presumably on December 30, 1984, {{she was already}} in an advanced state of decomposition. Like the others, she was white and had short red hair, which was somewhat curly. She was likely {{between the ages of}} 17 and 25, although she may have been as old as 30 at the time she was murdered. The victim was found clothed, with a tan pullover, <b>a</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> jeans. The Jane Doe had green or hazel eyes, which could not be positively confirmed as a certain color because of the state of her body. The young woman also had freckles, various scars and burn marks on her body and was two and a half to five months pregnant when murdered by an undisclosed method. She had no evidence of dental work, except for a partial denture holding two false teeth on her upper jaw.|$|E
25|$|Several {{scenes are}} also {{omitted from the}} director's cut, {{including}} one where the knights sit around a camp fire asking about their intended Sarmatian life, in which Bors reveals that his children do not even have names, most simply have numbers. In addition, a sex scene between Guinevere and Arthur is shifted to be chronologically before he is informed of the incoming Saxons towards Hadrian's Wall. This seemingly minor change arguably helps the story flow more smoothly. In the original film he is seen in full battle armour, contemplating a broken image of Pelagius on his floor, and then is disturbed by a call to come outside. When he comes outside, he is hastily putting on <b>a</b> <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> his hair is disheveled. In the Director's Cut, after an intimate moment between Arthur and Guinevere explaining Arthur's morals, they carry on into their sexual encounter, and are thus disturbed so that Arthur can be briefed on the Saxons. During the sexual encounter, he is wearing the same outfit he wears during the briefing. The scene where he is examining Pelagius's image is removed.|$|E

500|$|Tessie Reynolds (c. 1877 [...] 1955) was a British cyclist from Brighton who set an 1893 {{record for}} cycling from Brighton to London {{and back in}} 8 hours 30 minutes. She was aged sixteen {{at the time and}} dressed in [...] "rational" [...] clothing: pantaloons, <b>a</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> coat. The outfit, which was likely made for her by her sister, led to {{significant}} publicity and her ride came to be regarded as a milestone for women's rights. The record was broken in 1894 and Reynolds went on to be a London traffic safety officer.|$|E
500|$|Activision {{created a}} series of {{television}} advertisements directed by Brett Ratner based on the famous scene from Risky Business where Tom Cruise dances to Bob Seger's [...] "Old Time Rock and Roll" [...] in <b>a</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> underwear, each featuring {{a different set of}} celebrities lip synching to the lyrics while using the new instrument controllers. [...] The first ad included athletes Kobe Bryant, Tony Hawk, Alex Rodriguez, and Michael Phelps. Another ad spot featured model Heidi Klum; two versions of Klum's ad exist, one a [...] "director's cut" [...] where she is wearing less clothing. A subsequent commercial featuring model Marisa Miller was banned from airing as too racy.|$|E
500|$|Women's {{clothes at}} the time {{included}} long dresses and tight corsets, impractical for cycling; so Reynolds instead wore a [...] "rational" [...] outfit of pantaloons [...] "cropped and cinched below the knee", with <b>a</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> long coat. It {{is likely that the}} outfit was made specifically for Reynolds by her sister, Ada, who was a dress maker. The outfit caused outrage, with suggestions that it was inappropriately masculine and that she was cycling in her knickerbockers. The publicity traveled as far as America, and the outfit was promoted by proponents of Victorian dress reform, as Reynolds clearly intended. She was active in promoting dress reform five years prior to the foundation of the local cycling dress reform club and continued to wear the outfit regularly.|$|E

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Robert Blackman {{created the}} costume for Arturis, who {{noted that the}} character was [...] "diabolical" [...] but didn't {{want this to be}} given away through the costume immediately. In order to make him look [...] "curious and affable", he placed the character in <b>a</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> pair of trousers. Where the script called for him to be shot by weapons fire, a burn on the shirt was created by key costumer Kimberley Shull using the hair color product Streaks and Tips. It was initially darker than intended, but the residue cleaned off to the desired level. Prop creator Alan Sims created Arturis' pistol weapon, intending for it to be held horizontally to give it a more alien appearance. It was made from two molds of a generic pistol weapon created for The Next Generation.|$|E

Much like the song, the two singers take turns performing their verses while standing in dark-coloured rooms. Ace Hood appears without <b>a</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> stands next to Sarkodie while visual of female dancers performing choreography are randomly displayed.
