2500|$|There {{are three}} {{sites on the}} {{ribosome}} for tRNA binding. [...] These are the aminoacyl/acceptor site (abbreviated A), the peptidyl site (abbreviated P), and the exit site (abbreviated E). [...] The P-site holds the tRNA connected to the polypeptide chain being synthesized, and the <b>A-site</b> is the binding site for a charged tRNA with an anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon associated with the site. [...] After binding of a charged tRNA to the <b>A-site,</b> a peptide bond is formed between the growing polypeptide chain on the P-site tRNA and the amino acid of the <b>A-site</b> tRNA, and the entire polypeptide is transferred from the P-site tRNA to the <b>A-site</b> tRNA. [...] Then, in a process catalyzed by the prokaryotic elongation factor EF-G (historically known as translocase), the coordinated translocation of the tRNAs and mRNA occurs, with the P-site tRNA moving to the E-site, where it dissociates from the ribosome, and the <b>A-site</b> tRNA moves {{to take its place}} in the P-site.|$|E
2500|$|EF-Tu {{contributes}} to translational accuracy in three ways. [...] In translation, a fundamental {{problem is that}} near-cognate anticodons have similar binding affinity to a codon as cognate anticodons, such that anticodon-codon binding in the ribosome alone {{is not sufficient to}} maintain high translational fidelity. [...] This is addressed by the ribosome not activating the GTPase activity of EF-Tu if the tRNA in the ribosome's <b>A-site</b> does not match the mRNA codon, thus preferentially increasing the likelihood for the incorrect tRNA to leave the ribosome. [...] Additionally, regardless of tRNA matching, EF-Tu also induces a delay after freeing itself from the aa-tRNA, before the aa-tRNA fully enters the <b>A-site</b> (a process called accommodation). [...] This delay period is a second opportunity for incorrectly charged aa-tRNAs {{to move out of the}} <b>A-site</b> before the incorrect amino acid is irreversibly added to the polypeptide chain. [...] A third mechanism is the less well understood function of EF-Tu to crudely check aa-tRNA associations and reject complexes where the amino acid is not bound to the correct tRNA coding for it.|$|E

2500|$|EF-Tu {{participates in}} the {{polypeptide}} elongation process of protein synthesis.

[...] Outside of the ribosome, EF-Tu complexed with GTP (EF-Tu • GTP) complexes with aa-tRNA to form a stable EF-Tu • GTP • aa-tRNA ternary complex. [...] EF-Tu • GTP binds all correctly-charged aa-tRNAs with approximately identical affinity, except those charged with initiation residues and selenocysteine.

2500|$|Once {{translation}} initiation is complete, {{the first}} aminoacyl tRNA {{is located in}} the P/P site, ready for the elongation cycle described below. [...] During translation elongation, tRNA first binds to the ribosome as part of a complex with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) or its eukaryotic (eEF-1) or archaeal counterpart. [...] This initial tRNA binding site is called the A/T site. [...] In the A/T site, the <b>A-site</b> half resides in the small ribosomal subunit where the mRNA decoding site is located. [...] The mRNA decoding site is where the mRNA codon is read out during translation. [...] The T-site half resides mainly on the large ribosomal subunit where EF-Tu or eEF-1 interacts with the ribosome. [...] Once mRNA decoding is complete, the aminoacyl-tRNA is bound in the A/A site and is ready for the next peptide bond to be formed to its attached amino acid. [...] The peptidyl-tRNA, which transfers the growing polypeptide to the aminoacyl-tRNA bound in the A/A site, is bound in the P/P site. [...] Once the peptide bond is formed, the tRNA in the P/P site is deacylated, or has a free 3’ end, and the tRNA in the A/A site carries the growing polypeptide chain. [...] To allow for the next elongation cycle, the tRNAs then move through hybrid A/P and P/E binding sites, before completing the cycle and residing in the P/P and E/E sites.

EEF1A1 is a eukaryotic elongation factor that {{is involved in}} the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the <b>A-site</b> of ribosomes during translation. [...] NINL is a ninein-like protein that is involved in microtubule organization and has calcium ion binding activity. TRAF2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 2, is part of some E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and is involved in ubiquitinating proteins so they can get degraded by the proteasome. ZBTB16, zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 16, is also part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and is most likely involved in substrate recognition. There is also an alternate form of CCDC130 where only 803 bases are transcribed instead of 1433 bases, but there is no additional information provided. [...] ZNF165 and ZNF24 are both zinc finger proteins, which bind DNA and other proteins to regulate transcription. Below is a table of the interacting proteins for CCDC130 assembled by GeneCards. The interactions of CCDC130 with NINL, ZNF24, TRAF2, JUP, GATA5 have been verified by a two-hybrid screen according to STRING, so these interactions do occur. JUP is a plaque protein. GATA5 is a transcription factor that helps activate the promoter for lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. Interactions with CDA, DERA, CDC40, NAA25, DGCR14, NAA20, and PRPF19 have not been verified experimentally, but interactions between gene homologs have been documented in other species according to STRING so these interactions could potentially occur. ZBTB16, EEF1A1, and ZNF165 all have been verified by at least one two-hybrid screen according to MINT. NAT9 was described as a known interactant on I2D. In a study done at the University of the District of Columbia to characterize CCDC130, they have found that it is induced through insulin signaling, is targeted by three different kinases (GSK3, CK1, and CK2), and is a mitochondrial protein.5 The study also shows that CCDC130 can potentially be used as a biomarker for certain types of cancer due to its differential expression in cancer cells. The study specifically mentions that CCDC130 is downregulated in some types of colon cancer, which allowed more cancer cells to be untargeted by the apoptosis pathway.|$|E

In the present report, the ability of 13 folate analogs to activate both adenylate and guanylate cyclase in pre- as well as postaggregative cells is examined. The patterns of correlation between binding and activation data indicate that guanylate cyclase activation is mediated by the B-sites in both developmental stages (P less than 0. 001). In postaggregative cells, adenylate cyclase also seems to be activated by the B-sites (P less than 0. 001). In contrast, adenylate cyclase activation in preaggregative cells was well correlated with the specificity of <b>A-sites</b> (P less than 0. 01). Remarkably, the potencies of activation were less affected by molecular modifications than the binding affinities were, as suggested by a slope of 0. 4 in a plot of K 0. 5 values of activation vs. binding. This observation argues against the existence of a transduction mechanism in which the response is proportional to receptor occupancy.
