[...] About 500 million years ago a collision of the South American Plate with the North American Plate caused the shale and sandstone layers to fracture and fissure, creating mountains of the folded rocks.

50|$|Kalimantan, {{where the}} Mahakam lies, {{is part of}} the Sunda Continental Plate. The large island has {{mountain}} ranges between Indonesia and Malaysia. As described by van Bemmelen (1949), River Mahakam rises in Cemaru (1,681 m) in the centre of Kalimantan, from there it cuts through the pre-tertiary axis of the island east of the Batuayan (1,652 m) and then reaches the tertiary basin of Kutai. Its middle course traverses a lowland plain with many marshy lakes. This intermontane depression is separated from the neighboring basin, the Barito depression, by a broad hilly tract of less than 500 m altitude. After this region, the Mahakam cuts through the Samarinda <b>anticlinorium</b> and reaches its alluvial delta, which spreads like a broad fan over the shelf-sea, with a base of 65 km and a radius of about 30 km.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{prominent}} geologic {{structure in the}} Kutai Basin is the Samarinda anticlinoriumâ€”Mahakam foldbelt, a series of NNE-SSW trending folds and faults in Miocene deltaic strata that parallel the modern coast line. [...] The tightly folded, asymmetric, and thrust fault bound anticlines range from 2-5 km wide and 20-50 km long and separated by broad, open synclines. [...] Onshore, the anticline crests are commonly eroded and breached, {{and the amount of}} erosion and structural complexity increase toward the west. A detached fold belt in the westernmost region of the <b>anticlinorium</b> transitions to thrust cored folds in the central region and simple symmetric/asymmetric structures in the easternmost offshore region. The tectonic origin of the fold belt has been attributed to a number of geodynamic processes. [...] One explanation for the detachment folding is directly related to basement inversion along the rift stage normal faults, producing folding above a detachment surface in an underlying over-pressured shale. [...] Another is the inversion of delta top grabben systems. These syn-depositional faults form in conjunction with delta toe thrust faults due to differential loading.

50|$|Geophysical {{methods in}} the form of seismic {{analysis}} has also been used to determine movement along the thrust sheet. In one study, seismic data recorded along the 49Â°N parallel (the border between Canada and the US) was recorded from the Rocky Mountain trench fault in the foreland belt to the east flank of the Moyie anticline of the Purcell <b>anticlinorium,</b> which is thought to be the location where the Lewis fault tapers off. Seismic data produced showed total displacement of 115 km of the Lewis thrust sheet. This was done by locating the position of the footwall cutoff of the Lewis sheet which is interpreted in the seismic section as truncated reflectors at 11-15 km depth underlying the Purcell anitclinorium and overlying the basement reflectors. 75 km East along the profile is the exposure of the Lewis fault in the Waterton area, which directly links to the most displaced portion of the hanging wall. Measuring the distance between the footwall cutoff and the fault exposure at the Earth's surface, total movement of the Lewis thrust sheet was determined. Results showed that there was 75 km of direct movement of the thrust sheet along the Lewis fault, and an additional 40 km of transport by the formation of footwall-domain duplexes. Although this study did not take into consideration that it could be possible that the Lewis thrust sheet moved further east along the prairies and was eroded away, the data proved to be of high quality as it allowed excellent ties to be made to previous drill holes, mapped structures, measured stratigraphy, and existing geologic and seismic data. This study acted as a reinforcement to previous work and was very consistent with previous data collected. Additionally, This seismic data presented is significant in extensional terms as a direct link between reflectors on the West and East sides of the Rocky Mountain trench correlate to the same stratigraphic unit, where extension can be restored and an extensional distance of about 10 km was calculated by the difference of the pre extension and post extension.|$|E

40|$|The Uralides, {{a linear}} N-S {{trending}} Palaeozoic fold belt, reveals an intact, well-preserved orogen {{with a deep}} crustal root within a stable continental interior. In the western fold- and-thrust belt of the southern Uralides, Devonian to Carboniferous siliciclastic and carbonate rocks overlay Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks. Deformation in the Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian caused thick-skinned tectonic features in the western and central parts of the western fold-and-thrust belt. A stack of several nappes characterizes the deformation in the eastern part. Along the E-W transect AC-TS' 96 that crosses the western fold-and- thrust belt, apatite fission track data record various stages of the geodynamic evolution of the Uralide orogeny such as basin evolution during the Palaeozoic, synorogenic movements along major thrusts, synorogenic to postorogenic exhumation and {{a change in the}} regional stress field during the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous. The Palaeozoic sedimentary cover and the Neoproterozoic basement of the Ala-Tau <b>anticlinorium</b> never exceed the upper limit of the PAZ since the Devonian. A temperature gradient similar to the recent one (20 degreesC/km) would account for the FT data. Reactivation of the Neoproterozoic Zilmerdak thrust was time equivalent to the onset of the Devonian and Carboniferous collision-related deformation in the east. West-directed movement along the Tashli thrust occurred in the Lower Permian. The Devonian and Carboniferous exhumation path of the Neoproterozoic siliciclastic units of the Tirlyan synclinorium mirrors the onset of the Uralian orogeny, the emplacement of the Tirlyan nappe and the continuous west-directed compression. The five main tectonic segments Inzer Synclinorium, Beloretzk Terrane, Ala-Tau <b>anticlinorium,</b> Yamantau <b>anticlinorium</b> and Zilair synclinorium were exhumed one after another to a stable position in the crust between 290 and 230 Ma. Each segment has its own t-T path but the exhumation rate was nearly the same. Final denudation of the western fold-and-thrust belt and exhumation to the present surface probably began in Late Tertiary. In Jurassic and Cretaceous, south-directed movements along W-E trending normal faults indicate a change in the tectonic regime in the southern Uralides. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.
