5000|$|The IAL if-statement {{does not}} have a then-clause or else-clause; it rather guards the {{succeeding}} statement. IAL provides an if either-statement that cleanly <b>allows</b> <b>testing</b> of multiple conditions. Both were replaced by ALGOL's if-then construct, with the introduction of the [...] "dangling-else" [...] ambiguity.|$|E
50|$|Clover also <b>allows</b> <b>testing</b> time to {{be reduced}} by only running the tests that cover the {{application}} code that was modified since the previous build.

50|$|No {{significance}} {{tests are}} available with DCA, {{although there is a}} constrained (canonical) version called DCCA in which the axes are forced by Multiple linear regression to correlate optimally with a linear combination of other (usually environmental) variables; this <b>allows</b> <b>testing</b> of a null model by Monte-Carlo permutation analysis.|$|E
50|$|The {{university}} {{offers a}} large range of consultancies {{focusing on the}} industry need. It <b>allows</b> <b>testing,</b> suggestion, research and upgradation of any textile raw materials or machinery.

30|$|Using matter-wave {{interferometry}} with high-mass test particles is {{the most}} sensitive tool of MAQRO for testing quantum physics. While the other techniques described earlier <b>allow</b> <b>testing</b> deviations from quantum physics for values of the decoherence parameter larger than Λ_min≈ 10 ^ 14 m^- 2 s^- 1, high-mass matter-wave interferometry will <b>allow</b> MAQRO <b>testing</b> for even smaller deviations.|$|R
50|$|In 2017, Philip Nitschke {{announced}} that Exit International {{had created a}} smartphone app that connects to a SCiO infrared spectrometer to <b>allow</b> <b>testing</b> of the purity of Nembutal.|$|R

50|$|As of 2010, the SDK for Symbian is {{standard}} C++, using Qt. It {{can be used}} with either Qt Creator, or Carbide (the older IDE previously used for Symbian development). A phone simulator <b>allows</b> <b>testing</b> of Qt apps. Apps compiled for the simulator are compiled to native code for the development platform, rather than having to be emulated. Application development can either use C++ or QML.|$|E
50|$|The Central Data Subsystem (CDS) {{consists}} of a cluster of high-end minicomputers which store vital data such as vehicle test and performance data, test procedures, historical data, etc. There are 2 primary interfaces into the CDS. The first is a real-time interface with the CCMS. The second is a video simulation interface which <b>allows</b> <b>testing</b> of firing room systems without {{the need to have}} a vehicle present.|$|E
5000|$|... acts a wrapper {{for both}} virtual environments and test {{automation}} tools, {{to simplify the}} consistent testing of Python code {{across a range of}} environments. It integrates the use of a virtualisation tool, such as , with a test script such as Imprimatur. This gives a consistent container-based testing environment on both desktops and integration servers. It also <b>allows</b> <b>testing</b> in a range of Python environments, such as Python 2 or Python 3 specific contexts.|$|E
40|$|The latest {{results on}} jets and jet {{substructure}} from the ZEUS Collaboration are presented. These measurements <b>allow</b> stringent <b>tests</b> of perturbative QCD and the electroweak {{sector of the}} Standard Model.

5000|$|Some {{document}} formats like PostScript, or macros in Microsoft Word, have conditional constructs. (if-then-else) that <b>allow</b> <b>testing</b> {{whether a}} {{location in the}} file has one value or another {{in order to control}} what is displayed.|$|R
50|$|Located at Center Hill Research Center, the Large Scale Test Facility (UCLSTF) is a state-of-art {{laboratory}} for testing of large-scale structural projects. The laboratory {{is served by}} a 30-ton overhead crane with a 5-ton auxiliary hook, and two 60-gallon per minute pumps. This facility is equipped with computerized controllers capable of controlling an array of sensors to <b>allow</b> <b>testing</b> of large to full-scale structural components and systems. The laboratory has a machine shop for fabrication of specimens, test fixtures, etc. and is equipped to <b>allow</b> <b>testing</b> of full-scale bridge girders and other linear elements up to 100' long, and full-scale buildings up to 2 stories high.|$|R
50|$|The combinational ATPG method <b>allows</b> <b>testing</b> the {{individual}} nodes (or flip-flops) of the logic circuit without being {{concerned with the}} operation of the overall circuit. During test, a so-called scan-mode is enabled forcing all flip-flops (FFs) to be connected in a simplified fashion, effectively bypassing their interconnections as intended during normal operation. This allows using a relatively simple vector matrix to quickly test all the comprising FFs, as well as to trace failures to specific FFs.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} self-refer is an {{incentive}} for physicians to order more tests than they otherwise might. In the United States, the Stark Law (specifically sections I and II) was designed to control self-referrals. However, the exceptions designed to allow necessary testing in physicians' offices have been exploited to circumvent the law. The in-office exception, which <b>allows</b> <b>testing</b> on equipment in the physician's office, has resulted in many physicians purchasing high-tech and expensive equipment such as CT scanners, MRI scanners, and nuclear scanners for their own offices.|$|E
50|$|One part of JWST {{development}} was {{the production of}} the Optical Telescope Element Pathfinder. The OTE pathfinder uses two additional mirror segments, and additional secondary mirror, and puts together various structures to allow testing of various aspects of the section, including Ground Support Equipment. This supports the GSE being used on the JWST itself later on, and <b>allows</b> <b>testing</b> of mirror integration. OTE pathfinder as 12 rather than 18 cells compared to the full telescope, but it does include a test of the backplane structure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{application}} {{must provide}} {{a way to}} put the definition of services and processes in analyst terms - using universal concepts such as flows and tables. The interface should encourage documentation, warn on inconsistencies, and <b>allow</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|R
30|$|The SSH {{user and}} {{password}} fields {{are used by}} the main application to connect to each individual router and submit commands. Also, a Ping button was included to <b>allow</b> <b>testing</b> the connectivity between the server and the routers.|$|R
50|$|The {{grades of}} weight bearing for each phase of {{recovery}} {{will be determined}} by the surgeon. The Anti-Gravity Treadmill can <b>allow</b> <b>testing</b> of weight bearing by lowering effective body weight in 1% increments from 100-20% of body weight.|$|R
