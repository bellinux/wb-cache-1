5|$|Following the duels, general {{engagement}} {{between the}} two armies commenced. Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as the Muslims swept through their ranks. The Meccan army was pushed back, and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were negated by the Muslim archers. Enjoying {{the best of these}} early encounters, the Muslims pierced through the Meccan lines, with victory appearing certain. However, it was the detachment of the Muslim archers, disobeying Muhammad's strict orders to remain stationary, that would shift the outcome of the battle, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|For the 1888 season, Wilson {{was made}} {{captain of the}} Launceston Grammar School {{football}} team. He also became a leading player for the Launceston Football Club. Wilson kicked two of his team's three goals in a school match against Horton College, and was named in Launceston's best players in several games, including matches against South Launceston and City that counted towards the premiership. In a match that was to decide the premiership, against South Launceston, Wilson put in a creditable performance. The game ended in a draw, which left the teams even on the ladder, and a subsequent game was scheduled for two weeks later. In that match, Wilson kicked one of Launceston's five goals <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> out two-goal victors to win their first Northern Tasmanian Football Association (NTFA) premiership. He was named in Launceston's best players for the match by the Launceston Examiner. For the following cricket season, Wilson moved to play with St. Leonards.|$|E

5|$|The Kerala Blasters {{played their}} first ever {{game in the}} Indian Super League on 13 October 2014 against NorthEast United at the Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium. They lost the match 0–1 after Koke found the net in the 45th minute. It took till the 26 October 2014, the Blasters' third game, before they gained their first ever point in the Indian Super League. It was against their future final opponents, Atlético de Kolkata, at the Salt Lake Stadium. Iain Hume scored the {{equalizer}} for the Blasters after Baljit Sahni gave the Kolkata side the lead. In the next game, four days later, the Blasters recorded their first ever victory against Pune City at the Balewadi Sports Complex. David Trezeguet gave Pune City {{the lead in the}} 15th minute before Chinadorai Sabeeth scored a 41st minute equalizer. Penn Orji scored the winner for the Blasters in the 65th minute <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> out with a 2–1 scoreline.|$|E
5|$|The {{next three}} {{game for the}} All Blacks would be played in five days. The All Blacks scored 13 tries, and Jimmy Hunter five of them, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> up a 47–0 victory over Oxford University. Their next match, two days later, was against Cambridge University. The Scotland Test was approaching, and the All Blacks decided to rest several players, Hunter, Billy Stead, Selling and George Gillett. Cambridge's kicking game, and fast backs helped them to {{restrict}} the score to 14–0 to the All Blacks. Two days later the All Blacks faced Richmond, and scored five tries to register a 17–0 victory. Their last game before the Scotland Test was against a Bedford XV in Richmond. There were four All Black tries in the first half, and six in the second. The final score was 41–0; the All Blacks had now scored over 600 points on tour.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{large number}} of Germans poured through the breach in the Roman {{frontline}} and charged the centre of the Roman rear line. This position was held by the elite Primani legion, which stopped the German attack in its tracks and then counterattacked, routing the breakthrough force. The breach in the front line was presumably filled, either by the separated wings of the front line reconnecting, or by the Primani advancing from the rear line (Ammianus does not specify which). The front line, now extended on the left flank by the rear line left wing, (and presumably by Severus' victorious division), began pushing the Germans back, and gradually hemmed them in from the flanks. At this point, the Germans were already exhausted and demoralised by their lack of progress and severe losses. The mass of their army was now trapped in an ever-tighter Roman crescent, with the troops on the edges being methodically cut down and the ones in the middle packed tightly together and unable to move. Finally, after more relentless pressure from the Romans, the German line collapsed: as panic spread through their ranks, the Germans broke formation and ran for their lives. Many did not run fast enough: pursued {{all the way to the}} Rhine by Roman cavalry and infantry, many were cut down <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran.</b> Large numbers attempted to swim across the river, but many drowned, hit by Roman missiles or weighed down by their armour.|$|E

25|$|Canada {{finished}} second in Round 4 of the Americas 1999 Rugby World Cup qualifying, losing only to Argentina, and qualify for the World Cup. Canada finished third in their pool (with France, Fiji and Namibia), winning their match against Namibia but losing their other two fixtures. The victory against Namibia was uncharacteristic for Canada, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> the score up to 72–11, {{one of their most}} lopsided victories, as there was a very slight statistical chance that they could have advanced on points scored. This trashing was the one bright light in an otherwise gloomy and disappointing 1999 World Cup performance.|$|E
25|$|Curtis {{concentrated}} {{his army}} around the Confederate positions near Elkhorn Tavern during the night; at dawn he started an artillery bombardment which lasted two hours. Due to having no ammunition reserves nearby, the Confederates soon ran very low on artillery shells and couldn't resupply {{for at least}} five or six hours. Van Dorn ordered his army to retreat towards the east before moving southwards. Neither Van Dorn nor Price remained behind to supervise the retreat, so the units left the field chaotically, with the artillery batteries leaving <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> out of ammunition and the infantry and cavalry regiments following.|$|E
25|$|After {{conversion}} to electrical operation the boat lift was operated successfully for 75 years. Regular maintenance was still necessary; for example, the wire ropes supporting the caissons suffered from fatigue from the repeated {{bending and straightening}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> over the overhead pulleys {{and had to be}} replaced frequently. However, maintenance was simpler than before the conversion because the mechanism of the electrical lift was above ground. Maintenance was also less expensive because the caissons were now designed to be run independently, allowing most maintenance to be carried out while one caisson remained operational and thus avoiding the need to close the lift entirely.|$|E

25|$|From {{the police}} force's {{beginnings}} in 1840 {{through the next}} forty years, policing arrangements varied around New Zealand. Whilst the nationally organised Armed Constabulary split its efforts between regular law enforcement functions and militia support to the land wars, some provinces desired local police forces of their own. This led to a separate Provincial Police Force Act being passed by the Parliament. However, provincial policing models lasted only two decades as economic depression in the 1870s saw some provinces stop paying their police <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> out of money. Eventually, the government decided a single nationally organised police {{would be the best}} and most efficient policing arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Kämärä was a 1918 Finnish Civil War battle fought at the Kämärä (now Gavrilovo, Leningrad oblast, Russia) {{railway station}} on 27 January 1918 between the Whites and the Reds. The battle {{began as a}} White Guard {{battalion}} from Vyborg attacked Kämärä on its march to the White controlled side of the Karelian Isthmus. After taking the village, the Whites ambushed a Red train carrying a large cargo of weapons from Saint Petersburg, but were finally forced to leave the scene <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> out of ammunition. The Battle of Kämärä {{is considered to be}} the first battle of the Civil War, although some minor incidents had occurred throughout January.|$|E
25|$|The quakes trapped {{hundreds}} of climbers above the Khumbu icefall, {{and they had}} to be evacuated by helicopter <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> low on supplies. The quake shifted the route through the ice fall, making it essentially impassable to climbers. Bad weather also made helicopter evacuation difficult. The Everest tragedy was small compared the impact overall on Nepal, with almost nine thousand dead and about 22 thousand injured. In Tibet, by 28 April at least 25 had died, and 117 were injured. By 29 April 2015, the Tibet Mountaineering Association (North/Chinese side) closed Everest and other peaks to climbing, stranding 25 teams and about 300 people {{on the north side of}} Everest.

They {{appeared on the scene}} at the flank of the Confederates who had captured the artillery pieces, causing them to retreat. The brigades of McNair, Perry, and Robinson became intermingled <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> for shelter in the woods east of the field. Hood ordered Kershaw's Brigade to attack Harker and then raced toward Robertson's Brigade of Texans, Hood's old brigade. As he reached his former unit, a bullet struck him in his right thigh, knocking him from his horse. He was taken to a hospital near Alexander's Bridge, where his leg was amputated a few inches from the hip.|$|E
25|$|Many {{industry}} journalists, {{as well as}} {{executives at}} Ford and Chrysler, believed the Taurus {{was going to be}} a failure. Chrysler executives believed customers would instead embrace their more conventional Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler New Yorker, which were still in development at the time. Executives at Ford knew producing the Taurus was a gamble, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> the risk of the car being so advanced it would turn off potential customers, as was the case with the Edsel. As a result, Ford continued to produce the LTD, which the Taurus was designed to replace in 1986. If the Taurus failed, Ford would have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Taurus, however, ended up being a resounding success, selling over a million units in its first generation alone.|$|E
25|$|Inside the school, teacher Dave Sanders had {{successfully}} evacuated {{students from the}} cafeteria; where some of them went up a staircase leading {{to the second floor}} of the school. The stairs were located around the corner from the Library Hallway in the main South Hallway. By now, Harris and Klebold were inside the main hallway. Sanders and another student were down at the end of the hallway still trying to secure as much of the school as they could. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>ran,</b> they encountered Harris and Klebold, who were approaching from the corner of the North Hallway. Sanders and the student turned and ran in the opposite direction. Harris and Klebold shot at them both, with Harris hitting Sanders twice in the chest but missing the student. The latter ran into a science classroom and warned everyone to hide. Klebold walked over towards Sanders, who had collapsed, to look for the student but returned to Harris up the North Hallway.|$|E
