5|$|The initial {{mission to}} move a {{metallic}} disc {{from one side of}} an <b>arena</b> <b>to</b> another with a completely autonomous flying robot was seen by many as almost impossible. The college teams continued to improve their entries {{over the next two years}} when the competition saw its first autonomous takeoff, flight, and landing by a team from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Three years later in 1995 a team from Stanford University was able to acquire a single disk and move it from one side of the <b>arena</b> <b>to</b> the other in a fully autonomous flight—half a decade earlier than some pundits had predicted.|$|E

5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle <b>arena</b> <b>to</b> perform actions.

Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E

5|$|Gladiators {{were trained}} combatants {{who might be}} slaves, convicts, or free volunteers. Death was not a {{necessary}} or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training represented a costly and time-consuming investment. By contrast, noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena {{with little or no}} training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival. Physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects. Tertullian considered deaths in the <b>arena</b> <b>to</b> be nothing more than a dressed-up form of human sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing <b>arena</b> <b>to</b> field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.|$|E

5|$|Colony Ross, {{known as}} Fort Ross today, {{was built in}} California just north of San Francisco Bay. It was the RAC's southernmost outpost and {{operated}} from 1812 to 1841, and was established as an agricultural base for supplying the northern settlements with food {{as well as for}} conducting trade with Alta California. The Ross Colony included a number of settlements spread out over an area stretching from Point <b>Arena</b> <b>to</b> Tomales Bay. The administrative center was Port Rumianstev at Bodega Harbor, off Bodega Bay. An artel hunting camp was located on the Farallon Islands. Three ranches were established: the Kostromitinov Ranch on the Russian River near the mouth of Willow Creek, the Khlebnikov Ranch in the Salmon Creek valley about a mile (1.6km) north of the present day Bodega, and the Chernykh Ranch near present-day Graton. Fort Ross employed native Alaskans to hunt seals and sea otters on the California coast. By 1840 California's sea otter population had been severely depleted.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in {{relation}} to The Lost Age's battle mode is similar to traditional role-playing video games. In each battle, the player is required to defeat all the enemies using direct attacks with weapons, offensive Psynergy spells, and other means of causing damage, all while keeping their own party alive through items and supportive Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense. If all the player's characters are downed by reducing their hit points to zero, the party is returned to the last village that the player visited and suffers a monetary penalty. The successful completion of a battle yields experience points, coins, and occasionally rare items. In addition to the main game itself, {{there is also a}} competitive battling mode accessible from the menu screen, where players can enter their teams into an <b>arena</b> <b>to</b> battle increasingly difficult CPU-controlled enemies or other players head-to-head.|$|E
