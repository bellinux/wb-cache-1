So in order to investigate the effects of different crop {{rotation and}} soil tillage practices on soil water storage, a multi-annual experiment employing two crop rotations and six tillage practices {{was carried out in}} dry-land condition of Maragheh, northwest of Iran during year 2007 till 2011. Results showed that <b>autumn</b> <b>cultivation</b> of the common vetch (CR 1) compared to spring cultivation of the common vetch (CR 2) left more water in the soil for the following wheat cropping in the next years and subsequently increased biological and grain yield of wheat. It was also notified that the increase of water storage in second sampling depth (15 - 30 cm) was significantly more than two other depths (0 - 15 and 30 - 45 cm). Results also depicted that the tillage practice applying "chisel plough + cyclo-tiller + seed drill (TP 1) " compared to other practices and especially the routine tillage of the region moldboard plow + disk harrow + manual seed broadcasting, TP 5) significantly increased soil water storage. The mentioned tillage practice (TP 1) markedly decreased the bulk density of soil and increased biological and grain yield of wheat, as well. Therefore, applying TP 1 tillage practice beside <b>autumn</b> <b>cultivation</b> of common vetch in rotation with wheat would be a good strategy to increase soil water storage and crop yield in dry-land conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurements}} of atmospheric radon concentration {{were carried out}} for one year {{at the turn of}} 2008 / 2009, using Kodak LR 115 passive track detectors. The average atmo-spheric radon activity near the phosphogypsum stack was 104 Bq m– 3. This is below the level accepted for indoor air. The results indicate that there are strong positive correla-tions between radon concentration and temperature (r= 0. 9) or atmospheric pressure (r= 0. 9) and a negative correlation between radon concentration and humidity (r=- 0. 7) or wind velocity (r=- 0. 7). Moreover, for all monitoring points the correlation between radon atmospheric concentrations measured in four seasons of the year were analyzed. The cor-relation coefficients are as follows: winter-summer 0. 7, winter-autumn 0. 2, winter-spring 0. 2.

40|$|In {{dependence}} of nitrogen fertilisation, nitrogen {{supply in the}} soil, weather conditions and growth of cereals exist after yielding of cereals different amounts of nitrogen. High nitrogen fertilisation in the spring is connected with nitrogen losses. Water content of soil diminished during vegetation under semiaride climate. With mathematical equations is possible to estimate water and nitrogen contents in the soil. They are the basis for decision for cultivation of crops after cereal for temporary fixing of nitrogen. Cultivation of crops after cereals is useful, when the amount of nitrogen in the soil is higher than 100 kg N/ha.

40|$|Two main {{challenges}} facing organic arable farming are {{the supply of}} nitrogen (N) to the crop and the control of perennial weeds. Nitrate leaching from different organic arable crop rotations was investigated over three consecutive four-year crop rotations in a field experiment at three locations in Denmark (12 years in total). The experimental treatments were: i) crop rotation, ii) catch crop and iii) animal manure. Nitrate leaching was estimated from measured soil nitrate concentation in ceramic suction cells and modelled drainage. There were significant effects on annual N leaching of location (coarse sand > loamy sand > sandy loam) and catch crops (without > with). Including a grass-clover green manure on 25 % of the area did not increase N leaching compared with crop rotations without green manure. Also the application of animal manure did not influence N leaching, probably because even in the manured treatments the application rate was lower than crop demand. The results identify management of crop and soil during autumn as the main determinant of N leaching. Nitrate leaching was lowest for a catch crop soil cover during autumn and winter (avg. 20 kg N ha- 1), a soil cover of weeds/volunteers had on avg. 30 kg N ha- 1, and the largest N leaching losses were found after stubble cultivation (avg. 55 kg N ha- 1).

40|$|Conservation tillage {{practices}} were tested against autumn mouldboard ploughing {{for differences in}} physical properties of soil, surface runoff, subsurface drainflow and soil erosion. The study (1991 - 2001) was performed on a gently (2 %) sloping clayey soil of southern Finland, with two replicates of the tillage treatments on 0. 5 ha plots. The annual shares of surface runoff of the total flow (surface runoff + subsurface drainflow) were 842 % for ploughing (depth 2023 cm), 3666 % for shallow <b>autumn</b> stubble <b>cultivation</b> (depth 58 cm) and 3682 % for soil left untilled over winter. Surface runoff increased with decrease in the tillage intensity, and {{in line with the}} values of depressional water storage, macroporosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Erodibility of this gently sloping soil was at highest after autumn and spring tillage operations and decreased with time. Shallow autumn tillage produced erosion as high as mouldboard ploughing (4071700 kg ha 1 yr 1), but 48 % and 12 % lower erosion levels were measured from plots left untilled in autumn, covered by grass or barley residues, respectively. Eroded soil particles moved relatively freely to the subsurface drains, which carried 3794 % of the annual soil losses from the field. The study shows that even on the relatively flat clayey soils typical for southern Finland, tillage has a great influence on soil losses. The frequency of tillage needs to be reduced rather than the depth of tillage on clayey soils with poor water conductivity and structural stability if soil loss is to be diminished by conservation tillage. ...|$|R

The exper-imental design was a randomized block with the treatments arranged in a factorial 4 x 4, with three replications, with the first factor consisting of amounts of roostertree biomass (5. 4, 8. 8, 12. 2 and 15. 6 t ha- 1 on a dry basis), and the second factor by the incorporation times into the soil (0, 10, 20 and 30 days before sowing of the rock-et). Beyond the green mass yield and production costs, were determined the following economic indicators: gross income, net income, rate of return and profit margin. The optimal agronomic performance of the rocket was obtained into monetary terms. Spending on hand labor accounted for 69 % of protuction costs. Due to the increase in the daily price of rural workers, the costs of preparation of the green manure were higher in <b>autumn.</b> The <b>cultivation</b> of the rocket under fertilization with roostertree was feasible from the economic perspective, regardless the amount of green manure, time of incorporation into the soil and cultivation season.

At Jyndevad, stubble cultivations decreased Elymus repens density in the treatments without catch crops. Application of manure decreased the E. repens density in one rotation. At Flakkebjerg, there was a lower infestation of C. arvense in the rotation with than without grass-clover, with least biomass in the crop the year after grass-clover. There {{was no significant difference}} between the biomass of C. arvense in the treatments with and without catch crop, in spite of the fact that stubble cultivations and row hoeing were carried out without catch crops. The reason was most likely that the nutrients retained in the topsoil by the catch crops benefited the crops, which became more competitive against the weeds. Yields of spring cereals were consistently increased after catch crops. At sites with light soils and excess precipitation in <b>autumn,</b> stubble <b>cultivations</b> will most likely contribute to nitrogen leaching compared with growing catch crops in the same season. With stubble cultivations the following crop will be deprived of some important nutrition, and probably be less competitive against the weeds compared with the situation with catch crops. This is also indicated by the fact that manure applications in some cases reduced E. repens density. Our experiments show that although stubble cultivations reduce the E. repens infestation compared to the use of catch crops; the expected increase in the yield of the following crop may not be large enough to counter the negative effect of the nutrient loss. The efficacy of direct control on perennial weeds in the succeeding crop interacts with nutrient leaching so that the yield effects may differ from what is expected. Experiments aimed solely at revealing efficacy of direct control measures may fail to describe the relationship between different treatments, which are very important in organic farming. Our results emphasize that long-term experiments are important for evaluating the effect of different measures. ...|$|R

The field was divided into ten separate tile-drained plots, each with an area of 0. 16 hectare. The amount of drainage water from each plot was measured and water samples were collected twice a month and weekly during flood periods. The water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus an potassium. The fertilizer regimes were: Unfertilized, commercial fertilizer according to general recommendations (90 - 110 kg/ha), liquid manure (pig slurry) in spring or autumn (90 - 110 tot. N kg/ha) supplemented with commercial fertilizer applied in the spring (45 - 55 N kg/ha) and treatments with double amount of liquid manure applied in spring or autumn also supplemented with commersial fertilizer. all treatments were grown with and without a catch crop exept the treatments with autumn application of mature that are {{required by law to}} be followed by a green cover during the winter. During the first two years, Ialian ryegrass, and in the year perennial ryegrass wass grown as catch crop. The ryegrass was undersown in the main crop. The grop rotation was: Oat (1989), spring wheat (1990) an barley (1991). The treatments with ryegrass were ploughed in the spring whereas the other treatments were ploughed in the <b>autumn</b> after stubble <b>cultivation</b> following harvest. The catch crop reduced the spring leaching substially in the single dose treatments with only commersial fertilizer and in th combined system with both manure and commercial fertilizer. The reduction was as high as 74 and 78 %, respectively, but in the treatment with a double dose of pig slurry the reduction stopped at 50 %. When pig slurry was applied in the autumn, the losses were doubled compared to spring application in spite of the catch crop. The unfertilized treatment (8 years) without a cac crop had 50 % less leaching compared with treatments with springapplied normal doses of fertilizers without a catch crop. The yield in the unfertilized treatment was only 34 % of the yield in the treatment with a normal dose of commercial fertilicer. The treatment with a singel dose of manure and half a dose of commercial fertilizer, bothe appliedin the spring, gave 7 % higher yield but a more lodged stand compared with the treatment with a single dose of commercial fertilize. The last two treatments had the best nitrogen utilization ration (82 % of applied N was taken away by the grain yield). A double dose of manure lowered both the yield and the nitrogen utilization ratio indipendent of time of application. The main reason for this was higher lodging tendency and higher leaching values. The cath crop lowered the yield (7 - 24 %) both in 1989 and 1990 in the treatment with spring-applied fertilizers. Also the fertilizer utilization ration was lower in the catch crop treatments. But in 1991 the diffferences were smaller. The main reason for this seems to be a delivery by mineralization from organic nitrogen from earlier ploughed-in catch crops. Important reasons for the drop in yield in the treatments with a catch crop seem to be competition with the main crop and large deficiency of mineral nitrogen in the early spring compared with treatments without a catch crop. Any net immobilization of nitrogen following the ploughing-in of cath crop could not be verified. At the time of yellow ripeness for the cereals, the intersown ryegrass had taken up 7 - 14 N kg/ha in the standing crop (above ground) {{and in the middle of}} November 11 - 90 N kg/ha, most in treatments were the nitrogen supply was good, such as in treatments with autumn application of manure or in treatments where the frequent use of manure had enlargeed the mineralization capacity of the soil. In the autumn the dry matter content of the catch crop varied between 800 - 2700 kg d. w. per hectare. From last autumn to early spring the N content of ryegrass changed only very little. The catch crops decreased the amount of mineral nitrogen in the soil (0 - 90 cm) from the time of yellow ripeness to late autumn exept in the treatments with autumn-applied manure. In treatments without a catch crop, the nitrogen mineralization capacity of the soil. In late autumn the dry matter content of the ryegrass changed only very little. The catch crops decreased the amounts of mineral nitrogen in the soil 80 - 90 cm) from the time of wellow ripeness to late autumn exept in the treatments with autumn-applied manure. In treatments without a catch crop, the nitrogen mineralization increased in the storage of mineral nitrogen throughout the autumn, leading to a higher leaching during the following winter compared with treatments with a catch crop. In the treatments with a catch crop, the mineral nitrogen storage continued to be fairly small until the time of spring ploughing. During the time from spring ploughing with a catch crop than in corresponding treatments without a catch crop. Yearly application of manure enlarged the delivery of mineral nitrogen from the soil compared with to treatments without manure. The delivery was also lowered in the treatment without any fertilizer application. Calculations show that a frequent manure addition gave an enlarged nitrogen leachong magnitude, as well as increased ammoniavolatilization and denitrification. In the autumn-ploughed treatments without a catch crop, the net mineralization of nitrogen from the time of yellow ripeness to early spring was higher than in the treatments with catch crop and spring ploughing. However, during the growing season, the minratlization was higher in the treatments with a catch crop and spring ploughing. Thus, it seems as if anutumn ploughing stimulates the mineral N-mobilization during winter. In the treatments with a spring ploughed catch crop, the net mineralization during growing season is enlarged. The amounths of nitrogen mineralization also increased during the years, suggesting an additional influence of several years durration given by the ryegrass residues. The combination of a cath crop and spring ploughing therefore seems to both diminish leaching losses though retention of nitrogen in plants and plant residues, and futher offer a possibility to govern nitrogen prosesses in the soil in such a way that nitrogen ta a greater extent will released when it can be utilized by the crop...|$|R

40|$|Shallow {{cultivation}} to a {{depth of}} 5 - 7 cm has in the last years become a realistic alternative to common ploughless tillage (cultivation depth 1 0 - 15 cm), especially in Great Britain, France and Germany. Shallow cultivation means avoiding unnecessary soil loosening, preserving the soils natural structure, increasing activity in the top layer and decreasing fuel consumption with less power requirement. Two years ago VäderstadVerken AB developed a tillage tool for shallow cultivation called Rexius Carrier with System Disc. The tool consists of a heavy roller and a front tool called Systern Disc. The front tool includes two rows of concave, close mounted discs, which combined with a trave 1 ing speed of 10 - 14 km/h leaves a well leveled, 100 % work through, top layer. The aim of this thesis was to test shallow cultivation with Rexius Carrier under Swedish conditions, as <b>autumn</b> <b>cultivation</b> and as spring cultivation after a catch crop. This thesis includes the results of three different series of field experiments. The first, "Minimized autumn tillage to a spring crop", R 2 - 4122, was started in the autumn 2000. The result of the trial showed the highest yield for mouldboard ploughing and the lowest for the shallow cultivation, with deeper ploughless tillage in between. The second series, "Spring seeding without autumn tillage, including a catch crop", R 2 - 4123, was started in the spring of 2001. The series contained three experiments on sites with different clay contents, and compared autumn and spring ploughing with ploughless tillage to different depths and with different tillage intensities. The shallow cultivation performed well in this comparison. Despite a less suitable seedbed, plant establishment and crop yield in the shallow cultivated plots was nearly as high as for autumn ploughing. The weed population was greatly reduced in the shallow cultivated plots. The spring ploughed plots had less sui 1 able seedbed properties, poorer germination, more weed and lower crop yield than autumn ploughed plots. The third series, "Shallow cultivation to winter seed", started in the autumn of 200 1. In this series conventional mouldboard ploughing was compared with shallow cultivation with Rexius Carrier, chisel ploughing with and without roller and heavy disc harrow with and without roller. Before the second cultivation the germination of weeds and volunteers was counted, without any differences between different treatments. Before the seeding, the amount of straw and stubble on the surface was compared using digital image analysis. No differences between the treatments were found. After the seeding, the seedbed properties and the plant establishment was determined. Due to the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn, which had an equalizing effect on the analyzed parameters, {{no significant differences between the}} treatments were found. The trials has shown that only shallow cultivation before seeding can give good opportunities for the following crop. The trial R 2 - 4123 showed that shallow spring cultivation after a catch crop can maintain harvest yield compared to conventional mouldboard ploughing. Shallow <b>autumn</b> <b>cultivation</b> has a future as an alternative to conventional methods.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{aimed at}} evaluating the yield and quality response of broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica) to applied irrigation water and nitrogen by drip irrigation method {{during the spring}} and <b>autumn</b> <b>cultivation</b> periods of 2007. Irrigation water was applied based on a ratio of Class A pan evaporation (kcp= 0. 50, 0. 75, 1. 00 and 1. 25) with 7 days interval. Also, the effect of four nitrogen levels (0 kgha- 1, 150 kgha- 1, 200 kgha- 1 and 250 kgha- 1) was compared with each treatment. The seasonal evapotranspiration in the treatments varied from 233 mm to 328 mm during the spring period and from 276 mm to 344 mm during the autumn period. The highest broccoli yield was obtained in the spring period as 11. 02 tha- 1 and in the autumn period as 4. 55 tha- 1. In general, there were statistical differences along nitrogen does with respect to yield and yield components while there were {{no statistically significant differences}} in the yield and yield components among irrigation regimes. Both yield and yield parameters in the spring period were found to be higher than that of the autumn period due to the low temperature and high rainy days in autumn. Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) ranged from 3. 78 kgm- 3 to 14. 61 kgm- 3 during the spring period and from 1. 89 kgm- 3 to 5. 93 kgm- 3 during the autumn period. On the other hand, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) changed as 37. 32 - 73. 13 % and 13. 08 - 22. 46 % for spring and autumn season, respectively.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the possibility of a crop water stress index (CWSI) to schedule irrigation for broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica) grown with drip irrigation during the spring and <b>autumn</b> <b>cultivation</b> periods of 2007. The effects of five irrigation levels which were applied based on a ratio of Class A pan evaporation (kcpÂ =Â  0, 0. 50, 0. 75, 1. 00 and 1. 25) with 7 days interval on broccoli yields and resulting CWSl were investigated. The highest yield and water use was obtained in the treatment of applied 50 % of the evaporation measured in Class A pan for two seasons, while the effects of irrigation programs on yield was not statistically significant. The seasonal evapotranspiration in the treatments varied from 187 to 326 Â mm during the spring period and from 242 to 346 Â mm during the autumn period. The CWSI was calculated using the empirical approach from measurements of infrared canopy temperatures, ambient air temperatures and vapor pressure deficit values for five irrigation levels. An average threshold CWSI value of about 0. 51 before irrigation produced the maximum yield. The yield was directly correlated with mean CWSI values and the linear equation "YÂ =Â - 36. 51 (CWSI) 2 Â +Â  32. 958 (CWSI) Â +Â  0. 772 " with a determination coefficient R 2 Â =Â  0. 99 and standard deviation SyxÂ =Â  1. 38 Â MgÂ ha- 1 can be used for yield prediction. The soil water content, soil matric potential, above ground biomass and leaf area index values were also found to correlate better with CWSI as a key function for modeling the crop growth model. The CWSI value was useful for evaluating crop water stress in broccoli and should be useful for timing irrigation and predicting yield.

40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out in 2008 - 2010 on Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. var. pekinensis (Lour.) Olson). The main problem in {{cultivation}} of this vegetable is physiological disorder – tipburn. It is connected with low level of calcium in young leaves and with water deficiency. In 2008, seeds of Chinese cabbage were sown twice, in April and July. In July, the day temperature was high (25 - 30 °C) and relative air humidity was low (35 - 50 %). In these conditions, the young leaves were injured heavily. Rotting {{was caused by the}} activity of bacteria Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Jones) Hauben et al. However, three times foliar application of 1. 5 % calcium nitrate or 1. 5 % Wapnovit significantly reduced the tipburn. Also spraying with 0. 03 % of Tytanit (containing ions of titanium) or with 2. 5 % of Biochikol 020 PC (containing chitosan) gave similar effect. In these conditions, application of 1. 5 % K- 300 (containing potassium oxide and ammonium nitrate) exacerbated symptoms of tipburn. Application of Wapnovit or Tytanit reduced instantly rotting of heads contrary to the application of their mixture. In <b>autumn</b> <b>cultivation,</b> when the relative air humidity was 80 - 100 %, spraying with 1. 5 % solution of K- 300 significantly decreased injuries in comparison to control. Application of Wapnovit, K- 300, Biochikol, Tytanit or the mixture of Biochikol and calcium nitrate eliminated rotting. In experiments done in the springs of 2009 and 2010, when weather conditions were less favorable for tipburn appearance, a severity of it was lower but application of K- 300 increased it appearance. In these experiments, Biochikol and Wapnovit eliminated rotting of heads. The results of three years of study have shown that calcium nitrate, Wapnovit, Tytanit and Biochikol limited occurrence of tipburn and bacterial rotting of Chinese cabbage, but the weather conditions during cultivation had the greatest impact on the severity of tipburn...|$|E
40|$|Perennial weeds {{can be a}} major {{constraint}} {{to organic}} crop production in several North European 26 countries. Preventive and cultural control measures may not suffice when infestations with perennials 27 become severe. Direct control actions applied between crops can then be necessary to reduce the 28 problems. We conducted two experiments, one on a sandy loam and one on a sandy soil, respectively, in 29 Denmark, {{with the aim of}} studying the efficacy of different implement types and strategies. The 30 treatments were employed against mixed stands of perennials after harvest of spring barley in two 31 consecutive years. Time of treatment, cultivation depth and combinations of implements constituted the 32 strategies. Treatment effects were evaluated in the growing season that followed the post-harvest 33 treatments. In one experiment, repeated tine cultivation caused an 80 - 90 % annual reduction of the 34 population of mainly Cirsium arvense. With treatments conducted in two consecutive years, the 35 accumulated effects reached up to 99 % control. In the second experiment, power take-off driven 36 implements with rotating weeding devices demonstrated similar control efficacy against a mixed stand 37 composing C. arvense, Tussilago farfara, Elytrigia repens and Artemisia vulgaris. One pass was 38 conducted a week after barley harvest followed by another pass 3 weeks later and ending the strategy with 39 mouldboard ploughing in the succeeding spring. Grain yields did not differ among the treatments in the 40 two experiments {{as a result of the}} generally high effectiveness exerted by the control strategies. 41 Especially post-harvest control strategies based on rotating weed devices and mouldboard ploughing 42 appear to be effective solutions against mixed stands of perennials but they do not comply with optimal 43 nutrient management in organic cropping. Therefore, intensive <b>autumn</b> <b>cultivation</b> is only relevant where 44 a perennial weed problem is uncontrollable by other means and should preferably be applied on limited 45 areas only...|$|E
40|$|Field poppy, Papaver rhoeas L., is a {{very common}} weed in winter cereals in North-Eastern Spain. Its control is {{becoming}} difficult due to expanding herbicide resistance. To control field poppies there are alternative strategies such as non-chemical control that {{take into account the}} weed emergence period. However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge of P. rhoeas emergence patterns in semi-arid conditions. Thus, here we conducted pot experiments on the emergence of P. rhoeas. We aimed to describe the emergence period and to quantify the emergence of a susceptible and of a herbicide-resistant P. rhoeas population at two locations in Catalonia, Spain, from 1998 to 2001 and until 2004 at one of them. Therefore, pots containing seeds of both populations were established at the two locations and emergence was recorded monthly. We studied the origin of the population, the sowing location, the effect of cultivation and the sowing year. First, we found that the main emergence peaks in our experiments occurred in autumn, accounting for between 65. 7 and 98. 5 % of the annual emergence from October to December, and only little emergence was recorded in spring. This emergence pattern is different from those found in the literature corresponding to Northern European countries, where in some cases main flushes occur only in autumn, in spring and winter or only in spring. The emergence was mainly affected by cultivation, but the effect of light stimulus was observed several months later. As a consequence, cultivation should be done in early autumn, promoting emergence during the whole autumn and winter so that emerged seedlings can be controlled before sowing a spring crop. Second, most experiments showed that the emergence was significantly higher in the first autumn than in the following seasons, e. g. 4. 1 % emergence in the first year and only 2. 1, 2. 3, 0. 5 and 0. 6 % new emergence at one of the locations for the second, third, fourth and fifth years. Thus, after having a severe P. rhoeas infestation causing a big seed rain, emergence should be stimulated by <b>autumn</b> <b>cultivation</b> in the following season and seedlings controlled by trying to deplete the soil seed bank as much as possible. Despite the fact that emergence will be staggered throughout several years and that there was a significant relationship between rainfall and emergence, so that dry years will cause a smaller emergence rate of the weed, these findings define a cultural management strategy to reduce P. rhoeas infestations and to contribute to integrated weed management strategies combining it with other tools...|$|E
40|$|Early <b>autumn</b> <b>cultivation</b> of soil {{is known}} to stimulate {{nitrogen}} (N) mineralization and {{increase the risk of}} N leaching from arable land. This is due to mineralization of soil organic matter and high release of nitrate after mechanical disturbance at a time when soil temperature still allows high microbial activities. Nitrogen uptake in winter wheat is rather low, often not more than 10 - 15 kg ha⁻¹. Therefore, N mineralized due to conventional establishment of winter wheat is at risk of leaching during autumn and winter, especially if the preceding crop leaves a lot of N in the soil and in its crop residues, e. g. oilseed rape. This project studied the extent to which direct-drilling or shallow cultivation using Väderstad Carrier (5 - 7 cm) or stubble cultivation (10 - 12 cm) instead of conventional establishment after early moldboard ploughing could mitigate N mineralization during autumn, and how it affected crop establishment and yield. One-year field trials with three replicates were established at three Swedish sites in autumn 2002 and studied for three consecutive years. All four techniques for establishment of winter wheat (including direct-drilling) resulted in more soil mineral N in comparison with untreated soil. The increase after direct-drilling compared to no treatment varied between 5 - 36 kg N per hectare and was possibly explained by faster release of N from the oilseed rape residues. Two weeks after sowing, the soil profile contained on average 10, 5 and 7 kg less soil mineral N after direct-drilling than after moldboard ploughing in a light clay soil in Skåne, a light soil in Västergötland and a heavy clay soil in Uppland respectively. Shallow cultivation resulted in - 3 kg, + 11 kg and - 10 kg less mineral N per hectare compared with moldboard ploughing in Skåne, Västergötland and Uppland respectively. In Skåne, soil mineral N increased with increasing tillage depth. At the two other sites, however, there was no clear relationship between tillage intensity and soil N content. In Västergötland shallow cultivation resulted in more soil mineral N than moldboard ploughing, while in Uppland direct-drilling resulted in more soil mineral N than shallow tillage. Comparing moldboard ploughing and shallow tillage, soil mineral N during autumn after establishment of winter wheat was more dependent on the timing of tillage than tillage method. Average values of all nine experiments showed that net mineralization was 8 % lower after direct-drilling than after primary tillage and sowing (moldboard ploughing or shallow tillage), while compared to moldboard ploughing it was 20 % lower. Reduced tillage, especially direct-drilling but also shallow tillage, increased the amount of weeds in spring compared with moldboard ploughing. However, these treatment differences disappeared after herbicide application in summer, and thus with normal spraying, the effect of reduced tillage on weeds was not a problem. Direct-drilling resulted in a 2 % yield reduction compared with moldboard ploughing. The highest wheat yields were obtained after stubble cultivation and Väderstad Carrier. From an economic point of view, direct drilling or shallow cultivation to establish winter wheat is preferable to conventional moldboard ploughing...|$|E
