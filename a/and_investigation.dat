To allow the Russian workers access from the morning of 1 September, the crew was allowed to fly in and establish a base camp, but no work was to be done until Norwegian supervisors arrived in the morning. However, two people were observed at the wreck at about 20:00 CEST, who {{were brought to the}} Governor's offices for questioning. As they were both members of the Russian team, it was decided that the base would be disbanded.|$|E

5|$|Digital {{forensics}} (sometimes {{known as}} digital forensic science) is {{a branch of}} forensic science encompassing the recovery <b>and</b> <b>investigation</b> of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data.

5|$|Her {{best known}} work was a {{comprehensive}} study of Plasmodium, the malaria parasite, <b>and</b> <b>investigation</b> of various chemotherapies for the disease. Later she studied drug resistance in this parasite, research that proved valuable to the British military in World War II.

Bishop also discovered the protozoan Pseudotrichomonas keilini and worked with Aedes aegypti, a malaria vector, {{as part of her}} research on the disease. Elected to the Royal Society in 1959, Bishop was the founder of the British Society for Parasitology and served on the World Health Organization's Malaria Committee.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{laboratory}} test for serotonin syndrome. Therefore, diagnosis is by symptom observation <b>and</b> <b>investigation</b> of the patient's history. Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed. The first rigorously evaluated criteria {{were introduced in}} 1991 by Harvey Sternbach, a {{professor of psychiatry at}} UCLA. Researchers in Australia later developed the Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules, which have better sensitivity and specificity, 84% and 97%, respectively, when compared with the gold standard of diagnosis by a medical toxicologist. As of 2007, Sternbach's criteria were still the most commonly used.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist Don Brothwell {{considers}} {{that many of}} the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The study of bog bodies, including these found in Lindow Moss, has contributed to a wider understanding of well-preserved human remains, helping to develop new methods in analysis <b>and</b> <b>investigation.</b> The use of sophisticated techniques, such as computer tomography (CT) scans, has marked the investigation of the Lindow bodies as particularly important. Such scans allow the reconstruction of the body and internal examination. Of the 27bodies recovered from lowland raised mires in England and Wales, only those from Lindow Moss and the remains of Worsley Man have survived, together with a shoe from another body. The remains have a date range from the early 1st to the 4thcenturies. Investigation into the other bodies relies on contemporary descriptions of the discovery.|$|E
5|$|Initial police {{speculation}} {{was that}} Kinne had bribed guards {{to look the}} other way while she escaped the prison—an unusual blackout had been reported at the prison on the evening of and at the approximate time of her escape, <b>and</b> <b>investigation</b> showed that a door that should have been locked had been left unsecured—but further questioning of prison guards and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than it should have been. News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Kinne's escape, including that she had bribed prison guards, that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman, that Kinne's mother had been involved in the escape plan, that a former Mexican secret service agent had assisted in her escape, and that Kinne may have disguised herself as a man to effect her escape. A more modern theory speculates that the family of Francisco Parades Ordoñez had helped her escape and then killed her.|$|E

5|$|The {{disaster}} <b>and</b> <b>investigation</b> received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on}} the public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published {{on the front page of}} the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently was the result of the discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 2011, {{following}} the death of Florida A University drum major Robert Champion, the Delta Iota chapter was placed on investigative hold pending an investigation by the national fraternity. In January 2012, the Tallahassee Democrat reported alleged hazing by the FAMU chapter in spring 2010. According to the allegations, two members of the FAMU band faculty were involved in a hazing incident at a professor's home in which prospective members were struck on the back and neck and forced to recite information. The fraternity's investigation was postponed at the request of FAMU due to the ongoing police investigation. The investigations cleared Delta Iota of any connection to Champion's death; Champion was not a member or prospective member of the fraternity. After the conclusion of both the police and fraternity investigations, the national council closed down the chapter because of its violations of fraternity policy and the uncertainty of the future of the FAMU band program. As part of the chapter's termination, 28 members, including all active and prospective members in spring 2010, were expelled from the fraternity. Alumni members of the chapter who were present at the hazing were also expelled. Furthermore, the Delta Iota chapter may not return to FAMU before May 2017. Members who joined the fraternity after spring 2010 were transferred to alumni status but cannot participate in any fraternity events due to the shutdown of the chapter. No criminal charges were filed due to the delay in reporting <b>and</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The player builds their {{character}} by spending acquired points {{to increase their}} ratings in the three areas. The points spent on Attributes and Abilities combine to determine a player's success or effectiveness in performing tasks such as using firearms, brawling, and lock-picking; for example, determining how accurate or how far the player can shoot, or if they can hack a computer. Attributes are represented by physical (strength, dexterity, and stamina), social (charisma, manipulation, and appearance), and mental (perception, intelligence, and wits). Abilities are talents (such as brawling and dodging), skills (such as firearms and melee) and knowledges (such as computers <b>and</b> <b>investigation).</b> The player is initially assigned points to spend in the three areas, with the amount they can spend determined by clan; for example, the Brujah can spend the most points on physical and skill attributes. During character creation, each upgrade costs one point. The upgrade cost increases as the game progresses. Each ability can be raised from zero to five, and {{it is impossible to}} accrue enough experience points to complete every skill (allowing the player to specialize or balance {{their character}}). Experience points are gained by completing quests, finding items or unlocking secret paths, rather than killing enemies, and are used to increase or unlock the character's statistics and abilities. The game features a main story, and optional side quests that can be completed at any time; the player is able to move between the available areas at will to revisit locations, characters, or merchants.|$|E
