40|$|Abstract. The {{combined}} chemical composition, O and H isotopes, and {{the basic}} geologic setting of the geothermal system of the Gulf of Suez, Egypt have been investigated to evaluate {{the origin of the}} dissolved constituents and subsurface reservoir temperatures. Hydrochemical characterization of thermal waters discharged from springs and <b>flowing</b> <b>artesian</b> <b>wells</b> in the Gulf of Suez region show that there are two groups. One is Hammam Faroun thermal waters with salinity values exceeding 10, 000 mg/l, discharge temperatures reach to 70 ºC, and Na-Cl hydrochemical facies. The other group is thermal waters discharged at Hammam Mousa, Ain Sukhna, and shallow <b>flowing</b> <b>artesian</b> <b>wells</b> at Ayoun Mousa and Ras Sudr. They are characterized by salinity values less than 10, 000 mg/l, discharge temperatures ranging from 32. 5 to 72 ºC and Na-Mg-Ca-Cl (Hammam Mousa), Na-Cl-SO 4 (Ain Sukhna), and Na-Ca-Cl (Ayoun Mousa- 2 well and Ras Sudr- 2 well) water types. Different graphical presentations using major and minor ions indicated that little mixing with sea water is probably a source of dissolved constituents. Water/rock interaction is also a major source for the dissolved constituents as revealed from Ca and HCO 3 enrichment of the thermal waters that is attributed to dissolution of carbonate minerals. Thermal waters from Hammam Faroun and Ras Sudr- 2 well have the highest discharge temperatures and SiO 2 concentrations that indicate that ascending hot water at the Hammam Faroun area is slightly mixed with cold water. The thermal waters from the study area are depleted in 18 O and 2 H and fall on the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) and below the local eastern Mediterranean Meteoric Water Line (MMWL) with d-excess values ranging between 3. 42 and 10. 6 ‰, which is similar to the groundwater of the Nubian aquifer in central Sinai and the Western Desert of Egypt and suggesting a common origin.

40|$|We report {{engineering}} experiences {{from the}} critical task of relief well installation under high <b>artesian</b> <b>flow</b> {{conditions at the}} downstream toe of the Karkheh earth dam, Iran. Due {{to the establishment of}} excessive uplift pressure at the downstream toe of the Karkheh dam, installation of a series of new relief wells was considered to permanently relieve part of these pressures. The mentioned uplift pressure, as high as around 30 m above the ground level, was produced in a confined conglomerate aquifer bounded above and below by relatively impervious mudstone layers which reduced the safety factor of the dam toe to below 1. 0. Investigations on the shortcomings of the old relief wells installed at the dam site showed that the main problems were: insufficient well numbers, insufficient well diameters, irregular well screens causing their blockage by time passing, and insufficient total opening area. Despite engineering difficulties and associated risk of downstream toe instability, installation of new relief wells was successfully completed under high <b>artesian</b> <b>flow</b> conditions ” was successfully completed. The employed technique for the construction of the new relief <b>wells</b> under <b>flowing</b> <b>artesian</b> conditions was based on: 1) cement grouting and casing of the well, 2) telescopic drilling, 3) application of appropriate drilling fluid, and 4) controlling the <b>artesian</b> <b>flow</b> by adding a long vertical pipe {{to the top of the}} relief wells. Numerical modeling of seepage for the Karkheh dam foundation showed that, as a result of the installation of the new relief wells, the safety factor of the downstream toe increased to the safe value of 1. 3 for the normal reservoir water level...|$|R

50|$|Until the 1970s {{there was}} a {{commercial}} watercress industry, run by the now-defunct Greatford Gardens Watercress Company, using water pumped from artesian bores reaching deep within the limestone strata of the Lincolnshire Wolds. In some years, the bores became naturally <b>flowing</b> <b>artesian</b> <b>wells</b> when pressure was sufficient to allow the water to reach the surface {{without the aid of}} pumps. Spring water with a slight alkalinity, such as that imparted by the limestone strata, is especially suitable for watercress. Some remnants of this industry can be found {{to the west of the}} old sluice gates, approximately eight hundred yards south of the Haven Inn. Other watercress beds owned by the company were located to the east of Ferry Road but have now been ploughed over and little evidence remains of their existence. At the eastern location, there were approximately twenty five watercress beds each ten yards wide by one hundred yards long. The beds were built with a slight gradient and water was directed through a channel into the highest end and then allowed flow gently down the length of the bed before leaving through a narrow opening at the lower end. The water then flowed into a channel which directed it into the Beck approximately fifty yards to the east of the Clew Gates. The watercress was gathered by hand and put onto wooden trays before being taken to a packing shed where it was divided into bundles, labelled and then the roots cut off. The bunches were then packed into wooden baskets, known as chips and transported by road to the rail and ferry centre at New Holland for delivery to customers. The severed roots were returned to the watercress bed where they were replanted. The company had similar watercress farms at Healing, Lincolnshire, Stamford, Lincolnshire and Fordingbridge, Hampshire. The company ceased its operations in Barrow Haven when it lost its water rights.|$|R

40|$|Three {{processes}} successively predominate in enlarging original fractures within limestone into cavern passages: (1) early dissolving by acid {{produced by}} oxidizing reactions within the groundwater as it {{flows through the}} limestone; (2) dissolving caused by the initial undersaturation with respect to calcite of the groundwater when it enters the limestone; and (3) increased dissolving which occurs at the transition from laminar to turbulent groundwater flow. Only those original fractures in limestone which are widest and which have a high hydraulic gradient acting across them will be enlarged into cavern passages. Until all available surface drainage has been diverted underground, cavern development takes place under a constant hydraulic head, {{and the rate of}} limestone solution increases with time. After all available surface drainage has been diverted underground, the discharge through the cave, rather than the hydraulic head, remains constant, and the rate of limestone solution decreases toward a constant value. These principles apply to caverns formed both by water-table <b>flow</b> and by <b>artesian</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{piezometric head}} in {{artesian}} groundwater oscillates remarkably due to oceanic tide. As is well known, {{the effect of}} the tide on the piezometric head prevails even in far inland. The artesian groundwater is generally a very good source of drinking water, because of the purification properties of the soils; it is also used for irrigation, and, where surface water is scarce, for industrial purposes. A large quantity of discharge from an aquifer produces a reduction in water pressure and therefore, at the same time, an increase in the effective stress in the soil skeleton of the porous medium. The latter produces land subsidence (or consolidation) and sea water may infiltrate into artesian groundwater. It is necessary to study the characteristics of the littoral <b>artesian</b> groundwater <b>flow</b> for preventing these groundwater pollution.
