5|$|Like most insects, beetles inhale <b>air,</b> <b>for</b> {{the oxygen}} it contains, and exhale carbon dioxide, via a {{tracheal}} system. Air enters the body through spiracles, and circulates within the haemocoel {{in a system}} of tracheae and tracheoles, through whose walls the gases can diffuse.|$|E

5|$|All {{vanadium}} compounds {{should be}} considered toxic. Tetravalent VOSO4 {{has been reported to}} be at least 5 times more toxic than trivalent V2O3. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide dust and 0.1 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace <b>air</b> <b>for</b> an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 35 mg/m3 of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health, that is, likely to cause permanent health problems or death.|$|E

5|$|At one time, stable carbenes {{were thought}} to {{reversibly}} dimerise through the so-called Wanzlick equilibrium. However, imidazol-2-ylidenes and triazol-5-ylidenes are thermodynamically stable and do not dimerise, and have been stored in solution {{in the absence of}} water and <b>air</b> <b>for</b> years. This is presumably due to the aromatic nature of these carbenes, which is lost upon dimerisation. In fact imidazol-2-ylidenes are so thermodynamically stable that only in highly constrained conditions are these carbenes forced to dimerise.|$|E

Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which hibernate in cold winters, survived twelve hours at −5°C to −8°C in laboratory experiments.|$|E

5|$|Mercury(II) oxide, {{the main}} oxide of mercury, arises when the metal {{is exposed to}} <b>air</b> <b>for</b> long periods at {{elevated}} temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400°C, as was demonstrated by Joseph Priestley in an early synthesis of pure oxygen. Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized, as they are for its neighbors gold and silver.|$|E

5|$|On 19 April, a new Jetstream 32 {{aircraft}} {{was taken into}} service. This allowed capacity to increase from 12 to 19 passengers, {{and at the same}} time travel time was reduced from 47 to 39 minutes. By September, the most popular departures were being booked full, and Vildanden asked Coast <b>Air</b> <b>for</b> a larger aircraft, with about 30 seats. In addition to allowing more passengers, larger planes would give higher comfort, and allow a more flexible ticket pricing scheme. An agreement with Danish Air Transport (DAT) to operate an ATR 42, with a capacity of 48 seats, was signed in mid-October.|$|E
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool <b>air</b> <b>for</b> a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
5|$|The D-21 was {{designed}} to carry a single high-resolution photographic camera over a preprogrammed path, then release the camera module into the <b>air</b> <b>for</b> retrieval, after which the drone would self-destruct. Following a fatal accident when launched from an M-21, the D-21 was modified to be launched from a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. Several test flights were made, followed by four unsuccessful operational D-21 flights over the People's Republic of China, and the program was canceled in 1971.|$|E

5|$|West Alsek was {{selected}} for a test program {{by the addition of}} coal pulverizers—units that crushed coal and mixed it with <b>air</b> <b>for</b> injection into the boilers.

West Alsek was later abandoned by the USSB and scrapped in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the <b>air</b> <b>for</b> balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E
