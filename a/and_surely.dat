5|$|At age 11, {{he came to}} the {{attention}} to the prefect of Grenoble, Joseph Fourier, who had accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte on the Egyptian expedition which had discovered the Rosetta Stone. An accomplished scholar in addition to a well known mathematical physicist, Fourier had been entrusted by Napoleon with the publication {{of the results of the}} expedition in the monumental series of publications titled Description de l'Égypte. One biographer has stated that Fourier invited the 11-year-old Champollion to his home and showed him his collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts and documents. Champollion was enthralled, and upon seeing the hieroglyphs and hearing that they were unintelligible, he declared that he would be the one to succeed in reading them. Whether or not the report of this visit is true, Fourier did go on to become one of Champollion's most important allies and supporters, <b>and</b> <b>surely</b> had an important role in instilling his interest in Ancient Egypt.|$|E

The first train—a construction engineers train—arrived in Key West on January 21, 1912, while Mr. Flagler's special train and other passenger trains arrived the next day, January 22, 1912, and that is considered the first day of service on the new route.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, Greig helped Packer {{by signing}} {{a number of}} English and foreign players he was acquainted with. Great secrecy cloaked these signings, {{although}} Greig dropped a number of hints to friends not involved. The touring Australians arrived in England and they were scheduled to play Greig's Sussex team on 7–10 May 1977. The match was ruined by poor weather, but at a party held at Greig's house during the match, two Australian journalists discovered the secret signings and the news became public. Although Greig had counted on a backlash, he was {{taken aback by the}} severity of the condemnation and vitriol that poured in his direction. His central role in the organisation of the breakaway troupe caused much annoyance <b>and</b> <b>surely</b> conflicted with his role as England captain. As the furore continued on, Greig became the focal point for critics, particularly because Packer was still an unknown in Britain. Finally, after a week of politicking, Greig was removed from the England captaincy.|$|E
25|$|Coen had {{previously}} ordered Admiral Janszoon to detach a few ships from the Manila blockade to join Reijersen's fleet, <b>and</b> <b>surely</b> enough, two Dutch and two English vessels waited outside Macau since 29 May. The four ships {{had tried to}} disrupt Macau's sea traffic {{while waiting for the}} invasion fleet to arrive, but they were not successful in capturing any Portuguese prize since Macau's leader at the time, Captain-Major of the Japan Voyage Lopo Sarmento de Carvalho, had hurriedly fitted seven junks with guns to provide escort. The invasion fleet arrived in sight of Macau on 21 June and rendezvoused with the four friendly ships there. According to Coen's directives, the English were free to join in maritime operations but were not allowed {{to take part in the}} landing or take any share of the spoils of victory. As a result, the English captains refused to commit their ships for the attack. Now Reijersen had thirteen ships under his command for the attack on Macau, totaling 1300 men, including a landing force of 800.|$|E

In London, only a few of his works were still being published. However, not everyone viewed Smart's [...] "madness" [...] as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, many times. A century later, Robert Browning later remarked that A Song to David was great because Smart was mad, and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats. It is no wonder that a few of his loyal friends did come to Mr. Potter's and freed him.|$|E

500|$|Frank Worrell {{became the}} first black captain of the West Indies cricket team prior to their 1960–61 tour of Australia. [...] The first Test of the five-match series ended in a tie, the first in the history of Test cricket. [...] Don Bradman remarked to Australia captain Richie Benaud, [...] "That is the {{greatest}} thing that's ever happened to the game". Evelyn Wellings described the Test as [...] "the Greatest Test Match, the Greatest Cricket Match <b>and</b> <b>surely</b> the Greatest Game ever played with a ball". [...] Despite that setback, with Benaud claiming the Australians had [...] "thrown away a match", they {{went on to win the}} series 2–1 with one drawn Test. [...] Former cricketer and journalist Johnny Moyes declared the series to be [...] "the most wonderful cricket tour Australia has known". [...] The West Indies team received acclaim for their performances, the whole series was played in a convivial manner, and the Australians, suitably impressed by Worrell, named the trophy after him.|$|E
500|$|After Lincoln was elected, Nicolay, who {{continued}} as Lincoln's private secretary, recommended that Hay be hired {{to assist him}} at the White House. [...] Lincoln {{is reported to have}} said, [...] "We can't take all Illinois with us down to Washington" [...] but then [...] "Well, let Hay come". Kushner and Sherrill were dubious about [...] "the story of Lincoln's offhand appointment of Hay" [...] as fitting well into Hay's self-image of never having been an office-seeker, but [...] "poorly into the realities of Springfield politics of the 1860s"—Hay must have expected some reward for handling Lincoln's correspondence for months. Hay biographer John Taliaferro suggests that Lincoln engaged Nicolay and Hay to assist him, rather than more seasoned men, both [...] "out of loyalty <b>and</b> <b>surely</b> because of the competence and compatibility that his two young aides had demonstrated". Historian Joshua Zeitz argues that Lincoln was moved to hire Hay when Milton agreed to pay his nephew's salary for six months.|$|E

500|$|Although {{he wrote}} his second set of hymns, Hymns [...] for the Amusement of Children, for a younger audience, Smart cares more about {{emphasizing}} the need for children to be moral instead of [...] "innocent". These works {{have been seen as}} possibly too complicated for [...] "amusement" [...] because they employ ambiguities and complicated theological concepts. In particular, Mark Booth questions [...] "why, in this carefully polished writing.... are the lines sometimes relatively hard to read for their paraphrasable sense?" [...] Arthur Sherbo disagreed with this sentiment strongly and claims the Hymns [...] "are more than mere hack work, tossed off with speed and indifference. They were written when Smart was in prison and despairing of rescue. Into these poems, some of them of a bare simplicity and naiveté that have few equals in literature of merit anywhere..." [...] However, he does admit some of the argument when he claims that [...] "Generosity", along with a handful other hymns, was [...] "not so simple <b>and</b> <b>surely</b> proved too much for the children for whom they were bought." ...|$|E

500|$|After being {{released}} from St Luke's, Smart {{was taken to a}} private madhouse. Elizabeth LeNoir, Smart's daughter, was brought to see her father and stated that he was [...] "committed by Mr Newbery to the care of a Mr Potter who kept a private house at Bethnal Green". She described her experience as being held in a [...] "small neat parlour". However, Mr Potter's private madhouse was not [...] "homely", and Smart's treatments were far worse, as he describes: [...] "For they work on me with their harping-irons, which is a barbarous instrument, because I am more unguarded than others" [...] (Jubilate Agno B 129). Smart was left alone for four years, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker who would come to see those deemed mad. Piozzi described Smart's general situation: [...] "He was both a wit and a scholar, and visited as such while under confinement for MADNESS." [...] It is very possible that he felt [...] "homeless" [...] during his confinement <b>and</b> <b>surely</b> felt that he was in a [...] "limbo... between public and private space" [...] from being watched by outsiders.|$|E

500|$|In {{this way}} Hazlitt {{demonstrated}} how poetry {{might be used}} to glorify tyranny and oppression, a tendency he saw disturbingly prominent in Coriolanus. A lifelong advocate of individual freedom and the cause of the people as against the oppression of aristocracy, the tyranny of [...] "legitimate" [...] monarchy, Hazlitt was disturbed by this tendency in the human imagination as expressed in poetry, and it was here that these misgivings first entered into his general theory of poetry. These thoughts were not particularly noticed for a century and a half, when critic John Kinnaird pointed out how curiously at odds with the more typical critical theories of poetry Hazlitt's idea was, setting him apart from contemporaries such as Wordsworth and Coleridge: [...] "Students of Hazlitt's thought have strangely neglected this passage, yet the idea it introduces is perhaps the most original, <b>and</b> <b>surely</b> the most heretical, idea in the entire range of his criticism." [...] Kinnaird notes that Lionel Trilling was the first critic to grasp the [...] "originality and importance of this passage", though even Trilling interpreted Hazlitt's idea of the human love of power in too narrow a sense.|$|E
500|$|A Wizard of Earthsea {{has strong}} {{elements}} of an epic; for instance, Ged's place in Earthsea history is described {{at the very}} beginning of the book in the following terms: [...] "some say the greatest, <b>and</b> <b>surely</b> the greatest voyager, was the man called Sparrowhawk, who in his day became both dragonlord and Archmage." [...] The story also begins with words from the Earthsea song [...] "The Creation of Éa", which forms a ritualistic beginning to the book. The teller of the story then goes on to say that it is from Ged's youth, thereby establishing context for the rest of the book. In comparison with the protagonists of many of Le Guin's other works, Ged is superficially a typical hero, a mage who sets out on a quest. Reviewers have compared A Wizard of Earthsea to epics such as Beowulf. Scholar Virginia White argued that the story followed a structure common to epics in which the protagonist begins an adventure, faces trials along the way, and eventually returns in triumph. White went on to suggest that this structure can be seen in the series as a whole, as well as in the individual volumes.|$|E
500|$|After {{the series}} finale, the Los Angeles Times {{characterized}} the series as [...] "an epic poem, with Jack Bauer {{in the role}} of Odysseus or Beowulf.

[...] The critic {{went on to say that}} villain Charles Logan encapsulated all that [...] "Jack and 24 fought against for so long: political corruption and cowardice, narcissism and megalomania, ruthlessness and stupidity." [...] One reviewer for BuddyTV said that [...] "I'll remember the legacy of 24 as an action drama that redefined what serialized television can do and provided many shocking twists and turns along the way—the biggest one being the very real impact the show had on American foreign policy." [...] The New York Times said [...] "24 will live on, possibly as a feature film, <b>and</b> <b>surely</b> in classrooms and in textbooks. The series enlivened the country's political discourse in a way few others have, partly because it brought to life the ticking time-bomb threat that haunted the Cheney faction of the American government in the years after 9/11."
