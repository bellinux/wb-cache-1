A less common set-up consists of two units grouped together with one common station auxiliary. As each turbine generator unit has its own attached unit <b>auxiliary</b> <b>transformer,</b> it {{is connected to the}} circuit automatically. For starting the unit, the auxiliaries are supplied with power by another unit (<b>auxiliary)</b> <b>transformer</b> or station <b>auxiliary</b> <b>transformer.</b> The period of switching from the first unit transformer to the next unit is designed for automatic, instantaneous operation in times when the emergency power system needs to kick in. It is imperative that the power to unit auxiliaries not fail during a station shutdown (an occurrence known as black-out when all regular units temporarily fail). Instead, during shutdowns the grid is expected to remain operational. When problems occur, it is usually due to reverse power relays and frequency-operated relays on grid lines due to severe grid disturbances. Under these circumstances, the emergency station supply must kick in to avoid damage to any equipment and to prevent hazardous situations such as the release of hydrogen gas from generators to the local environment.|$|R

Two techniques can be distinguished in X-ray medical imaging: fluoroscopy and radioscopy.
