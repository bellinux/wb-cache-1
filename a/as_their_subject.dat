25|$|Ashton {{initially}} approached Sir William Walton {{to compose}} the score for Ondine. They had worked together before, on a ballet called The Quest for the Sadler's Wells company in 1943, {{and agreed to}} collaborate again for the 1955–56 season; they decided on Macbeth <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>subject.</b> Fonteyn, however, was firmly opposed to playing Lady Macbeth, and was not enthused by Ashton's next suggestion, Miranda in a ballet of The Tempest. By the time Ashton had lighted on Ondine as an alternative, Walton was immersed in work on a concerto. He suggested that his friend Henze be approached. Accordingly, the music was commissioned from Henze, who titled the score Undine.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of film, New York City was {{characterized}} as urbane and sophisticated. By the city's crisis period in the 1970s and early 1980s, however, films like Midnight Cowboy, The French Connection, Dog Day Afternoon, Taxi Driver, Marathon Man, Cruising, Dressed to Kill, and Death Wish showed New York as full of chaos and violence. With the city's renaissance in the 1980s and 1990s came new portrayals on television; Friends, Seinfeld, and Sex and the City showed life in the city to be glamorous and interesting. Nonetheless a disproportionate number of crime dramas, such as Law & Order, continue to make criminality in the city <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> even as New York has become the safest large city in the United States in the last two decades.|$|E
25|$|Another anecdote of {{the time}} had it that Pantazi Ghica was deeply resented by Domnitor Carol. According to the story, this was sparked by one of Carol's hunting trips in the {{vicinity}} of Buzău. Ghica, who was charged with organizing the event, allegedly thought he could gain more favor with the monarch by using a bear which, unbeknown to Carol, had been previously tamed by Romani trainers (see Ursari). Carol found out that this was the case, and, feeling insulted, ordered Pantazi Ghica to be relieved from his office of prefect. The short-lived magazine Satyrul once accused Ghica of having plagiarized for his Iadeş, and of having only added a dog as a character to separate his text from the source. As a result, a series of satirical lithographs, with Pantazi Ghica <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>subject,</b> showed a hunchback man {{in the company of a}} hunchback dog. Jokes about his medical condition even made it into the Chamber: a fellow deputy once made a public reference to Pantazi Ghica's arched spine, to which Ghica replied that it seemed arched because he only presented such colleagues with his back.|$|E

25|$|Wittgenstein's {{suggestion}} (PI, §66) {{about the}} impossibility of formulating a definition of games portrays a predicament for disciplines, which entail games <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> matter, because it denies the possibility to know what games are. One possible solution is {{to point out that}} Wittgenstein merely acts out his failing attempt to define the concept of game, because he wanted to demonstrate a mechanism of language. He wasn't particularly concerned about games, nor about the concept of 'game', but he was interested in the consequence of a definitory failure. The demonstration aims to show, that {{there is no reason to}} search for real definitions, which describe essential attributes of things, but rather nominal definitions, which describe the use of the term in a community. He connected this idea to language games – lingual expressions combined with action – as a more adequate alternative to explain the function of language. Confusing this is his choice to denominate the approach (PI, §7) as 'language games', further fueling the impression that he provides insights about the concept of game. Wittgenstein wasn't interested in games but in language, therefore his theories and examples are only superficially related to academic disciplines with games as subject matter.|$|E
25|$|During the 1050s and 1060s, {{there were}} two centres of Norman power in {{southern}} Italy: one at Melfi (under the Hautevilles) and another at Aversa (under the Drengots). Richard Drengot became ruler of the County of Aversa in 1049, beginning a policy of territorial aggrandisement to compete with his Hauteville rivals. At first he warred with his Lombard neighbours, who included Pandulf VI of Capua, Atenulf I of Gaeta and Gisulf II of Salerno. Richard pushed back the borders of Salerno until there was little left of the once-great principality but the city of Salerno itself. Although he tried to extend his influence peacefully by betrothing his daughter to the oldest son of Atenulf of Gaeta, when the boy died before the marriage he still demanded the Lombard dower from the boy's parents. When the duke refused, Richard seized Aquino (one of Gaeta's few remaining fiefs) in 1058. However, the chronology of his conquest of Gaeta is confusing. Documents from 1058 and 1060 refer to Jordan (Richard's oldest son) as Duke of Gaeta, but these have been disputed as forgeries (since Atenulf was still duke {{when he died in}} 1062). After Atenulf's death, Richard and Jordan took over the rule of the duchy and allowed Atenulf's heir—Atenulf II—to rule <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> until 1064 (when Gaeta was fully incorporated into the Drengot principality). Richard and Jordan appointed puppet, usually Norman, dukes.|$|E

The project was a collaboration between artist Derek Hampson and geographer Gary Priestnall. Hampson chose Chat Moss <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> because of its 19th-century historical significance as the site of the world's first passenger railway and its [...] "anti-picturesque appearance", a [...] "nondescript landscape of stumpy trees and expanses of grass".

500|$|Works in the Brushstrokes series depict brushstrokes <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>subject.</b> [...] However, {{rather than}} present {{the use of}} the {{delicate}} artist paint brush, Lichtenstein created the strokes of the broad house-painter's brush. His works both turned a mundane household task into a planned artistic operation and made a time-consuming task appear as if it were produced mechanically in an instant. [...] The Brushstroke series paintings [...] "...contain the clear outline, process colors, and Benday-dot screen of the comic strip, but like the landscapes, they exchew narrative in favor of reducing a subject (in this case, painting) to its most basic symbol (the brushstroke)."

500|$|By this time, Dylan and Baez were {{prominent}} {{in the civil rights}} movement, singing together at the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Dylan's third album, The Times They Are a-Changin', reflected a more politicized and cynical Dylan. The songs often took <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> matter contemporary stories, with [...] "Only a Pawn in Their Game" [...] addressing the murder of civil rights worker Medgar Evers; and the Brechtian [...] "The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll" [...] the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger. On a more general theme, [...] "Ballad of Hollis Brown" [...] and [...] "North Country Blues" [...] addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, [...] "Boots of Spanish Leather" [...] and [...] "One Too Many Mornings". During the Nashville Skyline sessions in 1969, Dylan and Johnny Cash recorded a duet of the song which has not been released.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{books and}} films have taken war at sea <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>subject,</b> often dealing with real or fictionalised {{incidents}} in the Second World War. Nicholas Monsarrat's 1951 novel The Cruel Sea follows {{the lives of a}} group of Royal Navy sailors fighting the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II; it was made into a 1952 film of the same name. The novelist Herman Wouk, reviewing [...] "five best nautical yarns", writes that [...] "The Cruel Sea was a major best seller and became a hit movie starring Jack Hawkins. Its authenticity is unmistakable... His description of a torpedoed crew, terrified, clinging to life rafts in the blackest of nights, is, indeed, too authoritative for comfort—we soon feel ourselves in that sea." [...] Anthony Asquith used a dramatised documentary style in his 1943 film We Dive at Dawn, while Noël Coward and David Lean's 1942 In Which We Serve combined information with drama. Pat Jackson's 1944 Western Approaches was, unusually for the time, shot in Technicolor, at sea in rough weather and sometimes actually in battle. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's 1956 The Battle of the River Plate tells a tale of [...] "gentlemanly gallantry" [...] of the scuttling of the Admiral Graf Spee. A very different message, of [...] "duplicitous diplomacy [...] flawed intelligence" [...] is the theme of Richard Fleischer, Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku's $22 million epic Tora! Tora! Tora!
