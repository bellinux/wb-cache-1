5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that human {{resources}} are <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> any research and innovation policy, the Medium Term Plan 2011–2015 did not discuss any explicit policy for promoting postgraduate studies {{in science and engineering}}. The scarcity of new PhDs in science and engineering fields from the University of Zimbabwe in 2013 was symptomatic of this omission.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Oregon, Mulder and Skinner {{travel to}} the woods, {{equipped}} with lasers for finding the UFO. Noticing a spot where the lasers cease in mid-air, Mulder walks through the force field. He finds and joins a group of abductees, including Billy and Theresa, standing below <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> light from a UFO; they are soon accosted by the Bounty Hunter. Mulder is abducted with the group while a stunned Skinner witnesses the UFO's departure.|$|E
5|$|Flambeau C (b. 1971) became <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> the French show jumping {{team in the}} 1980s. He {{participated in}} the 1984 Summer Olympics, where he took 7th individually, and the 1988 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal with the French team. The 1980s also saw the rise of Jappeloup (1975–1991), a small black horse with a {{conformation}} and gaits that were considered disadvantageous for show jumping. Despite this, he had an impressive jumping style, and won two French championships in 1982 and 1986, a European championship in 1987, several team medals at the European and World Championships, and a {{gold medal at the}} 1988 Summer Olympics with rider Pierre Durand, Jr.|$|E

5|$|Graves was <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> the Los Alamos community. He was {{an active}} member of the non-denominational Protestant Community Church. With the {{encouragement}} of Elizabeth, who played the violin, he learned to play the cello, hoarding his petrol ration stamps so that he could travel to Santa Fe, New Mexico, for lessons. He played in the Los Alamos Symphony, accompanying local performances of Gilbert and Sullivan and Handel's Messiah. He was chairman of the board of the local bank, and a member of the local school board.|$|E
5|$|Liebknecht and Bernstein, {{like the}} left wing of the party, felt the general strike {{should not be used}} to provoke the state but rather to defend {{political}} rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, speaking for the FVdG, advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon {{in the hands of the}} proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his speech on the topic was even more radical. He claimed that historical materialism, <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> Marxism, was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism—which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions. He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin's writings rather than Marx's works, which were most influential in the SPD.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force tracks {{a larger}} UFO as it hovers over Townsend. The {{invisible}} alien enters Max's trailer and abducts him. When the agents visit the trailer and find Max missing, an Army radio transmission reveals {{that he has}} been transported to a waterfront. They race to save Max as Henderson's men scour the area searching for him. The alien kills two soldiers who encounter Max, causing him to flee into a warehouse. As Mulder finds Max inside, the building is surrounded by Henderson's forces. Mulder tries to comfort Max, but is attacked and injured by the alien. Mulder then sees Max floating in <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> light before vanishing. When Henderson finds that Max is missing, he orders Mulder arrested.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens with}} {{a vision of the}} player's {{character}} wielding a blade of light to strike down a masked man in black robes. The vision is a dream the player has while on a carriage ride to their chosen starting city—Gridania, Ul'dah, or Limsa Lominsa. Players returning from the original release appear in a forest in <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> light—Louisoix's final spell to save their lives from the devastation at Carteneau. Through undertaking various odd jobs, the player character ingratiates him or herself with the local Adventurer's Guild and earns comparisons with the fabled Warriors of Light, brave adventurers who participated in the Battle of Carteneau whose identities have been mysteriously erased from the memories of all who knew them. A pattern emerges amid these quests involving a series of attacks by masked men, as well {{as a member of the}} Scions of the Seventh Dawn who claims to know the origin of the player's visions. The adventurer meets the leader of this secret society, Minfilia, who reveals that the visions are a manifestation of the Echo and mark the player as a chosen representative of Hydaelyn, the Mothercrystal.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, which were more typical action role-playing games, Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler, {{and the majority of}} the gameplay takes place in selected locations rather than on an open world map. The player selects these areas on the world map to reach them. The primary objective in each location is to clear the dungeon of monsters. Each dungeon is divided into different randomly generated floors, and to progress between each zone, the player must find an item called a Gleamdrop, then carry it to <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> light called a Gleamwell. The player must repeat this process on each floor of the dungeon until the last floor is reached, where a boss monster lies. The player can not return to previous floors unless they die or leave the dungeon; upon returning, they start the dungeon over at the beginning. When not clearing dungeons, the player stays in the Mana Village, which contains shops to purchase equipment. Dungeons can be returned to later by accepting quests from townsfolk in the Dudbear shop. During these quests, the dungeon itself is slightly altered: the player's starting position may be different, the number of floors can change, and the monsters and boss monster contained may change. Like the main quests, Dudbear quests involve clearing the dungeon of monsters, sometimes to acquire an item {{from the end of the}} dungeon.|$|E

The new 3 -pillar system features <b>a</b> first <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> universal state pension, <b>a</b> second <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> funded supplementary pension and <b>a</b> third <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> independent pension savings. The paper reviews the new pension {{system and the}} early experience. It also brings up a number of unsettled issues, in part stemming from the interplay between the pension and taxation systems. Albeit the new pension scheme has been successfully implemented, it is excessively complex and non-transparent. Certain groups could experience inadequate pension coverage. The public finances are {{in the short term}} adversely affected by lower payroll and income tax revenue. Any longer-term effects on economic performance are very uncertain and likely to stem primarily from changes in the labour supply. Pension reform, payroll taxes, savings, incentive effects...|$|R
