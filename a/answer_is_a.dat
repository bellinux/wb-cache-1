5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version {{of the problem in}} which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, and the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E
25|$|The {{examination}} is of 3 hours duration, {{and contains}} {{a total of}} 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both multiple choice questions (four answer options out of which the correct {{one has to be}} chosen) and numerical answer type questions (<b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse). Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} seven episodes of the season, Maureen Ryan of Variety gave {{positive}} thoughts on Jessica Jones, stating, [...] "The show, which features an exceptional performance from Krysten Ritter and sure-handed guidance from executive producer Melissa Rosenberg, {{is not just a}} contender for the title Best Marvel-related TV property; in a supremely crowded TV scene, {{it is one of the}} year’s most distinctive new dramas." [...] Jack Shepard of The Independent, also on {{the first seven}} episodes, felt the season [...] "not only matches [...] but exceeds expectations." [...] Shepard gave exceptional praise to Tennant's Kilgrave, feeling he was one of the best villains produced by Marvel, and possibly [...] "the best on-screen comic book villain since Heath Ledger’s Joker." [...] Forbes Merrill Barr stated that after seeing the first seven episodes, [...] "the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> resounding yes" [...] if lightning could strike twice for Marvel Television, claiming, [...] "In no uncertain terms, Jessica Jones is the best thing Marvel Television has ever produced. It contains all the hopeful anticipation of [...] S.H.I.E.L.D., all the feminist-overtones of Agent Carter and all the grittiness of Daredevil." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{differential}} equations, {{the function}} [...] {{is often used}} to simplify solutions, even if the final <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> real function involving sine and cosine.

2500|$|A crossnumber (also {{known as}} a cross-figure) is the {{numerical}} analogy of a crossword, in which the solutions to the clues are numbers instead of words. [...] Clues are usually arithmetical expressions, but can also be general knowledge clues to which the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> number or year. There are also numerical fill-in crosswords.|$|E

2500|$|The PSNI's Chief Constable Matt Baggott {{blamed the}} {{violence}} on the UVF for [...] "orchestrating violence for their own selfish motives. Everyone involved needs to step back.

2500|$|For instance, {{the puzzle}} Eight Isn't Enough by Matt Gaffney gives the clue [...] "This week’s contest <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> three-word phrase whose second word is “or.”". The crossword {{solution}} includes the entries [...] "BROUGHT TO NAUGHT", [...] "MIGHT MAKES RIGHT", [...] "CAUGHT A STRAIGHT", and [...] "HEIGHT AND WEIGHT", {{which are all}} three-word phrases with two words ending in -ght. The solution to the meta is a similar phrase in which the middle word is [...] "or": [...] "FIGHT OR FLIGHT".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the media}} outcry, an {{independent}} study speculated that Saints' players may have pretended to participate {{off the field}} but not put the tactics into action on the field. [...] "If the Saints tended to injure more players, then teams that played them would tend to list more injuries the following week. To test whether the Saints injured more players than a typical team, one need only compare the number of players added to injury reports after a Saints game to the league-wide average. Did the New Orleans Saints injure more players? The data-driven <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> resounding [...] "no." [...] The Saints appear to have injured far fewer players over the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. The numbers are striking." ...|$|E

2500|$|Skinner's book, Walden Two, {{presents}} {{a vision of}} a decentralized, localized society, which applies a practical, scientific approach and behavioral expertise to deal peacefully with social problems. (For example, his views led him to oppose corporal punishment in schools, and he {{wrote a letter to the}} California Senate that helped lead it to a ban on spanking.) Skinner's utopia is both a thought experiment and a rhetorical piece. In Walden Two, Skinner answers the problem that exists in many utopian novels – [...] "What is the Good Life?" [...] The book's <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> life of friendship, health, art, a healthy balance between work and leisure, a minimum of unpleasantness, and a feeling that one has made worthwhile contributions to a society in which resources are ensured, in part, by minimizing consumption.|$|E
2500|$|Abbreviations, {{the use of}} {{a foreign}} language, variant spellings, or other unusual word tricks are {{indicated}} in the clue. A crossword creator might choose to clue the answer SEN (as in the abbreviation for [...] "senator") as [...] "Washington bigwig: Abbr." [...] or [...] "Member of Cong.", with the abbreviation in the clue indicating that the answer is to be similarly abbreviated. The use of [...] "Var." [...] indicates the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> variant spelling (e.g., EMEER instead of EMIR), while the use of foreign language or a foreign place name within the clue indicates that the answer is also in a foreign language. For example, ETE ( [...] , French for [...] "summer") might be clued as [...] "Summer, in the Sorbonne". ROMA could be clued as [...] "Italia's capital", whereas the clue [...] "Italy's capital" [...] would indicate the English spelling Rome.|$|E
2500|$|James J. Sheehan in The New York Times {{wrote that}} Kershaw clears away various misconceptions {{of the period}} and {{describes}} the terrible fate endured by the civilian population. He also wrote, [...] "No one has written a better account of the human dimensions of Nazi Germany’s end." [...] Antony Beevor in the Telegraph wrote that the subject matter is doubly important due to the massive loss {{of life in the}} final months of the war, all to no purpose. However, Ben Shepard wrote in The Guardian that the book was flawed, saying, [...] "The real difficulty with The End is that its premise is false. It simply isn't true that no one has dealt adequately with the question of why Germany kept fighting. On the contrary, historians have discussed this issue ad nauseam; Kershaw himself gave an excellent account in his monumental biography of Hitler." [...] David Cesarani called the book a [...] "magisterial summing up of the events" [...] and that [...] "it cannot be bettered for relentless analysis". Jill Stephenson, a professor emeritus of the University of Edinburgh, asked, [...] "Do we need another book on the Second World War? In general, no. But in this particular case, the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> resounding 'yes'." ...|$|E

60|$|There can be {{no doubt}} that the {{behaviour}} of the French priests in this war has enormously diminished anti-clerical bitterness in France. There {{can be no}} doubt that France is far more a religious country than it was before the war. But if you ask whether that means any return to the church, any reinstatement of the church, the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> doubtful one. Religion and the simple priest are stronger in France to-day; the church, I think, is weaker.|$|E

60|$|Thus we {{see even}} our faith is not ours in its origin: {{but is the}} faith of the Son of God graciously communicated to us. Beware, therefore, that you do not {{frustrate}} the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain. If, therefore, we are saved by charity, we are saved by the keeping of the Law, which doctrine St. Paul declared to be an apostacy from Christ, and a bewitching of the soul from the truth. But, you will perhaps say, can a man be saved without charity?--The <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> <b>a</b> man without charity cannot be saved: {{the faith of the}} Son of God is not in him.|$|E
