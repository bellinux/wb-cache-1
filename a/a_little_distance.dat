This was the only part of London with an underground tram system, and Holborn tramway station (named Great Queen Street when first opened) is still extant beneath ground, though with no public access.|$|E

The area surrounding this is scattered with decrepit gates, graves and a large slum area. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>distance</b> from this place is the tomb of Shiekh Farid Murtaza Khan, who during Emperor Akbar’s period, was credited with building a number of Serai's, a mosque and Faridabad village, which is now the presentday large city in Haryana.|$|E

25|$|In 1846 the proprietors {{determined}} {{the need to}} improve their railway for ordinary locomotive use. Part of this process involved easing some of the very sharp curves on the line. This process included providing a new viaduct to cross the River Irvine, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>distance</b> south of the first viaduct. This second bridge was wooden; it was located where the river banks were lower than at the first viaduct, and elevated approaches were needed. Little detail of this second viaduct has survived.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Randolph {{goes to the}} House booted and spurred, {{with his}} whip in hand, in imitation, it is said, {{of members of the}} British Parliament. He is a very slight man but of the common stature. At <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>distance,</b> he does not appear older than you are; but, upon a nearer approach, you {{perceive}} his wrinkles and grey hairs. He is, I believe, about thirty. He is a descendant in the right line from the celebrated Indian Princess, Pochahontas. The Federalists ridicule and affect to despise him; but a despised foe often proves a dangerous enemy. His talents are certainly far above mediocrity. As a popular speaker, he is not inferior to any man in the House. I admire his ingenuity and address; but I dislike his politics.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday, 18 April 1967 {{at about}} 2.31pm, a wagon on a goods train of 69 empty mineral wagons, {{travelling}} on the down line to Northampton, derailed {{just south of}} the village. The train travelled a further 1½ miles before more wagons derailed, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>distance</b> north of the village playing field. Some of the wagons went towards the up line from Northampton to London and were hit by a four-coach passenger train at about 70mph. Although the brakes of the passenger train had been fully applied, two coaches were derailed with one falling onto its side. All 45 passengers and train crew were evacuated fairly promptly. Of these, 21 were injured but only two were detained at Northampton General Hospital. The driver of the passenger train was seriously injured but both he and the passenger detained overnight made a good recovery.|$|E

500|$|A Billboard staff {{reviewer}} {{noted that}} the story [...] "turned out {{to be less than}} pure fiction when the singer later went through personal problems in the very public eye." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post rated the video a C+ and stated that: [...] "Britney's first Hollywood cautionary tale video didn't seem quite as telling at the time, but with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>distance,</b> the lyrics and concept seem so much sadder". A writer of Rolling Stone said that [...] "Lucky" [...] is best known for [...] "being the first Spears video to focus on what would become a recurring theme: her conflicted relationship to fame".|$|E
500|$|Stirling was {{concerned}} by {{the proximity of the}} coast and hailed Pique with orders to anchor before it grounded, but Milne did not hear the order correctly and instead increased sail, lurching ahead of Jason and straight onto a sandbank close to La Tranche-sur-Mer on the Vendée coast. Seine too had struck the shore <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>distance</b> ahead, and Stirling was unable to arrest Jasons momentum before his ship too became stuck, lying between Pique and Seine. The French ship had been badly damaged in the crash, all three masts collapsing overboard at impact, but actually lay in a stronger position: Jason blocked Piques arc of fire and Stirling's ship had swung with the rising tide, leaving its stern exposed. Bigot took advantage of this position to fire several raking broadsides into Jason, during which Stirling was wounded and command passed to Lieutenant Charles Inglis. Inglis responded to the fire by cutting stern gunports to fire chase guns at Seine, and Milne succeeded in dragging his frigate around through the novel expedient of ordering his men to run towards the bows carrying round shot. This sudden shift in weight gently rotated the grounded ship to face Seine and Milne could direct four of his 12-pounder long guns at the French ship. [...] Under fire and with Mermaid finally approaching, Bigot determined that further resistance was hopeless and struck his colours.|$|E

500|$|The album {{opens with}} Cole's cover of Fiona Apple's [...] "Criminal" [...] (1997). Len Righi of The Morning Call wrote {{that she was}} {{surprised}} at Cole's ability to transform the [...] "agonizing, brazen lament" [...] into [...] "a funky, Tina Turner-type, rump-shaker." [...] The second track is a cover of Neil Young's 1972 single [...] "Old Man"; David Munk called it [...] "a personal rumination on her father". The third song, a cover of Aretha Franklin's [...] "Day Dreaming" [...] (1972), was recorded after Austin sang it in the studio. Cole said she [...] "added {{a little bit of}} a hip-hop feel to it". Richard Harrington of The Washington Post felt that the fourth track, a cover of Shelby Lynne's [...] "Leavin'" [...] (1999), [...] "metaphorically put <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>distance</b> between the original R diva and the pop star Cole". The fifth song is a cover of Ronnie Dyson's 1976 track [...] "The More You Do it (The More I Like It Done to Me)"; NPR's Jason King attributes the inclusion of [...] "the saucy but largely forgotten Yancy-Jackson mid-'70s track" [...] to his suggestion to Cole's A director. The song contains a homage to Cole's 1975 single [...] "This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)". The seventh track is a cover of Dobie Gray's 1973 single [...] "Loving Arms" [...] (here titled [...] "Lovin' Arms"), which Verve Records marketed as inspired by Etta James, allowing Cole [...] "the opportunity to move back to her 70's roots with rich, shimmering vocals".|$|E

Whether he had moved up to challenge the Union riders or to scout out a better position for his company as some accounts suggest, Marr was not in the immediate presence or line of sight of any of his men on the very dark night when he fell in the dense field. Soon, no one knew where he was or what may have happened to him. His body was found in the clover field later in the morning.|$|E
2500|$|Baruch's grave {{became the}} subject of later legends. According to a Muslim {{tradition}} reported by sources including Petachiah of Ratisbon, an Arabian king once ordered it to be opened; but all who touched it fell dead. The king thereupon commanded the Jews to open it; and they, after preparing themselves by a three days' fast, succeeded without a mishap. Baruch's body was found intact in a marble coffin, and appeared {{as if he had just}} died. The king ordered that it should be transported to another place; but, after having dragged the coffin <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>distance,</b> the horses and camels were unable to move it another inch. The king, greatly excited by these wonders, went with his retinue to Muhammad to ask his advice. Arrived at Mecca, his doubts of the truth of the teachings of Islam greatly increased, and he and his courtiers finally accepted Judaism. The king then built a [...] "bet ha-midrash" [...] on the spot from which he had been unable to move Baruch's body; and this academy served for a long time as a place of pilgrimage.|$|E
