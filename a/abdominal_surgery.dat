At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season, Miller was named the winner of several Kings team awards: best defenseman, best defensive player and the teams unsung hero. During the playoffs, he went pointless while playing in all seven of the Kings' games. <b>Abdominal</b> <b>surgery</b> and a broken foot limited Miller to 49 games with the Kings the next season, recording one goal and five assists for six points.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Zayat Stables' horses Bodemeister {{and then}} Paynter ran second {{in each of}} the three legs of the Triple Crown. Bodemeister {{finished}} a narrow second place in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes to I'll Have Another. Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes, Zayat's colt Paynter also finished second. Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near-fatal complications from colitis and laminitis. Zayat authorized the highest quality of care for the horse, and following <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgery</b> and several months of rehabilitation, Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013. After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag #PowerUpPaynter, the horse developed a significant fan base, and received hundreds of get well cards, many from children. For his struggle to return to health, Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E

On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm {{was only the beginning}} of a series of health problems that plagued the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgery</b> to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a hernia. Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road. The band brought along eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album. The final three performances of the tour were filmed at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia and released in home video form as Road Movie.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Studies were {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate whether}} different <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgeries</b> could benefit from early enteral feeding. Early feeding improves the outcomes of patients with trauma and burns, although {{few studies have examined}} its use after surgeries. This study compares an early regular diet to conventional postoperative dietary management to determine GI complications after <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgeries.</b> The aim of the study is to analyse and compare early enteral feeding with conventional postoperative dietary management to access complications after <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgeries.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS Place of study- Department of General Surgery, Chennai Medical College and Research Centre. Period of study- Between January 2015 to February 2017. Totally, 50 patients who had undergone various <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgeries</b> in that 25 cases are subjected to study and remaining 25 were control objects. RESULTS The results of our study the effect of enteral feeding analysed by the main outcome measures like vomiting, wound infection, mortality showed significant betterment to the control group. The length of the hospital stay was relatively less. CONCLUSION This study provides evidence to support the use of enteral feeding in surgical patients and indicate no increased morbidity or mortality. For early enteral nutrition to be effective, it must actually be received and tolerated by the patient. ...|$|R

25|$|The most {{prevalent}} response to latex is an allergic contact dermatitis, a delayed hypersensitive reaction appearing as dry, crusted lesions. This reaction usually lasts 48–96 hours. Sweating or rubbing the area under the glove aggravates the lesions, possibly leading to ulcerations.

25|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} (a {{condition in}} which the body contains excess amounts of cortisol) may also influence childhood obesity. Researchers analyzed two isoforms (proteins that have the same purpose as other proteins, but are programmed by different genes) in the cells of 16 adults undergoing <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgery.</b> They discovered that one type of isoform created oxo-reductase activity (the alteration of cortisone to cortisol) and this activity increased 127.5 pmol mg sup when the other type of isoform was treated with cortisol and insulin. The activity of the cortisol and insulin can possibly activate Cushing's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Ileus is {{the lack}} of {{motility}} of the intestines, leading to a functional obstruction. It often occurs postoperatively following any type of <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgery,</b> and 10–50% of all cases of surgical colic will develop this complication, including 88% of horses with a strangulating obstructions and 41% of all colics with a large intestinal lesion. The exact cause is unknown, but is suspected to be due to inflammation of the intestine, possibly a result of manipulation by the surgeon, and increased sympathetic tone. It has a high fatality rate of 13–86%.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND A {{revolution}} {{in the management of}} acute postoperative pain has occurred during the past three decades. The transverse abdominis plane block is a peripheral nerve block used to provide analgesia to anterior and lateral abdominal wall. By introducing local anaesthetic to transverse abdominis plane via the triangle of Petit, it is possible to block the sensory nerves of the anterior abdominal wall before they leave this plane and pierce the musculature to innervate the entire anterior abdominal wall. TAP block provides excellent pain relief especially in lower <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgeries.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS An observational study is carried out in sixty patients who underwent lower <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgeries</b> and who were given TAP block or traditional parenteral analgesia, 30 in each group. All patients in the study group were scheduled for postoperative pain monitoring using numerical rating scale at specific times 2 / 6 / 12 / 24 hours postoperatively. RESULTS Considering socioeconomic data, {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups with regard to age, sex and weight (p> 0. 05). Among clinical variables, the test and control group were comparable with respect to ASA physical status and haemodynamic parameters (p> 0. 05). There was significant difference in the pain scores of the 2 groups at 2, 6 and 12 hours, but at 24 hours, the pain scores were not significant. CONCLUSION We conclude that TAP block is an effective method of providing postoperative analgesia in patients who undergo lower <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgeries</b> and we recommend the same for all patients undergoing lower <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgeries...</b>|$|R

25|$|This form of colic {{is usually}} managed medically. Because {{there is no}} motility, {{intestinal}} contents back up into the stomach. Therefore, periodic decompression of the stomach though nasogastric intubation is essential to prevent rupture. Horses are monitored closely following <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgery,</b> and a sudden increase in heart rate indicates the need to check for nasogastric reflux, as it is an early indication of postoperative ileus.

40|$|Background: Ultrasound-guided {{transversus abdominis}} plane (TAP) block has {{recently}} come up as a modality {{to take care}} of postoperative pain. It can somewhat avoid the use of intravenous opioid analgesics and hence to avoid its complications. We have performed a prospective, double-blinded, randomized study to assess the analgesic effect of adding dexmedetomidine to local ropivacaine on TAP block for patients undergoing lower <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Aim: The aim is to assess whether addition of dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine may bring some improvements to the analgesic efficacy of TAP blocks in patients undergoing lower <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on forty patients undergoing lower <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgeries</b> under general anesthesia. The patients were divided into two groups: one receiving plain ropivacaine (Group 1) and other receiving ropivacaine with dexmedetomidine (Group 2) during TAP block. The patients in the two groups were compared for age, sex, body mass index, incidence of postoperative nausea, and vomiting and pain as measured on visual analog scale (VAS). Results: There was significantly lower pain score on VAS at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 h in Group 2 than in Group 1. Conclusion: The addition of dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine during TAP block improves analgesic effect of TAP block and prolongs the duration of analgesia as well...|$|R

25|$|Colic in horses {{is defined}} as {{abdominal}} pain, {{but it is a}} clinical sign rather than a diagnosis. The term colic can encompass all forms of gastrointestinal conditions which cause pain as well as other causes of abdominal pain not involving the gastrointestinal tract.

There are a variety of different causes of colic, some of which can prove fatal without surgical intervention. Colic surgery is usually an expensive procedure as it is major <b>abdominal</b> <b>surgery,</b> often with intensive aftercare.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Keyless <b>abdominal</b> rope-lifting <b>surgery</b> is a novel, gasless, single-incision lapa-roscopic {{surgical}} technique. In {{this study}} we aimed to compare the postoperative pain from keyless abdomi-nal rope-lifting surgery with carbon dioxide laparos-copy performed for benign ovarian cysts. Methods: During a 20 -month period, 77 women under-went surgery for a benign ovarian cyst. Keyless <b>abdominal</b> rope-lifting <b>surgery</b> and conventional carbon dioxide lap-aroscopy techniques {{were used for the}} operations in 32 women and 45 women, respectively. The 2 operative techniques were compared with regard to demographic characteristics; preoperative, intraoperative, and postop-erative data including early postoperative pain scores; and frequency of shoulder pain and analgesic requirements. Results: Data regarding demographic characteristics, pre-operative findings, cyst diameters and rupture rates, intra-abdominal adhesions, intraoperative blood loss, and post-operative hospital stay did not differ between groups (P. 05). However, the mean operative and abdominal access times were significantly longer in the keyless <b>abdominal</b> rope-lifting <b>surgery</b> group (P. 05). Visual analog scale pain scores at initially and at the second, fourth, and 24 th hours of the postoperative period were significantly lower in the keyless <b>abdominal</b> rope-lifting <b>surgery</b> group (P. 05). Similarly, keyless <b>abdominal</b> rope-lifting <b>surgery</b> caused significantly less shoulder pain and additional an-algesic use (P. 05). Conclusion: Keyless <b>abdominal</b> rope-lifting <b>surgery</b> seems to cause less pain in the management of benign ovarian cysts in comparison with conventional carbon dioxide laparoscopy...|$|R
