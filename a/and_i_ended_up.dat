I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E

This pod exploded <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> with what was supposed to be a terrible alien growth on my face. Come lunchtime and we all went off to the pub. Of course, I couldn't take this stuff off, the makeup was too complex; the landlord refused to serve me.” ...|$|E

McGee {{had to learn to}} walk, speak and function again after his first overdose. McGee said that his path into drug and alcohol abuse began when he started to hang out with [...] "the wrong people - drinking, partying." [...] After suffering an injury to his clavicle and elbow, McGee became dependent to painkillers, which he later mixed with alcohol. McGee had taken cocaine and heroin before overdosing.

40|$|In Chapter One, David Teece {{examines}} "orthodox" {{economics and}} finds it not very useful for {{answering questions about}} organizational strategy. In this chapter (and in Camerer, 1984), I examine "orthodox" strategy research and find it lacking in economic rigor. Teece <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> endorsing remarkably similar research agendas, though we take opposite paths to our conclusions. First, the philosophical bases and shortcomings of traditional strategy research are examined. Then, some foundations of a more rigorous approach to strategy research are proposed, by separating the useful from the absurd in economic theory. Finally, a critique of Teece's paper is offered (halfheartedly), and some specific research directions are proposed that are mostly complementary to those that Teece advocates...|$|R

It debuted at position 15 on The New York Times Best Seller list, and reached eight the next week, but was present there for only two weeks. Madonna was still livid that Morton wrote the book without her permission, even saying [...] "It's not a well-written book. We all know he wrote it for financial gain and the truth {{had little to do}} with it", after the book {{was released}}. With Jo Whiley from BBC Radio 1, she added that [...] " [...] really went through my Rolodex and that part was really annoying, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> writing him a letter saying, 'I'm not interested in you writing this book, I don't want to have anything to do with it – and please leave my friends alone'." [...] The singer said that she had even sent Morton a book of philosophy—The Power of Kabbalah—to try to dissuade him from continuing. [...] "It's a beginner's crash course in what it's all about – that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him, but he either didn't read it or didn't care," [...] Madonna added.|$|E
500|$|Lennon's love of wordplay and {{nonsense}} {{with a twist}} found a {{wider audience}} when he was 24. Harry writes that In His Own Write (1964) was published after [...] "Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles came to me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about". Like the Daily Howl it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, [...] "Good Dog Nigel", tells the tale of [...] "a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail—until he suddenly hears a message {{that he will be}} killed at three o'clock". The Times Literary Supplement considered the poems and stories [...] "remarkable... also very funny... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy". Book Week reported, [...] "This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge." [...] Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers [...] "took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me".|$|E

To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere was no {{exception}} - I'm listening to it with everything going on and there's just this weight and heaviness to it. 'Hurricane' {{is a good example of}} my trying to find something that fits there - the beauty and calm of the verses slamming into this huge thing, and I'm trying to find something that works with that <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> writing something where <b>I</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> questioning why all these beautiful moments in time are always shattered by something - because that's what the music feels likes its doing." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2000 {{interview}} Orzabal {{commented on}} his influences for the album: [...] "I {{started out with}} an absolute concrete vision of where I wanted to go so I started with a very different rhythm approach, with drum <b>and</b> bass/jungle...and <b>I</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> with something that wasn't the original plan." ...|$|R

2500|$|Love Equals Death {{proved to}} be a strong band and a fun band to be in, but I never felt {{comfortable}} in the band. I never felt like it was my band or that I was really a part of everyone else here ... Right before I joined LED, I started a solo project that I put on the back burner, because things were going well with LED <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> getting too busy to focus on it. I kept writing songs for both LED and the solo shit, knowing one day I would have to part ways with LED to fulfill my desire to express myself the way I had always dreamed. I was going to do this sooner and then [...] So I stayed to help get the band back on track and I never leave anything on a negative note.|$|E

While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter. [...] Soros {{received}} £40 from a Quaker charity. In a discussion at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times, asked Soros, [...] "How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you realize that you knew how to make money?" [...] Soros replied, [...] "Well, I had a variety of jobs <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank." [...] That job was an entry-level position in Singer & Friedlander.|$|E

I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance.

5000|$|Although the Chinese {{aristocracy}} counted {{painting as}} one of their accepted pastimes, the profession of the painter was not a highly venerated vocation. On one occasion, when Emperor Taizong was rowing a boat with his attendant scholars at the imperial pond, there were birds flying by. Emperor Taizong had the scholars write poems to praise the scene and then summoned Yan to paint a portrait of the scene. Yan was at the time already a mid-level official in the administration, but when he summoned Yan, the imperial attendants called out, [...] "Summon the imperial painter, Yan Liben!"
