25|$|Meanwhile, Sindhu {{really has}} fallen for JKB {{and both of}} them get {{intimate}} with each other. One day, JKB is caught coming out of Sindhu's apartment by Bhairavi. Sindhu is seen as the home wrecker and is forced to quit her association with JKB. He pines for her <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> on alcohol for support, which sadly leads to his downward spiral ending in an embarrassing barter of his musical knowledge for a drink. He even steals money from Bhairavi's grandfather, which leads to his death. Sindhu reenters his life and brings him around, however she has a secret of her own, the secret of her pregnancy. After Sindhu brings back JKB from his alcoholic state, JKB's friends pressurize Sindhu to leave the town and to never come back, which she does the very next day. Both Bhairavi and JKB are distraught as Bhairavi had agreed to marry Sindhu to JKB.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{research}} in the area of agile <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> software development has mirrored the strong growth of the use of agile <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> methodologies. However, while these research streams have made a significant contribution in the use of agile <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> methodologies, much of the recent research lacks the rigor and relevance to make an impact in research and practice. For example, many of the studies have not measured the actual use of agile or lean methods nor had a significant theoretical grounding. Furthermore, agile research has not expanded to fully cover emerging opportunities and challenges. A deeper theoretical motivation on agile <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> software development can help demonstrate how the principles of, for example, agile software development, may be transferred to these other areas, and hence, broaden the research’s relevance. This paper provides commentary intended to help push the agile <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> research agenda forward, and outlines three key critieria that future researchers should consider when conducting research on the phenomenon of agile. The paper also provides an example for the use of the criteria, and presents several initial, open research questions that could help increase the use of agile, including the use of agile <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> concepts in other IT and non-IT contexts...|$|R
500|$|Its {{influence}} {{can be seen in}} the dismissive {{stare and}} overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, [...] "Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her [...] "massive, monumental presence". In 1907 the Swiss artist Félix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting Édouard Vuillard to exclaim, [...] "That's Madame Bertin!" ...|$|E

It opens with Beyoncé filing her nails in silence, as her ex-partner packs up his property, as Beyoncé orders him to leave. Mid-way in the video, Beyoncé follows her then-ex-boyfriend outside the house <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> on a 2007 Jaguar XK. She appears to be pretentiously caressing him; only for the {{audience}} {{to find out that}} she is repossessing things she bought for him. He leaves her and the car, about to ride off in a taxi. Between cuts, Beyoncé manages herself in front of a mirror; putting on a lipstick, wearing huge curlers and a high-waisted skirt. There are additional beats mixed to the arrangement for the video version that can be heard, when Beyoncé sings with her all-female band, Suga Mama, towards the end. It ends with Beyoncé greeting her new boyfriend at the front door.|$|E

500|$|Mastras had Jesse buy a Roomba {{because he}} {{believed}} it was appropriate for Jesse's frame of mind: [...] "You don't need it, it's kind of inane. ... He's just trying to fill his world with noise and with these things." [...] During the final shot of the episode, a steadicam shot filmed by Andrew Voegeli, Jesse turns his stereo system {{all the way up}} <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> directly against the pulsating speaker to try to shut out his pain. MacLaren wanted the speakers to pulse, but they could not actually play loud music without harming actor Aaron Paul. The special effects crew unsuccessfully tried several methods to make the speakers pulse, such as shaking them and pulling on strings, but they did not appear realistic. It was achieved after MacLaren visited a local stereo store and an employee provided her a bass tester which would run the stereo system with no noise, but cause the speakers to pulse as if music was playing. That employee was hired to come on the set and run the system, and the lights and pulsing were timed to match music which was later dubbed in.|$|E
500|$|Residual {{complications}} of paralytic polio often occur following the initial recovery process. Muscle paresis and paralysis can sometimes result in skeletal deformities, tightening of the joints and movement disability. Once {{the muscles in}} the limb become flaccid, they may interfere with the function of other muscles. A typical manifestation of this problem is equinus foot (similar to club foot). This deformity develops when the muscles that pull the toes downward are working, but those that pull it upward are not, and the foot naturally tends to drop toward the ground. If the problem is left untreated, the Achilles tendons {{at the back of}} the foot retract and the foot cannot take on a normal position. Polio victims that develop equinus foot cannot walk properly because they cannot put their heel on the ground. A similar situation can develop if the arms become paralyzed. In some cases the growth of an affected leg is slowed by polio, while the other leg continues to grow normally. The result is that one leg is shorter than the other and the person limps <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> to one side, in turn leading to deformities of the spine (such as scoliosis). Osteoporosis and increased likelihood of bone fractures may occur. An intervention to prevent or lessen length disparity can be to perform an epiphysiodesis on the distal femoral and proximal tibial/fibular condyles, so that limb's growth is artificially stunted, and by the time of epiphyseal (growth) plate closure, the legs are more equal in length. Alternatively, a person can be fitted with custom made footwear which corrects the difference in leg lengths. Other surgery to re-balance muscular agonist/antagonist imbalances may also be helpful. [...] Extended use of braces or wheelchairs may cause compression neuropathy, as well as a loss of proper function of the veins in the legs, due to pooling of blood in paralyzed lower limbs. Complications from prolonged immobility involving the lungs, kidneys and heart include pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, paralytic ileus, myocarditis and cor pulmonale.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{arriving}} at Thebes, Oedipus encounters the Sphinx, a legendary beast {{with the head}} and breast of a woman, {{the body of a}} lioness, and the wings of an eagle. [...] The Sphinx was sent to the road approaching Thebes as a punishment from the gods, and would strangle any traveler who failed to answer a certain riddle. [...] The precise riddle asked by the Sphinx varied in early traditions, and is not stated in Oedipus Rex, as the event precedes the play; but the most widely-known version is, [...] "what is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three in the evening?" [...] Oedipus correctly guesses, [...] "man", who crawls on all fours as an infant, walks upright in maturity, <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> on a stick in old age. [...] Bested by the prince, the Sphinx throws herself from a cliff, thereby ending the curse. Oedipus' reward for freeing Thebes from the Sphinx is its kingship, and the hand of the dowager queen, Jocasta; none then realize that Jocasta is Oedipus' true mother. Thus, unknown to all of the characters, the prophecy has been fulfilled.|$|E
2500|$|To block balls that {{a pitcher}} throws on a bounce toward home plate (pitches that {{are said to}} be [...] "in the dirt"), the catcher will slide his body to the left or right, as necessary, to place himself {{directly}} {{in the path of the}} ball. Once in position, he drops to his knees, places his mitt between his legs to prevent the ball from passing through, <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> forward to deaden the rebound when, and if, the ball bounces off his thigh or torso. Although inexperienced catchers may try to catch the errant pitch with his mitt, coaches often prioritize the catcher's ability to [...] "keep the ball in front of him" [...] than to make a catch with his mitt. Ideally, the catcher will be able to knock the ball to the ground where it will stop within arm's reach. To perform this properly, without the ball being deflected in an undesirable direction, the catcher must angle his body so that his chest is always leaning forward, toward home plate. This maneuver is often difficult, and its difficulty depends largely on how fast the ball is traveling, the angle at which the ball is thrown into the ground, where it first hits the ground, the firmness of the ground it hits, and the manner in which it is spinning.|$|E

2500|$|The skiff is {{designed}} for optimum performance and so the technique applied is important. The two fundamental reference points in the stroke are the catch where the blade {{is placed in the}} water, and the 'finish' where the blade is removed from the water. The skiffer leans forward, and bends the legs slightly. After placing the blade vertically in the water at the catch, he or she applies pressure to stretcher, levering the blade in the water on the thole <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> back. This is called the drive phase of the stroke. Once the skiffer has pushed the blade as far forward in the water as possible, he or she extracts the oar from the water, and the recovery phase begins, setting up the skiffer's body for the next stroke. On the recovery, it is normal to tip the blade flat (known as [...] "feathering"). There are some differences from the rowing stroke. The hands must never pass one above the other - one hand must always lead, or one of the blades will [...] "dig" [...] in the water. The seat does not slide and the unbending of the legs follows from the leaning back of the body. Finally skiffs are more stable so {{that it is possible to}} lean back further and keep the blade in the water for longer. The last extra distance provides considerable motive power to the boat, leading to the encouragement to [...] "squeeze the finish".|$|E
