Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed <b>and</b> <b>ripped</b> a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, 2009, the Pittsburgh Steelers {{played the}} Detroit Lions at Ford Field. Nearing {{the end of}} the fourth quarter the Steelers were up by 8 points and the Lions were marching down the field. At this time the Lions mascot Roary The Lion, stepped on, bit <b>and</b> <b>ripped</b> apart a Terrible Towel. Following this the Lions {{suffered}} three straight sacks to put them in a long fourth and twenty-eight situation. The Lions did not convert and the Steelers won the game 28-20.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded <b>and</b> <b>ripped</b> the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} whether LRRK 2 physically interacts with Rip 2, we performed immunoprecipitation. First, we overexpressed LRRK 2 <b>and</b> <b>Rip</b> 2 in transfected HEK 293 T cells, {{and we found}} an association between LRRK 2 <b>and</b> <b>Rip</b> 2 (Fig.  6 C and 6 D). Second, we examined whether LRRK 2 <b>and</b> <b>Rip</b> 2 interacted endogenously and whether MDP treatment affected such interaction. We found that anti-LRRK 2 pulled down endogenous Rip 2 (Fig.  6 E), indicating an association of endogenous LRRK 2 <b>and</b> <b>Rip</b> 2. The association of LRRK 2 <b>and</b> <b>Rip</b> 2 remained unchanged upon MDP treatment (Fig.  6 E). Altogether, our results indicate a scenario that LRRK 2 physically interacts with <b>Rip</b> 2 <b>and</b> promotes phosphorylation of Rip 2.|$|R

40|$|Ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (RIPs) are toxins {{that act}} as N-glycosidases (EC 3. 2. 2. 22).

5|$|The {{desperation and}} the violent {{reaction}} {{of a generation}} robbed of a safe future are well-represented by the British punk movement of 1977–1978, whose rebellion against the establishment continued diluted in the new wave and post-punk music of the 1980s. These self-proclaimed punks were politically militant, relishing their anarchic attitude and stage practices like pogo dancing. They wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads, often with safety pins <b>and</b> <b>ripped</b> clothes, and considered musical prowess unimportant {{as long as the}} music was simple and loud. However, not all working-class male youths embraced the punk movement; some preferred to escape from their grim reality in heavy metal, which was equally effective in providing fun, stress relief, and peer companionship– otherwise denied because of their unemployment.|$|E
5|$|Several {{hundred years}} before {{the events of the}} game, a battle known as the War of Transgression took place between Pulse and Cocoon. During the battle, l'Cie from Pulse {{attacked}} <b>and</b> <b>ripped</b> a large hole in Cocoon. Eventually, the l'Cie completed their focus and were turned to crystal. The hole was patched with material lifted from Pulse, and Cocoon's citizens have since lived in fear of another invasion; this fear is used by the Sanctum to remain in power. The Sanctum oversees two military branches: the Guardian Corps, responsible for keeping order on Cocoon, and the Public Security and Intelligence COMmand (PSICOM), the special forces in charge of dealing with any threat related to Pulse. The fal'Cie have given the humans advanced technology, including flying airships and mechanical creatures, and a form of magic also exists. This magic is normally only accessible to l'Cie, fal'Cie, and various monsters in Cocoon and Pulse, though distilled chemical forms can be used by normal humans through the use of Manadrives.|$|E
5|$|The last {{match of}} the night was the main event between The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage), {{accompanied}} by Miss Elizabeth, and The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant), accompanied by André's manager Bobby Heenan and DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil. Jesse Ventura was the special guest referee. The Mega Powers took the early advantage over DiBiase. After Hogan attacked André the Giant, {{who was on the}} ring apron, The Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After a while, all four men began brawling, and André knocked The Mega Powers out of the ring. Subsequently, as part of the scripted ending to the match, Miss Elizabeth began arguing with Ventura, the referee, <b>and</b> <b>ripped</b> off her skirt to reveal her underwear. While the Mega Bucks were distracted, Savage climbed to the top rope and dropped the Macho Elbow on DiBiase, followed by Hogan hitting the leg drop on DiBiase. As Hogan pinned DiBiase, Ventura, a villainous character aligned with The Mega Bucks (despite being a long time on-air Savage fan and his former tag-team partner), began an obviously slow three-count. As a result, Savage slammed Ventura's arm down for the third time, indicating that Hogan and Savage had won the match.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a No Surrender Dog Collar {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the {{challenger}} Abyss, who was accompanied by James Mitchell. The encounter lasted 19 minutes and 17 seconds. In a Dog Collar match, both competitors are tied together at the neck by a long steel chain that {{is attached to a}} dog collar. The match is fought under no disqualification rules; in this case the only way to win was by pinfall. Abyss crashed through a table at ringside after Raven pushed him off the stage. Abyss removed the collar during the match and retrieved a bag of thumbtacks. He then poured them over the mat <b>and</b> <b>ripped</b> Raven's shirt off, before attempting to slam him into them. Cassidy Reilly interfered in the contest stopping Abyss. Later, Cassidy was shoved off the ring apron by Abyss and he crashed through a table. Raven followed by slamming Abyss back-first into the tacks with a powerbomb and covered for a near-fall. Abyss also gained a near-fall on Raven after slamming him into the mat back-first with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver. Raven finally won the contest following forcing Abyss head-first into thumbtacks with his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver to retain the championship. Following the bout, a segment took place between Raven and Jeff Jarrett, which ended when Rhino made his TNA debut and tackled Raven with his signature Gore maneuver.|$|E

50|$|Depending on beach state, near bottom {{currents}} show {{variations in}} the relative dominance of motions due to: incident waves, subharmonic oscillations, infragravity oscillations, and mean longshore <b>and</b> <b>rip</b> currents. On reflective beaches, incident waves and subharmonic edge waves are dominant. In highly dissipative surf zones, shoreward decay of incident waves is accompanied by shoreward growth of infragravity energy; in the inner surf zone, currents associated with infragravity standing waves dominate. On intermediate states with pronounced bar-trough (straight or crescentic) topographies, incident wave orbital velocities are generally dominant but significant roles are also played by subharmonic and infragravity standing waves, longshore currents, <b>and</b> <b>rips.</b> The strongest <b>rips</b> <b>and</b> associated feeder currents occur in association with intermediate transverse bar <b>and</b> <b>rip</b> topographies.|$|R

40|$|Nucleotide-binding {{oligomerization}} domain proteins (NODs) are modular cytoplasmic proteins {{implicated in}} the recognition of peptidoglycan-derived molecules. Further, several in vivo studies have demonstrated a role for Nod 1 and Nod 2 in host defense against bacterial pathogens.

Similar reduction on cytokine synthesis was not observed for IL- 12 and IL- 6. However, NOD 1, NOD 2, <b>and</b> <b>Rip</b> 2 knockout mice were no more susceptible to infection with virulent B. abortus than wild-type mice. Additionally, spleen cells from NOD 1 -, NOD 2 -, <b>and</b> <b>Rip</b> 2 -deficient mice showed unaltered production of IFN-γ compared to C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Taken together, this study demonstrates that NOD 1, NOD 2 <b>and</b> <b>Rip</b> 2 are dispensable for the control of B. abortus during in vivo infection...|$|R
