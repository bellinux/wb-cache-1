When speaking, the person can hear their speech, and the brain uses what it hears as a feedback mechanism to fix speech errors. If a single feedback correction occurs multiple times, the brain will begin to incorporate the correction to all future speech, making it <b>a</b> <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> mechanism. This is apparent in some deaf people. Deafness, as well as other, smaller deficiencies in hearing, can greatly affect one's ability to comprehend spoken language, as well as to speak it. However, if the person loses hearing ability later in life, most can still maintain a normal level of verbal intelligence. This is thought to be because of the brain's feed forward mechanism still helping to fix speech errors, {{even in the absence of}} auditory feedback.|$|E

Monkeys who lost all sensory information from their arms resumed normal behavior after recovering from the deafferentation procedure. Most skills were relearned, but fine motor control became very difficult.|$|E

50|$|Walking gait is {{classified}} as hybrid system, meaning that it has split dynamics. With this unique problem, a set of solutions to hybrid systems that undergo impacts was developed called Rapid Exponentially Stabilizing Control Lyapunov Functions(RES-CLF). Control Lyapunov function are used to stabilize a nonlinear system to a desired set of states. RES-CLFs can be realized using quadratic programs that take in several inequality constraints and return an optimal output. One problem with these are that they require {{a model of the}} system to develop the RES-CLFs. To remove the need of tuning to specific individuals Model Independent Quadratic Programs (MIQP) were used to derive CLFs. These CLFs are only focused on reducing the error in the desired output without any knowledge of what the desired torque should be.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the optimal configuration {{and performance of}} <b>an</b> adaptive <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> neural network filter to predict breathing in respiratory motion compensation systems for external beam radiation therapy. Method and Materials: <b>A</b> two-layer <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> neural network was trained to predict future breathing amplitudes for 27 recorded breathing histories. The prediction intervals ranged from 100 to 500 ms. The optimal sampling frequency, number of input samples, training rate, and number of training epochs were determined for each breathing history and prediction interval. The overall optimal filter configuration was determined from this parameter survey, and its accuracy for each breathing example was compared to the individually optimal filter setups. Prediction accuracy was also compared to breathing stability {{as measured by the}} autocorrelation of the breathing signal. Results: The survey of filter configurations converged on a standard setup for all examples of breathing. For 24 of the 27 breathing histories the accuracy of the standard filter for a 300 ms prediction interval was within a few percent of the individually optimized filter setups; for the remaining three histories the standard filter was 5 %– 15 % less accurate. Conclusions: A standard adaptive neural network filter setup can provide approximately optimal breathing prediction {{for a wide range of}} breathing patterns.
