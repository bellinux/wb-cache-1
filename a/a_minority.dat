40|$|Two {{experiments}} are reported which investigate {{the influence of}} ingroup and outgroup minority influence where group membership was determined according to a trivial dimension.

When ingroup/outgroup membership {{was associated with a}} positive/negative image respectively, the ingroup minority had the most influence. However, when ingroup/outgroup membership was associated with a negative/positive image, as predicted, <b>an</b> outgroup <b>minority</b> had more influence than <b>an</b> ingroup <b>minority.</b> These results are interpreted as supporting an intergroup analysis of minority influence processes...|$|R
