40|$|One {{of the top}} {{strategic}} objectives and research areas in Europe is recovering wood from processing and end of life products. However, there are still several "contaminated" wood products that are not or only partly reused/recycled. Particle board waste which is contaminated with aminoplasts {{is one of these}} products. In addition, a considerable amount of <b>aminoplast</b> waste resinis produced for the production of particle board that cannot be re-used or recycled. The chemical properties of these wastes (high nitrogen content of 5. 9 wt% and 54. 1 wt% for particle board and melamine formaldehyde respectively) make them ideal precursors for the production of nitrogenised activated carbon. The profitability of the produced activated carbon is investigated by calculating the net present value, the minimum selling price and performing a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. Encouraging results for a profitable production are obtained even though the current assumptions start from a rather pessimistic scenario...|$|E

50|$|Important {{epoxy resins}} are {{produced}} from combining epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A to give bisphenol A diglycidyl ethers.Increasing {{the ratio of}} bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves {{more and more like}} a thermoplastic. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 - 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with <b>aminoplasts,</b> phenoplasts and isocyanates.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study on the thermal {{stability}} of phase change material microcapsules that are incorporated with silver nano-particles (Ag-NPs). The novel microcapsules were fabricated by the technique of in situ polymerization, with <b>aminoplast</b> as the wall and phase change material bromo-hexadecane (PCM BrC 16) as the core. Thermal gravimetry (TG) analysis was applied to measure the thermal stability of these microcapsules and surface morphology of the microcapsules was observed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after an application of curing treatment at 130 ?XC. Comparing with conventional phase change material microcapsules (PCMMs), nano-composite phase change material microcapsules (NCPCMMs) have higher thermal stability. This can be attributed to nano-composite structure of the microcapsules, in which metal Ag-NPs distributed on the surface to increase wall toughness and strength. The possible reinforcement mechanisms of the nano-composite structure are explored. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|The {{enhancement}} of wood waste is a promising {{solution for the}} production of energy from renewable resources. Nevertheless, wood waste often needs a preliminary treatment step to remove pollutants present in the material. The thermal cleaning of wood laminated flooring (WLF) waste is studied through thermogravimetric and FTIR analyses. As a first step, it has been shown, through non iso-thermal tests, that degradation temperature ranges for wood and additives (<b>aminoplast</b> resins) are different, making it possible to proceed to a thermal cleaning through a low temperature pyrolysis. It has also been highlighted that chemical linkages between the different components of WLF waste influence their own thermal behaviour making it difficult to predict the thermal behaviour of the whole material. Fourier transform infra-red spectrometry analyses reveal that NH 3 and HNCO are the main nitrogen-containing gases produced during pyrolysis, which highlights the pyrolysis efficiency in terms of nitrogen (i. e., resin) removing. Lastly, thermal degradation of wood and WLF has been modelled to provide information for reactor designing...|$|E
40|$|Non-isothermal {{thermogravimetry}} {{was applied}} to study the condensation kinetics of dimethylol-urea (DMU) as a model substance for methylol oligomers of urea in the presence, or absence, of an acid curing agent (phthalic acid), and of blends of DMU with urea and with the hydrolysate of chrome-tanned leather waste. Kinetics {{of the formation of}} oxymethylene and methylene bonds were evaluated, using the Arrhenius equation to obtain the parameters. Addition of a mass fraction of 0. 05 H to DMU reduces the rate of formation of unstable oxymethylene cross-links in favour of more stable methylene bonds by 20 - 30 %. Acid curing agents accelerate the rate of formation of both types of cross-links, {{but at the same time}} markedly affect transformation of oxymethylene cross-links to methylene cross-links. Reducing the content of oxymethylene cross-links in cured <b>aminoplast</b> adhesive films, to control their instability, may lower the levels of formaldehyde emissions by cured aminoplast-type films.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a {{comparative}} study on the corrosion resistance of low-carbon steel substrates pretreated with different silane solutions and painted. The pure silanes used to pretreat the steel panels were 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (c-APS), 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (c-GPS), and bis(3 -triethoxysilylpropyl) amine. The study also considered other silane solutions with ureido, amino, and epoxy organofunctional groups, and two bis-functional silanes: bis(c-trimethoxysilylpropyl) amine (BAS) and 1, 2 -bis(triethoxysilyl) ethane (BTSE). A conventional phosphate-type pretreatment was also applied for reference purposes. The pretreated panels were then finished with an alkyd/polyester <b>aminoplast</b> base paint. As a branch test, an acrylic/urethane paint was also applied. Different tests were conducted to evaluate the anticorrosive ability of the different silane/paint systems: outdoor exposure {{in an atmosphere of}} moderate aggressivity; accelerated corrosion test (salt fog test); and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the steel pretreated with certain silanes, especially c-APS, yields similar results to steel subjected to conventional phosphate pretreatment. © ACA and OCCA 2010.
