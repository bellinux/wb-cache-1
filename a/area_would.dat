5|$|If magma were to rise {{towards the}} surface of Nazko, new {{earthquake}} swarms would occur, with {{a significant increase in}} the size and number of earthquakes. An eruption in the Nazko <b>area</b> <b>would</b> probably create a small cinder cone, similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. Immediate hazards related to cinder cone eruptions in the Nazko <b>area</b> <b>would</b> probably be forest fires and, if an eruption column were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.|$|E

5|$|Coal was {{expected}} {{to be able to be}} delivered to the station by rail, as well as by ship to the Port of Blyth. The station's coal storage <b>area</b> <b>would</b> have stored a minimum 45 days worth of coal supply. All of the station's pulverised fuel ash (PFA) may have been sold to the construction industry, transported to which in dry dust tankers. Unsold PFA and furnace bottom ash would be taken to a landfill site by road.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Down Street {{was one of}} the {{stations}} suggested for closure in connection with the extension of the Piccadilly line: the elimination of less-busy stations in the central <b>area</b> <b>would</b> improve both reliability and journey times for long-distance commuters. Additionally, the neighbouring stations were being rebuilt with escalators in place of lifts and their new entrances were even nearer to Down Street, further squeezing its catchment area. The station was permanently closed on 21 May 1932.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, it was {{proposed}} that the annual Apple Cup between the Seattle-based Huskies and the Pullman-based Cougars be hosted at CenturyLink Field for sixyears beginning in 2010. The two programs could not reach an agreement on how to divide tickets. Pullman's business community had expressed concerns that playing the game away from the <b>area</b> <b>would</b> be detrimental to the local economy.|$|E
5|$|In June 1816 Charles Morris again {{commanded}} Congress {{and began}} preparations for a cruise to the Pacific Coast of the United States. His objective was taking possession of Fort Astoria from the British and conducting inquiries at various ports {{along the coast}} to further improve commercial trade. These plans were canceled, however, when a U.S. Navy ship collided with a Spanish Navy vessel in the Gulf of Mexico. Consequently, Morris commanded a squadron of ships in the Gulf to ensure that American merchant commerce in the <b>area</b> <b>would</b> continue unmolested.|$|E

50|$|The {{physics of}} VHF {{broadcasting}} meant that a comparatively {{small number of}} transmitters could cover {{the majority of the}} population of Britain, if not the bulk of the area of the country. The ITA determined that the first three franchise <b>areas</b> <b>would</b> cover the London area, the English Midlands, and the North of England (basically the Lancashire/Yorkshire belt of industrial cities from Liverpool to Hull, with the surrounding countryside). All three franchise <b>areas</b> <b>would</b> be awarded on a divided weekday/weekend basis, and it was planned that the franchise holders for these <b>areas</b> <b>would</b> produce the great bulk of network programmes, while the companies given the smaller franchises would produce mainly local programmes for their area only.|$|R
5|$|It {{was also}} {{predicted}} that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render {{most of the city}} uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding <b>area</b> <b>would</b> spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump all the water out of the city.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese High Command {{believed}} that the raid had been conducted in preparation for an invasion of south China. In response, five additional infantry divisions {{were assigned to the}} defense of this area. Three of these divisions were released for other operations in March 1945 after the American invasion of Iwo Jima was interpreted as evidence that the Hong Kong-Canton <b>area</b> <b>would</b> be bypassed rather than attacked.|$|E
5|$|The {{final element}} of the {{protection}} scheme of the first dreadnoughts was the subdivision of the ship below the waterline into several watertight compartments. If the hull were holed—by shellfire, mine, torpedo, or collision—then, in theory, only one <b>area</b> <b>would</b> flood and the ship could survive. To make this precaution even more effective, many dreadnoughts had no doors between different underwater sections, so that even a surprise hole below the waterline need not sink the ship. There were still several instances where flooding spread between underwater compartments.|$|E

5|$|The {{motion was}} {{rejected}} by 5 votes to 7 after discussions. According to Benny Morris, the arguments that were advanced not to launch the attack were: the negative international repercussions for Israel already accentuated by the recent assassination of Count Bernadotte; the consequences of an attack on an agreement with Abdallah; the fact that defeating the Arab Legion could provoke a British military intervention because of Britain and Jordan's common defense pact and lastly because conquering this <b>area</b> <b>would</b> add {{hundreds of thousands of}} Arab citizens to Israel.|$|E
5|$|Weisman uses New York City as a {{model to}} outline how an unmaintained urban <b>area</b> <b>would</b> deconstruct. He {{explains}} that sewers would clog, underground streams would flood subway corridors, and soils under roads would erode and cave in. From interviews {{with members of the}} Wildlife Conservation Society and the New York Botanical Gardens Weisman predicts that native vegetation would return, spreading from parks and out-surviving invasive species. Without humans to provide food and warmth, rats and cockroaches would die off.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a report}} {{published}} by the city, {{the population of the}} island was expected to number 1,991,200 by 2012, with 3.9million in the Greater Montreal Area, an increase of 15.8% over 2001. However, in 2009, the Greater Montreal Area was estimated to number 3.86million people, suggesting that the <b>area</b> <b>would</b> surpass the four million threshold by 2012. The four million landmark however, wasn't reached until 2014. In 2015, the Greater Montreal population was estimated at 4,060,700. According to StatsCan, by 2030, the Greater Montreal Area is expected to number 5,275,000 with 1,722,000 being visible minorities.|$|E

5|$|After the {{accidental}} release, another radiological survey was performed, {{and the state}} government concluded that PermaGrain needed to be relocated. The DCNR made the policy decision that Quehanna Wild <b>Area</b> <b>would</b> be closed to industrial uses. After looking at multiple sites with Clearfield County development authorities, a new site for PermaGrain Products was purchased, and the company submitted its {{plans for a new}} building and license to the NRC in October 2001. In order to approve the move to the new site, the NRC required PermaGrain to provide an inventory of all their cobalt-60 sources, dispose of a damaged source, and dispose of any other sources not mechanically certified. However in late December 2002, PermaGrain filed for bankruptcy under Chapter Seven. PermaGrain had employed 135 people in 1988 and 80 in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Japanese would strike at Port Moresby again, the {{garrison}} was strengthened and MacArthur ordered {{the establishment of}} new bases at Merauke and Milne Bay to cover its flanks. The Battle of Midway in June 1942 led to consideration of a limited offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur's proposal for {{an attack on the}} Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the Navy, which favored a less ambitious approach, and objected to an Army general being in command of what would be an amphibious operation. The resulting compromise called for a three-stage advance. The first stage, the seizure of the Tulagi <b>area,</b> <b>would</b> be conducted by the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. The later stages would be under MacArthur's command.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on August17, the NHC {{anticipated}} that a low pressure <b>area</b> <b>would</b> form within {{five days to}} the south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec in the East Pacific, with a 30% chance of tropical cyclogenesis. By the next day, the wave was located over Panama, and the NHC upgraded the potential for development to 60%. The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific with accompanying convection, developing a low pressure area on August19. Conditions were favorable for further development, and the thunderstorms increased and became better organized on August20. After an increase in rainbands and outflow around the well-defined center, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E early on August22 about 370mi (595km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. A strong ridge over the southern United States, later expanding into northern Mexico, steered the system on a west-northwest course throughout its existence as a tropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|By 5 November, General Headquarters (GHQ) South West Pacific Area (SWPA) {{had decided}} that the Finschhafen <b>area</b> <b>would</b> be {{developed}} into a major air and naval base, but the large Japanese force on Sattelberg still overlooked the base area. In order to remove this threat, Wootten sent the 26th Infantry Brigade to capture Sattelberg on 16 November. On 25 November, after 10 days of fighting, and an advance up the southern approaches from Jivevaneng by infantry supported by artillery, armour and air support, Sattelberg was seized by the Australians. Having suffered heavy casualties, and short on supplies, the Japanese withdrew north to Wareo, where they established themselves in preparation for further attacks by the Australians.|$|E
5|$|During the North Sea {{flood of}} 1953, Jaywick was flooded, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 35 people. Since then, sea defences have been put in place and many precautions have been made to avoid flooding. Coastal Jaywick has benefited from 30,000 cubic metres of dredged sand as part of a £9.4million upgrade. The residential areas are categorised as having the highest risk of flooding in the country, and a council report anticipated that global warming would increase the risk to human life in Jaywick from flooding over the next 50 to 75 years. The <b>area</b> <b>would</b> be the first to be hit by floods {{in the event of a}} tidal surge over the marshes surrounding St Osyth.|$|E
5|$|In August 1957, the Bureau of Public Roads {{added the}} roadway to the Interstate Highway System upon the {{recommendations}} of various state highway departments to include toll roads in the system. I-80 was planned to run along the turnpike from the Ohio border to Harrisburg while I-80S would continue eastward toward Philadelphia. I-70 was also planned to follow the turnpike between Pittsburgh and Breezewood. At {{a meeting of the}} Route Numbering Subcommittee on the U.S. Numbered System on June 26, 1958, it was decided to move the I-80 designation to an alignment further north while the highway between the Ohio border and the Philadelphia <b>area</b> <b>would</b> become I-80S. I-70 was still designated on the turnpike between Pittsburgh and Breezewood. Between King of Prussia and Bristol, the turnpike was designated I-280.|$|E
