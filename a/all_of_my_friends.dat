[...] In X-Factor #10, the Marauders, a group of mutant mercenaries, severely injure Angel's wings, which are later amputated. When an interviewer commented on the brutality of this turn of events, Walt Simonson replied, [...] "Hey, that's nothing compared to what happens to him eventually." [...] Despondent, Angel attempts suicide by detonating his airliner mid-flight, but Apocalypse rescues him and transforms him into Death, one of his Four Horsemen, giving him metal wings and blue skin. Angel escaped Apocalypse's control, but these physical changes remain. He is renamed Archangel and becomes a much darker character, eventually rejoining the team in issue #36. Angel's replacement on X-Factor, Caliban, turns to Apocalypse for more power in issue #24, with Apocalypse leaving X-Factor his ship in return.|$|E

Calderon came out as gay on his appearance in the February 2007 issue, their swimsuit edition, which included the cover, a photo spread, feature story and interview.

[...] "It's been great. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends,</b> the volleyball world, absolutely everybody has been supportive. No one has shut me out." [...] Dickinson, in particular, has been very supportive, and told him that her role models for being tough, driven and ambitious, were all gay men.
