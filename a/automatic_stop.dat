2500|$|Because {{there was}} no <b>automatic</b> <b>stop</b> on older model Taser guns, many {{officers}} have used it repeatedly or for a prolonged period of time, thus potentially contributing to suspects’ injuries or death. The current X26 model automatically stops five seconds after the trigger is depressed and then the trigger must be depressed again to send another [...] "shock". The trigger can be held down continuously for a longer shock or the device can be switched off before the full five seconds have elapsed. The devices have no protections against multiple police officers giving multiple shocks, cumulatively exceeding the recommended maximum levels.|$|E
2500|$|On January 8, 1995, train {{operators}} {{began to}} announce each stop over the train's speaker {{system as a}} result of pressure from advocacy groups for the visually impaired. However, announcements were sporadic until the TTC began to enforce the policy about 2005. Later, automated announcements were implemented under further pressure from the advocacy groups. All Toronto subway trains use an automated system to announce each station which is played twice over the speaker system: when the train departs a station (e.g. [...] "The next station is: Dufferin, Dufferin station"); and when it arrives at the following station (e.g. [...] "Arriving at: Dufferin, Dufferin station"). In addition, the TTC's new Toronto Rocket subway trains provide visible and audible <b>automatic</b> <b>stop</b> announcements. Unlike the other trains, the Rockets also announce interchange stations, such as [...] "Change for Line 2", and terminus stations, [...] "This is a terminal station" [...] where applicable. , they also audibly announce (in addition to the visual arrows pointing to) which side the train doors will open on at each stop based on direction of train travel (except at terminus stations).|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} {{concerned}} with eÆcient edge-preserving numerical techniques for noise removal via anisotropic diusion. New minimum-biased (MB) nite dierence formulas are introduced to minimize diusion on both the piecewise smooth portions and their boundaries. Locally one-dimensional time-stepping algorithms are analyzed and a formula for eÆcient timestep sizes is suggested, to remove the high-frequency components of the error (the noise) more eÆciently and to minimize the torture of lower-frequency components of the image. An eective strategy is suggested for an <b>automatic</b> <b>stopping</b> of the diusion pro-cess. It is numerically veried that the MB formulas eliminate, rather than diuse, the noise of piecewise constant images. With such a property, the MB formulas are successfully applied to noise removal of general images. Numerical examples carried out with various images are presented to demonstrate superior properties of (a) the new MB formulas, (b) the formula for timestep sizes, and (c) the <b>automatic</b> <b>stopping</b> strategy of the diusion process...|$|R
