5|$|Although Greeley had {{requested}} a simple funeral, his daughters ignored his wishes and arranged a grand affair at the Church of the Divine Paternity, later the Fourth Universalist Society in the City of New York, where Greeley was a member.

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad,</b> flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are {{on the underside of the}} head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Johnson (15 November 1738 â€“ 20 December 1809) was an {{influential}} 18th-century London bookseller and publisher.

5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela {{closely resembles}} the scarlet myzomela, {{though there is}} only a small overlap in their respective ranges, in eastern Cape York Peninsula. The latter species lives in woodlands rather than mangroves. The dusky myzomela resembles the female red-headed myzomela, but is larger and darker brown, and lacks the red markings around the bill. The Sumba myzomela is similar but slightly smaller than the red-headed myzomela and has darker upper parts <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> black pectoral band.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to that of}} Nectomys, {{the skull}} is lightly built and has narrow nasals <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad,</b> round braincase without {{conspicuous}} ridges on it. The zygomatic plate is broad. The incisive foramina (perforations of the front part of the palate) extend between the first molars and are broadest in their back halves. The broad mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate, is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities. The molar crowns are not as simplified as in Nectomys species, but the front cusps of the upper (anterocone) and lower first molar (anteroconid) are not divided in two. In addition to the main roots, the upper and lower first molars have smaller additional roots.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{involved}} himself {{heavily in}} discussions over army reform, {{the need for}} which had become apparent with the failings of the Boer War. He supported the redesign of army command, {{the creation of the}} Territorial Force, and the decision to provide an Expeditionary Force supporting France in the event of war with Germany. Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because of the emergence of the Imperial German Navy as a new strategic threat. Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, who favoured increased spending <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> deployment, and the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir John Fisher, who favoured efficiency savings, scrapping obsolete vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new dreadnoughts.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} male has a {{short and}} narrow black bib <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> chestnut eye stripe {{that does not}} meet the mantle. The male has a grey crown and nape and a rufous lower back and rump. The female has a darker and greyer crown and cheek than the female house sparrow and the shoulder is darker chestnut. The female Dead Sea sparrow of the subspecies Passer moabiticus yattii is also similar to the female Sind sparrow, but has yellow tinges on the underparts and sometimes on parts of the head. The bill is black on the breeding male and pale brown on the non-breeding male and female. With a culmen length of , the Sind sparrow is slightly smaller-billed than the house sparrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{company has}} aimed {{to present the}} {{standard}} operatic repertoire, sung in English, and has staged all the major operas of Mozart, Wagner and Puccini, and {{a wide range of}} Verdi's operas. Under Mackerras and his successors the Czech repertoire has featured strongly, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> range of French and Russian operas has been presented. The company has for decades laid stress on opera as drama, and has avoided operas where vocal display takes precedence over musical and dramatic content. In addition to the operatic staples, ENO has a history of presenting new works, and latterly of commissioning them.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs of Plesiorycteropus show specializations for scratch-digging, {{in which}} the forefeet are placed against the substrate, the claws are entered into the substrate, and the forefeet are then drawn back against the body. Other {{parts of the body}} also show such specializations, {{including}} large hindlimbs <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> tail. Some aspects of the vertebral column and the pelvis suggest that the animal often assumed an erect, or sitting, posture. The animal may also have been capable of climbing, perhaps {{in a manner similar to}} gymnures and shrew tenrecs, which are small-eyed like Plesiorycteropus. It was probably myrmecophagous, eating insects such as ants and termites, but may also have eaten other soft food, and because of its small size probably did not forage in termite mounds, as the aardvark does.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{tropical}} depression were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on May 13. It crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, reaching a position east of the Yucatan Peninsula by May 25. The system interacted with a monsoon-type circulation over Central America, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> low-level circulation developed near Cozumel, Mexico. Atmospheric pressure in the region fell gradually as the system organized, and on May 31, the National Hurricane Center classified it as Tropical Depression One near the Isle of Youth. At the time of being upgraded, the circulation was located on the northwest side of the convection due to wind shear.|$|E
5|$|The slender smooth-hound has a {{very thin}} body <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad,</b> highly {{flattened}} head. The snout is long, with a distinctive bell-shaped outline when viewed from above. The eyes have an elongate horizontal oval shape, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath each eye is a prominent ridge, and behind is a much smaller spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by small, almost triangular flaps of skin. The line of the mouth forms an angle; there are very short furrows at the mouth corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 96â€“99 and 108â€“114 rows respectively of small, very closely spaced teeth; each tooth has a narrow upright central cusp flanked by smaller cusplets on both sides. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{ellipsoid}} {{and measure}} 12â€“14.5 by 6.5â€“8Î¼m.

The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 32â€“44 by 8â€“12Î¼m. The cap cuticle is made of a layer 130â€“150Î¼m thick, with hyaline, thin-walled gelatinized hyphae measuring 1.5â€“4Î¼m broad. The hypodermium (the tissue layer directly under the pileipellis) is made of thin-walled, hyaline hyphae, 2.5â€“8Î¼m broad, with a brownish incrusting pigment. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|E

5|$|Wolin was {{the major}} stronghold of the Volinian tribal territory, {{comprising}} the island <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> stretch of the adjacent mainland, with its frontier guarded by a string of gords. The city's peak of prosperity occurred around and after year 900, when a new seaport was built (the municipal complex had now four of them) and the metropolitan area was secured by walls and embankments. The archeological findings there include {{a great variety of}} imported goods (even from the Far East) and locally manufactured products and raw materials; amber and precious metals figure prominently, as jewelry was one of the mainstay economic activities of the Wolinian elite.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Berlin's public {{prosecution}} department rendered {{this incident}} assistance in emergency and self-defence in {{consequence of the}} police officer stating that he felt his life being threatened. In many cases West Berliner rescuers {{were not able to}} reach wounded persons because they were either on GDR territory or in East Berlin. They had no authorization to set foot into this territory, so that a trespassing would have been life-endangering for the rescue workers. The four children Ã‡etin Mert, Cengaver KatrancÄ±, Siegfried Kroboth and Giuseppe Savoca, who fell into the Spree at the GrÃ¶ben riverside between the years 1972 and 1975, could not be rescued even though West Berlin rescue forces arrived quickly on site. In April 1983 the transit passenger Rudolf Burkert {{died of a heart attack}} during an interrogation at the border checkpoint Derwitz. During a subsequent autopsy in West Germany several external injuries were detected, so that an external forceful impact could not be ruled out as the cause of death. This lethal incident resulted not only in negative press reports but also led to an intervention by Helmut Kohl and Franz Josef Strauss. For the imminent public-sector loans they imposed on the GDR the condition to conduct humane border controls. Two further deaths of West Germans in transit traffic, shortly after Burkert's death, set off demonstrations against the GDR regime <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> media discussion. In the period that followed inspections decreased in transit traffic.|$|E
5|$|On October 4, the Patriot militia reached Ferguson's former camp at Gilbert Town, where thirty Georgia militiamen joined them, {{anxious for}} action. On October 6, they reached Cowpens, South Carolina, (site {{of the future}} Battle of Cowpens), where they {{received}} word that Ferguson was east of them, heading towards Charlotte and Cornwallis. They hurried to catch him. Rebel spies reported Ferguson was making camp on Kings Mountain with some 1200 men. Ferguson, rather than pushing on until he reached Charlotte and safety (just a day's march away), camped at Kings Mountain and sent Cornwallis another letter asking for reinforcements. Kings Mountain {{is one of many}} rocky forested hills in the upper Piedmont, near the border between North and South Carolina. It is shaped like a footprint with the highest point at the heel, a narrow instep, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> rounded toe.
