Running away from the scene of the crime, does that make you any more innocent? Are they really willing to pay an exorbitantly higher transportation cost to bring in tomatoes from overseas or Mexico and pass that on to their customers rather than pay a penny more per pound?" ...|$|E

40|$|This paper excavates {{a debate}} {{concerning}} {{the claims of}} ordinary language philosophers that {{took place during the}} middle of the last century. The debate centers on the status of statements <b>about</b> "what <b>we</b> say". On one side of the debate, critics of ordinary language philosophy argued that statements <b>about</b> "what <b>we</b> say" should be evaluated as empirical observations about how people do in fact speak, on a par with claims made in the language sciences. By that standard, ordinary language philosophers were not entitled to the claims that they made <b>about</b> what <b>we</b> would say <b>about</b> various topics. On the other side of the debate, defenders of the methods of ordinary language philosophy sought to explain how philosophers can be entitled to statements <b>about</b> what <b>we</b> would say without engaging in extensive observations of how people do in fact use language. In this paper I defend the idea that entitlement to claims <b>about</b> what <b>we</b> say can be had in a way that doesn’t require empirical observation, and I argue that ordinary language philosophers are (at least sometimes) engaged in a different project than linguists or empirically minded philosophers of language, which is subject to different conditions of success...|$|R
