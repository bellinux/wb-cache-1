5|$|The {{main goal}} of {{treatment}} {{is to treat}} shock and preserve kidney function. Initially this is done through the administration of generous amounts of intravenous fluids, usually isotonic saline (0.9% weight per volume sodium chloride solution). In victims of crush syndrome, it is recommended to administer intravenous fluids even before they are extracted from collapsed structures. This will ensure sufficient circulating volume {{to deal with the}} muscle cell swelling (which typically commences when blood supply is restored), and to prevent the deposition of myoglobin in the kidneys. Amounts of 6 to 12liters over 24hours are recommended. The rate of fluid administration may be altered to achieve a high urine output (200–300ml/h in adults), unless there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons</b> why this might lead to complications, such as a history of heart failure.|$|E

25|$|In {{the study}} How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm (2010) the {{researchers}} criticized the free-choice paradigm as invalid, because the rank-choice-rank method is inaccurate {{for the study}} of cognitive dissonance. That the designing of research-models relies upon the assumption that, if the experimental subject rates options differently in the second survey, then the attitudes of the subject towards the options have changed. That there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons</b> why an experimental subject might achieve different rankings in the second survey; perhaps the subjects were indifferent between choices.|$|E

2500|$|There <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons</b> the Gothic styles {{became so}} {{widespread}} in Canada. The steep roofs and thick stone walls were {{well suited to}} Canada's northern climate. In the United States architects liked to link their republic to those of Ancient Greece and Rome through the neo-classical style. Canada's Loyalists had no such leanings, and the English-Canadian elite was strongly Anglophilic and monarchist. Gothic architecture was seen as symbolic of this. In the late 19th century as Canada began to see an influx of Southern and Eastern European immigrants, the nativist backlash also embraced Gothic Revival architecture as emblematic of Canada's identity as a homeland for the [...] "northern race." [...] In French Canada the civic and religious authorities of the 19th and early 20th century also embraced a strident conservatism.|$|E
2500|$|For {{otherwise}} healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down {{a trial of}} vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks. Vaginal delivery in this case does not worsen the outcome for either infant as compared with caesarean section. [...] There is some controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first {{and the second is}} not, but most obstetricians will recommend normal delivery unless there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons</b> to avoid vaginal birth. When the first twin is not head down, a caesarean section is often recommended. Regardless of whether the twins are delivered by section or vaginally, the medical literature recommends delivery of dichorionic twins at 38 weeks, and monochorionic twins (identical twins sharing a placenta) by 37 weeks due to the increased risk of stillbirth in monochorionic twins who remain in utero after 37 weeks. [...] The consensus is that late preterm delivery of monochorionic twins is justified because the risk of stillbirth for post-37 week delivery is significantly higher than the risks posed by delivering monochorionic twins near term (i.e., 36–37 weeks).|$|E
