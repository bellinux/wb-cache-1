5|$|In North America, Tricholoma pardinum can be {{confused}} with T.nigrum and forms of T.virgatum that have more streaked rather than spotted caps. A form of T.pardinum in North <b>America</b> <b>can</b> be nearly white with pale scales, and may {{be confused}} with the whitish edible species T.resplendens. Microscopically, the presence of clamp connections sets T.pardinum apart from most other members of the genus, although the similar-looking (though more tan-coloured) T.venenatum also has them. According to Alexander H. Smith, T.huronense is closely related, but can be distinguished from T.pardinum by its narrower gills, its tendency to form drops of reddish liquid on the gills and stalk, and an ash-grey and scaly stalk surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; Pisaster brevispinus, the short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of <b>America,</b> <b>can</b> use {{a set of}} specialized tube feet to dig itself deep into the soft substrate to extract prey (usually clams). Grasping the shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its adductor muscle, and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft tissues. The gap between the valves need only be {{a fraction of a}} millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry.|$|E
5|$|The AKC {{accepted}} {{registration of}} the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers {{were introduced to the}} United States. They were originally known as Wirehaired Pinschers. International Kennel Club classifications vary; in the United Kingdom and Australia they fall within the Utility Group, while in Canada they are in the Working Group. In the AKC the Miniature Schnauzer is classed with the terriers. It was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1948 and also classed as a terrier. The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer is generally considered to begin with Ch. Dorem Display, the first Miniature Schnauzer to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He was born 5 April 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. Almost every living Miniature Schnauzer in <b>America</b> <b>can</b> trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{the word}} {{gasoline}} instead of petrol outside North <b>America</b> <b>can</b> often be confusing. Shortening gasoline to gas, which happens often, causes confusion with various forms of gas used as car fuel (compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)). In many countries, gasoline has a colloquial name derived from that of the chemical benzene (e.g., German Benzin, Czech benzín, Dutch benzine, Italian benzina, Russian бензин benzin, Polish benzyna, Chilean Spanish bencina, Thai เบนซิน bensin, Greek βενζίνη venzini, Romanian benzină, Swedish bensin, Arabic بنزين binzīn). Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay use the colloquial name nafta derived from that of the chemical naphtha.|$|E

Spain exercised its control of smaller administrative units in the colonies through royal officials, such as the corregidor, who represented the king in the municipal governments that were elected by their citizens. By the early 17th century, there were four corregidores in Upper Peru.|$|E

[...] Pseudocraterellus pseudoclavatus (formerly classified in Gomphus) is a lookalike species that grows under conifers in the central United States and westward, also differing on microscopic characters and reaction to potassium hydroxide. Turbinellus floccosus and T.kauffmanii are of similar shape but their caps are covered in scales. The edible blue chanterelle (Polyozellus multiplex) could be confused with G.clavatus, but has distinctive spores.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} in architectural criticism {{have investigated the}} relationship between architecture and the body, sexuality, sex, power, and place. Feminists in particular, such as Margrit Kennedy, perceive high-rise phallic-like buildings on the urban landscape as [...] "phallic symbols of male domination, power and rational instrumentality." [...] Esther M. K. Cheung believes the form of monumental high-rise building which grew up in 20th century <b>America</b> <b>can</b> [...] "be read as a phallic symbol of power". [...] The present trend symbolises [...] "Science and technology over nature, [...] incorporating all the maleness which that with sci-fi utopias." [...] Elizabeth Grosz, however, offers a counter argument to phallocentrism in urban design theories, saying [...] "not so much {{the dominance of the}} phallus as the pervasive unacknowledged use of the male or masculine to represent the human. The problem, then, is not so much to eliminate as to reveal the masculinity inherent in the notion of the universal, the generic human, or the unspecified subject." [...] Marc C. Taylor discusses phallic architecture and what makes a building masculine or feminine in his book Disfiguring: Art, Architecture, Religion.|$|E
500|$|Whether formed far {{offshore}} as seamounts, {{or close}} inshore by a slab window, the Siletzian basalts were laid {{down on a}} subducting oceanic plate: the Siletz terrane on the Farallon plate, and the Crescent terrane most likely on the adjoining Resurrection plate (previously broken away from the Kula plate, which had previously broken away from the Farallon plate). In both cases the Siletzia mass was drawn toward the subduction zone, which possibly ran diagonally across what is now Washington, approximately at {{the position of the}} Olympic-Wallowa Lineament. However, Siletiza was too big to be subducted, and it accreted to the continent. Accretion is sometimes called [...] "docking," [...] but is more akin to a collision: various peripheral structures are first folded or crushed, then the main structures are deformed when they come into contact, and various parts get pushed over other parts, all this playing out over several million years. To the extent that the accretion of Siletzia to North <b>America</b> <b>can</b> be given a definite date most studies give it as about 50 Ma. This date has added significance as it is also the start of a change in direction of the Pacific plate, as seen in the bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, and also a change in the Pacific Northwest from compressional to extensional tectonics. This may also be when the last of the Resurrection plate was subducted under British Columbia. Initiation of the north-striking right-lateral Straight Creek Fault at ~48 Ma likely resulted from strain accumulated during the accretion of Siletzia.|$|E
