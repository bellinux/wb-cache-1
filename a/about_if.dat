One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on Tenryū to look down onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.|$|E
5|$|At {{work one}} day, Esquire meets John Garnett (Keith David), a millionaire {{who heads a}} {{successful}} business venture called the United Express. The two quickly become friends, with Garnett's admiration for Esquire's ambition and Esquire's respect for Garnett's success driving the relationship. Esquire sees an opportunity to obtain the letter of recommendation that would bring about his acceptance to his primary college choice. When Esquire goes to Garnett's house {{to pick up the}} letter, he meets his daughter Erin, who, to his surprise, turns out to be New-New, whose real name is Erin. Erin says that she will reveal where Esquire is really from (something he lied to her father <b>about)</b> <b>if</b> he tells Rashad about her.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's {{memory was}} revived {{in the art}} of late {{eighteenth-century}} French painters. His tyrannical career became the subject of the work of several French painters such as Greuze, , David, Bonvoisin, J.A.C. Pajou, and Lethière. Their fascination with Caracalla was a reflection of the growing discontent of the French people with the French monarchy. Caracalla's visibility was influenced by the existence of several literary sources in French that included both translations of ancient works and contemporary works of the time. Caracalla's likeness was readily available to the painters due to the distinct style of his portraiture and his unusual soldier-like choice of fashion that distinguished him from other emperors. The artworks may have served as a warning that absolute monarchy could become the horror of tyranny and that disaster could come <b>about</b> <b>if</b> the regime failed to reform. Art historian Susan Wood suggests that this reform was for the absolute monarchy to become a constitutional monarchy, as per the original goal of revolution, rather than the republic that it eventually became. Wood also notes the similarity between Caracalla and his crimes leading to his assassination and the eventual uprising against, and death of, King Louis XVI: both rulers had {{died as a result of}} their apparent tyranny.|$|E

500|$|The Documentaly album {{concept was}} created in January, after the song [...] "Rookie" [...] was written.

And we instantly, before we got off the phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's an idea how that could work for us.'

[...] The publication {{went so far as to}} call Tomb Raider III [...] "a marketing concept", stating that the game is so difficult that it is impossible to beat without buying a strategy guide. Similarly, Electronic Gaming Monthly criticised the game for being rushed and highly frustrating, noting that it has [...] "too many instances of cheap deaths." [...] The magazine also remarked that the stealth elements in the Nevada levels were ineffective, especially when compared to Konami's 1998 hit Metal Gear Solid.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to start}} of {{production}} on the show, Hillenburg decided early that he wanted SpongeBob SquarePants to be a storyboard-driven show, rather than script-driven. Storyboard-driven is an approach that required artists who could take a skeletal story outline and flesh it out with sight gags, dialogue and a structure that [...] "would {{strike a balance between}} narrative and whimsy." [...] Hillenburg originally wanted [...] "a team of young and hungry people" [...] to work on the show. The group, who worked with Hillenburg on Rocko's Modern Life before, consisted of Alan Smart, Nick Jennings, and Derek Drymon. Tim Hill was asked <b>about</b> <b>if</b> he want to work as story editor, but he was unavailable at the time. The crew got Peter Burns to work as story editor who developed the idea for the episode [...] "Ripped Pants" [...] about SpongeBob ripping his pants.|$|E

On April 19 it was announced that James Van Patten would return as Dr. Heffner, a character featured in the opening scene of the fourth installment performing the autopsy on John Kramer. Peter Outerbridge was cast as a new character, William, and Tobin Bell, Betsy Russell, and Mark Rolston returned as their characters John Kramer, Jill Tuck, and Special Agent Erickson, respectively. Russell commented about her character: [...] "You find out a little more <b>about</b> <b>if</b> Jill is good or evil. Pretty much you'll know." [...] Greutert wanted to bring Cary Elwes's character Dr. Gordon back but Elwes was not available.

Meyer, who pitched the episode's premise, was {{a fan of the}} band, but Jean did not know much of them before they appeared in the episode; [...] "I've never seen one of their concerts, so I'm not the most familiar", he said. He first became aware of the band after reading an article about them in Entertainment Weekly. As they worked on the episode however, Jean became more acquainted with the band members.

Robida had a swastika tattoo and flaunted Nazi insignias and paraphernalia on his website. On February 5, Robida shot and killed a traffic officer during a routine stop. When police pulled Robida over during a later stop, he killed his girlfriend, Jennifer Bailey of Charleston, West Virginia, then opened fire on the police. Robida was shot twice in the head during the shootout with the police, and later died in the hospital. On February 7, Insane Clown Posse released a statement on the Robida attacks.

500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed... us in. It wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: [...] "There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital." ...|$|E

AllHipHop stated that [...] "overall, {{it appears that}} Lecrae is ready to offer {{one of his most}} broad and, dare-we-say, mainstream albums in terms of sound; yet, it still manages to capture the trueness of what he has always stood for and rapped <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> anything, Gravity is a giant step forward for his expanding career, and it will surely be a welcome addition to many 'Top 10' lists when 2012 comes to a close." [...] Indie Vision Music in announcing the cover of Gravity called the album [...] "likely the biggest Christian hip hop album yet". AllHipHop listed [...] "Mayday" [...] as one of the standout tracks on the album, noting the [...] "beautiful" [...] melody and hook by Ashthon Jones. The reviewer considered [...] "Violence" [...] a personal favorite, calling Lecrae's line [...] "Grew up under Tupac, bible verse and two glocks" [...] {{one of the most powerful}} lines on the album. Parlé Magazine also was favorable to the song, stating [...] "That track is definitely going places." [...] Jonathan Landrum of The Associated Press was favorable to the album, saying that [...] "in his sixth album 'Gravity,' Lecrae delivers a strong piece of work. He's not afraid to rap about his past mistakes, supplying inspirational rhymes filled with Christian values backed by well-produced secular hip-hop beats." [...] In its track-by-track review of the album, The Boombox stated that [...] "based on the warm reception to Church Clothes, this LP is set to stir the pot further in the realm of both of hip-hop and Christianity." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, declaring that Lecrae makes Gravitys various genre experiments and jumps in style [...] "sound effortless and natural". He asserted that [...] "while Rehab is the more rewarding album in the end, this one is more persuasive and immediate, making it an easy entry point into this gifted artist's discography." ...|$|E
