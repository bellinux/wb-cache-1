500|$|Since the {{previous}} episode [...] "Occupation" [...] {{focused on the}} resistance, writer Ronald D. Moore wanted the second part {{to focus more on}} Jammer's role within the NCP, as he wanted to personalize somebody working for the police force. He also wanted to make Tigh know he's wrong with launching suicide bombers, but has to do so if he believes doing so will defeat the Cylons. This is also Tigh's principal trait and role in the series. Moore stated [...] "why is Colonel Tigh on Galactica? Why does Adama keep him around? Because when the chips are down, and they are way down, baby, in this situation, when you are in a foxhole, who do you want next to you? You want Colonel Tigh 'cause he is gonna get your <b>ass</b> <b>out</b> of there." [...] The scene where Baltar speaks to an imprisoned Roslin about the suicide bombings was one of Moore's favourite scenes, as he wanted the audience to be unsure who to [...] "root for," [...] since Baltar is the biggest Cylon collaborator among the humans, but Roslin seemingly supports the bombings.|$|E

Loneliness got me into it." [...] In 1978, Tucker moved to Los Angeles to try, unsuccessfully, to broaden her appeal to pop audiences, and was quickly captivated by the city's nightlife. She also said that she [...] "was the wildest thing out there. I could stay up longer, drink more and kick the biggest ass in town. I was on the ragged edge." ...|$|E

5000|$|In April 1963, Kennedy {{assessed}} {{the situation in}} Vietnam: [...] "We don't have a prayer of staying in Vietnam. Those people hate us. They are going to throw our <b>asses</b> <b>out</b> of there at any point. But I can't give up that territory to the communists and get the American people to re-elect me." [...] Kennedy faced a crisis in Vietnam by July; despite increased U.S. support, the South Vietnamese military was only marginally effective against pro-communist Viet Cong forces.|$|R

60|$|Thus it stands, plainly recorded, in {{the oldest}} {{tradition}} that, for any {{evidence to the}} contrary, the sepulchre may have been emptied {{at any time during}} the Friday or Saturday nights. If it is said that no Jew would have violated the Sabbath by taking the former course, it is to be recollected that Joseph of Arimathæa might well be familiar with that wise and liberal interpretation of the fourth commandment, which permitted works of mercy to men--nay, even the drawing of an ox or an <b>ass</b> <b>out</b> of a pit--on the Sabbath. At any rate, the Saturday night was free to the most scrupulous of observers of the Law.|$|E

"It {{would be}} a crime against the public interest," [...] {{answered}} his friend; [...] "there can no mischief happen between two such originals, which {{will not be a}} positive benefit to society, and particularly to the Chevalier's establishment, as he calls it. I have been as sick of that captain's buff belt, and red doublet, for this month past, as e'er I was of aught; and now I hope this bold linendraper will cudgel the <b>ass</b> <b>out</b> of that filthy lion's hide. See, Nigel, see the gallant citizen has ta'en his ground about a bowl's-cast forward, {{in the midst of the}} alley--the very model of a hog in armour. Behold how he prances with his manly foot, and brandishes his blade, much as if he were about to measure forth cambric with it. See, they bring on the reluctant soldado, and plant him opposite to his fiery antagonist, twelve paces still dividing them--Lo, the captain draws his tool, but, like a good general, looks over his shoulder to secure his retreat, in case the worse come on't. Behold the valiant shop-keeper stoops his head, confident, doubtless, in the civic helmet with which his spouse has fortified his skull--Why, this is the rarest of sport. By Heaven, he will run a tilt at him, like a ram." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{last they}} reached a little bay, and began to take soundings. A light wind blew from the shore, and covered the deck and the great lateen sail with a fine red dust.

5000|$|Ilićs {{most infamous}} public {{occurred}} during a summer 2002 live phone-in on Studio B radio station. Ilić {{was asked about}} road blocks that Serb refugees from Kosovo have supposedly set up in protest throughout {{different parts of the}} country. Being completely unaware of any protests he asked the host to clarify. Host explained that Nebojša Čović, then Serbian government coordinator for Kosovo, said the refugees were organized by Ilić. Upon hearing this, Ilićs mood instantly darkened and he began his tirade: [...] "Listen to me now, Nebojša Čović is a communist piece of garbage and a Belgrade scumbag and youre free to quote me on that anywhere you want. That sick bastard should go to sanatorium, somewhere, and Ill be happy to pay for his treatment". After somewhat settling down, Ilić informs the host that hes been at home recovering from bronchitis for days and that he has no idea about any protests, but soon fires up again, this time against the Studio B radio station itself: [...] "all of you bastards at Studio B can suck my cock, and also make sure to take good care of yourselves because Ill come to that shitty station of yours and throw all you <b>asses</b> <b>out</b> the window". Finally, Ilić ends his outburst by blasting Studio B TV journalist Olja Bećković, calling her [...] "a jerkoff" [...] and adding [...] "If she was better looking, Id let her suck me off, but shes way too ugly".|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the use of some emblemes (i. e., {{gestures}} which, in a certain culture, have an inequivocal verbal equivalent) in classical Rome and their survival in the present time. We specifically study emblems which express ridicule and insult. Six gestures are analized; four of them were already used in Rome as mocking or insulting gestures (imitating the stork, the ears of an <b>ass,</b> sticking <b>out</b> the tongue and extending the middle finger); furthemore, two gestures have been included that were used in the Roman Antiquity but did not have the mocking meaning that they convey nowadays (the horn-sign and the fig-sign) ...|$|R
60|$|The {{legs of the}} ass {{are often}} striped, {{and this may be}} {{considered}} as a reversion to the wild parent form, the Equus taeniopus of Abyssinia (13/30. Sclater in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1862 page 163.), which is generally thus striped. In the domestic animal the stripes on the shoulder are occasionally double, or forked at the extremity, as in certain zebrine species. There is {{reason to believe that the}} foal is more frequently striped on the legs than the adult animal. As with the horse, I have not acquired any distinct evidence that the crossing of differently-coloured varieties of the <b>ass</b> brings <b>out</b> the stripes.|$|R

Opposite this, on the right, was the cantina, a dark place with wine-barrels and more agricultural stores. This was the whole of the downstairs.|$|R
