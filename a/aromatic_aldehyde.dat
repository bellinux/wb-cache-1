30|$|Encouraged by {{the result}} {{obtained}} with benzaldehyde, we had applied this methodology {{to a variety}} of <b>aldehydes</b> such as <b>aromatic,</b> heteroaromatic and aliphatic aldehydes successfully. The condensation reaction proceeded smoothly with β-ketoester and ammonium acetate {{in the presence of a}} catalytic amount of cadmium chloride at acetonitrile reflux to give the corresponding 1, 4 -dihydropyridine derivatives in very good yields. The acid sensitive aldehydes such as cinnamaldehyde (compound 1 e), pyridine- 2 -aldehyde (compound 1 [*]h) and 2 -furfuraldehyde (compound 1 i) worked well under these reaction conditions. The <b>aromatic</b> <b>aldehydes</b> having electron-withdrawing group react a little slower than <b>aromatic</b> <b>aldehydes,</b> and the <b>aromatic</b> <b>aldehydes</b> having electron-donating group react a little faster than <b>aromatic</b> <b>aldehydes.</b> In a similar manner, the <b>aromatic</b> <b>aldehydes</b> reacted comparatively faster than aliphatic aldehydes. This protocol is successfully applicable to both electron-rich as well as electron-deficient aldehydes. In general, all the reactions were completed within 3 to 5 [*]h at 80 °C to 85 °C, and the products of 1, 4 -dihydropyridine derivatives were obtained in 75 % to 93 % yields.
