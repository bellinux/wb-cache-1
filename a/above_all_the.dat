The rising power of buses and trolleybuses, the Great Depression in France, and <b>above</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Second World War that ravaged Rouen and Normandy, condemned the tramway to death.

5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} the rugged Finisterre Range.
