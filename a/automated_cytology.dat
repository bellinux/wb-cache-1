DNA histogram pattern and calculated proliferation index (PI) {{can be used to}} evaluate the presence or the absence of tumor cells and this technique {{can be applied to the}} <b>automated</b> <b>cytology</b> in patients with bladder tumor. Furthermore flow cytometry is considered to provide us with useful information about the malignant potential of the tumor as well as the effect of the treatment. In the follow-up examination, our results suggest that flow cytometry may be a valuable addition to the routine urological examination in the conservatively treated patients with superficial bladder tumors...|$|E
40|$|To {{achieve the}} extreme {{accuracy}} rates demanded by applications in unsupervised <b>automated</b> <b>cytology,</b> it is frequently necessary {{to supplement the}} primary segmentation algorithm with a segmentation quality control system. The more robust the segmentation strategy, the less severe the data pruning need be at the segmentation validation stage. These issues are addressed as we describe our cell nucleus segmentation strategy which is able to achieve 100 % accurate segmentation from a data set of 19946 cell nucleus images by automatically discarding the most difficult cell images. The automatic quality checking is applied to enhance {{the performance of a}} robust energy minimisation based segmentation scheme which already achieved a 99. 47 % accurate segmentation rate...|$|E

With few exceptions, {{much of the}} software developed during these early days, whether in academic or commercial institutions, was proprietary. The primary paradigm was production of hand-tuned engineered systems that could reproduce human performance, and visualization was emphasized for interpreting results or providing assistance to clinicians (Bartels and Wied, 1977; Kaman, et al., 1984; van Driel-Kulker and Ploem, 1982). The computational resources {{available at the time}} were frequently limiting.

40|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in cancer screening over the past decade, but a great deal more needs to be done if screening is to make a major impact on worldwide cancer mortality. Where fully implemented, cytological screening for cervical precursor lesions has had a major impact on mortality. However, the cost and required infrastructure levels are high, and new approaches are needed if screening is to be effective in the developing world. Testing for the human papillomavirus and <b>automated</b> liquid based <b>cytology</b> offer great promise to improve quality, reduce overall cost and make screening more viable generally. Breast screening has been less successful, although useful mortality benefits have been achieved in women aged over 50 years. Full implementation in countries that can afford it will save lives, but radical new approaches will be needed to conquer breast cancer. Colorectal cancer screening offers the best hope of a major reduction in cancer mortality over the next decade. Less certainty exists about screening for other major cancers such as lung, prostate and ovary, but a range of potential approaches merit investigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Health issue Cervical {{cancer is}} one of the most common {{malignant}} diseases of women; it is diagnosed in almost half a million women every year and half as many die from it annually. In Canada and other industrialized countries, its incidence has decreased due to cytology screening. However, invasive cases still occur, particularly among immigrant groups and native Canadian women. Although incidence of squamous cell carcinomas has decreased, the proportion of adenocarcinomas has increased because Pap cytology is ineffective to detect these lesions. Key findings In Canada, cervical cancer will cause an estimated 11, 000 person-years of life lost. In most Canadian provinces, early detection is dependent on opportunistic screening. Primary prevention can be achieved through health education (sexual behavior modification) and vaccination to prevent infection from Human Papillomavirus (HPV). The initial results from vaccination trials are encouraging but wide scale use is more than a decade away. Data gaps and recommendations Most cases of cervical cancer occur because the Pap smear was either false negative, was not done or not done often enough. Appropriate recommendations and guidelines exist on implementation of cytology-based programs. However, most Canadian women do not have access to organized screening. Further research is needed to 1) evaluate <b>automated</b> <b>cytology</b> systems; 2) define appropriate management of precursor lesions and 3) deliver definitive evidence of HPV testing efficacy in long-term follow-up studies with invasive cancer as an outcome and 4) provide Canadian data to justify augmenting or modifying current programs to use HPV testing in secondary triage of equivocal Pap smears. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{standard}} for reading cervical cytology {{is for a}} cytoscreener to manually search across an entire slide for abnormal cells using a conventional microscope. Automated technology can select fields of view to assess abnormal cells, which allows targeted reading by cytoscreeners. In the Manual Assessment Versus <b>Automated</b> Reading in <b>Cytology</b> (MAVARIC) trial, we compared the accuracy of these techniques {{for the detection of}} underlying disease. Methods: For this randomised controlled trial, women aged 25 - 64 years undergoing primary cervical screening in Manchester, UK, were randomly assigned (1 : 2) to receive either manual reading only or paired reading (automation-assisted reading and manual reading), between March 1, 2006, and Feb 28, 2009. In the paired arm, two automated systems were used - the ThinPrep Imaging System and the FocalPoint GS Imaging System. General practices and community clinics were randomised to either ThinPrep or to SurePath (for the FocalPoint system) liquid-based cytology with block randomisation stratified by deprivation index. Samples were then individually randomised to manual reading only or paired reading only. Laboratory staff were unaware of the allocation of each slide and concealment was maintained {{until the end of the}} reporting process. The primary outcome was sensitivity of automation-assisted reading relative to manual reading for the detection of underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2 +) in the paired arm. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN 66377374. Findings: 73266 liquid-based cytology samples were obtained from women undergoing primary cervical screening; 24688 allocated to the manual-only arm and 48578 to the paired-reading arm. Automation-assisted reading was 8 % less sensitive than manual reading (relative sensitivity 0. 92, 95 % CI 0. 89 - 0. 95), which was equivalent to an absolute reduction in sensitivity of 6. 3 %, assuming the sensitivity of manual reading to be 79 %. Specificity of automation-assisted reading relative to manual reading increased by 0. 6 % (1. 006, 95 % CI 1. 005 - 1. 007). Interpretation: The inferior sensitivity of automation-assisted reading for the detection of CIN 2 +, combined with an inconsequential increase in specificity, suggests that automation-assisted reading cannot be recommended for primary cervical screening.
