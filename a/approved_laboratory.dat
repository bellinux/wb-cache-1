50|$|If {{a person}} is {{suspected}} as having died from anthrax, precautions {{should be taken to}} avoid skin contact with the potentially contaminated body and fluids exuded through natural body openings. The body should be put in strict quarantine. A blood sample should then be collected and sealed in a container and analyzed in an <b>approved</b> <b>laboratory</b> to ascertain if anthrax is the cause of death. Then, the body should be incinerated. Microscopic visualization of the encapsulated bacilli, usually in very large numbers, in a blood smear stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFadyean stain) is fully diagnostic, though culture of the organism is still the gold standard for diagnosis. Full isolation of the body is important to prevent possible contamination of others. Protective, impermeable clothing and equipment such as rubber gloves, rubber apron, and rubber boots with no perforations should be used when handling the body. No skin, especially if it has any wounds or scratches, should be exposed. Disposable personal protective equipment is preferable, but if not available, decontamination can be achieved by autoclaving. Disposable personal protective equipment and filters should be autoclaved, and/or burned and buried. B. anthracis bacilli range from 0.5-5.0 μm in size. Anyone working with anthrax in a suspected or confirmed person should wear respiratory equipment capable of filtering this size of particle or smaller. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health - and Mine Safety and Health Administration-approved high-efficiency respirator, such as a half-face disposable respirator with a high-efficiency particulate air filter, is recommended. All possibly contaminated bedding or clothing should be isolated in double plastic bags and treated as possible biohazard waste. The infected person should be sealed in an airtight body bag. Dead people who are opened and not burned provide an ideal source of anthrax spores. Cremating people is the preferred way of handling body disposal. No embalming or autopsy should be attempted without a fully equipped biohazard laboratory and trained, knowledgeable personnel.|$|E

First, a conventional magnet synchrotron (UNK- 1) to receive protons from the existing 70 GeV synchrotron (U- 70) and accelerate the beam from 70 to 400 GeV. Second, a superconducting accelerator storage ring (UNK- 2) to accelerate the beam to 3 TeV.

40|$|A {{study to}} detect human {{taeniasis}} and cysticercosis {{was conducted in}} 4 village communities served by the Bethanie clinic in the North West Province, based on reports of people being diagnosed there with epileptiform episodes. Many home owners in the villages rear pigs in small numbers for both meat availability and an immediate income from live pig or pig meat sales. The primary aim of the work was to conduct {{in the study area}} a census of all small scale pig producers and a survey of rural village consumers, both by means of a structured questionnaire. The former reviewed pig husbandry practices, slaughter and marketing of pigs and the latter provided information on pork consumption, sanitation as well as people's basic knowledge of Taenia solium. Stool samples from consenting participants were screened by a contracted <b>approved</b> <b>laboratory</b> for T. solium. A descriptive analysis of retrospective data was conducted at the Bethanie clinic to determine the proportional morbidity of neurocysticercosis from the medical records of patients diagnosed with seizures in an attempt to establish possible sources of infection and routes of transmission. In addition, the total pig population in the study area was determined more accurately and the prevalence of cysticercosis investigated in pigs subjected to meat inspection at an approved abattoir. The questionnaires revealed a poor understanding of the disease, poor sanitation and hygiene, poor methods of pig husbandry and poor meat inspection and control in rural smallholder communities. There was no significant statistical difference in the proportion of households reporting evidence of epilepsy and owning pigs and those that did not.

40|$|Theses (M. Med.) -University of Natal, 1996. The aims of {{the study}} were to review the {{literature}} on the currently known adverse health effects of formaldehyde vapour exposure, to measure environmental formaldehyde levels before and after engineering controls were implemented, to measure symptoms of formaldehyde exposure when compared to non - exposed controls and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} engineering controls in reducing the symptoms associated with formaldehyde vapour exposure in anatomy students at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Natal. Pre and post intervention environmental monitoring surveys were conducted over the period July 1993 to September 1995 in the aforementioned Human Anatomy Laboratory using passive diffusion badges which were then analyzed by an <b>approved</b> <b>laboratory</b> in Johannesburg. Ambient air temperature, humidity and ventilation rates were measured simultaneously using appropriate instruments. Self-administered questionnaires, relating to the symptoms of exposure to formaldehyde vapours, were obtained from all anatomy students over a two year period before or after as well as during their exposure to the laboratory environment, as well as from all exposed staff members (including their control group). Nasal epithelial scrapings of staff members and a control group were subjected to cytological examination by the Cytology Department of the Provincial Pathology service, at the pre - intervention phase. The environmental monitoring data of 1993 and 1994 indicated that the ambient levels of formaldehyde vapour exceeded the American (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) and thus posed a potential health risk to students and staff, this was due to inadequate ventilation in the Human Anatomy Laboratory. An intervention in terms of ventilation controls was implemented and proved to be effective in reducing formaldehyde vapour levels and reported symptoms in the cohorts studied, comparing each group to themselves, however, the reported symptom levels did not drop significantly in the group exposed after the intervention compared to the group surveyed at the pre - intervention phase. Whether this reduction is sufficient to prevent long term health effects such as neoplasms and sensitization remains to be established.

The product Arcus are interested in launching in England is Linie Aquavit. They have previously tried to launch their aquavit, but without success. A group of five students at Leeds Metropolitan University has worked with this report regarding the spirit market in England. The aim and objectives was to examine the English spirit market with focus on market trends, identifying possible external influences, and the positioning of Linie Aquavit in England. The report consists of primary and secondary data, where primary data was conducted through in-depth interviews with bartenders and bar owners and questionnaires handed out to the consumers at pubs, bars and restaurants. The data was collected in Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle and Birmingham. In addition, an e-mail was sent to different distributors in England, to find different options regarding entering the English spirit market. The secondary data consists of web pages, articles, reports, journals and appropriate literature. The primary and secondary data has been analysed, and the authors have developed strategic options and recommendations that Arcus can find useful if entering the market. The findings of the analysis show that the English spirit market {{is one of the largest}} in the world. The on-trade market has decreased the recent years, while the off-trade market has been slightly increasing. The overall spirit market has decreased, and some of the reasons are the economic recession and public health campaigns. Political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal factors could influence a possible entry to the English spirit market. The authors have found that England has a well-established drinking culture, and that there is a market for Linie Aquavit.

40|$|Whilst {{growing demand}} for energy in Nepal and neighbouring- countries, {{investments}} in hydro- power projects appears continuously, both by local and multinational companies. As a consequence of this, Turbine Testing Lab was founded in 2011 at Kathmandu University in Nepal. The laboratory is rapidly developing, and is currently implementing a Francis turbine test rig. A long- term goal for the laboratory, is to execute model tests according to IEC 60193, which is the standard used in model tests of hydraulic runners. When determining the hydraulic efficiency of a runner, a central parameter is the discharge measurement. According to IEC, any secondary device {{used to measure the}} discharge shall be calibrated in sit&# 249; against one of the following primary methods: the weighing method, volumetric method or the moving- screen method. The aim of this work has been to develop and design a primary method for calibration of the flowmeter at TTL. Based on an evaluation of the mentioned primary methods, as well as economy, accuracy and correspondence with technical staff, a volumetric method is chosen as calibration principle. The principle of the method is based on collecting water into a tank with a known geometry, and by execution of level- and time measurements calculating the discharge. The calibration rig consists of a flowmeter, inlet nozzle, deflector mechanism, emergency weir, calibration tank, level measurement, time measurement, drainage system, emergency weir, and an upgraded pipe run at the measuring section of the flowmeter. It is developed a LabView program, for logging and processing the voltage output from the flowmeter. The other measurements executed is registered manually in a separate calibration sheet for data processing. An evaluation of the accuracy in the calibration method is conducted, which may be used to determine the total uncertainty when the calibration facility is installed. Provided design and installation according to ISO 8316, the accuracy in discharge measurement with the volumetric method lies within ± 0, 1 - 0, 2 %. The major uncertainty contribution in the method lies in the determination of the volume collected, and the corresponding tank calibration. It is proposed to reduce the diameter of the flowmeter from original size of 400 mm to 250 mm. Reduction in diameter and upgraded pipe run will increase accuracy of the flow measurement, a result of improved flow pattern at the measuring section. When the primary calibration rig is installed at TTL, this will be a large step towards an IEC- <b>approved</b> <b>laboratory</b> in Nepal, which open doors against an international market. </p...|$|E
40|$|U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) used large {{quantities}} of mercury in the uranium separating process from the 1950 s until the late 1980 s in support of national defense. Some of this mercury, {{as well as other}} hazardous metals and radionuclides, found its way into, and under, several buildings, soil and subsurface soils and into some of the surface waters. Several of these areas may pose potential health or environmental risks and must be dealt with under current environmental regulations. DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) awarded a contract ''Alternative Field Methods to Treat Mercury in Soil'' to IT Group, Knoxville TN (IT) and its subcontractor NFS, Erwin, TN to identify remedial methods to clean up mercury-contaminated high-clay content soils using proven treatment chemistries. The sites of interest were the Y- 12 National Security Complex located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the David Witherspoon properties located in Knoxville, Tennessee, and at other similarly contaminated sites. The primary laboratory-scale contract objectives were (1) to safely retrieve and test samples of contaminated soil in an <b>approved</b> <b>laboratory</b> and (2) to determine an acceptable treatment method to ensure that the mercury does not leach from the soil above regulatory levels. The leaching requirements were to meet the TC (0. 2 mg/l) and UTS (0. 025 mg/l) TCLP criteria. In-situ treatments were preferred to control potential mercury vapors emissions and liquid mercury spills associated with ex-situ treatments. All laboratory work was conducted in IT's and NFS laboratories. Mercury contaminated nonradioactive soil from under the Alpha 2 building in the Y- 12 complex was used. This soils contained insufficient levels of leachable mercury and resulted in TCLP mercury concentrations that were similar to the applicable LDR limits. The soil was spiked at multiple levels with metallic (up to 6000 mg/l) and soluble mercury compounds (up to 500 mg/kg) to simulate expected ranges of mercury contamination and to increase the TCLP mercury values. IT/NFS investigated ambient temperature amalgamation/stabilization/fixation of mercury-contaminated soils to meet these objectives. Treatment ranged in size from a few ounces to 10 pounds. The treatability study philosophy was to develop working envelops of formulations where reasonable minimum and maximum amounts of each reagent that would successfully treat the contaminated soil were determined. The dosages investigated were based on ratios of stoichiometric reactions and applications of standard sets of formulations. The approach purposely identified formulations that failed short or longer cure-time performance criteria to define the limits of the envelope. Reagent envelops successfully met the project requirements one day after treatment and after greater than 30 -day cures. The use of multiple levels of spikes allowed the establishment of reagent dosages that were successful across a broad range of mercury values, e. g., 50 to 6000 mg/kg mercury. The treatment products were damp to slightly wet material. Enough drying reagent, e. g., Portland cement or lime by-product, were added to some formulations to control the leachability of uranium and other hazardous metals and to ensure the product passed the paint filter test. Cost analyzes and conceptual designs for four alternatives for full-scale treatments were prepared. The alternatives included two in-situ treatments and two ex-situ treatments. The cost estimates were based on the results from the bench-scale study. All four alternatives treatment costs were well below the baseline costs...|$|E
