40|$|The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, {{and safety}} of the <b>Androderm</b> tes-tosterone (T) transdermal system (TTD) and {{intramuscular}} T enan-thate injections (IM) {{for the treatment of}} male hypogonadism were compared in a 24 -week multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study. Sixty-six adult hypogonadal men (22 – 65 years of age) were withdrawn from prior IM treatment for 4 – 6 weeks and then randomly assigned to treatment with TTD (two 2. 5 -mg systems applied nightly) or IM (200 mg injected every 2 weeks); there were 33 patients per group. Twenty-six patients in the TTD group and 32 in the IM group completed the study. TTD treatment produced circadian variations in the levels of total T, bioavailable T, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol within the nor-mal physiological ranges. IM treatment produced supraphysiological levels of T, bioavailable T, and estradiol (but not dihydrotestosterone...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Testosterone-containing gels have {{improved}} testosterone substitution therapy, {{but they are}} associated with the risk of interpersonal transfer. Therefore, we tested a new hydroalcoholic 2. 5 % testosterone gel (TGW), which was removed by washing 10 min after administration. DESIGN: The gel was applied to scrotal or non-scrotal skin in comparison to two 2. 5 mg <b>Androderm</b> patches in a randomised, three-arm, parallel-group, controlled multicentre trial over a period of 24 weeks. We included symptomatic hypogonadal men whose morning testosterone levels were < 10 nmol/l. Either 1 g TGW was applied to scrotal skin (n = 54) or 5 g to non-scrotal skin (n = 56) once daily; the patch group (n = 52) applied two patches/day. Dose titration was allowed. RESULTS: Whereas serum testosterone levels and the pre-post changes of the areas under the curve of testosterone and free testosterone between weeks 0 and 24 indicated equivalent treatment success for the patch and scrotal groups, the dermal gel group was significantly superior to the other two groups. Questionnaires on sexual function, mood and quality of life did not differ significantly between study groups, nor were prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and prostate symptoms different. However, tolerability was much better in the gel groups than the patch group. CONCLUSION: Efficacy, safety and tolerability suggest TGW as a favourable treatment for hypogonadal patients...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{delivery}} {{system has been}} developed for testosterone replacement. This formulation, COL- 1621 (Striant), a testosterone-containing buccal mucoadhesive system, {{has been shown in}} preliminary studies to replace testosterone at physiological levels when used twice daily. Therefore, the current study compared the steady-state pharmacokinetics and tolerability of the buccal system with a testosterone-containing skin patch (Andropatch or <b>Androderm)</b> in an international multicenter study of a group of hypogonadal men. Sixty-six patients were randomized into two groups; one applied the buccal system twice daily, whereas the other applied the transdermal patch daily, in each case for 7 d. Serum total testosterone and dihydrotestosterone concentrations were measured at d 1, 3 or 4, and 6, and serially over the last 24 h of the study. Pharmacokinetic parameters for each formulation were calculated, and the two groups were compared. The tolerability of both formulations was also evaluated. Thirty-three patients were treated with the buccal preparation, and 34 were treated with the transdermal patch. The average serum testosterone concentration over 24 h showed a mean of 18. 74 nmol/liter (SD =; 5. 90) in the buccal system group and 12. 15 nmol/liter (SD =; 5. 55) in the transdermal patch group (P < 0. 01). Of the patients treated with the buccal system, 97 % had average steady-state testosterone concentrations within the physiological range (10. 41 - 36. 44 nmol/liter), whereas only 56 % of the transdermal patch patients achieved physiological total testosterone concentrations (P < 0. 001 between groups). Testosterone concentrations were within the physiological range in the buccal system group for a significantly greater portion of the 24 -h treatment period than in the transdermal patch group (mean, 84. 9 % vs. 54. 9 %; P < 0. 001). Testosterone/dihydrotestosterone ratios were physiological and similar in both groups. Few patients experienced major adverse effects from either treatment. No significant local tolerability problems were noted with the buccal system, other than a single patient withdrawal. We conclude that this buccal system is superior to the transdermal patch in achieving testosterone concentrations within the normal range. It may, therefore, be a valuable addition to the range of choices for testosterone replacement therapy...|$|E
