Contains an overview of all the fragments of Justinian’s Digest regarding donations in favor of concubine made by legal <b>acts</b> <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> and mortis causa. Fromthe analysis carried out on the particular fragments of Digest results that apart from indicating the possibility of their making they do not include any mention of restrictions on their property values, and none of the fragments contained in Digest refers neither to testamentary inheritance, nor intestate inheritance by a concubine after the deceased partner. Approved in Digest legal solutions show that Justinian did not intend to carry on a restrictive policy towards concubinage, that characterized especially the legislation of Constantine the Great, but treated it positively and fully rationally. slawomirpatrycjusz@wp. plSzkoła Wyższa Psychologii Społeczne...|$|R

There {{are real}} {{uncertainty}} about the interpretation of section 3 (3) (a) (1 A) of the Estate Duty Act when the buy-and-sell agreement comes to mind. The uncertainty started with the definition of "person" in the Estate Duty Act, because the trust was not so commonly used {{at the time when}} the act came into force. Unfortunately the trust doesn't fall under the definition of "person" and therefore cannot qualify for the estate duty benefit. The big question arises whether the insured life can qualify for the estate duty benefit if the interest of the company is situated in 'n <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> trust. According to Magnum Financial Holdings (Pty) Ltd) (in Liquidation) v Summerly and Another NNO 1984 1 SA 160 (W) the court decided that the trust should be recognised as a "debtor" for all practical purposes. The trustees are authorised to conclude transactions on behalf of the trust. That means that the trust are managed by the trustees and that the trust cannot exist without the trustees. The trustees have a key-person position in the trust. My conclusion is that for the sake of section 3 (3) (a) (1 A) of the Estate Duty <b>Act</b> the <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> trust should be recognised as a person. In that case all the requirements of the section will be satisfied, and if the insured life was a trustee of the trust, he/she should enjoy the estate duty benefit. There are two solutions to the problem we face. Either the definition of "trust" or "person" should be amended in the Estate Duty Act. The definition of "trust" should include a trust as a person and the definition of "person" should include a person as a trust. That way the trust and section 3 (3) (a) (1 A) of the Estate Duty Act can be reconciled. Master...|$|R

40|$|Empirical work on intergenerational {{transfers}} {{has focused}} on distinguishing between altruistic and exchange motivated behavior. However, these two models are unable to explain the strong tendency for estates to be divided equally across children, while <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers are made unequally. This paper presents a new framework for analyzing transfers from parents to children that is more consistent with observed behavior than are the altruistic and exchange models alone. In particular the model developed here allows for differing behavior with respect to <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers and bequests due to uncertainty about the recipient's permanent income. The empirical work uses data from the Health and Retirement Survey and the Asset and Health Dynamics Survey. The patterns observed in these data are consistent with earlier findings that <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers go disproportionately to less well-off children, while bequests are divided equally across children. Further, the results support the prediction of the model in that differences in <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers arise from differences in current income, while bequests are unequal when the children's permanent incomes are different. ...|$|R

40|$|Taxpayers are {{considerably}} interested in tax planning for intergenerational transfers (<b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> gifts and bequests) that minimize {{the payment of}} taxes.

This paper aims to demonstrate that if the wealth management/investment behavior of the parent is taken into consideration, tax avoidance will persist even when gifts and bequests are jointly taxed. This is because parents dislike missing an opportunity to gain investment returns from the payment of taxes on gifts that exceed the exemption level.
