Interviews and questionnaires were conducted respectively in both China and New Zealand from May, 2007 to November, 2007. An action research was conducted in China, which lasted about four months with three cycles from March to July in 2008. Two English language teachers with the students in their class participated in the action research. The goal {{of the study was}} to identify the role that New Zealand English language teachers’ beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> played in helping Chinese English language teachers develop their teaching beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> so as to promote their students’ communication competence in the target language. On investigation, it was found that New Zealand English language teachers’ beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> played a positive role in helping Chinese English language teacher participants develop their teaching beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices.</b> They provided Chinese teacher participants with new angles to think and reflect their own teaching beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices,</b> <b>and</b> provide teacher participants with implications to be creative in the construction and reconstruction of new beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices.</b> However, it was also found that in learning and using New Zealand teachers’ beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices,</b> Chinese teacher participants had to consider the contexts within which their teaching occurred. It was proposed by this research that during the cross-cultural transplantation of teaching beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices,</b> cultural congruence <b>and</b> pedagogical reconciliation had to be achieved. Without regard to the Chinese educational culture, values, expectations, and Chinese teachers’ expertise, the change would be superficial. This study embraced a positive attitude toward using beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> from other culture(s) in Chinese English language teacher development and proposed it as an effective teacher development mode for China’s English language teacher education programme...|$|R

" Participants from Taiwan perceived significantly higher research knowledge, attitudes, <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> than pediatric OTs from Australia and the United Kingdom for a number of research activities.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the institutionalization of {{information}} security in the banking sector. This study is important to pursue since it explicates the internalization of information security governance <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> how such internalization develops an organizational resistance towards security breach. The study argues that information security governance <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> become institutionalized through social integration of routines and system integration of relevant technologies. The objective is to {{develop an understanding of}} how information security governance <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> in the Indonesian banking sector become institutionalized. Such objective is built on an argument that information security governance <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> become institutionalized through social integration of routines and system integration of relevant technologies. Pursuing this study is necessary to conceptualize the incorporation of security governance <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> as routines, the impact of security breaches on such routines, and the effects of a central governing body on such routines altogether. Accordingly, the concept of institutionalization is developed using Barley and Tolbert’s (1997) combination of institutional theory and structuration theory to explain the internalization of security governance <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> at an organizational level. Scott’s (2008) multilevel institutional processes based on institutional theory is needed to elaborate security governance <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> in an organization-to-organization context. The research design incorporates the interpretive case-study method to capture communicative interactions among respondents. Doing so provides answers to the following research questions: (1) how institutions internalize information security governance <b>and</b> <b>practices,</b> (2) how an external governing body affects the institutionalization of information security governance <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> in institutions, <b>and</b> (3) how security breaches re-institutionalize information security governance <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> in institutions. Several important findings include the habitualized security routines, information stewardship, and institutional relationship in information-security context. This study provides contributions to the body of literature, such as depicting how information security becomes internalized in an organization and the interaction among organizations engaged in implementing information security...|$|R

These results were attributed to several factors such as the abstractness of principles and attitude toward students. Implications for teacher education and future studies are discussed...|$|R
