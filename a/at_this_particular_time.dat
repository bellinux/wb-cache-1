A year later, his {{business had}} grown even more, and he started a shipping agency. Through this agency, Spark sold incoming cargoes, exporting stores to places such as Hobart, colonial produce to Calcutta, and wool consignments (the first {{of what would be}} very many wool consignments) to London, backloading merchandise when it was possible. Additionally, Spark worked as a sort of agent for farmers and country settlers by purchasing their produce and selling them supplies such as livestock and stores, as well as the occasional ploughman or overseer. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time,</b> Spark owned more than six thousand acres (24km²) of land on the Hunter River and a nine-acre (4 hectare) grant at Woolloomooloo; Spark had developed a passion for land ownership. In 1835, the designer John Verge (who also built Elizabeth Bay House) helped Spark complete his property, now named Tusculum outside of Wolloomooloo Hill (now known as Potts Point). It now houses The Royal Australian Institute of Architects.|$|E

He chose the actual removal of children from the home <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time</b> because it was a specific event, the effects of which could be studied, and because he believed it could have serious effects on a child's development and because it was preventable. In addition, views that he had already expressed about the importance of a child's real life experiences and relationship with carers had been met by [...] "sheer incredulity" [...] by colleagues before World War II. This led him to see that far more systematic knowledge was required of the effects on a child of early experiences. Bowlby and his colleagues were pioneers of the view that studies involving direct observation of infants and children were not merely of interest but were essential to the advancement of science in this area.|$|E
500|$|A {{major reason}} for GE's {{interest}} in the collaboration, rather than building a 10-ton engine on their own, was that the SNECMA project was {{the only source of}} development funds for an engine in this class <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time.</b> GE was initially considering only contributing technology from its CF6 engine rather than its much more advanced F101 engine, developed for the B-1 Lancer supersonic bomber.

Concerned that the company would be left with only the [...] "limited" [...] engine in its portfolio if it did not win the Air Force contract (for which it was competing with Pratt & Whitney and a General Motors division with its [...] "advanced" [...] engine), GE decided to apply for an export license for the F101 core technology.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{conversion}} of glucose into platform chemicals such as 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural, levulinic acid and formic acid {{has been investigated}} using two aluminophosphate based zeotypes (SAPO- 5 and MeAPO- 5) catalysts in 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride [BMIM]Cl ionic liquid as a reaction medium. The silico aluminophosphates (SAPO- 5) and metal aluminophosphates (MeAPO- 5) were designed and chosen for their tunable amount and strength of acid sites. The dehydration of glucose using each catalyst gave more than 90 % glucose conversion. Among all the catalysts tested, the most hydrophilic SAPO- 5 (1. 5 T) results in a better 5 -HMF yield of 8 % at 100 °C and 6 h reaction time. Contrary to this, the more hydrophobic SAPO- 5 gives higher yield of levulinic acid and formic acid and no 5 -HMF yield <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> reaction <b>time.</b> In general, despite the higher glucose conversion attained by these aluminophosphate based catalysts, the lower yield obtained by these materials {{can be attributed to}} the type of acidity and the incompatibility of the pore diameter of the AFI channels of the catalysts and the desired products...|$|R

[...] The company's executives answered that two was the exact number they wanted <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time,</b> because their production was based on customer orders and anything more than necessary would be a waste of resources. After this visit to Boeing, Bo became much more critical of the Chinese practice of a planned economy, pointing out that excesses of production were in fact a waste of resources. Even for a planned economy, Bo believed that central planning should be based on market demand instead of on rigid Soviet-style planning undertaken without regard to market forces.|$|E
2500|$|Mayweather fought Manny Pacquiao, after {{negotiations}} {{spread over}} a number of years, on May 2, 2015, inside MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Mayweather dictated the pace early, controlling range with the jab. His deft movement and pivoting made Pacquiao, who landed only 19% of his punches, consistently miss. Mayweather was able to counter Pacquiao with his right hand constantly throughout the fight and won via unanimous decision with the scorecards reading 118–110, 116–112, and 116–112. The vast majority of media outlets (16/18) scored the bout in his favor. In the days following the fight, many casual observers felt the match {{failed to live up to}} expectations. Pacquiao told the media after the match that he was limited in the fight due to an injured right arm. Sports Illustrated reported that Pacquiao fought through a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder, which will require surgery. Bob Arum revealed Pacquiao's injury to have been a persistent one dating back to 2008. Additionally Pacquiao's camp never requested a cortisone injection, which is allowed by the US Anti-Doping Agency, but rather a last minute toradol injection, which was declined by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. Mayweather, who originally had no plans on a rematch with Pacquiao, told ESPN's Stephen A. Smith in a text that he would be open to a rematch after Pacquiao recovers from shoulder surgery, however as of May 9, 2015, Mayweather stated [...] "Did I text Stephen A. Smith and say I will fight him again? Yeah, but I change my mind. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time,</b> no, because he's a sore loser and he's a coward."

50|$|Advances in the {{prosecution}} of sieges in ancient and medieval times naturally encouraged {{the development of a}} variety of defensive countermeasures. In particular, medieval fortifications became progressively stronger—for example, the advent of the concentric castle from the period of the Crusades—and more dangerous to attackers—witness the increasing use of machicolations and murder-holes, as well the preparation of hot or incendiary substances. Arrowslits (also called arrow loops or loopholes), sally ports (airlock-like doors) for sallies, and deep water wells were also integral means of resisting siege <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Particular</b> attention would be paid to defending entrances, with gates protected by drawbridges, portcullises, and barbicans.

40|$|This {{research}} aims to {{find out}} how motherhood is represented in the text and images of women's magazines in contemporary Britain. It explores discourses of motherhood in this popular cultural form <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> historical <b>time,</b> using quantitative, semiotic and discourse analyses of selected monthly magazines. Psychoanalytic theories and discourse analysis are employed to explore the construction of figures of motherhood in the text. I have identified the period of the late 1980 s and early 1990 s as a time of social and economic change and I seek {{to find out}} what correlation there might be between images of motherhood in the magazines and these changes, as illustrated by political rhetoric and empirical evidence of social trends. There are two main findings. The first points to the relative absence of motherhood as denoted in the magazines of the late 1980 s. Motherhood is subsumed into discourses of femininity, but rarely picked out, suggesting that motherhood is an absent presence within the magazines <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time. Motherhood is rarely mentioned but where it is identified, it is either in relation to the 'caring' or the 'working' mother. The second, major finding relates to {{the emergence of a new}} figure of motherhood in the 1990 s, which builds on the earlier figures of motherhood but presents a significant move away from earlier articulations, especially those which locate motherhood within the domestic arena and within the traditional family. This new figure of the Independent Mother suggests a paradigm shift which challenges the conservative assumptions of traditionalist political rhetoric...|$|R

I {{will go on to}} discuss <b>this</b> topic, but <b>at</b> <b>this</b> early stage it is worthwhile reflecting on exactly why it has become such an important issue <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> point in <b>time.</b> The answer is in fact relatively simple, the recent efficiencies gained using longwall mining extraction techniques have actually come at a cost, one that is currently being borne by the environment (and taxpayers of NSW). As longwall mining panels have become wider and longer and in some cases the height of the seam worked has become higher, subsidence levels have increased dramatically- from much less than 1 m in many older longwall (and earlier bord and pillar) configurations to almost 3 m over the most recent Dendrobium workings. In turn the impacts associated with subsidence have also increased dramatically (eg Cataract River, Upper Georges River, Waratah Rivulet). If longwall top coal caving methodologies are introduced into NSW, these subsidence impacts are likely to increase even further. While longwall top coal caving may not be identified for use in the southern coalfields because of the generally narrower coal seams...|$|R
40|$|Tracing the {{international}} career of the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights to Sweden via France, {{this article is}} a study in the translation of politics and the politics of translation. Specifically, it shows how the Swedish translator, physician and publisher Lorents Münter Philipson (1765 – 1851) reached for it in 1792 to add to domestic arguments against hereditary office, the purpose of which, the article argues, was to revive and legitimise a more indigenous but by now slumbering rights revolution. The article first outlines the reception of America in Sweden {{and the ways in which}} Sweden figured in American debates. It then provides a detailed analysis of the trial that ensued as a response to the Swedish translation of the Virginia Declaration. Having reconstructed the process of transmission and the trial, during which the translator was charged with attacking Sweden's monarchical constitution by means of ‘wrongly’ translating the term ‘magistrate’, the article places the translation of the declaration in political context. The contextual analysis shows that translating the declaration <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> point in <b>time</b> makes most sense against the background of the events unfolding in revolutionary France, which the translator hoped would influence political developments in Sweden and which the authorities sought to suppress...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to make sense of the typologically quite {{exceptional}} pattern of person neutralization in the plural as we find it in Dutch verbal paradigms. We argue that Dutch, and most of its dialects, have a structural pattern of syncretism in their verbal paradigm: there are no person-distinctions in the plural. The main question {{of this paper is}}: where does this structural pattern of neutralization in Dutch come from, if we cannot explain it as a typologically wellattested pattern? As a first step, note that although the pattern is typologically quite odd, it conforms to another well-known generalization about paradigms: neutralization occurs in the marked half of the paradigm (see e. g. Nevins 2009). Further, we need to explain why this pattern occurs precisely in the Netherlands <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> point in <b>time.</b> To this, we argue that this pattern arises as the result of a particular language acquisition strategy together with reduced evidence from the input for the fully inflected forms, probably as a result of dialect contact. This reduced evidence causes the third person, being the most frequent form, to dominate the other plural forms. In combination with limited paradigm splitting (Pinker, 1996), this explains the uniform plural that we find in most Dutch dialects...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore how the Oktoberfest impacts on {{regional}} identity in Bavaria, with particular focus on its capital, Munich. Over the last decade, a conscious revival of Bavarian traditions at the event has become noticeable. This thesis investigates why {{there has been a}} revival of Bavarian characteristics at the Oktoberfest and seeks also to explain why this revival is occurring <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> point in <b>time.</b> My investigation of the revival of regional Bavarian identity was conducted with a qualitative approach and placed in the wider context of Germany and Europe. Using theories around 'imagined communities' (Anderson, 1991), 'communities' boundaries' (Cohen, 1985) and 'invented traditions' (Hobsbawm, 1983), I show that, alongside the historical and political background of Bavaria, wider trends and developments in the course of Europeanisation and globalisation have {{played a significant role in}} the increasing interest in and emphasis on Bavarian identity in Munich. The research showed that the Oktoberfest offers the most prominent occasion for the Munich locals to display Bavarian traditions. Moreover, it serves as a 'celebratory stage' for the locals to reassert their identity, which is stressed as being distinct from the German nation. Also, the celebration of Bavarian tradition can be interpreted as people's 'return' to their regional roots in their search for stability in a rapidly globalising world...|$|R
