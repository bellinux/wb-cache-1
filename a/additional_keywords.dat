40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Barriers {{linked to}} drug control systems are {{considered}} to contribute to inequitable access to controlled medicines, leaving {{millions of people in}} pain and suffering. Most studies focus on access to opioids for the treatment of severe (cancer) pain. This study aims to identify specific access barriers for patients with opioid dependence in legislation and regulations of 11 central and eastern European countries. METHODS: This study builds on a previous analysis of legislation and regulations as part of the EU 7 th Framework Access To Opioid Medication in Europe (ATOME) project. An in-depth analysis was undertaken to determine specific barriers for patients with opioid dependence in need of opioid analgesics or opioid agonist therapy (OAT). For each country, the number and nature of specific potential barriers for these patients were assessed according to eight categories: prescribing; dispensing; manufacturing; usage; trade and distribution; affordability; penalties; and other. An <b>additional</b> <b>keyword</b> search was conducted to minimize the omission of barriers. Barriers in an additional category, language, were recorded qualitatively. Countries included Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey. RESULTS: Ten of the 11 countries (all except Estonia) showed specific potential barriers in their legislation and regulations. The total number of barriers varied from two (Slovenia) to 46 (Lithuania); the number of categories varied from one (Slovenia) to five (Lithuania). Most specific potential barriers were shown in the categories 'prescribing', 'usage' and 'other'. The total number in a single category varied from one to 18 (Lithuania, prescribing). Individual differences between countries in the same specific potential barrier were shown; for example, variation in minimum age criteria for admission to OAT ranging from 15 (Lithuania, in special cases) to 20 years (Greece). All countries had stigmatizing language in their legislation. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with opioid dependence are likely to experience specific barriers to accessing opioids in addition to those experienced by other non-dependent patients...|$|R
40|$|The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol is {{developed}} for Mobile Ad Hoc Network. It {{operates as a}} table driven, proactive protocol. The core of the OLSR protocol is the selection of Multipoint Relays (MPRs), used as a flooding mechanism for distributing control traffic messages in the network, and reducing the redundancy in the flooding process. A node in an OLSR network selects its MPR set so that all two hop neighbor are reachable by the minimum number of MPR. However, if an MPR misbehaves during {{the execution of the}} protocol, the connectivity of the network is compromised. This paper introduces a new algorithm for the selection of Multipoint Relays (MPR) whose aims is to provide each node to selects alternative paths to reach any destination two hops away.

5000|$|Classified {{information}} is material {{that a government}} body claims is sensitive information that requires protection of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Access is restricted by law or regulation to particular groups of people, and mishandling can incur criminal penalties and loss of respect. A formal security clearance is often required to handle classified documents or access classified data. The clearance process usually requires a satisfactory background investigation. Documents and other information assets are typically marked with one of several (hierarchical) levels of sensitivity—e.g. restricted, confidential, secret and top secret. The choice of level is often based on an impact assessment; governments often have their own set of rules which include the levels, rules on determining the level for an information asset, and rules on how to protect information classified at each level. This often includes security clearances for personnel handling the information. Although [...] "classified information" [...] refers to the formal categorization and marking of material by level of sensitivity, it has also developed a sense synonymous with [...] "censored" [...] in US English. A distinction is often made between formal security classification and privacy markings such as [...] "commercial in confidence". Classifications {{can be used with}} <b>additional</b> <b>keywords</b> that give more detailed instructions on how data should be used or protected.|$|E
5000|$|Type {{libraries}} contain metadata {{to represent}} COM types. These types are described using Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MSIDL/IDL). IDL files define object-oriented classes, interfaces, structures, enumerations and other user-defined types {{in a language}} independent manner. IDL is similar in appearance to C++ declarations with some <b>additional</b> <b>keywords</b> such as [...] "interface" [...] and [...] "library" [...] for defining interfaces and collections of classes. IDL also supports the use of bracketed attributes before declarations to provide additional information, such as interface GUIDs and the relationships between pointer parameters and length fields. IDL files are compiled by the MIDL compiler. For C/C++, the MIDL compiler generates a compiler-independent header file containing struct definitions to match the vtbls of the declared interfaces and a C file containing declarations of the interface GUIDs. C++ source code for a proxy module can also be generated by the MIDL compiler. This proxy contains method stubs for converting COM calls into remote procedure calls to enable DCOM for out-of-process communication. IDL files can also be compiled by the MIDL compiler into a type library (TLB). TLB files contain binary metadata that can be processed by different language compilers and runtime environments (e.g. VB, Delphi, [...]NET etc.) to generate language-specific constructs to represent the COM types defined in the TLB. For C++, this will convert the TLB back to its IDL representation.|$|E

The application of model checking is limited {{due to the}} state-space explosion problem- {{as the number of}} components represented by a model in-creases, the worst case size of the associated state-space grows exponentially.

Current techniques can handle limited kinds of symme-try, e. g. full symmetry between identical components in a concurrent system.

OBJECTIVE: To present nationally representative findings on associations of DSM-IV ASPD versus syndromal adult antisocial behavior without conduct disorder before age 15 with additional psychiatric disorders among U.
