25|$|The {{tower and}} TRACON opened on September 16, 2013 with updated {{electronics}} and equipment, including the STARS radar system; improving services and safety for pilots and the flying public. With the expanded facilities and new equipment, the TRACON operates the <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> for Boise Airport, and also remotely operates the <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> for the Bozeman Airport in Montana. The TRACON was then renamed Big Sky Approach {{to reflect the}} broader geographical coverage. The consolidation of Boise and Bozeman <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> facilities into Big Sky Approach {{is part of the}} FAA's continuing plan to consolidate <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> services across the nation. Boise's TRACON was designed with the option of adding additional radar scopes, and may offer <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> services to other airports in the future.|$|E

30|$|The six-machine {{power system}} is {{considered}} to be controlled through the conventional and Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-based sliding mode <b>control</b> <b>approaches,</b> while the optimal <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> is also designed to have the merit of comparison. It is clearly concluded that the conventional one is not as efficient as the proposed Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-based integral <b>control</b> <b>approaches</b> in general. As long as the same conventional <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> involves the high levels of the chattering on the sliding surface, the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-based <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> tries to suppress the phenomenon. Besides, the results of the aforementioned Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-based <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> are much quicker than other related considered ones. It is worth to noting that both the conventional and the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-based <b>control</b> <b>approaches</b> stabilize the system successfully after the occurrence of the grid faults to show acceptable efficiency. Stabilizing in a few seconds, the good accuracy and the ability to trace and follow the desired levels, prior to and after the fault, can be considered from the positive aspects of these <b>control</b> <b>approaches.</b> Although the higher control parameters in optimal <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> yields quicker stability, it fails to efficiently stabilize the system in the presence of perturbations. Regarding the supremacy of the robust <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> in overcoming the perturbations, it is shown that by realizing these types of <b>control</b> <b>approaches</b> in parallel, the effectiveness of the proposed Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-based <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> is tangibly visible.|$|R

40|$|Centralized {{semi-active}} {{control is}} a technique for controlling the whole structure using one main computer. Centralized control systems introduce better control for relatively short to medium high structures where the response of any story cannot {{be separated from the}} adjacent ones. In this paper, two centralized <b>control</b> <b>approaches</b> are proposed for controlling the seismic response of post-tensioned (PT) steel frames. The first <b>approach,</b> the stiffness <b>control</b> <b>approach,</b> aims to alter the stiffness of the PT frame so that it avoids large dynamic amplifications due to earthquake excitations. The second <b>approach,</b> deformation regulation <b>control</b> <b>approach,</b> aims at redistributing the demand/strength ratio in order to provide a more uniform distribution of deformations over the height of the structure. The two <b>control</b> <b>approaches</b> were assessed through simulations of the earthquake response of semi-actively and passively controlled six-story post-tensioned steel frames. The results showed that the stiffness <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> is efficient in reducing the frame deformations and internal forces. The deformation regulation <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> was found to be efficient in reducing the frame displacements and generating a more uniform distribution of the inter-story drifts. These results indicate that centralized semi-active control can be used to improve the seismic performance of post-tensioned steel frames...|$|R

25|$|The plane made {{radio contact}} with <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> at Prestwick shortly before 11:00p.m. At {{this point the}} {{cross-wind}} over the main runway had, unknown to Parmentier, dropped to 14knots which made it within limits to attempt a landing on the main runway. Instead, he decided to attempt an overshoot of the main runway guided by the ground radar controller, followed by a left-hand turn that would bring the plane downwind of the alternate runway. He would then overfly the runway before looping round for his final approach. While it might sound complicated, Parmentier {{expected to be in}} visual contact with the ground which would make such an attempt relatively easy.|$|E

At the same time, the Republic Airlines aircraft, bound for Los Angeles, California was instructed to taxi into position and hold for two minutes before takeoff clearance was also granted on the intersecting runway 1L. As the landing SkyWest aircraft passed the runway threshold the Republic Airlines {{aircraft was}} cleared for takeoff.
