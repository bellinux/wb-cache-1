5|$|Is the land's epitome, or you {{may call}} it the lesser isle of Great Britain.

It is <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> stones and men, with a vast {{confusion}} of languages; and were the steeple not sanctified, nothing liker Babel. The noise in it is like that of bees, a strange humming or buzz mixed of walking tongues and feet: {{it is a kind}} of still roar or loud whisper... It is the great exchange of all discourse, and no business whatsoever but is here stirring and a-foot... It is the general mint of all famous lies, which are here like the legends of popery, first coined and stamped in the church.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{over the}} state of the {{environment}} around the most popular parts of the Mont Blanc massif, and the need for visitors to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont Blanc is <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. The problems are covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. But I want to confront people with the reality and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter Hut used by most climbers ascending Mont Blanc, the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses Hut. Each high altitude hut faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and energy supply or waste management, and the provision of services to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif and elsewhere in the Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont Blanc between 2007 and 2013.|$|E

In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children {{had a crush on}} Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E

25|$|It was {{impossible}} to estimate the number involved {{with any degree of}} accuracy because the lighting was poor, the victims were all tangled together, and everything was covered with a thick layer of black dust. Many of the victims were writhing in agony and were screaming for individual attention.

25|$|In {{the area}} {{corresponding}} to the lower legs of the body were laid out various drinking vessels, including a pair of drinking horns made from the horns of an aurochs, extinct since early mediaeval times. These have matching die-stamped gilt rim mounts and vandykes, of similar workmanship and design to the shield mounts, and exactly similar to the surviving horn vandykes from Mound 2. In the same area stood a set of maplewood cups with similar rim-mounts and vandykes, and <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> folded textiles lay on the left side.|$|E
25|$|On tilled soil a {{one-piece}} roller has {{the disadvantage}} that when turning corners the outer {{end of the}} roller has to rotate much faster than the inner end, forcing one or both ends to skid. A one-piece roller turned on soft ground will skid up <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> soil at the outer radius, leaving heaps, which is counter-productive. Rollers are often made {{in two or three}} sections to reduce this problem, and the Cambridge roller overcomes it altogether by mounting many small segments onto one axle so that they can each rotate at local ground-speed.|$|E

25|$|The main diet of Iyers is {{composed}} of vegetarian food, mostly rice which is the staple diet for millions of South Indians. Vegetarian side dishes are frequently made in Iyer households apart from compulsory additions as rasam,sambar,etc. Home-made ghee is a staple addition to the diet, and traditional meals do not begin until ghee is poured over <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> rice and lentils. While tasting delicious, the cuisine eschews the extent of spices and heat traditionally found in south Indian cuisine. Iyers are mostly known for their love for curd. Other South Indian delicacies such as dosas, idli, etc. are also relished by Iyers. Coffee amongst beverages and curd amongst food items form an indispensable part of the Iyer food menu.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{an effort}} to crack down on {{corruption}} by the eunuchs inspired by Johnston, Puyi ordered an inventory of the treasures in the Forbidden City, which caused the Hall of Supreme Harmony to go up in flames in a case of arson on the night of 26 June 1923 as the eunuchs tried to cover up the extent of their theft. Johnston reported on the next day he “found the Emperor and Empress standing on <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> charred wood, sadly contemplating the spectacle”. The treasures reported lost in the fire include 2,685golden statues of Lord Buddha, 1,675golden altar ornaments, 435porcelain antiques, and 31boxes of sable furs, though it is likely that most if not all of these treasures were sold on the black market before the building was set afire.|$|E

25|$|The {{time and}} {{circumstances}} of its final extinction are wholly unknown, but {{the site is}} now desolate, and the whole neighbouring district, once celebrated {{as one of the}} most fertile in Italy, was by the mid-19th century almost wholly uninhabited. The position of the ancient city may nevertheless be clearly identified; and though no ruins worthy of the name are still extant, large heaps of rubbish and foundations of ancient buildings mark the site of Heraclea near Policoro, about 5km from the sea, and a short distance from the right bank of the Aciris. Numerous coins, bronzes, and other relics of antiquity have been discovered on the spot. A medieval town, Anglona, was founded on the site; however, once a bishopric, now itself is but <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> ruins, among which are those of an 11th-century church.|$|E
25|$|As a seven-year-old, after {{traumatic}} {{separation from}} his mother,Chaya Lau, Lau was imprisoned in a Nazi slave labor camp {{and then in}} Buchenwald extermination camp. He has attributed his unlikely survival to heroic efforts of his older brother Naphtali Lau-Lavie who concealed him, at constant risk, and enlisted other prisoners in this effort. Yisrael Meir was freed from the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1945. He became a poster child for miraculous survival, and the inhumanity of the Nazi regime, after U.S. Army chaplain Rabbi Herschel Schacter detected him hiding behind <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> corpses when the camp was liberated. Lau has credited a teen prisoner with protecting him in the camp (later determined by historian Kenneth Waltzer to be Fedor Mikhailichenko). His entire family was murdered, {{with the exception of}} his older brother, Naphtali Lau-Lavie, his half brother, Yehoshua Lau-Hager, and his uncle already living in Mandate Palestine.|$|E
25|$|Canada {{played their}} third match {{of the tournament}} at the same venue in Stirling, Scotland against United Arab Emirates. UAE got off to the ideal start. Aside from winning the coin-toss, they decided to bowl first. Canada, batting first, lost their first 2 wickets in the first 8 balls bowled. It was {{followed}} by a solid partnership between Hiral Shah and Nitish Kumar who plundered 58 runs between them. But the tide turned again in UAE’s favor as they picked up <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> wickets to reduce Canada down to 109 for the loss of 9 wickets. But Navneet Dhaliwal came to the rescue with an unbeaten 39 to raise the total to 132 runs at the end of 20 overs. In response, UAE lost their first wicket in the third over but good partnerships for the second (25 runs), third (40 runs) and fourth (19 runs) wickets kept them on track. The match seemed level when the target was whittled down to 33 runs required in three overs which came down to 25 runs required off 12 balls. But, Shakoor and Patil brought UAE home in the last over after plundering Cecil Parvez for 21 runs in his final over.|$|E
