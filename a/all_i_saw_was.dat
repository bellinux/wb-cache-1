500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the seventh season, the {{producers}} sought to re-introduce Dax but with a new host. They decided immediately that it had to be a female character, as otherwise Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor, would be the only female main character. There were some difficulties in finding an actress who met the requirements of the part; Ira Steven Behr said [...] "So we started the casting process, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> a lot of people who couldn't play the part. There was absolutely no one in the running." [...] The initial casting call required an actress with a [...] "spooky" [...] quality, but following the failure to find someone adequate, co-supervising producer René Echevarria suggested that the character instead should be someone who was unprepared to be joined with Dax and only did so because of an unexpected occurrence.|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the final}} appearance. Because the grotto was barricaded by the local government, Soubirous knelt outside the fence by the riverbank. [...] "I thought I was at the Grotto, at the same {{distance}} as I was the other times. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> Our Lady... She was more beautiful than ever." ...|$|E

5000|$|A common anecdote {{between the}} {{brothers}} {{came from a}} match where they played for opposing teams and where they were matched up against each other. El Burro was playing at C.D. FAS and Cañitas at Sonsonate. Sonsonate had a green uniform, with green socks. The brothers joked in later years about facing each other in that match, where El Burro played a very rough game against his older sibling. After the match, {{when they arrived at}} their common home, Cañitas confronted his younger brother about his rough play during the match, to which El Burro responded: Hey, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> the green socks! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{smiled to}} think that these childish devices were {{intended}} to deceive Sir Charles Vandrift. Not quite {{the sort of man}} (as the City of London knows) to be taken in by hocus-pocus. And <b>all</b> this, <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> <b>was</b> the cheapest and most commonplace conjurer's patter.|$|R
25|$|Penny Sparrow is {{one such}} {{high-profile}} case. She posted the following through her Facebook account:These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I’m sorry to say that I was among the revellers and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear. From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Remember, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> {{that a man}} was there. I {{concluded}} it was Andrews, {{waiting to}} take the horse; and as {{he is a great}} hanger-on of Sam, I wished to avoid him, and not keep my candle alight to attract his attention. That was the whole reason of my getting out of window, and starting so soon; as unlucky a thing as I could have done.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Tommy Tit {{smoothed}} out some rumpled feathers and was most provokingly slow about it. [...] "When I left here," [...] he began at last, [...] "I flew straight up to Farmer Brown's house, as I said I would. I flew all around it, but <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> that horrid Black Pussy {{on the back}} doorsteps, {{and she looked at}} me so hungrily that she made me dreadfully uncomfortable. I don't see what Farmer Brown keeps her about for, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All that I {{ever heard}} was {{the opening of}} the door. <b>All</b> that <b>I</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> that pair of hands. One night I fancied--but that must have been a dream!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered. [...] "I did {{not notice}} him at the station at <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that he <b>was</b> sitting {{at the same table}} downstairs as this gentleman, but I am quite sure that I have never seen him before in my life." ...|$|R

60|$|The prisoners trailed past him, talking fluently, {{but unable}} to gesticulate in the drag of the current. Then the surfacers rolled up, two {{on each side of}} the Statue. With one accord the spectators looked elsewhere, but there was no need. Keefe turned on full power, and the thing simply melted within its case. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> a surge of {{white-hot}} metal pouring over the plinth, a glimpse of Salad's inscription, 'To the Eternal Memory of the Justice of the People,' ere the stone base itself cracked and powdered into finest lime. The crowd cheered.|$|E
60|$|I was {{so excited}} by these heavy minute-guns {{following}} one another that I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury. As I did so a second report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards Hounslow. I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such evidence of its work. But <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> the deep blue sky above, with one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath. And {{there had been no}} crash, no answering explosion. The silence was restored; the minute lengthened to three.|$|E
60|$|So far as {{the work}} was {{concerned}} that was {{all there was to}} see. Nothing dramatic happened; no girl fled to them imploring help or asking to be saved from the persecutions of a man; no girl even insulted them--for these Officers to be insulted is a thing unknown. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> the sowing of the seed in very stony ground, where not one kern out of a thousand is like to germinate and much less to grow. Yet as experience proves, occasionally it does both germinate and grow, yes, and bloom and come to the harvest of repentance and redemption. It is for this that these unwearying labourers scatter their grain from night to night, that at length they may garner into their bosoms a scanty but a priceless harvest.|$|E
60|$|Lucy I {{never thought}} of as {{handsome}} at <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> she <b>was</b> pleasing; fancied she was even more so to me than to any one else; and I never looked upon her sunny, cheerful and yet perfectly feminine face, without a feeling of security and happiness. As for her honest eyes, they invariably met my own with an open frankness that said, as plainly as eyes could say anything, {{there was nothing to}} be concealed.|$|R
60|$|But {{the odds}} were too unequal, and, though he who fought alone {{was by far the}} best and bravest of them <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that it <b>was</b> but a {{question}} of time before the remaining five would find an opening through his marvelous guard and bring him down.|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 Who claimed {{that death is}} the end of life? You died-but <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> happen <b>was</b> your spirit fill the world. And your words: Take flight, child. Don 2 ̆ 7 t wait for the end, the beauty is in the flight.

60|$|Eager as I was to ship, the indulgence of {{gazing at}} <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> so attractive, {{that it was}} noon before we reached an Indiaman. This was a pretty little ship of about four hundred tons, that was called the John. Little I say, for such she would now be thought, though a vessel of her size was then termed large. The Manhattan, much the largest ship out of the port, {{measured}} but about seven hundred tons; while few even of the Indiamen went much beyond five hundred. I can see the John at this moment, near fifty years after I first laid eyes on her, as she then appeared. She was not bright-sided, but had a narrow, cream-coloured streak, broken into ports. She was a straight, black-looking craft, with a handsome billet, low, thin bulwarks, and waistcloths secured to ridge-ropes. Her larger spars were painted the same colour as her streak, and her stern had a few ornaments of a similar tint.|$|E

5000|$|Unnatural Axe's 1978 song [...] "They Saved Hitler's Brain" [...] was {{singer and}} guitarist Richie Parsons' {{homage to the}} film. He says in an {{interview}} with Boston Groupie News, [...] " [...] I saw the last 5 minutes of this B movie that was funny as hell. I had no idea what it was about. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> Hitler's Brain in a glass jar {{in the back of a}} staff car and the rest I made up." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently I dozed off, to be {{awakened by}} the sudden sound of a great fish leaping in the lake. I sat up and stared, fearing lest {{it might be the}} splash of a paddle, for I could not put from my mind the {{possibility}} of attack. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> however, <b>was</b> the low line of the distant shore, and above it the bright and setting stars that heralded the coming of the sun. Then I woke the others, and we washed and ate, since once the sun rose time would be precious.|$|R
5000|$|From <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> {{my father}} <b>was</b> a good man. But while I was growing up, I was told {{so many stories}} about him that I've come to learn were all lies.

5000|$|In Western culture, Schultes's discoveries {{influenced}} {{writers who}} considered hallucinogens as the gateways to self-discovery, such as Aldous Huxley, William Burroughs and Carlos Castaneda. Although he {{contributed to the}} psychedelic era with his discoveries, he personally disdained its proponents: dismissing drug guru and fellow Harvard professor Timothy Leary for being so little versed in hallucinogenic species that he misspelled the Latin names of the plants. When William Burroughs described his ayahuasca visions as an earth-shaking metaphysical experience, Schultes famously replied, [...] "That's funny, Bill, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> colors." ...|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on September 16, 2008, the private Yahoo! Mail account of Sarah Palin was hacked by a 4chan user. The hacker, known as [...] "Rubico", {{claimed he had}} read Palin's {{personal}} e-mails because {{he was looking for}} something that [...] "would derail her campaign." [...] After reading through Palin's emails, Rubico wrote, [...] "There was nothing there, nothing incriminating — <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> personal stuff, some clerical stuff from when she was governor." [...] Rubico wrote that he used the Sarah Palin Wikipedia article to find Palin's birth date (one of the standard security questions used by Yahoo!.) in [...] "15 seconds." [...] The hacker posted the account's password on /b/, an image board on 4chan, and screenshots from within the account to WikiLeaks. A /b/ user then logged in and changed the password, posting a screenshot of his sending an email to a friend of Palin's informing her of the new password on the /b/ thread. However, he did not blank out the password in the screenshot. A multitude of /b/ users then attempted to log in with the new password, and the account was automatically locked out by Yahoo!. The incident was criticized by some /b/ users, one of whom complained that [...] "seriously, /b/. We could have changed history and failed, epically." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} slated {{first to be}} {{released}} on 11 June 2008 (Koldun's birthday) but some minor production problems caused the release to be postponed to autumn 2008. However, in 2008 Koldun stopped working with Lunev due to conflicting opinions. Lunev did not want Koldun's own songs being featured on the debut album. Since the dispute Koldun is now his own producer and the album release was pushed to February/March 2009. Koldun has said (translated from Russian) [...] "I was deciding {{for a long time}} what to do, {{but at the end of}} <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> this <b>is</b> not going to work out and I decided to be my own producer. To be alone and be able to do with my music what I want." ...|$|R
6000|$|... a mere {{reflection}} of {{the tone of the}} period, compared with a real element in the character. At least so my sister tells me, though at the time <b>all</b> the difference <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> that Miss Fordyce had the most originality, and unconsciously became the leader. The bookroom was given up to us, and there in the morning we drew, worked, read, copied and practised music, wrote out extracts, and delivered our youthful minds to one another on all imaginable topics from 'slea silk to predestination.' ...|$|R
6000|$|In the fauna of {{the region}} that I had traversed I had noted changes {{corresponding}} {{to those in the}} flora. On the upper slope there was nothing but the mountain sheep, but I passed successively through the habitats of the bear, the deer and the horse. This last mentioned creature, which our naturalists have believed long extinct, and which Dorbley declares our ancestors domesticated, I found in vast numbers on high table lands covered with grass upon which it feeds. The animal answers the current description of the horse very nearly, but <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> destitute of the horns, and none had the characteristic forked tail. This member, on the contrary, is a tassel of straight wiry hair, reaching nearly to the ground--a surprising sight. Lower still I came upon the mastodon, the lion, the tiger, hippopotamus and alligator, all differing very little from those infesting Central Europe, as described in my [...] "Travels in the Forgotten Continent." ...|$|R

6000|$|And {{stranger}} still, {{it happened}} to be before that very same curtain that many years later I myself stepped forth to make my first bow as a playwright. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the house but dimly, for on such occasion one's vision is apt to <b>be</b> clouded. <b>All</b> that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> clearly <b>was</b> in the front row of the second circle--a sweet face laughing though the tears were in her eyes; and she waved to me a handkerchief.

It was during the Klondyke rush that my father first became prosperous, and {{for a number of}} years <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> him. When my mother died I was sent to a small, old-fashioned, New England town, where some elderly relatives took care of me. They were good people, but very narrow, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> heard and <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> commonplace and provincial. Then I went to a very strict and exclusive school and stayed there much longer than other girls.” Ruth paused and smiled. “When at last I joined my father I felt as if I had suddenly awakened in a different world.

60|$|On the {{following}} day, I visited a plantation or farm, of about twelve hundred acres, {{on the opposite}} bank of the river. Here again, although I went down with {{the owner of the}} estate, to 'the quarter,' as that part of it in which the slaves live is called, I was not invited to enter into any of their huts. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> of them, <b>was,</b> that they were very crazy, wretched cabins, near to which groups of half-naked children basked in the sun, or wallowed on the dusty ground. But I believe that this gentleman is a considerate and excellent master, who inherited his fifty slaves, and is neither a buyer nor a seller of human stock; and I am sure, from my own observation and conviction, that he is a kind-hearted, worthy man.|$|R
