5000|$|The term [...] "information" [...] is {{also used}} for other {{purposes}} in the Criminal Code, such as applications to obtain <b>a</b> search <b>warrant.</b> <b>A</b> peace officer who is seeking <b>a</b> search <b>warrant</b> must file <b>a</b> sworn information before a {{justice of the peace}}, outlining the reasons in support of <b>a</b> search <b>warrant.</b> The justice of the peace then reviews the information to obtain, and decides whether the information supports the issuance of <b>a</b> search <b>warrant.</b>|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, {{the defense}} in many {{criminal}} trials attempted to prove that <b>a</b> search <b>warrant</b> was invalid, thus making the search illegal and hence the evidence obtained through the search inadmissible in the trial. However, there were no hard guidelines defining the legality of <b>a</b> search <b>warrant</b> {{and it could be}} difficult for a judge to decide upon <b>a</b> <b>warrant’s</b> validity.|$|R

5|$|Tera McArthur asked {{two police}} {{officers}} to accompany her to a trailer home where she lived with her husband Charles, {{so that she could}} take her belongings out of the home. Just after she came out of the trailer, she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get <b>a</b> <b>warrant.</b> The Illinois Appellate Court held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures without <b>a</b> <b>warrant.</b> The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case in 2000.|$|E

With publicity increasing demand, sales were brisk, but the reappearance of The Well on bookshop shelves soon {{came to the attention of}} the Home Office.

5|$|Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case {{decided in}} 2001. The case {{concerned}} {{the extent of}} the government’s power to limit an individual’s complete control of his or her home pending the arrival of a search warrant. A divided Court held that the search was not unconstitutional because there was a reasonable law-enforcement need to acquire <b>a</b> <b>warrant,</b> namely, to prevent the potential destruction of evidence within the home.|$|E

50|$|However, not all {{of these}} cues are {{weighted}} equally; rather, <b>warrants</b> possess <b>a</b> <b>warranting</b> value (Walther & Parks, 2002).

Warrants that are very difficult to manipulate by the user are considered high in warranting value, while those that are easily changed have <b>a</b> low <b>warranting</b> value and are therefore much more questionable in terms of accuracy (Walther & Parks, 2002).
