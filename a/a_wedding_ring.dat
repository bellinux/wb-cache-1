5|$|On Her Majesty's Secret Service was {{the longest}} Bond film until Casino Royale was {{released}} in 2006.

5|$|A running joke {{throughout}} the film series is Moneypenny's unrequited love for Bond and his playful flirting with her. She flirts back, jokes and sometimes pouts, hoping to wrangle a proposal and <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>ring</b> out of him. A fantasy sequence in Die Another Day marks the only occasion in the Eon film series in which Moneypenny was actually {{shown in a}} romantic embrace with Bond, although this is only in Q-branch's virtual reality machine.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw writes {{of the possibility that}} the Duke raped his sister, citing evidence from Charles Greville's diaries, as well as other factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>ring</b> in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E
5|$|While Elaine is {{depressed}} {{about the}} low quality of her apartment, Jerry overhears Harold (Glenn Shadix) and Manny (Tony Plana), {{the managers of}} his apartment building, discussing a death that makes an apartment available. Shocked by the low rent, Jerry immediately tells Elaine {{that he will be}} able to get her the apartment above his. She is extremely excited to hear this, as s{{he will be able to}} live near Jerry. Though excited at first, Jerry later realizes how intrusive Elaine might become, and that living with her might get annoying. He discusses his problem with George, but the topic of their conversation changes and they eventually talk about wearing <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>ring</b> to a party, to see how women will react. George dislikes the idea at first, but eventually borrows one from Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) to experiment.|$|E
5|$|Willis {{wakes up}} a few days later, but now has a more {{sinister}} personality.

Scully explains to Fox Mulder that Willis has been obsessed with the Dupre-Phillips case for the past year, and admits to dating Willis while he was her instructor at the FBI Academy. It is discovered that left-handed shears were used to cut off Dupre's fingers, {{despite the fact that}} Willis is right-handed, leading Mulder to believe that Willis' body is inhabited by Dupre's consciousness. The agents visit a University of Maryland medical professor who theorizes that during near-death experiences, an energy release can occur that could radically change someone's personality.|$|E

5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood {{that seems to have}} resisted the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among the debris on the floor. Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress is still on the bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>ring</b> was found concreted to the bottom of a soup tureen that was retrieved from the debris field. It was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.|$|E

Aden's {{relationship}} with her deteriorates when Belle develops post-traumatic stress disorder after being attacked. She later refuses to leave hospital after being injured in a fire, and becomes addicted to the prescription medication that she takes for anxiety. Aden's feelings for Nicole are reignited, and they have sex several times before being caught together by Belle. Roman throws Aden out for sleeping with his daughter. Drug addict Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) deepens the rift between Aden and Belle, but they eventually reconcile and become engaged. In order to pay for <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>ring,</b> Aden takes a loan from corrupt bookmaker Clint, and loses several football matches on Clint's instruction. He refuses to ruin Geoff's career by injuring him, however, so Clint has Aden beaten up. Belle learns that she has terminal cancer and pushes the wedding forward, but does not tell Aden. He is devastated to learn of her condition {{the day before the}} ceremony, but is convinced {{to go ahead with the}} wedding by Roman. He and Belle spend four weeks together as husband and wife before she dies. Following her death, Aden becomes reclusive. He eventually returns to work, and is saved by Geoff when he almost drowns in an accident, which results in them becoming friends.|$|E
25|$|Mate {{guarding}} tactics {{employed by}} males {{tend to be}} hiding the female from intrasexual threats; this could be not bringing the mate to social events in which other competing males may be present. Another is to request that the female wear items that indicate possession, this could be <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>ring</b> or the male's jacket for example. Males may also demonstrate the quality of resources they have to offer (e.g. buying the mate gifts, or paying for a meal). Men {{are also more likely}} to employ threatening and violent behaviour towards intrasexual rivals.|$|E
50|$|Wrap rings {{can serve}} several purposes. They {{can be used}} in {{addition}} to <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> band or can be used as the wedding band itself, creating <b>a</b> coordinated <b>wedding</b> <b>ring</b> set. Wrap rings are sometimes chosen as anniversary gifts or used when renewing wedding vows. In some instances, enhancers have been chosen to wrap around an heirloom solitaire diamond ring, such as a mother’s engagement ring. Generally, these rings are used simply to enhance the appearance of a basic, diamond solitaire ring.|$|R

25|$|The thali is {{an emblem}} {{shaped like a}} leaf and which is worn as a necklace.

The thalikettu kalyanam was the ritual during which the thali would be tied on a piece of string around the neck of a Nair girl. If the girl should reach puberty before the ceremony took place then she would in theory have been out-caste, although it is probable that this stricture was not in fact observed.|$|E

500|$|The wool {{produced}} by the Shetland has historically been a valuable commodity. Shetlands produce numerous shades of wool colours (see below), and this variety was commercially important to the wool industry of the Shetland Isles, where natural wools are often used undyed. Tweed is also produced from the coarser Shetland wool, but the Isles are best known for their multicoloured knitwear (made using Fair Isle knitting) and for the traditional knitted lace shawls which are so fine, they will pass through <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>ring.</b> Fleeces usually weigh between [...]|$|E

500|$|Midge {{was sold}} [...] "pregnant" [...] with Nikki, {{who was a}} tiny baby inside Midge's {{magnetic}} removable womb. This led to some controversy with some consumers saying that the doll was inappropriate for children, or that it promoted teen pregnancy. Another cause for this controversy was that Midge did not initially have <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>ring,</b> but this was later fixed. She also was packaged without Alan. Customers complaining about the doll led to Wal-Mart pulling the Happy Family line off their shelves. [...] A new version of this Midge was produced for Wal-Mart, this time not pregnant and with a cardboard cut-out display of Alan and Ryan standing next to her inside the box. The Happy Family Line included everything from a talking house, a backyard swimming pool, neighborhood market, and playground.|$|E

During the filming of [...] "Unusual Suspects"—an episode that would largely feature Byers feeling a romantic connection to Susanne—Harwood removed his wedding ring, deducing that in 1989, when the episode took place, Byers had not been married yet. However, [...] "Three of a Kind"—which takes place in 1999—features Byers once again romantically drawn to Susanne. Harwood explained, [...] "And then [...] brought back the character Suzanne [...] Modeski back in season six, and {{that was supposed to be}} in the present. So I had to redo my back story; I said Byers had been divorced".|$|E
