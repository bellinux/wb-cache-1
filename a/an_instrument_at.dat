As Love later reflected, [...] "The {{best thing that ever}} {{happened}} to me in a way, was Kat." [...] Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they recruited bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Janis Tanaka. According to Bjelland, [...] " [...] didn't play <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>at</b> the time" [...] aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her. The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track demo before disbanding in late 1985. After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group Babes in Toyland, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.|$|E

2500|$|Lynott {{then left}} the family home and moved into a flat in Clontarf, where he briefly joined 'Kama Sutra'. It was in this band that he learned his {{frontman}} skills, and worked out how to interact with an audience. In early 1968, he teamed up with bassist Brendan 'Brush' Shiels to form Skid Row. Shiels also wanted Brian Downey to play drums in the band, but Downey wasn't interested in the band's style, so the job went to Noel Bridgeman instead. The band signed a deal with Ted Carroll, who would later go on to manage Thin Lizzy, and played a variety of covers including [...] "Eight Miles High", [...] "Hey Jude" [...] and several numbers by Jimi Hendrix. Because Lynott did not play <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>at</b> {{this point in his}} career, he instead manipulated his voice through an echo box during instrumental sections. He also took to smearing boot polish under his eyes on stage, which he would continue to do throughout Lizzy's career later on, and regularly performed a mock fight with Shiels onstage to attract the crowd. In mid 1968, guitarist Bernard Cheevers quit to work full-time at the Guinness factory in Dublin, and was replaced by Belfast-born guitarist Gary Moore.|$|E
60|$|Caius Gracchus, it is said, when he harangued the Roman populace, {{modulated}} {{his tone}} by an oratorical flute or pitch pipe. Wilhelmus Kieft, not having such <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>at</b> hand, availed himself of that musical organ or trump which nature has {{implanted in the}} midst of a man's face; in other words, he preluded his address by a sonorous blast of the nose; a preliminary flourish much in vogue among public orators.|$|E

6000|$|The {{literary}} {{situation which}} confronted me when I came to Boston was, then, as native as could well be; and whatever value I {{may be able}} to give a personal study of it will be from the effect it made upon me as one strange in everything but sympathy. I will not pretend that I saw it in its entirety, and I have no hope of presenting anything like a kinetoscopic impression of it. What I can do is to give here and there a glimpse of it; and I shall wish the reader to keep in mind {{the fact that it was}} in a [...] "state of transition," [...] as everything is always and everywhere. It was no sooner recognizably native than it ceased to be fully so; and I became a witness of it after the change had begun. The publishing house which so long embodied New England literature was already attempting enterprises out of the line of its traditions, and one of these had brought Mr. T. B. Aldrich from New York, a few weeks before I arrived upon the scene in that dramatic quality which I think never impressed any one but Mr. Bowles. Mr. Aldrich was the editor of 'Every Saturday' when I came to be assistant editor of the Atlantic Monthly. We were of nearly the same age, but he had a distinct and distinguished priority of reputation, insomuch that in my Western remoteness I had always ranged him with such elders and betters of mine as Holmes and Lowell, and never imagined him the blond, slight youth I found him, with every imaginable charm of contemporaneity. It is no part of the office which I have intended for these slight and sufficiently wandering glimpses of the past to show any writer in his final place; and above all I do not presume to assign any living man his rank or station. But I should be false to my own grateful sense of beauty in the work of this poet if I did not at all times recognize his constancy to an ideal which his name stands for. He is known in several kinds, but to my thinking he is best in a certain nobler kind of poetry; a serious sort in which the thought holds him above the scrupulosities of the art he loves and honors so much. Sometimes the file slips in his hold, as the file must and will; it is but <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>at</b> the best; but there is no mistouch in the hand that lays itself upon the reader's heart with the pulse of the poet's heart quick and true in it. There are sonnets of his, grave, and simple, and lofty, which I think of with the glow and thrill possible only from very beautiful poetry, and which impart such an emotion as we can feel only ...|$|E

25|$|Lamp power also {{influences}} colour in tungsten lamps. As {{the lamp}} power is decreased, the tungsten filament in a bulb {{will tend to}} produce increasing percentages of orange light, {{as compared to the}} nearly white light emitted at full power. This is known as amber drift or amber shift. Thus <b>a</b> 1000-watt <b>instrument</b> <b>at</b> 50 percent power will emit a higher percentage of orange light than <b>a</b> 500-watt <b>instrument</b> operating <b>at</b> full power.|$|R
