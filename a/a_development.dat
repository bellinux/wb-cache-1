40|$|Early in {{postnatal}} development, glutamatergic synapses transmit {{primarily through}} NMDA receptors. <b>As</b> <b>development</b> progresses, synapses acquire AMPA receptor function. The molecular {{basis of these}} physiological observations is not known. Here we examined single excitatory synapses with immunogold electron-microscopic analysis of AMPA and NMDA receptors along with electrophysiological measurements. Early in postnatal <b>development,</b> <b>a</b> significant fraction of excitatory synapses had NMDA receptors and lacked AMPA receptors. <b>As</b> <b>development</b> progressed, synapses acquired AMPA receptors with little change in NMDA receptor number. Thus, synapses with NMDA receptors but no AMPA receptors can account for the electrophysiologically observed 'silent synapse'...|$|R
