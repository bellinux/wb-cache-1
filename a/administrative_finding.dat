40|$|Home {{care for}} the elderly and {{disabled}} is a rapidly expanding industry in which structural and regulatory factors contribute to worker vulnerability and exploitation. Systemic exclusion from core federal employment and labor laws, as well as many state and local regulations, results in minimal consequences for employers who violate standards. Despite recent movement at the federal level to create a “new mindset” of rights and regulations, home care workers must be equipped with creative ways to enforce these new rights and to challenge existing gaps in enforcement. With the understanding that two-thirds of the home care industry is financed by tax dollars, primarily through Medicare and Medicaid, this article advances three innovative legal bases for deterring wage theft and recovering unpaid wages. First, the article considers whether wage theft by a Medicare or Medicaid participating employer may trigger liability under the qui tam provision of the False Claims Act. Second, the article considers whether the receipt of these tax dollars imposes fiduciary duties on employers and whether this “employer-as-fiduciary” theory gives rise to viable claims by workers (and consumers and taxpayers) when employers illegally underpay or misclassify their employees. Lastly, this article suggests leveraging the authority of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General to exclude home care employers from participation in federal health care programs upon an <b>administrative</b> <b>finding</b> of wage theft. Recasting wage theft in the home care industry as a “public larceny” could have ramifications that extend well beyond the immediate loss of wages. When wage theft goes unchecked, ethical employers who comply with legal standards are forced to compete with unscrupulous competitors whose law breaking affords them an economic advantage. The ability of the home care industry to meet the growing demands of our aging population depends on a system of enforcement that helps reduce staffing turnover and ensure a high quality of care. Given the persistent limitations of federal and state law in combating wage theft, the three strategies proposed in this article have the potential to break new ground in enforcing standards and improving working conditions in this critically important and expanding industry...|$|E
40|$|A {{decision}} {{to terminate the}} employment of a public school teacher will usually be made only after the teacher has had {{an opportunity for a}} hearing. If there is a hearing, and if the law requires evidentiary support for a termination, then such a decision must be based solely upon the evidence adduced at the hearing. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to research the law of evidence for teacher employment termination hearings. The major questions considered were: (1) What are the standards for the admission of evidence? (2) What evidence may be used to support a finding?^ Related literature from educational management, administrative law, and evidence law was reviewed. The research consisted primarily of an analysis of the judicial decisions and state statutes which relate specifically to public school teacher termination procedures. ^ It is fundamental evidence law that facts having rational probative value are to be admitted unless some specific rule forbids. Three categories of rules of evidence have evolved [...] rules of relevancy, which define probative value; rules of exclusion, which protect probative value; and rules of privilege, which invoke extrinsic policies that override probative value. ^ The formal rules of evidence used in judicial trials are not generally applied at teacher termination hearings. Instead, the more informal evidentiary procedures common to administrative agency proceedings are usually followed. Generally, when evidence is offered and objected to, the rules of relevancy are applied and the rules of privilege are recognized, but the rules of exclusion are not enforced. However, if a court examines the hearing record to determine whether there is an adequate evidentiary basis for the decision, the legal residuum rule might then be applied. That rule requires that an <b>administrative</b> <b>finding</b> must be based at least in part on evidence that would be admissible under the formal rules. ^ The standard of relevancy is generally established by the notice to the teacher. Only evidence relevant to the charges in the notice should be admitted and used in support of a termination decision. The rules of exclusion are generally not enforced when evidence is introduced. However, these rules may be applied if a court examines the record to determine whether there is some legally admissible evidence to support the findings. The rule against hearsay is perhaps the most frequently invoked exclusionary rule. Rules of privilege are seldom an issue at these hearings. However, it seems that both the constitutional and common law privileges are generally recognized. ^ The determination must be fairly based on the hearing proceedings. The teacher may introduce evidence showing that the tribunal is too biased to render an objective decision or that some unstated, impermissible reason may be the real basis for the termination. ^ The burden of proof at the hearing, and therefore the evidentiary considerations, may vary depending upon the legal rights of the teacher. The school officials may be required to prove cause for termination; in other instances, the teacher is simply provided a forum. ^ Perhaps one of the most effective means to insure that a decision has been made within the bounds of the law is to require that a termination be explained by written findings and reasons. However, such a requirement has not been consistently enforced. ^ The Nebraska law regarding the major evidentiary questions considered has not been clearly established. Although a degree of procedural informality seems to be permissible, any decision should be solidly based on evidence admissible under the formal rules. ^ The hearing procedures should promote a thorough consideration of the issues and the evidence. The objective should be a meaningful process leading to a just and rational decision. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{preliminary}} findings of an indepth case study of {{the implementation of a}} computerized order entry (COE) system at a medium-sized, acute care hospital. In this paper, we propose a theoreticallygrounded framework, based on work by Barley [8] [9], for analyzing organizational changes that may result from COE introduction and use the framework to analyze findings at the research site. The hospital studied was largely successful in implementing and utilizing the system. However, use of the COE has altered the content and structure of order-related information that passes between key participants in clinical care, affecting how these occupational groups and departments communicate and interact by creating ambiguity and uncertainty about order information. Use of the system may also be enabling increased organizational control over clinical care practices, exercised through professional norms and the clinical <b>administrative</b> hierarchy. <b>Findings</b> were consistent with other studies of COE use, suggesting that future research could focus on the consequences of structuring the content of order-related communications on interactions between clinical and ancillary departments and the need to integrate the COE with other clinical systems to minimize disruptions...|$|R
