Most of these adverse effects are transient <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> with continued treatment. Central and peripheral 5-HT3 receptor stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, {{a higher incidence of}} anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain.|$|E
25|$|The {{three are}} found by Mamana gangster who tricks and then trains street {{children}} into becoming beggars. When Salim discovers Maman is blinding {{the children in}} order to make them more effective beggars, he flees with Jamal and Latika to a departing train. Latika fails to board the train as Salim purposefully lets go of her hand, in revenge for an extremely embarrassing prank that Latika had played on Salim. This resulted in her being recaptured by Maman. Over the next few years, Salim and Jamal make a living travelling on top of trains, selling goods, picking pockets, working as dish washers, and pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, where they also steal people's shoes. At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, discovering that she is being raised by Maman to be a prostitute, to fetch him soon a high price and as a virgin. The brothers rescue her, and while escaping Maman they shoot him to death. Salim then manages to get a job with JavedMaman's rival crime lord. Back at their room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, whereas Latika persuades Jamal to obey his brother <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
500|$|Malawi's economy while Banda was {{president}} was {{often cited as}} an example of how a poor, landlocked, heavily populated, mineral-poor country could achieve progress in both agriculture and industrial development. While in office, and using his control of the country, Banda constructed a business empire that eventually produced one-third of the country's GDP and employed 10% of the wage-earning workforce. All money earned by Banda was ploughed back into developing Malawi and was symbolised by the building of a top boarding school called Kamuzu Academy (Eton of Africa). In Banda's own words [...] "I do not want my boys and girls to do what I had to do — to leave their homes and their families <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> from Malawi to get an education", was the reason for gifting this school to Malawi.|$|E

500|$|Hunter and Morse {{are written}} off the {{series in the}} episode [...] "Parting Shot", both leaving S.H.I.E.L.D., as Palicki and Blood [...] "physically had to go leave to shoot the pilot ... they had to stop being on S.H.I.E.L.D. {{and get ready for}} the pilot and then shoot the pilot and all of that, so it didn't make sense for us to have all these episodes with them and then not have them in two or three episodes, and then go, [...] "Oh, we were just over here," [...] and then come back <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> again." [...] On whether they could return to the series at some point, Bell said, [...] "I can't answer that, but I can say it would be kind of {{cheating}} to make Mack cry like that only to buy it back—not that we haven't brought characters back from the dead.

2500|$|References in the Bible {{point to}} an {{awareness}} of human sacrifice {{in the history of}} ancient near-eastern practice. During a battle with the Israelites the King of Moab gives his firstborn son and heir as a whole burnt offering (olah, as used of the Temple sacrifice) (2 Kings 3:27) The Bible then recounts that following the King's sacrifice [...] "There was great indignation [...] against Israel", and that the Israelites had to raise their siege of the Moabite capital <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> This verse had perplexed many later Jewish and Christian commentators who tried to explain why should the Moabite King's sacrifice make God angry at the Israelites. Whatever the explanation, evidently at the time of writing such an act of sacrificing the firstborn son and heir was considered as an emergency measure, to be performed in exceptional cases where Divine favor is desperately needed - and that in such cases it might be effective.|$|E

Each man wore a long white robe and his face was covered by a loose mask with scarlet stripes. She was ordered to get up and dress which she did at once and then admitted to her room the captain and lieutenant who in addition to the usual disguise had long horns on their heads and a sort of device in front. The lieutenant had a pistol in his hand and he and the captain sat down while eight or ten men stood inside the door and the porch was full. They treated her [...] "gentlemanly and quietly" [...] but complained of the heavy school-tax, said she must stop teaching <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> and warned her that they never gave a second notice.
