5|$|Black Sabbath {{was made}} {{at the end of}} {{production}} of The Girl Who Knew Too Much during an eight-week period between February and March 1963. <b>American</b> <b>International</b> Production's involvement with the film allowed Salvatore Billitteri of the Titra Sound Corporation to be on set to supervise the film for dubbing on its English-language release. As the film was going to be dubbed in different languages, actors could no longer phonetically pronounce their dialogue as {{it had to be done}} rhythmically to match various languages. Billitteri was also on set to give suggestions to Bava on how to make his film more appropriate for American audiences which led to decreasing the amount of violence in the film. The film was first conceived under the title The Fear.|$|E
5|$|Corman had initial {{trouble finding}} {{distribution}} for the film, as some distributors, including <b>American</b> <b>International</b> Pictures (AIP), felt that the film would be interpreted as anti-Semitic, citing the characters of Gravis Mushnick and Siddie Shiva. Welles, who is Jewish, stated that he gave his character a Turkish Jewish accent and mannerisms, and that he saw the humor of the film as playful, and felt there was no intent to defame any ethnic group. The film was finally released by its production company, The Filmgroup, nine months after it had been completed.|$|E
5|$|Daiei also {{hoped to}} find a foreign market for Warning from Space, though the company found {{difficulty}} in selling it. Nevertheless, the film played at both King Cinema in Rangoon, Burma and Tai Khoon Theatre in Sandakan, Malaysia, in 1958. The film did help Daiei achieve some success in the genre. It was passed for release, anglicized as Warning from Space, by the BBFC in the United Kingdom in 1957, {{and later in the}} United States in 1963. The film was also released as The Mysterious Satellite in some areas. It was shown in the U.S. by <b>American</b> <b>International</b> Television later in the 1960s as Warning From Space.|$|E

5|$|Gravel then boarded at Assumption Preparatory School in Worcester, Massachusetts, {{where his}} {{performance}} was initially mediocre. Then an English teacher, the Assumptionist Edgar Bourque, gave him personal attention, improving Gravel's language skills and instructing him in public speaking. Gravel's grades improved measurably {{in his final}} year, and he graduated in 1949. He has a sister, Marguerite, who became a Holy Cross nun, but Gravel himself struggled with the Catholic faith. He studied for one year at Assumption College, a Catholic school in Worcester, then transferred for his sophomore year to <b>American</b> <b>International</b> College in Springfield. Journalist I. F. Stone and philosopher Bertrand Russell strongly influenced Gravel in their willingness to challenge assumptions and oppose social convention and political authority.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, <b>American</b> <b>International</b> Pictures founders James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff hired European talent agent Flavio Lucisano to {{look for}} Italian {{commercial}} films for them after the large success of the Italian feature Hercules (1958). In February 1963, <b>American</b> <b>International</b> Pictures {{made a deal with}} the Italian film production company Galatea that they would contribute to a minimum of nine co-productions in the next eight years. Black Sabbath follows many production trends of Italian films of the era. These co-productions were influenced by the lack of large film stars in Italy. To avoid high costs or larger stars, producers created anthology films involving three or four short narratives whose combined running time was that of a regular feature film, as in Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (1963). A second trend was to match an up-and-coming actor or a much older actor with a European ingenue actress, as in Spy in Your Eye which paired Pier Angeli and Dana Andrews. The third trend was the move towards making Westerns and horror films which were less expensive to produce than the previous sword and sandal films.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Lexus began {{sales of}} the GS 450h, a V6 hybrid {{performance}} sedan, and launched the fourth generation LS line, comprising both standard- and long-wheelbase V8 (LS 460 and LS 460 L) and hybrid (LS 600h and LS 600h L) versions. The fifth generation ES 350 also debuted in the same year. The LS 600h L subsequently went on sale as the most expensive sedan ever produced in Japan. By the end of 2006, Lexus' annual sales had reached 475,000 vehicles worldwide. In January 2007, Lexus announced a new F marque performance division, which would produce racing-inspired versions of its performance models.

5|$|Lucas and {{producer}} Gary Kurtz took the script to <b>American</b> <b>International</b> Pictures, who expressed interest, but ultimately believed American Graffiti was not violent or sexual {{enough for the}} studio's standards. Lucas and Kurtz eventually found favor at Universal Pictures, who allowed Lucas total artistic control {{and the right of}} final cut privilege on the condition that he make American Graffiti on a strict, low budget. This forced Lucas to drop the opening scene, in which the Blonde Angel, Curt's image of the perfect woman, drives through an empty drive-in cinema in her Ford Thunderbird, her transparency revealing she does not exist.|$|E
