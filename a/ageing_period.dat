Age is a life period we all want to await but on the other side we are a bit afraid of it.

But the question where to live in the <b>ageing</b> <b>period</b> or how to live is still unaswered.

The system displays a distinct two-phase mixture of the intermediate a' and ߠphases, whose phase proportions approach 40 and 50 wt. %, respectively {{at the end of the}} <b>ageing</b> <b>period.</b> The change in proportion of each intermediate phase and free fcc Ni suggests two periods of Ni depletion.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Meat {{quality is}} a complex trait {{influenced}} by a range of factors with post mortem biochemical processes highly influential in defining ultimate quality. High resolution two-dimensional DIfference Gel Electrophoresis (2 -D DIGE) and Western blot were applied to study the influence of post mortem meat ageing on the proteome of pork muscle. Exudate collected from the muscle following centrifugation was analysed at three timepoints representing a seven day meat <b>ageing</b> <b>period.</b> 				 				 					 						Results 					The intensity of 136 spots varied significantly (p&# 8201;<&# 8201; 0. 05) across this post mortem period and 40 spots were identified using mass spectrometry. The main functional categories represented were metabolic proteins, stress-related proteins, transport and structural proteins. Metabolic and structural proteins were generally observed to increase in abundance post mortem and many likely represent the accumulation of the degradation products of proteolytic enzyme activity. In contrast, stress-related proteins broadly decreased in abundance across the <b>ageing</b> <b>period.</b> Stress response proteins have protective roles in maintaining cellular integrity {{and a decline in}} their abundance over time may correlate with a reduction in cellular integrity and the onset of meat ageing. Since cellular conditions alter with muscle ageing, changes in solubility may also contribute to observed abundance profiles. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Muscle exudate provided valuable information about the pathways and processes underlying the post mortem <b>ageing</b> <b>period,</b> highlighting the importance of post mortem modification of proteins and their interaction for the development of meat quality traits...|$|E

A multi-echo sequence was used to obtain T 2 images, and independent of <b>ageing</b> <b>period,</b> the T 2 values {{were found to be}} lower in pressure-heat treated meat revealing alterations in water characteristics of pressure-treated, cooked meat compared with cooked meat. With increasing ageing duration, the T 2 values in both pressure-treated, cooked and cooked meat decreased indicating that the water became more tightly trapped in the protein network. In addition, independent of length of <b>ageing</b> <b>period</b> the relationship between cooking loss in the cooked meat and transverse relaxation differed between non-pressurised and pressure-treated meat. which reveals that the mechanisms changing the water properties in beef during ageing are different from those occuring during pressure-heat treatment of meat.

40|$|The {{effect of}} ageing on the small-strain shear {{stiffness}} of compacted silty-clayey sand following a ‘soft’ biological treatment is discussed. Samples were prepared by static compaction, adding urea-degrading bacteria to the compaction water. No nutrients were artificially added, {{relying on the}} natural availability of urea and calcium ions (Ca 2 +) in the humic soil and in the compaction water for the bacteria to precipitate calcium carbonate. After compaction, to replicate different environmental boundary conditions, some of the samples were cured in a system open to vapour transfer and some were cured in a closed system. The small-strain shear stiffness was periodically tracked with bender elements during the <b>ageing</b> <b>period.</b> Tests were run in parallel to investigate the unconfined compression strength, the water retention properties and soil pore size distribution changes during ageing. The test results revealed a small but consistent increase in the small-strain shear stiffness during the <b>ageing</b> <b>period</b> due to the microbiological treatment, in both the closed and open systems. In the latter case, {{the contribution of the}} microbiological treatment to the increase in stiffness could be estimated after correcting the data for the suction increase due to evaporation.

However, it is always associated with few setbacks like degradation of material properties during the shelf <b>ageing</b> <b>period.</b> In the present work, nanocomposites were prepared using ball milling process and then compression moulding process where UHMWPE was reinforced by MWCNTs with 0. 20 and 0. 40 wt. %. The samples were gamma irradiated using 60 Co at 25 and 50 kGy sterilizing doses in air without any post irradiative treatments and then shelf aged for 240 days. The mechanical properties of the composites were studied using small punch technique according to ASTM F 2183 standards. Both toughness and hardness of the composites {{were found to be}} improved with an increase of irradiation dosage and MWCNT concentration. It is observed that the percentage reduction in Young’s modulus, yield stress and % strain at fracture of 0. 4 % composite at 50 kGy dose are 6. 4 %, 8. 8 % and 12. 7 %, respectively compared to that of virgin UHMWPE irradiated at same dosage. It is concluded that presence of MWCNTs in UHMWPE prevents the degradation of material properties during the shelf <b>ageing</b> <b>period</b> after irradiation...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{analysis}} {{is an interesting}} technique to determine kinetic parameters of separate components, and also of a complete system to receive adequate information on the ageing process of pyrotechnic compositions. The investigated tracer is a tracking tracer of a Swiss missile. It {{is attached to a}} missile and produces during burning a red flame. The missile system is already in use for 15 years. Periodic inspections of the system take place every three years. These inspections, however only give information on the actual state of the tracer and not on the future state. The aim of this investigation is to predict the ageing behaviour of the tracer system to give additional information about the future use of the missile system. After two ageing profiles the tracer systems were tested on the test range at Armasuisse in Thun. The results of the testing show that an <b>ageing</b> <b>period</b> of 4 weeks at 60 °C gives no changes in performance (light output and burning time). On the other side also a quite heavy <b>ageing</b> <b>period</b> of 4 weeks at 150 °C was applied on tracer systems, which gives a dramatically change in burning time. The light output was even higher after this ageing profile, although the intensity changes a lot. © 2005 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest...|$|E
