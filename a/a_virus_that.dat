5|$|Baris stubbornly holds Kirk {{responsible}} for this apparent fiasco, and Koloth additionally demands an apology from Kirk after some of the Enterprise crew are provoked into a brawl with the Klingons in the station's bar. However, the tribbles reveal {{the identity of a}} Klingon agent masquerading as a human: Arne Darvin (Charlie Brill), Baris' own assistant. He had infected the grain with <b>a</b> <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> becomes an inert material in an organism's bloodstream which eventually prevents the organism from taking in enough nourishment to survive.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. The autopsy revealed that {{the damage to the}} bear’s brain was so severe that even if he had not fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from <b>a</b> <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> caused the encephalitis.|$|E
5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza <b>A</b> <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, a {{new species}} of virophage (<b>a</b> {{satellite}} <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> impairs the ability of its co-infective host virus to replicate) was discovered in Organic Lake, the Organic Lake virophage.

5|$|Murray {{opened the}} 2009 {{season with a}} {{successful}} defence of his title at the Qatar Open in Doha, defeating Andy Roddick in straight sets. At the Australian Open, Murray {{made it to the}} fourth round, losing to Fernando Verdasco. Murray won his eleventh career title in Rotterdam, defeating No. 1, Nadal in the three sets. Murray next went to Dubai but withdrew before the quarterfinals with a re-occurrence of <b>a</b> <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> had affected him at the Australian Open. The virus caused Murray to miss a Davis Cup tie in Glasgow. Murray then lost in the finals to Nadal at Indian Wells, but won a week later in Miami over Djokovic for another masters title.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} of the serial crime-thriller {{television}} series Millennium commenced airing in the United States on October 2, 1998, and concluded on May 21, 1999 after airing twenty-two episodes.

Black had previously worked for a private investigative organization, the Millennium Group, but left after the Group unleashed <b>a</b> <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> resulted in the death of Black's wife. Now working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation with agent Emma Hollis (Klea Scott), Black seeks to discredit and expose the Group for their sinister motives.|$|E
5|$|In 2259, Enterprise {{receives}} a distress {{call from a}} space station harvesting {{the power of a}} binary star. There is too much interference to beam the crew aboard, so Kirk and Spock (voiced by Zachary Quinto) take a shuttle to rescue the crew. They encounter T'Mar, a childhood friend of Spock, who explains they were gathering energy to power the Helios device, which would speed up the terraforming of New Vulcan; the team inadvertently opened a rip in the fabric of space. Beaming to New Vulcan, Kirk and Spock meet with T'Mar's father Surok, who explains the station's power from the base was lost after they were attacked by creatures—who call themselves the Gorn— from the rip. The Gorn infect some of the crew with <b>a</b> <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> makes them aggressive. Kirk and Spock enter the locked down sections of the base to recover the infected survivors, but are unable to stop the Gorn from stealing the Helios device and kidnapping Surok.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} the rise of polio in industrialised {{countries}} in the 20th century has never been fully explained. The disease is caused by <b>a</b> <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> is passed {{from person to person}} by the faecal-oral route, and naturally infects only humans. It is a paradox that it became a problem during times of improved sanitation and increasing affluence. Although the virus was discovered {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, its ubiquity was unrecognised until the 1950s. It is now known that fewer than two per cent of individuals who are infected develop the disease, and most infections are mild. During epidemics the virus was effectively everywhere, which explains why public health officials were unable to isolate a source.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{branching}} into different timelines {{that can be}} experienced in any order, depending on the choices made by the player. While completing {{the first set of}} puzzle rooms, the participants learn of a pandemic caused by Radical-6, <b>a</b> <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> slows down its victims' cognition and drives them to suicide. Depending on the given timeline, the characters also discover either the murdered body of an old woman or antimatter bombs. The other participants' backstories are explored: Luna is a humanoid robot, tasked with maintaining the Nonary Game; K was raised by Zero Sr. inside of the facility; Tenmyouji willingly joined the game, together with his adopted grandson Quark, after being promised a chance to find a certain woman; Alice and Clover are government secret agents tasked with stopping the religious cult Free the Soul; and Dio is a member of Free the Soul.|$|E

25|$|Injury to α-MNs is {{the most}} common type of lower motor neuron lesion. Damage may be caused by trauma, ischemia, and infection, among others. In addition, certain {{diseases}} are associated with the selective loss of α-MNs.

Simultaneously, a hidden virus loads a combat program into the production-line gynoids, causing them to attack everyone aboard.
