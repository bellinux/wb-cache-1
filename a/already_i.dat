The Emperor wrote to his brother-in-law Dom FernandoII, King-consort of Portugal: [...] "By the time you receive this, you will certainly have learnt of the grievous loss I have undergone... God who has made me pass though so hard a testing, will in his mercy give me grounds to console my sorrows." [...] PedroII had already lost another son, Dom Afonso, almost three years earlier. He revealed his inner turmoil in a sonnet: [...] "Twice <b>already</b> <b>I</b> have suffered death, for the father dies who sees his son is dead." [...] Except for brief inspection visits, the Emperor avoided Santa Cruz thereafter.|$|E
500|$|De Boer {{felt that}} the {{producers}} {{did a good job}} with involving Ezri {{over the course of the}} seventh season, but not to the extent that it detracted from the more established members of the main cast. However, there was one part of the season where she was concerned that the fans would suffer from [...] "Ezri overload". But she {{felt that the}} character had a real story arc and character evolution as the season went by. She said that she did not want Ezri to remain the same [...] "young and confused" [...] person that she was in her first appearances, which was something that the writers and producers agreed with. She said that [...] "As time went on, you saw that Ezri was intelligent, that she was endearing and a good person. She became a more complicated character than you might have thought in her first few episodes." [...] She praised specific episodes which evolved the character, such as [...] "The Siege of AR-558" [...] which required Ezri to draw upon Dax's past experiences, as otherwise she would have been completely out of her element. De Boer also enjoyed [...] "" [...] as the episode showed the change in Ezri from before she was joined with the Dax symbiont, and she thought that the events portrayed in [...] "" [...] were [...] "fascinating". As she approached the end of Deep Space Nine, de Boer addressed the rumors of her joining , saying that [...] "My first instinct would be to say no. I would need to feel there was a reason for Ezri to be on Voyager". She was interviewed at the series wrap party after completing filming on the final episode, [...] "What You Leave Behind", and said, [...] "The last episode was very emotional, especially on the last day... I couldn't believe that a season had gone by <b>already.</b> <b>I</b> realized all the people I'd grown close to must be feeling it much more because they'd been doing it 7 years. I cried." ...|$|E

I think we felt that the album was so long <b>already.</b> <b>I</b> don't know what the fate of that will be." [...] "Ship in the Bottle" [...] was released on the Japanese version of Sea Change and later remasters.|$|E

2500|$|The judge William Keogh, before passing {{sentence}} {{asked him}} if he had any further remarks to make in reference to his case.

I have endeavoured to serve Ireland, and now I am prepared to suffer for Ireland." [...] Then the judge with many expressions of sympathy for the prisoner, and many compliments in reference to his intellectual attainments, sentenced him to be kept in penal servitude for fourteen years.|$|E

2500|$|The {{best and}} current {{estimate}} of active homosexuals in Florida is 60,000 individuals. [...] The plain {{fact of the}} matter is that a great many homosexuals have an insatiable appetite for sexual activities and find special gratification in the recruitment to their ranks of youth. [...] The homosexual's goal is to [...] "bring over" [...] the young person, to hook him for homosexuality. A veteran investigator of homosexual activities… said, [...] "We must do everything in our power to create one thing in the minds of every homosexual and that is to keep their hands off our children. [...] …if we don't act soon we will wake up some morning and find they are too big to fight. They may be <b>already.</b> <b>I</b> hope not." [...] We hope that many citizen organizations in Florida will use this report… to prepare their children to meet the temptations of homosexuality lurking today in the vicinity of nearly every institution of learning." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taylor is a {{globally}} renowned {{psychiatrist and}} {{works at the}} UCLA Medical Center. When she debuted, the character emerged as the [...] "good girl" [...] alongside other female characters, but still had a strong demeanor. Network Ten writes: [...] "This Freudian Doc always seems to lose out to Brooke {{when it comes to}} matters of the heart. Taylor is as sophisticated and intelligent as they come, always able to analyze the problems of others, and sometimes even her own." [...] The writers wanted Taylor to retain a [...] "pristine" [...] and [...] "well-mannered" [...] personality, according to Tylo, to contrast her from rival Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) who was [...] "feisty and reckless", the different facets which attracted Ridge to each of them. Tylo criticized a storyline in 2000 where Ridge is tricked into sleeping with his mentally unstable high school lover Morgan DeWitt (Sarah G. Buxton), who becomes pregnant with his child. She said: [...] "I just wish that Taylor would get a clue, period! I wish that her psychiatric expertise would kick in <b>already.</b> <b>I</b> mean, she's retarded!", also observing that the character can be absentminded.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} {{as early as}} November 2009 that the band were aiming {{to take a new}} direction with the third album, with Cronise explaining that [...] "coming up with eight or nine or 10 different themes [...] every couple years, well, it's a little daunting some times, especially for me personally" [...] and noting that [...] "Given the types of themes we'd covered <b>already,</b> <b>I</b> didn't really want to revisit the same stuff again on another record and talk about the same things and doom and gloom and sorcerers and ravens and things. So, we just kind of wanted to change it up and do something a little different." [...] Further elaboration was also given on the 'science fiction concept album' idea, with Cronise explaining that [...] "It's psychedelic, in a way. It's not like Star Wars science fiction ... laser guns and action all the time. It's more cerebral in that it's still mythological in the way it's told. It's science fiction and there's spaceships and robots, but it doesn't take place in the future. It's just like another planet far away sort of thing. Otherworldly. And of course, it will have universal-type themes in it. I wanted to create a completely original kind of setting to have the songs take place in." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Cao Cao, a warlord {{who rose}} to {{prominence}} in {{the final years of}} the Han dynasty and became the de facto head of the Han central government, was still relatively unknown to others, he once visited Qiao Xuan. Qiao Xuan was surprised to see Cao Cao and he told him, [...] "The world is about to enter a state of chaos. You're the person who will restore peace and order!" [...] At the time, Qiao Xuan and He Yong were the only two persons who felt that Cao Cao was extraordinary. Cao Cao later often said that Qiao Xuan was someone who really understood him. The Wei Shu (魏書) recorded that Qiao Xuan told Cao Cao, [...] "I've seen many famous persons but I've never seen someone like you before! You should work hard. I'm old <b>already!</b> <b>I</b> {{hope to be able to}} entrust my family to you." [...] Cao Cao's fame increased after his meeting with Qiao Xuan. The Shishuo Xinyu recorded that when Qiao Xuan met Cao Cao, who was still a youth then, he told him, [...] "The world is in chaos and warlords are fighting for supremacy. Aren't you the person who will eliminate all of them and restore order? You're actually a hero in chaotic times but a villain in times of peace. It's a pity that I'm old already because I won't be able to see you become wealthy and powerful. I entrust my descendants to you." [...] Qiao Xuan also recommended Cao Cao to see Xu Shao, a well-known commentator and character evaluator.|$|E
