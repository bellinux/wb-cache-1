2500|$|Until the {{military}} assumed control of relief efforts in September 1943, government aid seldom provided much {{help to the}} rural poor, directing most of its cash and grain supplies instead to the relatively wealthy landowners and urban bhadraloks. After an initial spate of humanitarian aid for the cyclone-stricken areas around Midnapore in October 1942, the government response was slow, and relief efforts were very limited until April 1943. The response was slowed both by a failure to grasp the nature {{and scope of the}} problem and by political factors brought on by a public propaganda campaign declaring [...] "sufficiency" [...] in Bengal's rice supply, denying that there had been any significant crop shortfall, and blaming rising prices on war profiteering and hoarding. In April, more cash and grain began to flow to the outlying areas, but relief efforts were misdirected. Famine relief came in three major forms: <b>agricultural</b> <b>loans</b> (for the purchase of paddy seed, plough cattle, and maintenance expenses), gratuitous relief, and test works. [...] <b>Agricultural</b> <b>loans</b> offered no assistance to the large numbers of rural poor who had little or no land. Grain relief was divided between cheap grain shops and the open market, with far more going to the markets. Supplying grain to the markets was intended to lower grain prices, but did not accomplish that aim, instead putting rural poor in direct competition with wealthier Bengalis at greatly inflated prices. As the depth and scope of the famine became unmistakable, the government began setting up gruel kitchens in August 1943; the gruel, which often provided barely a survival-level caloric intake, was sometimes unfit for consumptionmoldy or contaminated with dirt, sand, and gravel.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} {{was slow to}} supply humanitarian aid, at first using propaganda to discourage hoarding. It attempted to drive rice paddy prices down through price controls {{and a series of}} procurement schemes. Price controls merely created a thriving black market and encouraged cautious sellers to withhold their stocks; moreover, prices soared when the controls were abandoned. Relief efforts in the form of gruel kitchens, <b>agricultural</b> <b>loans</b> and test works were both insufficient and ineffective through the worst months of the food crisis phase. Despite having a long-established and detailed Famine Code that would have triggered a sizable increase in aid, the provincial government never formally declared a state of famine. Relief efforts increased significantly when the military took control of crisis relief in October 1943, and more effective aid arrived after a record rice harvest that December. Deaths from starvation began to decline, but [...] "very substantially more than half" [...] of the famine-related fatalities were caused by disease in 1944, after the food security crisis had subsided.|$|E

The regression results bode well for agricultural lending if acquiring banks have larger concentrations of assets in agriculture than acquired banks. Conversely, if acquiring banks have smaller concentrations than acquired banks, acquisitions have a negative impact on agricultural lending.

This study reveals that formal sector has flourished in recent years in disbursing agricultural credit where previously informal sector dominated the rural credit market for agriculture. NGOs have a stronger network throughout the country and many local private commercial banks and foreign banks use these channel to provide agricultural credit.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsBrian C. BriggemanAs {{the recent}} {{financial}} crisis brought to light, {{the ability of}} commercial banks to quantify and better manage risk in their loan portfolios is paramount to their continued success and viability.

Pinnacle Bancorp is a community banking organization headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska with roughly $ 8. 6 billion in assets. The company {{is also one of the}} largest agricultural lenders in the country and the largest agricultural lender among traditional community banks. Given the ominous outlook heading into 2016 for agricultural producers from lower projected net incomes and increased borrowing costs following Federal Reserve action on the Fed Funds Rate, many banks worry about the increased likelihood of default for agricultural producers. The objective of this thesis is to determine the adequacy of Pinnacle Bank’s equity capital relative to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>loan</b> portfolio. This process begins by employing binary logit regression in an effort to determine the probability of default for the bank’s <b>agricultural</b> <b>loan</b> portfolio. With default likelihood quantified, efforts are then made to determine the bank’s credit value-at-risk at various solvency levels. These figures are then compared to current capital levels in order to determine the adequacy of bank capital as measured by five key regulatory ratios ultimately imposed by Basel III. Finally, recommendations are made to management as to the adequacy of bank capital relative to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>loan</b> portfolio and any future efforts that need to be made in order to determine and ensure the adequacy of bank capital for the entire loan portfolio...|$|R
