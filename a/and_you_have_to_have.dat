500|$|The {{sessions}} were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered chronic back pain. [...] "When your back is killing you <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> surgery {{and all this}} stuff, it's just {{kind of hard to}} keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't know {{if it was going to}} be on a label or if we were going to put it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time.

We went far down the garden to the farthest end, where the children and the nurse and the puppy and I used to play in the summer in the shade of a great elm, and there the footman dug a hole, and I saw he was going to plant the puppy, and I was glad, because it would grow and come up a fine handsome dog, like Robin Adair, and be a beautiful surprise for the family when they came home; so I tried to help him dig, but my lame leg was no good, being stiff, you know, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> two, or it is no use.

5000|$|In 2009, Dunaway began {{shooting}} a {{film version of}} the McNally play Master Class, starring herself as Maria Callas, Al Pacino (as Aristotle Onassis), Val Kilmer, Alan Cumming, her son Liam Dunaway O'Neill and lyric soprano Danielle de Niese (the latter two as opera students). As film roles became more difficult to find, Dunaway bought {{the rights to the}} play after the 1997 tour and announced her intention of writing, directing and starring in the film. The production however was a disaster and financing the project {{has been one of the}} many obstacles. [...] "I want to do it my way. I'm not going to sell it out to a studio. You have to raise money. You have to get private investors and it takes a long time to get it right. It takes 10 years. People hear Faye Dunaway and think she has a lot of money, but I don't because I've spent a lot. Not tonnes. I spent what I want to spend on this movie <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> skin in this game. You have to take risks." [...] In 2013, she confirmed that she had completed the first half of the film and planned to shoot the rest soon after. However, it was announced in June 2014 that after nearly 20 years of owning the film rights, Dunaway had decided to withdraw from the project.|$|E
5000|$|San Andreas {{opened in}} North America across 3,777 theaters {{including}} {{a total of}} 3,200 3D locations. Several days prior to the film's release various box office pundits were predicting a $40 million or more opening in North America. It made $3.1 million from Thursday night showings and $18.2 million on its opening day. It earned $54.5 million in its opening weekend which was well above the tracking and predictions. It was Johnson's biggest opening as a lead actor, surpassing the $36 million debut of his The Scorpion King in 2002 even after adjusting for inflation. Warner Bros. distribution chief Dan Fellman commented about the successful opening, saying that audiences never get tired of disaster films, even going back to The Poseidon Adventure (1972). He added, [...] "What also gets tiring is {{when you start to}} do sequels of the same thing. It needs to be fresh, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the right chemistry in the cast", pointing out the originality of the film, and the performances of Johnson and the other cast, as some of the factors behind the film's successful opening. In its second weekend, it fell gradually by 52% earning an estimated $26.4 million, falling in second place (behind Spy) as a result of major competition with newly released films. However, the fall was less than that of other disaster movies.|$|E
