50|$|User Account Control {{is a new}} {{infrastructure}} that requires user consent before allowing any action that requires administrative privileges. With this feature, all users, including users with administrative privileges, run in a standard user mode by default, since most applications do not require higher privileges. When some action is attempted that needs administrative privileges, such as installing new software or changing system settings, Windows will prompt the user whether to allow the action or not. If the user chooses to allow, the process initiating the action is elevated to a higher privilege context to continue. While standard users need to enter a username and password of an <b>administrative</b> <b>account</b> to get a process elevated (Over-the-shoulder Credentials), an administrator can choose to be prompted just for consent or ask for credentials.|$|E

40|$|The {{target of}} this master's thesis were the known methods for testing {{the quality of}} {{transfer}} parameters of data networks. I have studied the RFC 2544 document to analyze these tests. From that information and by studying other existing web-based applications I was able to design a concept of my own application that will allow to measure basic quality parameters of transfers made through the Internet (the parameters: downstream, upstream, latency, variance of these and a traced route). My application doesn't require any modifications on the user's system. It's built on the server-based programming language PHP and uses the relational database engine MySQL to store measurement and user data. On the client side, it's assisted by the JavaScript scripting language. Both registered users and visitors are allowed to perform the listed measurements. Registered users are able to browse {{the history of their}} own benchmark results and also to send messages to others. There is an <b>administrative</b> <b>account</b> to oversee the operations.
