5|$|This {{species has}} been {{reported}} to grow solitary or in groups on sandy soil or rich composted soil in both mixed and coniferous forests, often beneath cedars. In Hawaii, it is usually found growing in duff under coastal Casuarina and groves of Cupressus. The species has been noted to occur in late summer and autumn (in Britain and Europe), but the fruit bodies may dry <b>and</b> <b>persist</b> for some time.|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe Park is {{important}} for its lichen flora. Records suggest this site has been wood pasture or parkland for at least 400 years. There are some very old oak pollards which may be of this age or older. The oldest standard trees are over 200 years of age. The continuity of open woodland and parkland, with large mature and over-mature timber, has enabled characteristic species of epiphytic lichens and beetles to become established <b>and</b> <b>persist.</b> Many of the species in the park are now nationally scarce because this type of habitat has been eliminated over large areas of Great Britain. The park was notified as an SSSI in 1990.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, a large {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa. A tropical system along the wave axis contained a low pressure area as well as an impressive outflow pattern, though initially its convection was disorganized and limited. By September 1 a cyclonic circulation with a diameter of 690miles (1115km) was evident on satellite imagery, well to the southeast of the Cape Verde Islands. Several hurricane forecast models anticipated development and strengthening. As it tracked quickly westward, the convection organized and developed into rainbands– bands of showers and thunderstorms that spiral cyclonically toward the storm center– and late on September 1 meteorologists began tracking the system using the Dvorak technique. Low amounts of wind shear and favorable outflow allowed vigorous deep convection to develop <b>and</b> <b>persist</b> near the center, and by 1800UTC on September 2 the system developed into Tropical Depression Nine about 450miles (730km) southwest of Praia, Cape Verde.|$|E

25|$|JE virus IgM {{antibodies}} {{are usually}} detectable 3 to 8 days after onset of illness <b>and</b> <b>persist</b> for 30 to 90 days, but longer persistence has been documented. Therefore, positive IgM antibodies occasionally {{may reflect a}} past infection or vaccination. Serum collected within 10 days of illness onset may not have detectable IgM, and the test should be repeated on a convalescent sample. For patients with JE virus IgM antibodies, confirmatory neutralizing antibody testing should be performed.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines cause a {{decrease}} in norepinephrine (noradrenaline), serotonin, acetylcholine, and dopamine. These neurotransmitters are needed for normal memory, mood, muscle tone and coordination, emotional responses, endocrine gland secretions, heart rate, and blood pressure control. With chronic benzodiazepine use, tolerance develops rapidly to most of its effects, so that, when benzodiazepines are withdrawn, various neurotransmitter systems go into overdrive {{due to the lack}} of inhibitory GABA-ergic activity. Withdrawal symptoms then emerge as a result, <b>and</b> <b>persist</b> until the nervous system physically reverses the adaptions (physical dependence) that have occurred in the CNS.|$|E
25|$|In {{breast cancer}} CD44+CD24−/low cells are {{detectable}} in metastatic pleural effusions. By contrast, an {{increased number of}} CD24+ cells {{have been identified in}} distant metastases in breast cancer patients. It is possible that CD44+CD24−/low cells initially metastasize and in the new site change their phenotype and undergo limited differentiation. The two-phase expression pattern hypothesis proposes two forms of cancer stem cells - stationary (SCS) and mobile (MCS). SCS are embedded in tissue <b>and</b> <b>persist</b> in differentiated areas throughout tumor progression. MCS are located at the tumor-host interface. These cells are apparently derived from SCS through the acquisition of transient EMT (Figure 7).|$|E

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) monitors the area from North America westward to 140°W, while the Central Pacific Hurricane Center is from 140°W to the International date line, north of the equator. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) currently defines the season as starting May15 in the eastern Pacific and June1 for the central Pacific and ending on November30 for both regions in each calendar year.

25|$|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) {{is a small}} virus which infects {{humans and}} some other primate species. AAV is not {{currently}} known to cause disease. The virus causes a very mild immune response, lending further support to its apparent lack of pathogenicity. Gene therapy vectors using AAV can infect both dividing and quiescent cells <b>and</b> <b>persist</b> in an extrachromosomal state without integrating into the genome of the host cell, although in the native virus some integration of virally carried genes into the host genome does occur. These features make AAV a very attractive candidate for creating viral vectors for gene therapy, and {{for the creation of}} isogenic human disease models. Recent human clinical trials using AAV for gene therapy in the retina have shown promise.|$|E
25|$|In an ontogenetic {{histological}} {{analysis of}} Stegosaurus plates and spikes, Hayashi et al. (2012) examined their {{structure and function}} through juveniles to old adults. They found that throughout the ontogeny, the dorsal osteoderms are composed of dense ossified collagen fibres in both the cortical and cancellous sections of the bone, suggesting that plates and spikes are formed from the direct mineralization of already existing fibrous networks in the skin. However, the many structural features, seen in the spikes and plates of old adults specimens, are acquired {{at different stages of}} development. Extensive vascular networks form in the plates during the change from juveniles to young adults <b>and</b> <b>persist</b> in old adults but spikes acquire a thick cortex with a large axial vascular channel only in old adults. Hayashi et al. argue that the formation of nourishing vascular networks in young adults supported the growth of large plates. This would have enhanced the size of the animal, which may have helped attract mates and deter rivals. Furthermore, the presence of the vascular networks in the plates of the young adult indicate a secondary use of the plates as a thermoregulatory device for heat loss much like the elephant ear, toucan bill or alligator osteoderms. The thickening of the cortical section of the bone and the compaction of bone in the terminal tail-spikes in old adults suggest that they were used as defence weapons, but not until an ontogenetically late stage. The development of the large axial channel in old adults from small canals in young adults, facilitated the further enlargement of the spikes by increasing the amount of nourishment supplied. On the other hand, plates do not show a similar degree of bone compaction or cortical thickening indicating they would not be capable of taking much weight from above. This suggests they were not as important as spikes in active defense.|$|E

Filipovitch-Robinson praises Jovanović for providing [...] "further historical testimony to the steadfast faith that enabled the Serbs to retain their identity and unity as a people <b>and</b> <b>persist</b> in their goal of regaining their freedom and nationhood." [...] She ranks the painting among Jovanović's best, alongside Migration of the Serbs (1896) and The Proclamation of Dušan's Law Codex (1900).

500|$|According {{to another}} Cochrane Collaboration review on {{withdrawal}} in individuals who compulsively use amphetamine and methamphetamine, [...] "when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue amphetamine use, many report a time-limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24hours {{of their last}} dose." [...] This review noted that withdrawal symptoms in chronic, high-dose users are frequent, occurring in roughly 88% of cases, <b>and</b> <b>persist</b> for weeks with a marked [...] "crash" [...] phase occurring during the first week. [...] Amphetamine withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, drug craving, depressed mood, fatigue, increased appetite, increased movement or decreased movement, lack of motivation, sleeplessness or sleepiness, and lucid dreams. [...] The review indicated that the severity of withdrawal symptoms is positively correlated with {{the age of the}} individual and the extent of their dependence. [...] Mild withdrawal symptoms from the discontinuation of amphetamine treatment at therapeutic doses can be avoided by tapering the dose.|$|E
