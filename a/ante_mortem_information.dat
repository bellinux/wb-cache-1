40|$|The {{identification}} of deceased individuals {{is important in}} society as it not only facilitates the progression of criminal investigations into suspicious deaths, but also enables the resolution of legal matters and brings closure to the families affected by the death. When a corpse is skeletonized, heavily burned, or the soft tissue has degraded {{to a point that}} other professionals cannot obtain information about the deceased, a forensic anthropologist or odontologist is often tasked with identification. A variety of methods exist that enable forensic anthropologists to achieve identification. These include: non-imaged records comparisons; craniofacial superimposition and comparative radiography. Facial reconstructions can also be utilized when no <b>ante</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>information</b> about the deceased individual is available or when law enforcement have no suspicions on who the deceased person is. Facial reconstructions are traditionally a manual method however with the recent advancement of photogrammetry and three-dimensional and computer-aided design modeling software, the process can be performed within a virtual space. The purpose of this literature review is to identify an efficient and low-cost method of generating facial reconstructions using photogrammetry and open-source three-dimensional and computer-aided design software...|$|E
40|$|Background Bone metastases (BM) {{are a very}} {{uncommon}} site of metastatic {{spread from}} ovarian cancer, especially if diagnosed <b>ante</b> <b>mortem.</b> <b>Information</b> regarding prognostic relevance in this population is very limited. Therefore, the present analysis was initiated. Methods Patients with histological confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, carcinoma of the fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma (EOC) and BM admitted from 2004 to 2009 to the university hospital Charité in Berlin, Germany were analyzed retrospectively. Results Twenty-six patients with BM were identified, resulting in an incidence of 1, 5 %. Incidence of BM in patients with EOC in autopsy studies varies around 10, 3 %. Therefore the estimated number of unknown cases is 9 %. The most common localisations of BM were the thoracic and lumbar spine and the pelvic bone. 96, 2 % of all BM were located within {{the margins of the}} CT abdomen scan. CT scans were often performed for various reasons, but osseous structures were not described routinely. General Overall Survival (OS) was 55 months and from diagnosis of BM 13, 8 months (range 2, 5 months – 11, 7 years). Patients with a single BM had an OS after diagnosis of BM of 24, 9 months versus patients with multiple BM with 11, 5 months (p= 0, 110). OS after diagnosis of BM for patients without any further distant metastasis was 27, 1 months in contrast to 9, 1 months for patients with other metastasis (p= 0, 100). As a major prognostic factor we identified the time of first appearance of BM in respect to the diagnosis of EOC. We therefore classified two subgroups of patients with BM: “early onset group” and “late onset group”. Early onset of BM within 12 months from diagnosis of EOC was associated with fast and aggressive progress, early appearance of distant metastasis and a significantly shorter OS of 11, 2 months, whereas in the late onset group (appearance of BM later than 12 months – on an average 61. 1 months – after diagnosis of EOC) the OS was with 78, 4 months seven times longer (p= 0, 000001). Since this behaviour does not correlate with the histological type or grading of EOC, we postulate that a possible reason for these findings is differences in the biological activities of various EOC. Conclusion We highly recommend to take into account our defined two subgroups with different progression types of EOC as well as the special attention to the osseous structures in CT abdomen scans in order to diagnose even asymptomatic BM as early as possible. Hereby, high risk patients as well as patients with BM could be identified earlier and benefit from early therapeutic approaches. Morbidity and OS of these patients could be improved...|$|E

40|$|Determination {{of blood}} alcohol {{concentration}} (BAC) on <b>ante</b> <b>mortem</b> and post mortem samples is often performed in forensic laboratory. BAC determination has been common task in forensic laboratory due to rising accident cases due to driving under influence of alcohol. Earlier researchers have proven that factors such as preservative, storage temperature and storage period affect the blood alcohol stability and BAC determination. Apparently, no regulation governs these factors in BAC determination. Therefore, this study is performed to address the effect of preservative, temperature and storage days on BAC level. A blood specimen of <b>ante</b> and post <b>mortem</b> samples with preservative and non preservative in two different conditions (chilled temperature, 4 - 7 oC and room temperature, 24 - 26. 9 oC) has been examined.

40|$|Shooting {{is widely}} used to reduce the abundances of {{terrestrial}} wildlife populations, but there is concern about the animal welfare outcomes ('humaneness') of these programmes. Management agencies require methods for assessing the animal welfare outcomes of terrestrial wildlife shooting programmes. We identified four key issues in previous studies assessing the animal welfare outcomes of shooting programmes: (i) biased sampling strategies; (ii) no direct <b>ante</b> <b>mortem</b> observations; (iii) absence of quantifiable parameters for benchmarking; and (iv) no evaluation of explanatory variables that may cause adverse welfare outcomes. We used methods that address these issues to assess the welfare outcomes of a European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) shooting programme in south-eastern Australia. An independent observer collected <b>ante</b> <b>mortem</b> (distance, timing and outcome of each shot fired) and post mortem (locations of bullet wounds) data. The <b>ante</b> <b>mortem</b> data were used to estimate three critical animal welfare parameters: apparent time to death (ATTD); instantaneous death rate (IDR); and wounding rate (WR). The post mortem data were {{used to evaluate the}} location of bullet wounds relative to the Australian national standard operating procedure (SOP). For rabbits, the mean IDR was 0. 60, ATTD was 12 s and WR was 0. 12. A large proportion of rabbits (0. 75) were shot in the cranium or thorax, as required by the SOP. Logistic regression indicated that the proportion of rabbits wounded and missed increased with shooting distance. Hence, reducing shooting distances would increase the humaneness of European rabbit shooting programmes. Our approach enables the animal welfare outcomes of terrestrial shooting programmes to be independently quantified...|$|R
