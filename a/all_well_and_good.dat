5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, <b>all</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E

2500|$|On 10 October 1939, Britain refused Hitler's {{offer of}} peace and on 12 October, France did the same. Colonel-General Franz Halder (Chief of the General Staff of OKH), {{presented}} the first plan for Fall Gelb (Case Yellow) on 19 October. This was the pre-war codename of plans for a campaign in the Low Countries: the Aufmarschanweisung N°1, Fall Gelb (Deployment Instruction No. 1, Case Yellow). Halder's plan {{has been compared to}} the Schlieffen Plan, the name given to the German strategy of 1914 in the First World War. It was similar in that both plans entailed an advance through the middle of Belgium. Aufmarschanweisung N°1 envisioned a frontal attack, sacrificing a projected half million German soldiers to attain the limited goal of throwing the Allies back to the River Somme. Germany's strength for 1940 would then be spent; only in 1942 could the main attack against France begin. When Hitler raised objections to the plan and instead advocated for a decisive armoured breakthrough as had happened in the invasion of Poland, Halder and Brauchitsch attempted to dissuade him, arguing that while the fast-moving mechanised tactics were <b>all</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> against a [...] "shoddy" [...] Eastern European army, they would not work against a first-rate military like the French.|$|E

2500|$|Eyvind Earle joined Walt Disney Productions in 1951 first {{employed}} {{as an assistant}} background painter for Peter Pan before being promoted as a full-fledged background painter in the Goofy cartoon, [...] "For Whom the Bulls Toil" [...] and the color stylist of the Academy Award-winning short, Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom. For Sleeping Beauty, Earle said he [...] "felt totally free to put my own style" [...] into the paintings he based on Hench's drawings stating [...] "Where his trees might have curved, I straightened them out…. I took a Hench and took the same subject, and the composition he had, and just turned in into my style." [...] Furthermore, Earle found inspiration in Italian Renaissance utilizing works from Albrecht Dürer, Pieter Bruegel, Nicolaas van Eyck, Sandro Botticelli, as well as Persian art and Japanese prints. When Geronimi became the supervising director, Earle and Geronimi entered furious creative divisions. Geronimi commented that he felt Earle's paintings [...] "lacked the mood {{in a lot of}} things. All that beautiful detail in the trees, the bark, and all that, that's <b>all</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> <b>good,</b> but who the hell's going to look at that? [...] The backgrounds became more important than the animation. He'd made them more like Christmas cards." [...] Earle left the Disney studios in March 1958, before Sleeping Beauty was completed, to take a job at the John Sutherland studio. As a result, Geronimi had Earle's background paintings softened and diluted from their distinctive medieval texture.|$|E

40|$|Martin Kaliski is {{a typical}} pet owner. He {{currently}} houses both cats and a dog. In order to keep from having to constantly let his pets {{out in the middle}} of the night he has installed a pet door into his home. <b>All</b> was <b>well</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> until early one morning Martin woke up to the sound of his Pomeranian barking violently. He ran downstairs to see what the problem was. He not only found his dog standing there but also a wild raccoon. The raccoon had slipped into the house in the early morning and was rummaging through the pets’ food. Martin was successfully able to get the wild animal to leave through the way he came only to notice a few minutes later that the raccoon’s animal accomplice soon snuck out behind him. From that point on Martin refused to leave the pet door unlocked and no longer uses it. Wild animals entering through a home’s pet door is not an uncommon thing and leaves a sense of insecurity for a pet owner. Without having some way of monitoring this, a pet owner is subject to other animals entering his/her home and potentially destroying his/her property or causing harm to loved ones. The goal for this project is to produce a new and innovative way at managing pet doors. There are a few products out there that already have smart pet door technology but this project will provide an easy to use and less invasive way of monitoring which animals can and cannot enter the home. This will be accomplished by implementing some type of weight sensor that is able to register the distinct size of the animal trying to enter the home within a programmed range between 10 – 15 lbs. and from that allow access. In order to help with the cost, a pre engineered weight sensor will be used as well as already automated pet doors. The ultimate goal is to take this product and be able to add it to already installed pet doors...|$|R

40|$|The best science {{teaching}} reveals {{not just the}} science of nature but also the nature of science. It is <b>all</b> very <b>well</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> for a student to learn the facts that science has discovered, but to {{do no more than}} that is to miss what is most important and distinctive about science, namely, its methods of investigation. The most inspiring science teachers already know this. Physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, who was himself an inspiring teacher, recounted several stories about how his father taught him science. In one story, he described how his father would take him for walks in the woods in the Catskill Mountains and tell him interesting things going on in the forest. Other children would later tease him when he could not give the name of some bird they saw, saying that his father did not teach him anything. But Feynman said that the opposite was true and explained that his father would point to a bird and say, “It’s a brown throated thrush—but in Portuguese it’s a – –, in Italian a – – and so on. “Now, ” his father would continue, “you know all the languages, {{you want to know what}} the name of that bird is and when you’ve finished with all that you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You only know about humans in different places and what they call the bird. Now, let’s look at the bird and what it’s doing” (Feynman, 1983). In a simple and memorable lesson, Feynman’s father was introducing the fundamental idea that science begins not in words but in observations. Science is not so much a list of facts we have discovered as a set of methods that let us know when we are justified in adding to or revising that list. Science advances by observation and inductive reasoning, and the student who does no more than memorize what previous scientists have found will be unlikely to make new discoveries about the world or even truly understand why he or she should believe what has already been discovered. Evolution, as one such fundamental scientific discovery, should be included as a pervasive explanator...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Hardy was {{remarking}} {{upon this}} {{one day to}} Mr. Percy, who replied, [...] "Ah, the poor fellows are very unfortunate. They brought out a fair capital, and had as large a stock of sheep and cattle as the Canterbury party have. About six months, however, before you arrived--yes, it's just a year now--the Indians swept down upon them, and carried off every animal they had. They attacked the house, but the Jamiesons defended themselves well; and the Indians were anxious to get off with their booty, and so they beat a retreat. Pursuit was hopeless; every horse had been driven off, {{and they had to}} walk six miles to the next hacienda to give the news; and long before a party could be got together the Indians were beyond the possibility of pursuit. Two or three hundred sheep and a dozen or two of the bullocks found their way back, and these and their land was all that remained to the Jamiesons of their capital, for they had invested all they had in their stock. However, they looked affairs manfully in the face, sold their animals, bought a couple of plows and draught bullocks, hired a peon or two, and set to work with a will. They will get on but slowly for a time; but I have no doubt that they will do well {{in the course of a}} few years. Men with their pluck and perseverance are certain to get on. That puts me in mind, Hardy, of a matter upon which I had intended to speak to you. We are just getting now to the time of the year when Indian attacks are most likely to take place. Sometimes they are quiet for a year or two, then they are very troublesome again. Five or six years ago, just after I first came out, we had terrible times with them. Vast numbers of cattle were driven off: the sheep they less seldom take, because they cannot travel so fast, but they do drive them off sometimes. A good many shepherds were killed, and two or three estancias captured and burned, and the inmates murdered. You are now the furthest settler, and consequently the most exposed. Your estancia is strong <b>and</b> <b>well</b> built, <b>and</b> you are <b>all</b> <b>well</b> armed <b>and</b> <b>good</b> shots.
