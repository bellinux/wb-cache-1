40|$|The {{components}} of grain yield are altered by adverse growing conditions as {{the effects of}} certain environmental factors on crop growth and yield differ depending upon the developmental stages when these conditions occur. Path-coefficient {{analysis was used to}} investigate the main processes influencing grain yield and its formation under Mediterranean conditions. Twenty-five durum wheat genotypes, consisting of four Spanish commercial varieties and 21 inbred lines from the ICARDA durum wheat breeding program, were grown during 1997 and 1998 under both rainfed and irrigated conditions in southern Spain. Path-coefficient analysis revealed that under favourable conditions grain yield depended in equal proportion on the three primary yield components (i. e. spikes m − 2, grains spike − 1, and mean grain weight), whereas in the rainfed experiments, variations in grain yield were due mainly to spikes m − 2 {{and to a lesser extent}} to grains spike − 1. Compensatory effects were almost absent under irrigated treatments; however, under water shortage, spikes m − 2 exerted a negative influence on grain spike − 1 due mainly to a negative interrelationship between tiller production and apical development. These compensatory effects could partially explain the restricted success in durum wheat breeding observed in water-limited environments of the Mediterranean region. Under rainfed conditions the number of spikes m − 2 depended mainly on the <b>ability</b> <b>for</b> <b>tiller</b> production, whereas in the irrigated experiments the final number of spikes was determined mostly by tiller survival...|$|R

Despite genetic variation for the trait, previous studies have been confined to a limited number of genotypes and the physiological mechanisms and causes of genotypic differences in tillering in sorghum remain unclear. To exploit the trait in sorghum improvement, the genotypic and environmental effects on tillering and their interactions need to be understood. The present study aims to explore the extent and nature of genetic variation <b>for</b> <b>tillering</b> in sorghum and the interaction of these genetic effects with variation in environment.

40|$|Background and Aims: Tillering has a {{significant}} effect on canopy development and, hence, on resource capture, crop growth and grain yield in sorghum. However, the physiological basis of tillering and its regulation by environmental effects are not fully understood. The objective {{of this study was to}} understand and quantify the environmental effects on tillering in sorghum using a carbohydrate supply-demand framework. Methods: A series of five experiments with a wide range of radiation and temperature conditions was conducted and details of the tillering responses of a single representative hybrid were monitored. The concept of internal plant competition for carbohydrate was developed for analysis of these responses. Key Results: Tiller appearance was highly synchronized with main shoot leaf appearance, with a consistent hierarchy <b>for</b> <b>tillering</b> across environments. The main environmental effect was on the frequency of tiller appearance, in particular of the lower-rank tillers. This explained some of the observed environmental differences in the onset of tillering. A generalized index of internal plant competition, which took account of plant assimilate supply and demand (S/D) during the critical period <b>for</b> <b>tillering,</b> explained most of the variation in maximum tiller number observed across the five experiments. Conclusions: This result was consistent with the hypothesis that internal plant competition <b>for</b> assimilates regulates <b>tillering</b> in sorghum. Hence, the framework outlined has a predictive value that could provide the basis for dynamic simulation of tillering in crop growth models...|$|R

30|$|This study {{demonstrated}} {{that the lack of}} GS 1; 2 caused a disorder of carbon metabolism in the basal portions of rice shoots at the seedling stage. The reduction in the sucrose content was caused by the downregulation of OscFBP 2 in the basal portions of the gs 1; 2 mutant shoots. Downregulation of OscFBP 2 caused low rates of sucrose synthesis, which, in turn, reduced tiller numbers at the early growth stages. Therefore, sufficient sucrose and glutamine is required <b>for</b> <b>tiller</b> growth in the basal portions of rice shoots.|$|R
30|$|Metabolomic {{analysis}} revealed {{that the lack of}} GS 1; 2 reduced sucrose metabolism in the basal portions of the shoots. Our results indicated that sucrose reduction was caused by the downregulation of OscFBP 2 expression in the basal portions of the gs 1; 2 mutant shoots. The reduction in sucrose content caused by the lack of cFBPase 2 resulted in lower tiller number at the early growth stage. Therefore, adequate sucrose supply via cFBPase 2 may be necessary <b>for</b> <b>tiller</b> growth in the basal portions of rice shoots.|$|R
30|$|The lack of GS 1; 2 {{suppressed}} tiller {{axillary bud}} outgrowth, which, in turn, substantially decreased tiller number and rice yield (Funayama et al. 2013; Ohashi et al. 2015 b). In the basal portions of rice shoots where the axillary buds emerge, GS 1; 2 protein localized in the phloem companion {{cells of the}} nodal vascular anastomoses joining the axillary bud vessels (Ohashi et al. 2015 b). Transcriptomic analysis showed downregulation of genes regulating nitrogen and carbon metabolism in the basal portions of the gs 1; 2 mutant shoots (Ohashi et al. 2015 b). Therefore, the metabolic disorder caused {{by the lack of}} GS 1; 2 severely reduced tiller axillary bud outgrowth triggered by imbalanced primary metabolism (Ohashi et al. 2015 b). The lack of GS 1; 2 significantly lowered glutamine and asparagine content in the basal portions of the shoots (Ohashi et al. 2017). The low glutamine levels repressed the active cytokinin required <b>for</b> <b>tiller</b> bud outgrowth (Ohashi et al. 2017). In contrast, the low asparagine content caused by asparagine synthetase 1 (OsAS 1) downregulation did not significantly inhibit tiller axillary bud outgrowth (Ohashi et al. 2018). In conclusion, it is highly probable that glutamine is responsible <b>for</b> <b>tiller</b> axillary bud outgrowth.

Three different areas on the pasture (undergrazed, with proper grazing and overgrazed) and three tiller categories (without defoliation, withdefoliation and without shoot apical meristem) were evaluated. Randomized block design with three repetitions was used. The B. decumbens pasture was managed under the continuous stocking system with cattle, and the grass height was kept at about 25 cm. Thenumber of tillers showing defoliation was higher (1, 333 tillers/m²) for the overgrazed area compared to the area with proper grazing and the undergrazed area. Inverse response pattern was observed <b>for</b> the <b>tillers</b> without defoliation. On the other hand, the number of tillerswithout the shoot apical meristem was higher in the areas with proper grazing (395 tillers/m²). Tillers without defoliation showed a lower pseudoculm length (10. 3 cm) and a smaller number of dead leaves (0. 22) when compared to the other categories.

Near-isogenic lines (NILs) varying <b>for</b> a <b>tiller</b> inhibition (tin) gene and representing two genetic backgrounds were investigated <b>for</b> <b>tillering</b> dynamics, organ size distribution, leaf area, light interception, red: far-red ratio, and chlorophyll content. Tillering ceased {{earlier in the}} tin lines to reduce the frequencies of later primary and secondary tillers compared to the free-tillering NILs, and demonstrated the genetically lower tillering plasticity of tin-containing lines. The distribution of organ sizes along shoots varied between NILs contrasting for tin. Internode elongation commenced at a lower phytomer, and the peduncle was shorter in the tin lines. The flag leaves of tin lines were larger, and the longest leaf blades were observed at higher phytomers in the tin than in free-tillering lines. Total leaf area was reduced in tin lines, and non-tin lines invested more leaf area at mid-canopy height. The tiller economy (ratio of seed-bearing shoots to numbers of shoots produced) was 10 % greater in the tin lines (0. 73 – 0. 76) compared to the free-tillering sisters (0. 62 – 0. 63). At maximum tiller number, the red: far-red ratio (light quality stimulus that is thought to induce the cessation of tillering) at the plant-base was 0. 18 – 0. 22 in tin lines and 0. 09 – 0. 11 in free-tillering lines at levels of photosynthetic active radiation of 49 – 53 % and 30 – 33 %, respectively. The tin lines intercepted less radiation compared to their free-tillering sisters once genotypic differences in tiller numbers had established, and maintained green leaf area in the lower canopy later into the season. Greater light extinction coefficients (k) in tin lines prior to, but reduced k after, spike emergence indicated that differences in light interception between NILs contrasting in tin cannot be explained by leaf area alone but that geometric and optical canopy properties contributed.

This study investigated the observation that a high stem WSC concentration (WSCc) is often related to low tillering. The proposition tested was that stem WSC accumulation is plant density dependent and could be an emergent property of tillering, whether driven by genotype or by environment. A small subset of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) contrasting <b>for</b> <b>tillering</b> was grown at different plant densities or on different sowing dates in multiple field experiments. Both tillering and WSCc were highly influenced by the environment, with a smaller, distinct genotypic component; the genotype×environment range covered 350 - 750 stems m and 25 - 210 mg g WSCc. Stem WSCc was inversely related to stem number m, but genotypic rankings for stem WSCc persisted when RILs were compared at similar stem density. Low tillering-high WSCc RILs had similar leaf area index, larger individual leaves, and stems with larger internode cross-section and wall area when compared with high tillering-low WSCc RILs. The maximum number of stems per plant was positively associated with growth and relative growth rate per plant, tillering rate and duration, and also, in some treatments, with leaf appearance rate and final leaf number. A common threshold of the red:far red ratio (0. 39 - 0. 44; standard error of the difference= 0. 055) coincided with the maximum stem number per plant across genotypes and plant densities, and could be effectively used in crop simulation modelling as a 2 ̆ 7 cut-off 2 ̆ 7 rule <b>for</b> <b>tillering.</b> The relationship between tillering, WSCc, and their component traits, {{as well as the}} possible implications for crop simulation and breeding, is discussed...|$|R

The parents involved in these crosses are average x average general combiners and or poor x average combiners except in cross 35 th IBWSN- 14 / PBW 502 (3. 14), which involved good x average general combiners. Desirable specific combining ability of the crosses involving such parents seems to be mainly due to complementation of the genes. Thus these crosses can be exploited for grain yield per plant by using biparental mating syste...|$|R

40|$|Grain yield {{in spring}} wheat, Triticum aestivum L., {{is in part}} {{determined}} {{by the number of}} spikes per unit area. With the exception of high plant density crops, spike numbers are in turn the end-product of the tillering process common to all grass species. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the tillering patterns of diverse spring wheat genotypes under the short growing season conditions of central Saskatchewan. In addition, experiments were carried out to determine how consistently tillering patterns were expressed in different years, locations, seeding rates, seeding dates, seeding depths and temperatures. Significant genotypic variation was detected <b>for</b> the following <b>tillering</b> pattern components: time to tiller emergence, maximum tiller number, tiller mortality and spike number. Maximum tiller number consistently exhibited the greatest variability among genotypes with a five and 2. 5 -fold range at 5 and 100 % of the commercial seeding rate (230 seeds/m 2), respectively. Genotypes which produced large tiller populations did so by producing more secondary tillers as a result of higher individual tiller emergence and survival frequencies. Cultivars in which tillers emerged when the main stem was less developed had higher tiller grain yields but were late maturing. Lower tillering cultivars were characterized by a lower synchronization of tiller emergence and a greater phytomass differential between the main stem and its second leaf tiller at the mid- to late-tillering phase. On a crop basis there was no relationship between a genotype's yielding ability and either its tillering capacity or tiller mortality. Cultivars with diverse tillering habits (free-tillering, low-tillering and oligoculm) responded differently to changing environments as illustrated by cultivar x seeding rate and cultivar x year interactions <b>for</b> <b>tillering</b> characteristics and yield components. The genotype x environment (G x E) interactions <b>for</b> <b>tillering</b> did not involve changes in cultivar rank while those for a number of yield components did. The G x E interactions for yield components were ascribed to a pronounced reduction in the means of the low-tillering and oligoculm cultivars at higher seeding rates under extended pre-anthesis drought conditions. Several years of testing led to the conclusion that oligoculm cultivars are not suited to the erratic precipitation distributions common to central Saskatchewan. Under field and/or controlled environment conditions increases in seeding depth (1 to 3 cm) had a slight effect on tillering, reducing the rate of tillering, shortening the tillering phase, and reducing maximum tiller number, tiller mortality and spike number. Under controlled environment conditions temperature was shown to have a pronounced effect on the rate of tillering but little impact on maximum tiller number. Similarly, under field conditions delayed seeding had little effect on maximum tiller number. Heritability estimates <b>for</b> maximum <b>tiller</b> numbers based on the variance component method were high and G x E effects negligible, indicating that genotypic tillering characteristics are expressed consistently across environments. A lack of heterosis combined with few deviations from normality in F 2 population distributions suggests that tillering capacity is controlled by genes with largely additive effects. It is suggested that selection <b>for</b> maximum <b>tiller</b> number could be carried out during early generations in solid seeded plots. However, the fact that grain yields were not associated with a particular tillering capacity leads {{to the conclusion that the}} manipulation of this trait would not be a productive breeding venture...|$|R
