5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to <b>anything</b> <b>resembling</b> a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E

25|$|The early Socialist Labor Party, {{influenced}} by {{the father of the}} Social Democratic Party of Germany, Ferdinand Lassalle, argued that the wage gains and improvements of conditions achievable by trade unions were insignificant and ephemeral. Only the capture of the state through the ballot box would enable a restructuring of the economy and society in <b>anything</b> <b>resembling</b> a permanent manner. So long as capitalism existed, wage gains here would be offset by the pressure of wage cuts there and incomes would be driven down to a subsistence minimum through the inexorable pressure of the market. Thus the political campaign for the capture of the state—winning office for the sake of winning power to enact change—was considered paramount.|$|E

500|$|Soul {{music is}} a {{combination}} of R and gospel that began in the late 1950s in the United States. Soul music is characterized by its use of gospel techniques with a greater emphasis on vocalists, and the use of secular themes. The 1950s recordings of Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, and James Brown are commonly considered the beginnings of soul music. Solomon Burke's early recordings for Atlantic Records codified the style, and as Peter Guralnick writes, [...] "it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records that you could see <b>anything</b> <b>resembling</b> a movement".|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{variance}} risk premia {{in energy}} commodities, particularly crude {{oil and natural}} gas, using a robust model-independent approach. Over a period of 11 years, {{we find that the}} average variance risk premia are negative for both energy commodities. Energy variance risk premia in dollar terms are time-varying, while energy variance risk premia in return terms, particularly in the case of natural gas, are more constant over time. Finally, the return profile of a natural gas variance swap resembles that of a call option, while the return profile of a crude oil variance swap, if <b>anything,</b> <b>resembles</b> the return profile of a put option. The annualized Sharpe ratios from shorting energy variance are sizable. Although not nearly as high as the annualized Sharpe ratio of shorting S&P 500 index variance, they are comparable to those of shorting interest rate volatility or variance on individual stocks.

500|$|If {{the dates}} given by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle are {{accurate}} to within half a century, then Ælle's reign lies {{in the middle of}} the Anglo-Saxon expansion, and prior to the final conquest of the Britons.
