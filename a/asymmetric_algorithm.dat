5000|$|... {{asymmetric}} encryption is too slow for many purposes, and all secret key algorithms {{require that the}} key is securely distributed. By using an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>algorithm</b> to encrypt the secret key for another, faster, symmetric algorithm, it's possible to improve overall performance considerably. This is the process used by PGP and GPG.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of public key cryptosystems {{depends on the}} intractability (computational and theoretical) of certain mathematical problems such as integer factorization. These problems are time consuming to solve, but usually faster than trying all possible keys by brute force. Thus, <b>asymmetric</b> <b>algorithm</b> keys must be longer for equivalent resistance to attack than symmetric algorithm keys. As of 2002, an asymmetric key length of 1024 bits was generally considered by cryptology experts to be the minimum necessary for the RSA encryption algorithm.|$|E

Many <b>asymmetric</b> <b>algorithms</b> have homomorphic properties, such as unpadded RSA [10] and Paillier [17], described in Appendix. To be more precise, unpadded RSA is a multiplicative homomorphic cryptosystem, while Paillier is an additive homomorphic cryptosystem.|$|R
50|$|One of the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>algorithm</b> types, {{elliptic}} curve cryptography, or ECC, {{appears to be}} secure with shorter keys than other asymmetric key algorithms require. NIST guidelines state that ECC keys should be twice the length of equivalent strength symmetric key algorithms. So, for example, a 224-bit ECC key would have roughly the same strength as a 112-bit symmetric key. These estimates assume no major breakthroughs in solving the underlying mathematical problems that ECC is based on. A message encrypted with an elliptic key algorithm using a 109-bit long key has been broken by brute force.|$|E

50|$|Asymmetric {{algorithms}} rely {{for their}} effectiveness on {{a class of}} problems in mathematics called one-way functions, which require relatively little computational power to execute, but vast amounts of power to reverse, if reversal is possible at all. A classic example of a one-way function is multiplication of very large prime numbers. It's fairly quick to multiply two large primes, but very difficult to find the factors of the product of two large primes. Because of the mathematics of one-way functions, most possible keys are bad choices as cryptographic keys; {{only a small fraction}} of the possible keys of a given length are suitable, and so asymmetric algorithms require very long keys to reach the same level of security provided by relatively shorter symmetric keys. The need to both generate the key pairs, and perform the encryption/decryption operations make asymmetric algorithms computationally expensive, compared to most symmetric algorithms. Since symmetric algorithms can often use any sequence of (random, or at least unpredictable) bits as a key, a disposable session key can be quickly generated for short-term use. Consequently, it is common practice to use a long asymmetric key to exchange a disposable, much shorter (but just as strong) symmetric key. The slower <b>asymmetric</b> <b>algorithm</b> securely sends a symmetric session key, and the faster symmetric algorithm takes over for the remainder of the message.|$|E
40|$|For many {{foreseen}} {{applications of}} Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) – for example monitoring the structural {{health of a}} bridge – message integrity is a crucial requirement. Usually, security services such as message integrity are realized by symmetric cryptography only, because asymmetric cryptography is often stated as impracticable for WSN. However, the proposed solutions for symmetric key establishment introduce a significant computation, storage, and– most important–communication overhead. Digital signatures and key-exchange based on <b>asymmetric</b> <b>algorithms</b> would be very valuable though. In the literature nearly only RSA and ECC are implemented and compared for sensor nodes, though there exist a variety of innovative <b>asymmetric</b> <b>algorithms.</b> To close this gap, we investigated the efficiency and suitability of digital signature algorithms based on innovative asymmetric primitives for WSN.

For the RSA cryptosystem at 128-bit security level, NIST and ENISA recommend using 3072-bit keys and IETF 3253 bits. Elliptic curve cryptography requires shorter keys, so the recommendations are 256-383 (NIST), 256 (ENISA) and 242 bits (IETF).|$|R
