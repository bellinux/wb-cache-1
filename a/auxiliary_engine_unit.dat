40|$|Engine room {{monitoring}} {{control system}} is monitoring and controlling main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> from long distance by powerline communication network and wireless network {{to ease the}} operator in operating the ship and save operational cost. To prevent error in programming the main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine,</b> a simulation using instrument software is needed to know the machine characteristic. After simulation result fulfills the requirement which is approached the value of test record, it {{can be applied to}} the real machine. In this study, some steps were done such as: getting know type of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> which performance will be simulated and programmed, getting test record of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine,</b> getting know how the main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> work, making simulation of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> work system, doing monitoring control simulation by powerline communication and wireless network, comparing the results between simulation and test record of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine.</b> Engine programming can be set after simulation result meets the requirement. Result of simulation fulfills the requirement, the difference values between machine simulation using software instrument and test record of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> are around 1 %- 2 %. If engine room monitoring control system by wireless and powerline communication is applied in the ship, the ship owner will get advantages because it will prolong ship durability and can monitor operasional of main <b>engine</b> or <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> from long distance; while the operator will be easier in operating the ship.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of wave rotor-topping in turboshaft engines, subsonic high-bypass turbofan <b>engines,</b> <b>auxiliary</b> power <b>units,</b> and ground power units are evaluated. The thermodynamic cycle performance is modeled using a one-dimensional steady-state code; wave rotor performance is modeled using one-dimensional design/analysis codes. Design and off-design engine performance is calculated for baseline engines and wave rotor-topped engines, where the wave rotor {{acts as a}} high pressure spool. The wave rotor-enhanced engines are shown to have benefits in specific power and specific fuel flow over the baseline engines without increasing turbine inlet temperature. The off-design steady-state behavior of a wave rotor-topped engine is shown {{to be similar to}} a conventional engine. Mission studies are performed to quantify aircraft performance benefits for various wave rotor cycle and weight parameters. Gas turbine engine cycles most likely to benefit from wave rotor-topping are identified. Issues of practical integration and the corresponding technical challenges with various engine types are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Among all <b>engine</b> <b>auxiliary</b> <b>units</b> {{a cooling}} fan is the noisiest. There are two {{mechanisms}} that generate the overall noise of the fan: the rotational and non-rotational one. These mechanisms depend on the fans geometry and operation conditions. The rotational noise {{is characterized by a}} broadband noise and superimposed discrete frequency tones. The superimposed tones are linked with the blade passage frequency and its higher harmonics. In heavily loaded conditions (at the lower flow rate) non-rotational noise is found to be prevailing. The non-rotational noise spectrum has a peak at frequency that is not related to the rotational speed or blade passage frequency. Rotational noise is mainly the consequence of the fluctuating forces on the rotor blades and is provoked by the interaction of the rotor blades with the nearby stationary objects. Non-rotational noise is caused by: a) laminar boundary layer vortex shedding, b) blade interaction with the tip clearance vortex and c) blade stall. The goal of this paper is highlight all these noise generating mechanisms caused by axial fans in IC engines cooling applications. </p...|$|R
