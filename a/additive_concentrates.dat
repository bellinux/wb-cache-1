A high oxygen content observed in sample fracture surfaces was found to be consistent with the existence of an oxygen-enriched phase in the grain boundaries.

25|$|Because {{water has}} good {{properties}} as a coolant, water plus antifreeze {{is used in}} internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications, such as HVAC chillers and solar water heaters. The purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes. Commercially, both the <b>additive</b> (pure <b>concentrate)</b> and the mixture (diluted solution) are called antifreeze, depending on the context. Careful selection of an antifreeze can enable a wide temperature range in which the mixture remains in the liquid phase, which is critical to efficient heat transfer and the proper functioning of heat exchangers.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Polyethylene (PE) resins being non-polar in nature and having {{a high degree of}} crystallinity have limited miscibility and compatibility when blended with polar polymers. The miscibility and compatibility of these blends are generally worsened when they are prepared by direct injection moulding without a precompounding process. Such situations are commonly encountered in particular by polymer converters when blending colour and/or <b>additive</b> <b>concentrates,</b> commonly known as masterbatches. Typically, masterbatches are mixtures containing high loading of pigments and/or additives predispersed in a suitable solid vehicle (commonly known as carrier) such as a polyethylene resin. These masterbatches are usually used for the colouration {{of a wide range of}} polymers and the carrier used must therefore be compatible with these matrix (host) polymers. The preliminary stage of this study involved the investigation of the properties of blends based on high density polyethylene (HDPE) and a range of engineering thermoplastics (ABS, PC, PBT, PA 6), prepared by injection moulding. Five different types of compatibilisers namely, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer, ethylene-methyl acrylate (EMA) copolymer, ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate (E-GMA) copolymer, ethylene-methyl acrylateglycidyl methacrylate (E-MA-GMA) terpolymer and maleic anhydride grafted HDPE (HDPE-g-MAH) copolymer were evaluated with respect to their efficiencies in compatibilising HDPE with the four engineering polymers.

40|$|Cow types {{adapted to}} forage-based {{production}} systems {{are of particular}} interest for organic milk production, because of the limited use of <b>additives</b> (<b>concentrates,</b> pharmaceuticals etc.). The objective of this project was to study the aptitude of New Zealand Holstein cows (HNZ) to produce milk in a pasture-based production system with a shortened calving season (February to mid April) under organic conditions. 11 HNZ were compared 2007 to 11 farm-bred, “Swiss” Holstein cows (HCH), all of them during their first lactation, in a rotational pasture system on the organic farm “l’Abbaye” in Sorens (CH). With an average live weight (LW) {{at the beginning of}} 469 kg and a height at withers (WH) of 130 cm the HNZ were considerably smaller compared to HCH with 609 kg LW and 147 cm WH. During the first lactation the HNZ gained more body mass (63 kg vs. 24 kg, P < 0. 03) and had a higher average body condition score (3. 03 vs. 2. 77, P < 0. 04). The milk production per HNZ was lower by 1000 kg milk (P < 0. 004) respectively 800 kg energy-corrected milk (ECM) (P < 0. 02). No differences were detected between the two cow types concerning the ECM production per 100 kg metabolic weight. Milk protein and lactose contents were significantly higher for HNZ and milk fat content was not significantly different. The somatic cell counts were similar for both types. Although the adaptation period on farm for HNZ had been short, they produced the same amount of ECM per kg metabolic weight and gained more body mass compared with HCH...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of conventional products incorporating single aspects of organic production systems such as lower inputs of pesticides, food <b>additives</b> or <b>concentrated</b> animal feed (referred to as low-input products hereafter) are found on the food market. By means of choice experiments, we explore consumers’ buying behaviour regarding organic, conventional and low-input food in Germany. Our analyses show that lowinput products mostly substitute conventional products. We identify two main groups of buyers {{who are interested in}} low-input products: Firstly, consumers who buy little organic and secondly, consumers who buy particular product groups in organic quality and others in conventional. We suggest that the organic sector should take advantage of its basic values to attract the low-input buyers. Through better communication of what organic means, the organic sector could differentiate itself from low-input products and gain new customers...|$|R

40|$|Polylactic acid (PLA) is {{an organic}} polymer {{commonly}} used in fused deposition (FDM) printing and biomedical scaffolding that is biocompatible and immunologically inert. However, variations in source material quality and chemistry make it necessary to characterize the filament and determine potential changes in chemistry occurring {{as a result of}} the FDM process. We used several spectroscopic techniques, including laser confocal microscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and photoacousitc FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in order to characterize both the bulk and surface chemistry of the source material and printed samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to characterize morphology, cold crystallinity, and the glass transition and melting temperatures following printing. Analysis revealed calcium carbonate-based additives which were reacted with organic ligands and potentially trace metal impurities, both before and following printing. These <b>additives</b> became <b>concentrated</b> in voids in the printed structure. This finding is important for biomedical applications as carbonate will impact subsequent cell growth on printed tissue scaffolds.

A feeding trial was conducted for 7 months in National Agricultural Cooperative Federation farm located in Anseong, Korea. Steers were assigned randomly to one of three treatments: control (without additive supplementation), treatment 1 (0. 05 % <b>additive</b> of <b>concentrate),</b> treatment 2 (0. 1 % additiveof concentrate). The results of this study showed that initial and final BW averaged 564 and 755 kg, respectively, and BW gain was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) for steers fed the additive mixture than for those fed no mixture (0. 78 and 0. 79 vs. 0. 69 kg/d, respectively). Serum aspartate aminotransferase in the T 2 treatment was decreased during the 24 to 31 months of age.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{products}} incorporating single aspects of organic production {{systems such as}} lower inputs of pesticides, food <b>additives</b> or <b>concentrated</b> animal feed is found on the food market (referred to as low-input products hereafter). In our study, we analysed how consumers react to low-input products in a purchase simulation with certified organic, conventional and low-input products. In the purchase simulations, each participant was asked to make three consecutive purchase decisions, one each for milk, yogurt and apples. The results of a cluster analysis revealed one cluster with a high preference for organic products and three clusters that featured considerable shares of low-input purchases. The latter clusters, however, were not characterised by a clear preference for low-input products. Rather, they bought mixed baskets of goods, i. e. low-input products in combination with either organic or conventional products. The low-input products in the categories milk, yogurt and apples did thus not necessarily attract the same groups of people. Interestingly, we found that most consumers who chose low-input products in the simulations usually buy those particular products in conventional quality. We conclude that in our study, we found a heterogeneous group of low-input buyers. For the organic sector, communicating the various aspects of organic production might be a promising strategy for gaining new customers. The low-input products in the purchase simulation only featured one special attribute, whereas organic products incorporate several. (C) Cambridge University Press 200...|$|R
40|$|Avascular {{necrosis}} (AVN) of the femoral head is {{a debilitating}} disease of multifactorial genesis, predominately affects young patients, and {{often leads to}} the development of secondary osteoarthritis. The evolving field of regenerative medicine offers promising treatment strategies using cells, biomaterial scaffolds, and bioactive factors, which might improve clinical outcome. Early stages of AVN with preserved structural integrity of the subchondral plate are accessible to retrograde surgical procedures, such as core decompression to reduce the intraosseous pressure and to induce bone remodeling. The <b>additive</b> application of <b>concentrated</b> bone marrow aspirates, ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stem cells, and osteogenic or angiogenic growth factors (or both) holds great potential to improve bone regeneration. In contrast, advanced stages of AVN with collapsed subchondral bone require an osteochondral reconstruction to preserve the physiological joint function. Analogously to strategies for osteochondral reconstruction in the knee, anterograde surgical techniques, such as osteochondral transplantation (mosaicplasty), matrix-based autologous chondrocyte implantation, or the use of acellular scaffolds alone, might preserve joint function and reduce the need for hip replacement. This review summarizes recent experimental accomplishments and initial clinical findings in the field of regenerative medicine which apply cells, growth factors, and matrices to address the clinical problem of AVN. © 2012 BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the effect of the feed <b>additive</b> alfalfa protein <b>concentrate</b> (APC), on pig health. The trial {{involved}} 40 crossbred gilts and 40 crossbred castrates (Polish Landrace × Polish Large White) × Duroc of 29. 0 ± 0. 5 kg initial body weight. Allocation of experimental animals was into four treatment groups: the control group (C) was fed standard mixtures, without APC addition; group E- 15 was fed a basal diet supplemented with 1. 5 % APC; and groups E- 30 and E- 30 P were fed diets with 3. 0 % APC inclusion. There were two feeding systems. In the first system, animals of groups C, E- 15, and E- 30 were fed continuously with suitable mixtures. The second feeding system was used in group E- 30 P where animals received the experimental or control mixture alternating at two-week intervals. The addition of APC supplement to diets significantly increased (P ≤ 0. 05) red blood cell indices, i. e. haematocrit (Ht), red blood cell count (RBC), and haemoglobin concentration (Hb) in growing and finishing periods. The analysis of enzyme activity demonstrated a markedly higher activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and especially alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the blood plasma of pigs fed APC supplement. This increase may indicate a negative impact of APC on the animal’s liver. A positive effect of dietary APC on blood lipid parameters was associated with a decreased level of total cholesterol and reduced low-density lipoprotein fraction. Analysis of the haematological and biochemical blood indices demonstrated that APC additive may affect animal health...|$|R
40|$|The {{lubricants}} {{are normally}} composed by base oils {{and a number}} of additives which are added to improve the performances of the final product. In this work, which is due to the collaboration between ENI S. p. A. and Prof. Casnati’s group, significant results in the application of calixarene structures to two classes of lubricant additives (viscosity index improvers and detergents) were shown. In particular, several calix[8]arene derivatives were synthesized to use as core precursors in the “arm-first" synthetic processes of star polymers for viscosity index improver applications. The use of calixarene derivatives enable the production of star polymers with a high and well-defined number of branches and endowed with a very low dispersivity of molecular weight which can originate better performances than the current commercially available viscosity index improvers of the major competitor. Several functional groups were considered to prepare reactive p-tert-butylcalix[8]arene cores to be used in living anionic polymerization. n-butyllithium was used as model of the living anionic polymer to test the outcome of the reaction of polymer insertion on the calixarene core, facilitating the analyses of the products. The calixarene derivative, which easier reacts with n-BuLi, was selected for the preparation of star polymers by using a isoprene/styrene living anionic polymer. Finally, the lubricant formulations, which include the calixarene-based star polymers or commercially available products as viscosity index improvers, were prepared and comparatively tested. In the last part of Thesis, the use of calixarenes as polycarboxylic acids to synthetize new sulfur-free detergents as lubricant additives was carried out. In this way, these calcium-based detergents can be used for the formulation of new automotive lubricants with low content of ash, phosphorus and sulfur (low SAPS). To increase the low deprotonation degree of OH groups and their capacity to complex calcium ions, a complete functionalization of the calixarene mixtures with acetic acid groups was required. Futhermore, the “one-step” synthesis of new calixarenes with alkyl chains in para positions longer than the ones already known was necessary to improve the oil solubility and stability of reverse micelles formed by the detergents. Moreover, the separation and characterization of the calixarenes were carried out to optimize their synthetic process, also on pilot scale. For our purpose, the use of p-tert-octylcalixarenes for the preparation of detergents was carried out to compare the properties of the final detergents respect {{to the use of the}} p-dodecyl calixarenes. Once achieved the functionalization of both calixarene mixtures with carboxylic acid groups, the syntheses of new calixarene-based detergents were carried out to identify the best calixarene derivative for our research goals. The synthetic process for the preparation of calixarene-based detergent having very high basicity (TBN 400) was also investigated for applications in lubricants for marine engines. In addition, with the aim of testing the calixarene-based detergents in automotive lubricants, several <b>additive</b> packages (<b>concentrated</b> mixture of <b>additives)</b> containing our detergents were prepared. Using these packages the corresponding automotive lubricants can be formulated. Besides, a lubricant containing commercial calcium alkylbenzene-sulfonates detergents was prepared to compare its detergency properties with those of the calixarene-based oils...|$|R
40|$|Why do we age? Most organisms undergo senescence, {{a process}} {{involving}} progressive functional decline culminating in death, yet this widespread phenomenon remains largely mysterious. A number of genetic {{and environmental factors}} affect longevity, the best conserved and most widely studied of which is dietary restriction (DR), a reduction of nutrient intake short of malnutrition. Since nutrient ingestion determines lifespan, any factor affecting longevity—particular food components, genetic pathways or drugs—may do so indirectly, by altering feeding behavior. This is particularly true in Drosophila, which is normally kept in conditions where food is present in excess. Moreover, since DR is applied by aging flies on two different food concentrations—diluted media are associated with an extended lifespan—animals may alter their intake {{in response to the}} change in nutrient content. Since the medium is also the only water source, this compensatory feeding would result in changes in hydration, introducing a second experimental variable. Despite these issues, Drosophila feeding behavior has classically been ignored or superficially characterized in the context of aging research, partly due to the absence of appropriate methodology. We developed two complementary assays allowing long-term measurement of food intake. Using these techniques, we present the first characterization of real-time Drosophila feeding behavior. Our results reveal gender-specific feeding trends and show that mating stimulates female appetite via the seminal Sex Peptide. Additionally, we show that ingestion is dramatically affected by food dilution or dietary <b>additives.</b> Animals fed <b>concentrated</b> media restrict their intake and are chronically thirsty. We have found that lifespan extension by classical DR paradigms is abolished in the presence of ad libitum water, challenging the long-held assumption that DR affects longevity by altering nutrient intake. We characterize a new regime that robustly prolongs lifespan irrespective of water availability, and thus likely represents a more relevant model for mammalian DR. In contrast to previous claims, demographic analysis using this paradigm indicates that DR acts not by reducing the immediate risk of death, but by slowing the accumulation of age-related damage. Our findings directly challenge current views on the mechanistic basis of DR and have broad implications for the study of aging and nutrition in model organisms. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} injection molding processing variables, resin formulation and mold material on the resulting morphology and properties of semi-crystalline and amorphous polymers in parts molded on large presses with fully developed flow. Five different polymer resins and two different coating types were investigated, and the near-surface morphology {{was found to be}} dependent on material formulation, processing parameters, and geometry. For painted TPO, changes in the near-surface rubber morphology and surface chemistry based on material and processing conditions had no significant effect on the adhesion performance. For metal plated ABS, the adhesion performance was found to be heavily dependent on the rubber surface morphology, which varied with material formulation and processing conditions. One of the most significant findings was that forged aluminum injection molding tooling had little effect on the surface morphology or adhesion performance of either polypropylene or the two TPO formulations examined, despite the five-fold increase in thermal conductivity over traditional tool steel. Surface chemistry, however, was found to be affected by cooling rate, depending on material formulation. A UV stabilizer <b>additive</b> was found <b>concentrated</b> at 2. 5 atomic percent {{on the surface of the}} aluminum molded part, but not the steel molded part, demonstrating a possible opportunity for using additives and aluminum tooling to create "designer surfaces". Processing conditions were found to have a competing role in metal plated ABS, where conditions that lowered surface stress and improved adhesion by a factor of 15 also increased the amount of bulk molded-in stress by nearly 7 %. Both factors were found to play an important role in adhesion performance due to the effect of surface stress on the quality of the resulting etch structure. The bulk stress must be minimized to due to the large mechanical and thermal mismatch between the polymer and metal layers. This work provides a more in-depth understanding of the effect of processing and material composition on morphology, surface chemistry, molded-in stress and adhesion. This will establish guidelines for future injection molded part designs to alleviate delamination failures and minimize warp, as well as contribute to modeling predictions of shrink and mechanical behavior...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} {{research}} is to develop polymeric additives based on aqueous dispersions of (meth) acrylic polymers, including polymethacrylates, polyacrylates, products of thermal decomposition of polyamide- 6 in the vegetable oil media, and low-molecular polyethylene. Decomposition of polyamide- 6 took 8 … 10 hours at the temperature of 245 … 275 °С. The mixture of low-molecular polyamides, the average molecular weight of which reached 3400 … 8600, was used both independently and as a constituent of a composite additive designated for Concrete Mix В 22, 5 (М 300). The choice of polymers is based on their availability, as they are produced by local manufacturers of chemicals. For example, low-molecular polyethylene is the by-product of high-capacity synthesis of high-pressure polyethylene. Besides low-molecular polyamides, <b>additives</b> may represent <b>concentrated</b> oligomers of ε-caprolactam generated {{in the course of}} synthesis of polyamide- 6. Therefore, the problem of disposal of by-products generated by major producers of chemicals is resolved to some extent, while the cost of the feed stock required for the manufacturing of effective additives designated for concretes goes down. The above substances are non-toxic, they do not emit any hazardous fumes {{in the course of the}} concrete mixture preparation, further evaporation and dehydration of molded concrete and reinforced concrete products. Therefore, the following conclusions can be made on the basis of the research of the influence of polymeric additives onto the properties of Concrete В 22, 5 : 1) polymeric additives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 represent plasticizing additives that decelerate the hardening of concrete mixtures and reduce the water-cement ratio by 6. 5 % (Additive 1) - 19. 4 % (Additive 5); 2) Additives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 added into the mixture in the amount of 0. 5 … 0. 7 % (weight share) improve the strength of Concrete В 22, 5 samples, if tested on the 28 day of hardening (see Table 1) in the dry-hardening mode, if compared to the benchmark sample, by 0. 6 % (Additive 1),by 9. 1 % (Additive 2), by 22. 4 % (Additive 3), by 24. 8 % (Additive 4), and by 28. 2 % (Additive 5); 3) polymeric additives improve the water resistance of Concrete В 22, 5 by 2. 56 times (Additive 1), by 7. 5 times (Additive 2),by 26, 2 times (Additive 4), by 191 … 195 times (Additive 5), if compared to the benchmark sample; 4) the optimal composite additive that increases the time period of stiffening of the cement grout, improves the water resistance and the compressive strength of concrete, represents the composition of polyacrylates and polymethacrylates, products of thermal decomposition of polyamide- 6 and low-molecular polyethylene in the weight ratio of 1 : 1 : 0. 5.
