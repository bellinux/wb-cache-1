The box contained an instruction manual, reference card with controls and a cassette tape containing the game soundtrack, thus allowing even players without sound cards to enjoy the music.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} extent and types of {{cigarette}} <b>advertising</b> <b>materials</b> in stores and to assess tobacco company compliance with the 1998  Master Settlement Agreement (MSA).  DESIGN—A cross-sectional analysis of {{a random sample of}} 586  stores that sold cigarettes.  SETTING— US state of California.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Trained data collectors classified cigarette <b>advertising</b> <b>materials</b> by type (signs, displays, functional items), location (interior or exterior), and placement (below 3  feet (1  m) or near candy).  RESULTS—California retail outlets featured 17. 2  (SD 16. 1) tobacco <b>advertising</b> <b>materials</b> on average, and 94 % of stores featured at least some advertising. About 85 % of these were within 4  feet (1. 3  m) of the counter. About 50 % of the stores had ads at or below 3  feet, and 23 % had cigarette product displays next to candy. In violation of the MSA, 3 % of stores featured signs with cartoons and 11 % had large exterior signs.  CONCLUSIONS—Tobacco companies are aggressively using stores to market cigarettes. Moreover, the spirit of the MSA—to protect children from cigarette advertising—has not been realised. Future studies should monitor industry use of this venue and assess the impact of exposure to cigarette <b>advertising</b> <b>materials</b> in stores on adult smokers and youth.    Keywords: advertising; point-of-sale advertising; tobacco industr...|$|R

500|$|According to The, in a 1970s interview, Ouw Peh Tjoa was {{released}} in 1934. Newspaper advertisements show the film being screened by February 1935. [...] The film mostly targeted ethnic Chinese audiences. <b>Advertising</b> <b>material,</b> however, emphasised the use of spoken Malay and described the film as [...] "full of astonishments and all forms of magic fights"; through these action sequences, Ouw Peh Tjoa proved popular among native audiences. The film was exported to Singapore, part of the Straits Settlements, {{where there was a}} large ethnic Chinese population.|$|E
500|$|After Sanger's departure, Wikipedia was {{managed by}} Wales and a burgeoning online community; {{although}} he thought advertising a possibility, the Wikipedia community {{was opposed to}} business development and Internet marketing was difficult {{at the end of}} 2002.

Live action shorts were also used in the advertisement of [...] focusing on the Spartan supersoldiers of the Halo universe. Two shorts, The Birth of a Spartan and Deliver Hope were made, again to appeal to customers who were unfamiliar with the series.|$|E

A series of Adam Hat matchbooks from 1942 was a contest for people {{to try to win}} a free hat. Each matchbook in the series had a celebrity photo, and six names below the photo. If one of those names was the celebrity in the photo, then that was a winning matchbook.|$|R

500|$|Microsoft {{considers}} the series [...] "the next step" [...] between <b>advertising</b> <b>material</b> and a full-length film after {{the failure of}} a previous effort, and aimed to produce a standalone series that could be enjoyed without necessarily playing the games. The budget for the series was almost USD$10million, Microsoft's largest investment in a live-action promotion. Director Stewart Hendler said [...] "We're either the best-funded web series of all time, a sort of mid-road healthy TV pilot, or a super-low-budget movie." [...] When the idea of directing a video game based web series was pitched to Hendler he declined, saying he was not interested in video game adaptions unless the subject was Halo. Hendler was already a fan of the series, having read the novels and played the games.|$|E
500|$|Fritz the Cat was {{the first}} {{animated}} feature film to receive an X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The film's distributor capitalized on the rating in the film's <b>advertising</b> <b>material,</b> which touted the film as being [...] "X rated and animated!" [...] Released on 12 April 1972, it opened simultaneously in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. The film {{went on to become}} a worldwide hit, grossing over $100 million (USD) and was the most successful independent animated feature ever. The film is credited with extending Crumb's reputation beyond the underground comix scene. Crumb disliked how the film presented the sexual content and politics, denouncing Fritz's dialogue in the final sequences of the film, which includes a quote from The Beatles song [...] "The End", as [...] "red-neck and fascistic". Following the film's release, The People's Comics published the story [...] "Fritz the Cat 'Superstar'", in which Crumb satirized Bakshi and Krantz. Crumb portrayed Fritz in a script conference for a fictional sequel Fritz Goes to India. The strip ends with a neurotic ex-girlfriend killing Fritz. She stabs him in the back of the head with an ice pick due to Fritz's overt sexism.|$|E
