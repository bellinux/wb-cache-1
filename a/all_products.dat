5|$|The Holliday {{junctions}} in {{homologous recombination}} are between identical or nearly identical sequences, {{leading to a}} symmetric arrangement of sequences around the central junction. This allows a branch migration process to occur where the strands move through the junction point. Cleavage, or resolution, of the Holliday junction can occur in two ways. Cleavage of the original set of strands leads to two molecules that may show gene conversion but not chromosomal crossover, while cleavage of the other set of two strands causes the resulting recombinant molecules to show crossover. <b>All</b> <b>products,</b> regardless of cleavage, are heteroduplexes {{in the region of}} Holliday junction migration.|$|E
5|$|Eidos's German {{branch and}} the KMF agency handled {{marketing}} for Lara Croft. Eidos marketing manager David Burton oversaw marketing efforts, which attempted {{to portray the}} character as attractive and pleasant. However, interaction with the press, especially those in Europe, resulted in less clothing depicted in promotional images. Concerned with diluting Croft's personality, Eidos avoided products it felt did not fit the character. Ian Livingstone, Eidos's product acquisition director, commented that the company declines most merchandising proposals. He stated that Eidos primarily focused on game development and viewed such promotion outside video games as exposure for the character. Following Square Enix's acquisition, Eidos's marketing duties were transferred to the Square Enix Europe subsidiary. As part of the second reboot, Crystal Dynamics planned to align <b>all</b> <b>products,</b> promotions, and media ventures with its {{new version of the}} character.|$|E

5|$|Although Crash! Boom! Bang! saw chart success (No.1 in Sweden, No.2 in Germany & Australia, No.3 in the UK), it sold fewer copies {{than had}} their {{previous}} albums. EMI America {{were reluctant to}} release the album, and instead promoted a shortened 10-track Favorites CD in association with McDonald's. The Favorites of Crash! Boom! Bang! CD reportedly sold about 1 million copies. It was noted by journalists that the McDonald's promotion CD and other CDs by Tina Turner, Garth Brooks and Elton John, led to US music retailers of the time being unhappy with the promotion on several fronts, including that it bypassed established music stores and {{that the price of}} the CD was way below normal wholesale costs. Some stores refused to sell the albums published by EMI, with one major chain protesting by temporarily pulling <b>all</b> <b>products</b> from CEMA (EMI's distribution wing) out of its sales and ad campaigns. Relations with EMI's North American subsidiary, never on the best of terms, collapsed after the release of this album. Crash! Boom! Bang! became the last Roxette release EMI would issue in the US, until Greatest Hits was released in 2011 on subsidiary label Capitol Records.|$|E
5|$|The Congo Free State was a {{corporate}} state in Central Africa privately owned by King Leopold II of Belgium founded and recognised by the Berlin Conference of 1885. What {{would later become}} Abir Company territory was the land between the Lopori and Maringa river basins, tributaries of the Congo River, {{in the north of}} the state. The local populace here were yam and cassava farmers who engaged in trade with river fishermen and pygmy hunters. In 1885 a force of the Manyema people, followers of Tippu Tip, the Swahili-Zanzibari slave trader, arrived {{at the head of the}} Lopori River from Stanley Falls. They took hostages from nearby villages to ransom in return for ivory. By 1892 they had enrolled local people into their army and controlled the entire eastern half of the basin. The Free State was concerned by this development and in 1889 had enacted the Monopoly Act which declared that <b>all</b> <b>products</b> in the area were to be under their jurisdiction alone. The Free State also began a campaign to drive the slavers, traders and the Manyema from the region, the first stage of which was the establishment of a supply post at Basankusu in May 1890. The campaign would be long but eventually successful and the entire basin was under Free State control by 1898.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} {{the set of the}} {{equivalence}} classes of multifoliate structures is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of equivalence classes of finite complete projective systems of vector space epimorphisms. After that we give the complete description of <b>all</b> <b>product</b> preserving bundle functors on the categories of multifibered and multifoliate manifolds. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 58 A 05, 58 A 32. Key words and phrases: product preserving bundle functors, multifoliate structures, projective systems. In the middle 1980 s Eck [2], Kainz and Michor [3], Luciano [8] described <b>all</b> <b>product</b> preserving bundle functors on the category of smooth manifolds in terms of Weil bundles [14] (see also [5]). In 1996 Mikulski [9] classified <b>all</b> <b>product</b> preserving bundle functors on fibered manifolds.
