Due to poor weather conditions only 3./JG 1 was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> formation at first, claiming one B-17.

5|$|After Stillman's defeat on May 14, {{the regulars}} and militia {{continued}} up the Rock River {{to search for}} Black Hawk. The militiamen became discouraged at not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> British Band. When they heard about the Indian raids, many deserted {{so that they could}} return home to defend their families. As morale plummeted, Governor Reynolds asked his militia officers to vote on whether to continue the campaign. General Whiteside, disgusted with the performance of his men, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of disbanding. Most of Whiteside's brigade disbanded at Ottawa, Illinois, on May 28. About 300 men, including Abraham Lincoln, agreed to remain in the field for twenty more days until a new militia force could be organized.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the various}} {{versions}} and changes, the 1798 version {{is the most}} regular of the editions. The story describes Joan from her first appearance at Vaucouleurs until the Dauphin Charles VII is crowned at Rheims. The rest of the events are described in flashbacks throughout the first half. As the story begins, an 18-year-old Joan travels to Vaucouleurs, home of Robert de Baudricourt, with her uncle Claude. She arrives searching for the Dauphin and meets Charles Dunois as the general tries to raise troops for France's defence. He helps her through Lorraine to Chinon while explaining her background and life's story to the general. She tells of her family, her natural living, {{and the effects of}} the soldiers who brought war to France told to her by a French soldier named Conrade. Of these various incidents, the English's massacring French prisoners at the Battle of Agincourt and the starvation of the people of Rouen during a siege are mentioned. They finally arrive at Chinon where they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> French court.|$|E

5|$|United {{started the}} first leg the better of the two sides, and {{although}} Inter improved in the second half, neither side was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> net during the match, and United took a 0–0 draw back to Old Trafford. The draw was also United's 20th match since their last defeat in the UEFA Champions League, breaking Ajax's 19-match record that had stood for 13 years. The lack of an away goal at the San Siro meant that United {{could not afford to}} concede a goal {{in the event of a}} draw. A fourth-minute headed goal from Nemanja Vidić, however, got the home side off to a good start, and Cristiano Ronaldo doubled United's lead fourminutes into the second half. Shots from both Zlatan Ibrahimović and Adriano hit the frame of the Manchester United goal in either half of the match, but they were unable to find the back of the net, and the 2–0 result sent the English champions through to the next stage of the competition.|$|E
5|$|In the Rogue Cut version, Rogue's role is more consequential, and the {{narrative}} is more complex: When seeing Stryker causes Wolverine's consciousness to phase {{between past and}} future—resulting in his claws being extended, injuring Kitty Pryde—the Professor talks {{about the need for}} Wolverine to have more time back in 1973. Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the Professor's school, the one place where the Professor's mind can't reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. With the Professor and Magneto, he does so—at the cost of his own life—and Rogue is taken to where the mutants are making their last stand, where she takes over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand, which got stuck in the X-Jet after the Sentinel tried to prevent the Professor, Magneto and Rogue from escaping the incinerated remains of the X-Mansion. It also includes a scene where Mystique visits the X-Mansion at night while Charles and Logan are sleeping. She revisits her previous romance with Beast but leaves very early the next morning and breaks Cerebro in order to prevent Charles from finding her.|$|E

25|$|The {{flight was}} {{chartered}} by Aker Kværner from Stavanger Airport, Sola via Sørstokken to transport its employees from there and Stord to Molde Airport, Årø. An investigation {{was carried out}} by the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN). It was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> underlying cause of the spoiler malfunction. However, it found that when the captain selected the emergency braking the anti-lock braking system was disabled. This caused hydroplaning {{to the point where the}} water under the tyres turned to steam, subsequently reducing brake performance. The damage was aggravated through a minimal run-off zone at each end of the runway.|$|E

This was fine for Gun Laying, but in order to be useful in the interception role, the system had to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> target anywhere in front of the fighter. The team began to consider different ways to scan the radar beam to produce a search function.|$|E
25|$|Atlantic Airways Flight 670 was a crash {{following}} a runway overrun of a British Aerospace 146-200A at 07:32 on 10 October 2006. The aircraft's spoilers failed to deploy, causing inefficient braking. The Atlantic Airways aircraft {{fell over the}} edge past the runway at slow speed and burst into flames, killing four of sixteen people on board. The investigation was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> underlying cause of the spoilers malfunction. However, it found that disemployment of the anti-lock braking system caused hydroplaning and subsequent reduced braking ability. The damage was aggravated through a minimal safety zone surrounding the runway.|$|E
25|$|As most cave diving {{is done in}} an {{environment}} where there is no free surface with breathable air allowing an above-water exit, it is critically important to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> way out before the breathing gas runs out. This is ensured by the use of a continuous guideline between the dive team and outside of the flooded cave, and diligent planning and monitoring of gas supplies. Two basic types of guideline are used: permanent lines, and temporary lines. Permanent lines may include a main line starting near the entrance/exit, and side lines or branch lines, and are marked to indicate the direction to the nearest exit. Temporary lines include exploration lines and jump lines.|$|E

25|$|Large fruit-eating {{birds in}} {{tropical}} forests depend on trees which bear fruit {{at different times}} of the year. Many species, such as pigeons and hornbills, {{have been shown to be}} able to decide upon foraging areas according to the time of the year. Birds that show food hoarding behavior have also shown the ability to recollect the locations of food caches. Nectarivorous birds such as hummingbirds also optimize their foraging by keeping track of the locations of good and bad flowers. Studies of western scrub jays also suggest that birds may be able to plan ahead. They cache food according to future needs and risk of not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> food on subsequent days.|$|E
25|$|The mystery {{begins to}} unravel. Alex and Chase decide that {{whatever}} the Tenandrome found, Lesha Tanner had found it first, 200 years before.

A collection of Candles' poems, Rumors of Earth, had been in Uncle Gabe’s bedroom when Alex returned, and was open to that poem. Gabriel Benedict must have had the same insight. Alex is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> university researcher who helped his uncle work with the clues in Candles’ poem and who identifies a location about 1,300 light years into the Veiled Lady as the primary locus of search.|$|E

In the end, Seiya manages to wound the god Apollo. The conclusion of the actual fight between the two is not depicted; instead, the climax of the movie cuts to a peaceful scene where Seiya apparently becomes reacquainted with Saori Kido. It was explained in the Japanese DVD audio commentary with director Shigeyasu Yamauchi that, since Seiya's and Saori's greatest strength was their love and trust for each other, Apollo erased their memories so that they would never again be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> will to rebel against the gods.|$|E
