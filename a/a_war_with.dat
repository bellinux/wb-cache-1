5|$|After Dumouriez's {{victory at}} Jemappes in November 1792, the French armies rapidly overran {{most of the}} Austrian Netherlands. Rather than driving the Austrians {{to the west bank}} of the Rhine River, Dumouriez and the French {{government}} became preoccupied with <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Dutch Republic. During the breathing space offered by her enemy, Austria assembled an army under the Prince of Coburg and struck back. After a French covering force was routed by Coburg at Aldenhoven, Dumouriez began gathering his army for a counterstroke.|$|E
5|$|Halo: Reach is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Bungie {{and published by}} Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360 home video game console. The sixth installment in the Halo series, Reach was released worldwide in September 2010. The game {{takes place in the}} year 2552, where humanity is locked in <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the alien Covenant. Players control Noble Six, a member of an elite supersoldier squad, when the human world known as Reach falls under Covenant attack.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, the Senate {{took up the}} {{question}} of ending the joint occupancy of the Oregon Territory with Great Britain. Lewis Cass, a senator from Michigan, supported an immediate termination of the joint occupation agreement and maintained that <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the British over the matter was inevitable. Crittenden disagreed, and insisted that Britain be given two years notice before the joint occupation of the territory was ended {{in order to allow}} time for a diplomatic resolution. Ultimately, Crittenden's position prevailed, and a compromise with Britain was effected, setting the dividing line between the two nations' claims at the 49th parallel north.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of the Austrian Empire's war with the Ottoman Empire, and similar Russian Empire's war, Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski, {{attempted}} to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Ottomans as an opportunity to strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This line of reasoning gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski.|$|E
5|$|Libya's prompt retreat {{took many}} {{observers}} by surprise. One reason lay in Gaddafi's desire {{to host the}} OAU's annual conference in 1982 and assume the organization's presidency. Another was Libya's difficult situation in Chad where, without some popular and international acceptance for Libyan presence, {{it would have been}} difficult to take the concrete risk of causing <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Egypt and Sudan, with US support. Gaddafi had not renounced the goals he had set for Chad, but he had to find a new Chadian leader, as Goukouni had proved himself unreliable.|$|E
5|$|Liubartas (baptized Dymitr) was Gediminas' {{youngest}} son. In {{the early}} 1320s {{he married a}} daughter of Andrew of Galicia and ruled Lutsk in eastern Volhynia. After Andrew's and his brother Lev of Galicia's deaths about 1323, Galicia–Volhynia experienced a power vacuum. Rather than promoting Liubartas and risking <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Poland, Gediminas married his daughter Eufemija to Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia. War with Poland was thereby postponed until 1340. The Galicia–Volhynia Wars were settled after 1370, when Poland received Galicia, while Lithuania retained Volhynia. Liubartas died around 1385, having ruled Volhynia for roughly sixty years. He had three sons.|$|E

5|$|Michelangelo, {{who was not}} {{primarily}} a painter but a sculptor, was reluctant {{to take on the}} work. Also, he was occupied with a very large sculptural commission for the pope's own tomb. The pope was adamant, leaving Michelangelo no choice but to accept. But <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the French broke out, diverting the attention of the pope, and Michelangelo fled from Rome to continue sculpting. The tomb sculptures, however, were never to be finished because in 1508 the pope returned to Rome victorious and summoned Michelangelo to begin work on the ceiling. The contract was signed on 10 May 1508.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|Reforms became {{possible}} {{again in}} the late 1780s. In {{the context of the}} wars being waged against the Ottoman Empire by both the Austrian Empire and the Russian Empire, Poniatowski tried to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Ottomans as an opportunity to strengthen the Commonwealth. Catherine gave permission for the next Sejm to be confederated, as she considered some form of limited military alliance with Poland against the Ottomans might be useful.|$|E

During the late 1670s Greek adventurer Constance Phaulkon arrived in Siam. He sailed to the country from Java on a British East India Company vessel and, heeding orders from his employer, promptly embarked {{on a mission to}} smuggle arms to Singora. His escapade ended in failure when he was shipwrecked.|$|E

Finally, the Avatar visits the Ethereal Void, a strange world with floating, glowing pathways and no map. Eventually, the Avatar discovers that Mayor Patterson is the traitor and destroys the blackrock dome.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{set about}} creating a regional alliance against Rosas, sending a delegation to the region led by Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later the Marquis of Paraná), who held plenipotentiary authority. He was assisted by José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later the Viscount of Rio Branco). Brazil signed a treaty with Bolívia in which Bolivia agreed to strengthen its border defenses to deter any attack by Rosas, though it declined to contribute troops to <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Argentina.|$|E

5|$|The Cekaracecekaramalai written {{during the}} Aryacakravarti rule in Jaffna {{asserts that the}} direct {{ancestors}} of the Kings belonged {{to a group of}} 512 Ariyar (a Brahmin priestly caste) of the Pasupata sect of the Rameswaram Hindu temple. The source also claims that two out of the 512 were selected as Kings of Ariyars. It also explains that a direct ancestor of the kings was a scribe in the Pandyan kingdom and was called during <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> other kingdoms to assist the king, and that the ancestors of the kings fought in wars against kings in the Hoysala and Karnataka.|$|E
5|$|The {{authors of}} War Memorandum (Eastern) 1920 divided <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Japan into three phases. In the first phase, the {{garrison}} of Singapore would defend the fortress while the fleet {{made its way}} from home waters to Singapore. Next, the fleet would sail from Singapore and relieve or recapture Hong Kong. The final phase would see the fleet blockade Japan and force it to accept terms.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} envisaged that <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Japan {{would have}} three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would {{make its way}} from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms. The idea of invading Japan was rejected as impractical, but British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. Aware {{of the impact of}} a blockade on an island nation {{at the heart of a}} maritime empire, they felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E

5|$|The {{potential}} for {{conflict between the}} Ottomans and Venice was still present, as evidenced in 1638, when a Venetian fleet attacked and destroyed a fleet of Barbary pirates that had sought protection in the Ottoman port of Valona, bombarding {{the city in the}} process. Sultan Murad IV was enraged: he threatened to execute all Venetians in the Empire, and put an embargo on Venetian trade. Eventually, and given that the Ottomans were still engaged in <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Persians, the situation was defused with the Republic paying the Ottomans an indemnity of 250,000 sequins.|$|E
