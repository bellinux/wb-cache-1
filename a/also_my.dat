25|$|I {{lived through}} the whole of it, being of an age to {{comprehend}} events, and giving my attention to {{them in order to}} know the exact truth about them. It was <b>also</b> <b>my</b> fate to be an exile from my country for twenty years after my command at Amphipolis; and being present with both parties, and more especially with the Peloponnesians by reason of my exile, I had leisure to observe affairs somewhat particularly.|$|E
25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was <b>also</b> <b>my</b> godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E

25|$|James S. Donnelly, Jr., a {{historian}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, {{wrote in his}} book, Landlord and Tenant in Nineteenth-century Ireland:I would draw the following broad conclusion: at a fairly early stage of the Great Famine the government's abject failure to stop or even slow down the clearances (evictions) contributed {{in a major way}} to enshrining the idea of English state-sponsored genocide in Irish popular mind. Or perhaps one should say in the Irish mind, for this was a notion that appealed to many educated and discriminating men and women, and not only to the revolutionary minority...And it is <b>also</b> <b>my</b> contention that while genocide was not in fact committed, what happened during {{and as a result of}} the clearances had the look of genocide to a great many Irish.|$|E

[...] "It's been awhile since I've performed in front of a live audience, and it was great to flex that old theater acting muscle. It was <b>also</b> <b>my</b> first experience with a television sitcom." ...|$|E

500|$|Renee Kovacs, a [...] "scholar and self-stated Assyriologist", {{said the}} statue {{depicted}} neither Ashurbanipal or Gilgamesh, {{but rather a}} Mesopotamian [...] "protective figure, like a guard." [...] Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took artistic liberties and attempted to incorporate the various aspects of Assyrian culture, from its hunting mastery to its admiration for writing. He said of the sculpture: The piece has authentic qualities to it, but it is <b>also</b> <b>my</b> statue.... With the earrings and the clothing and the hair and his daggers, it is Ashurbanipal. But {{in the choice of}} (stance), {{the fact that he is}} holding a tablet and a lion, that is mine. I wanted myself to be represented in the piece.|$|E
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Final Fantasy VIII (1999), {{unlike that of}} VI and VII, did not include {{character}} themes, as Uematsu felt {{they would not be}} effective. In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's <b>also</b> <b>my</b> intention to put various types of music into one game". Although the idea had not been used in the previous game, he thought a ballad would closely relate to the theme and characters of VIII, and composed [...] "Eyes on Me", performed by Faye Wong. The song was released as a single, while Square produced soundtrack, orchestral, and piano albums for the game's music.|$|E
500|$|Spinosaurus {{appeared}} in the 2001 film Jurassic Park III, replacing Tyrannosaurus as the main antagonist. The film's consulting paleontologist John R. Horner was quoted as saying: [...] "If we base the ferocious factor {{on the length of}} the animal, there was nothing that ever lived on this planet that could match this creature [...] <b>Also</b> <b>my</b> hypothesis is that T-rex was actually a scavenger rather than a killer. Spinosaurus was really the predatory animal." [...] (He has since retracted the statement about T. Rex being a scavenger.) [...] In the film, Spinosaurus was portrayed as larger and more powerful than Tyrannosaurus: in a scene depicting a battle between the two resurrected predators, Spinosaurus emerges victorious by biting the tyrannosaur's neck. In the fourth film Jurassic World, there is a nod to this fight where the T-Rex smashes through the skeleton of a Spinosaurus in the climatic fight {{near the end of the}} film.|$|E

500|$|Nobuo Uematsu's usual {{influences}} include Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Simon and Garfunkel, and Elton John. In {{regard to}} Final Fantasy VIII, Uematsu did not {{prefer to use}} multiple sources to find MIDI instruments—"I could be {{coming up with a}} great melody in the very moment"—instead using a Roland SC-88 synthesizer for the entire score. Uematsu wrote notes based on character designs and screenplays, creating a general picture of the pieces' moods. He could not express a character's emotions solely with plot, instead using images of appearance and attire—"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" [...] In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's <b>also</b> <b>my</b> intention to put various types of music into one game".|$|E
500|$|On 2 January 1939, Holloway {{married a}} 25-year-old actress and former chorus dancer named Violet Marion Lane (1913–1997) {{and they moved}} to Marylebone. [...] Violet {{was born into a}} working-class family from Leeds. Her mother was Scottish, and her civil {{engineer}} father, Alfred Lane, was a Yorkshireman. [...] Holloway's second marriage lasted over 40years until his death in 1982. Although he was a client of the Aza Agency in London, Violet effectively managed Holloway's career, and no project was taken on without her approval. In his autobiography, Holloway said of her, [...] "I suppose I am committing lawful bigamy. Not only is she my wife, lover, mother, cook, chauffeuse, private secretary, house keeper, hostess, electrician, business manager, critic, handy woman, she is <b>also</b> <b>my</b> best friend." [...] Together, they had one son, Julian, who also became an actor and is best known for appearing in the Carry On films. [...] Julian had a brief relationship with Patricia Neal's daughter Tessa Dahl which produced a daughter, the model and author Sophie Dahl.|$|E
500|$|A washed-up former pilot {{called out}} of {{retirement}} by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And {{he was the kind}} of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. I would like to have a few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but <b>also</b> <b>my</b> will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E

500|$|Sebastian {{reflected}} on his song's popularity, [...] "I guess its success {{is due to}} it being a well-written pop ballad, coupled {{with the fact that}} it's perfectly suited to my voice, and <b>also</b> <b>my</b> back-story... It doesn't take a genius to realise that the show was mostly responsible for the songs enormity but still, I'm glad I was the guy standing there at the end singing it". In a review for Sebastian's fifth number one single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] in 2010 The Vines Tim Byron said [...] "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] was [...] "heavily associated with the climax of the show, and thus [...] pre-packaged meanings and associations that other songs will not ... something of the joy of music, of its eternal mystery, gets leached out in the process". Byron felt there was considerable [...] "controversy over whether to give ARIA awards to people like Guy Sebastian" [...] due to concerns about the artist's credibility. Byron added [...] "But it's hard to argue that Guy Sebastian's continued success, seven years later, {{has much to do with}} Australian Idol.....even his 'brand recognition' will have faded by now.....If he is still successful, it's more and more because of his musical talent." ...|$|E
500|$|Vernon {{recorded}} his lines {{in a separate}} recording studio {{than most of the}} album. Vernon described the studio as a [...] "tiny black room". He would record a line in the room, and then shortly later West would come in and play back what was recorded, and then discuss what needed to be changed. They repeated that process a few times until the song was finished. Vernon expressed a positive opinion of working with West, and though he called West demanding in some ways, he appreciated West's enthusiasm for music and the creativity produced by the recording sessions. The song was recorded around the death of Michael Jackson and the event had an effect of the recording crew of the song, and certain aspects of the song are influences by personal events that affected West throughout the years. In an interview with MTV, West said that the song was going to be last featured on the album, and commented that [...] "emotionally it just fit the crescendo of everything that I was saying and what I wanted to say to this girl. And it's <b>also</b> <b>my</b> favorite eight bars that I've ever written in my life. I think it's one of the greatest pieces of writing." ...|$|E
500|$|Regular series {{composer}} Nobuo Uematsu {{wrote the}} soundtrack for Final Fantasy VIII. He tried to base the songs {{off of the}} emotional content of when they would be played, asserting that expressing the emotions he desires {{is more important than}} improving skills: [...] "I {{think it will be a}} shame if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game". He could not determine a character's emotions solely based on the plot, instead using images of appearance and attire—"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" [...] In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's <b>also</b> <b>my</b> intention to put various types of music into one game". The absence of character themes found in the previous two games was due to Uematsu finding those of Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a [...] "highlight" [...] in the game, but he found Final Fantasy VIII only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the [...] "Eyes on Me" [...] theme.|$|E

500|$|Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "Ratatouille is the most {{straightforward}} and formulaic picture to date from Pixar Animation Studios, but it is also among the most enchanting and touching." [...] Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The Pixar magic continues with Brad Bird's Ratatouille, a gorgeous, wonderfully inventive computer-animated comedy." [...] Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "Fresh family fun. Although there are those slightly noxious images of rodents scampering around a kitchen, the movie doesn't stoop to kid-pandering jokes based on back talk and bodily gases." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "A film as rich as a sauce béarnaise, as refreshing as a raspberry sorbet, and a lot less predictable than the damn food metaphors and adjectives all us critics will churn out to describe it. OK, one more and then I'll be done: it's yummy." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Ratatouille never overwhelms, even though it's stocked with action, romance, historical content, family drama and serious statements about the creation of art." [...] Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "From the moment Remy enters, crashing, to the final happy fadeout, Ratatouille parades the brio and depth that set Pixar apart from and above other animation studios." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A lot of animated movies have inspired sequels, notably Shrek, but Brad Bird's Ratatouille is the first one that made me positively desire one." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Had Bird gone the safe route, he would have robbed us of a great new cartoon figure in Remy, who {{like the rest of the}} film is rendered with animation that is at once fanciful and life-like. It's <b>also</b> <b>my</b> pick for Pixar's best." ...|$|E
