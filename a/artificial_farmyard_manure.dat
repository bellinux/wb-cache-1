40|$|A case–control {{study of}} the factors {{associated}} with {{the risk of a}} bovine tuberculosis (TB) breakdown in cattle herds was undertaken within the randomized badger culling trial (RBCT). TB breakdowns occurring prior to the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in three RBCT triplets were eligible to be cases; controls were selected from the same RBCT area. Data from 151 case farms and 117 control farms were analysed using logistic regression. The strongest factors associated with an increased TB risk were movement of cattle onto the farm from markets or farm sales, operating a farm over multiple premises and the use of either covered yard or ‘other’ housing types. Spreading <b>artificial</b> fertilizers or <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> on grazing land were both associated with decreased risk.

We sampled two long term field trials (8 and 16 years) on silt loam soil, with continuous amendment of dairy <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> (FYM) and 6 types of organic waste (VFG, BIO), municipal solid waste (MSW), sludge (GWS) or organic farm waste (CMC 1, CMC 2) composts. Soil P availability was measured as 0. 01 M CaCl 2 extractable P (P-CaCl 2) and hot water extractable P (HWP) and fresh subsamples were used to conduct a leaching experiment in unsaturated conditions in the laboratory. Since the P fertilization history was not equal among the treatments, P leaching concentrations (TP) were standardized with the total P content of the soil (Ptot). P-CaCl 2, HWP and the P leaching experiment revealed that in long term <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> amended soils, more P becomes available and is susceptible to leaching than in long term VFG, BIO, MSW, CMC 1 and CMC 2 compost amended soils.

Densities of phosphate dissolving bacteria and Pseudomonas spp. in biofertilized rhizosphere were always higher {{in the presence of}} <b>farmyard</b> <b>manuring</b> (25 or 50 m 3 /fed.) compared to chemical fertilizer under weed control treatments. The mulch treatments (rice straw, black and white plastic) recorded a marked positive effect on the counts of tested microorganisms in the rhizosphere as compared to butralin herbicide and unweeded control treatment. Biofertilizers associated with <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> at the rate of 50 m 3 /fed under hand hoeing treatment, yielded higher fresh weight and number of nodules in pea plants. On the other hand, presence of weeds reduced fresh weight and number of nodules, seed index, number of pods per plant and pod yield per fed. Application of different weed control treatments caused a significant reduction in number and dry weight of weeds. The best weed control was obtained by black plastic mulch, followed by hand hoeing and rice straw mulch treatments. Associating biofertilizer with <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> at rate of 50 m 3 /fed exhibited the greatest pod yield and significant increase in the fresh and dry weight of seeds when compared with <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> at rate of 25 m 3 /fed. and chemical fertilizer application under weed control treatments. The highest concentrations of N, P, K, Zn and Mn elements in pea seeds were achieved, due to combined action of biofertilizer and 50 m 3 /fed. of <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> under controlling weeds by hand hoeing treatment...|$|R

Tobacco waste gathered from cigarette industry were composted and applied to the soil together with <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure.</b> lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. capitata) was grown as test plant. No mineral fertilizers or pestisides were applied. The effects of composted tobacco wastes and <b>farmyard</b> <b>manures</b> on soil physical properties and lettuce yield were investigated. All application rates provided increasing effects on soil’s physical properties at different percentages. Also, similar effects were determined for lettuce yield.

40|$|In {{order to}} evalutate the efficieny {{of green and}} <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> and biofertilizers either {{separated}} or integrated on nitrogen dynamics in soil, leaves and grains in corn (Zea mays L.), an experiment was conducted at 2009 cropping season. Experiment was arranged in split split plot based on randomized complete block design with three replicates. Main plots were three levels of green manure (consisting of control, berseem clover and barley) and sub plots were different levels of green manure residuals (including full and half clipping and no-clipping). Different levels of integrated fertilizers (including, 1 - control; 2 - recommended NPK as 250, 150 and 100 kg urea, superphosphate triple and potassium sulphat ha- 1, respectively; 3 - 50 % NPK 4 - 15 Mg <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> (FM) + 50 % NPK ha- 1; 5 - biofertilizer (BF) + 50 % NPK; 6 - 15 Mg FM + BF ha- 1; 7 - 15 Mg FM + 50 %NPK ha- 1 + BF, were the sub sub plots. Results indicated that green manures (both clover and barley) significantly increased soil nitrogen up to 23 percent. Leaves and seed nitrogen however, increased in clover treated plots (15 and 12 %, respectively) compared with barley treated plots. Also <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> + 50 % NPK, biofertilizer + 50 % NPK, and integration of <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> + biofertilizer + 50 % NPK, showed the best performance in (up to 32. 9 %) terms of nitrogen dynamics compared to recommended NPK...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of different soil moisture conservation practices on evapotranspiration and growth of young tea (Camellia sinensis L.) plants. Treatments were: control (T 1), <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> at 62 tons ha - 1 (T 2), <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> at 124 tons ha - 1 (T 3), pine-needles at 12 tons ha - 1 (T 4), pine-needles at 25 tons ha - 1 (T 5) and tea inter-cropped with maize (T 6). Moisture content of the soil was determined upto 0. 3 m depth by gravimetric method. Plant growth was recorded at 15 - 30 days intervals. Resulting values of evapo transpiration of young tea plants ranged from 0. 50 mm day - 1 for (T 5) to 4. 77 mm day - 1 for (T 2). Double dose of <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> (T 3) caused 42 % increase in plant height compared to control (T 1). One drawback of tea cultivation is that its first yield is delayed i. e. after 5 years, which could be compensated by inter-cropping...|$|R
40|$|Conventional mineral {{fertilizer}} {{was compared}} with alternative organic fertilizers for the crop of head cabbage and cucumber. There were seven different treatments: Agormin (an organo-mineral fertilizer), Agro (made from poultry bedding and molasses), conventional <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure,</b> compost, Dvorecky agroferm (dried, aerobically-fermented <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure),</b> mineral fertilizer, and an unfertilized control. All treatments were applied at rates providing {{approximately the same}} level of nutrients. The level of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured by FRAP assay immediately after harvest. Average value of TAC in fresh cabbage was 23660 mg GA. 100 g- 1 in the year 2005 and 29527 mg GA. 100 g- 1 in the year 2006. Average value of TAC in field cucumber was 12532 mg GA. 100 g- 1 in the year 2005 and 10460 mg GA. 100 g- 1 in the year 2006.
