30|$|Acute PID, in {{addition}} to antibiotic therapy, may benefit from surgical or laparoscopic intervention. The old concept that surgery during <b>acute</b> <b>pelvic</b> <b>infection</b> results in greater injury than waiting for the infection to subside has been recently challenged. It {{is much easier to}} operate on acute adhesions than on the dense adhesions that obliterate the normal anatomic relationships and develop neovasularization. Laparoscopic drainage of a pelvic abscess followed by lysis of all peritoneal cavity adhesions and excision of necrotic inflammatory exudate allows host defenses to effectively control the infection [24]. Rapid subjective improvement of the general status, the absence of early PID complications, and the absence of recurrence were noticed when laparoscopy was carried out to supplement the medical treatment of PID [25]. Many cases of acute PID are examined in the emergency units, simulating acute appendicitis or due to unclear diagnosis. These laparotomies could be avoided, if laparoscopy of those patients was considered.|$|E

So for this study, we considered only tubal infertility {{and to make a}} pin-pointed assessment criteria. The criteria for selection of patients and assessment of results were unilateral or bilateral tubal blockage diagnosed in hysterosalpingography (HSG). Thus 18 patients in the age group of 20 - 40 years were registered for the study, with 75 % primary infertility and 25 % secondary infertility. Of these patients 16 completed the course of treatment.

40|$|Background & Objectives: In {{spite of}} rapid {{development}} and arrival of newer medical imaging modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, hysterosalpingography (HSG) {{has a great}} role among imaging techniques because of its enormous advantages. HSG is the standard screening test for the diagnosis of tubal infertility and can provide useful information about the uterine cavity. The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate the value of HSG in the evaluation of infertility and to diagnose the tubo-uterine causes of infertility in Tabriz. Methods: In current study, 1260 patients were investigated for infertility by HSG, patients of both primary and secondary infertility were included except those who have history of <b>acute</b> <b>pelvic</b> <b>infection</b> and allergy to contrast media. This study was conducted at Day Medical Imaging Center in Tabriz-IRAN. Results: HSG outlined normal uterus cavity, normal tube bilaterally with peritoneal spill in 1045 patients (82. 94 %) and 215 cases (17. 06 %) were detected with abnormalities. Among these patients, 78 cases (36. 28 %) detected with normal uterine shape and block of one tube, 32 (14. 88 %) patients shows both tubal blockages with normal uterus.

40|$|Ertapenem is a {{carbapenem}} that {{shares the}} activity of imipenem and meropenem against most species, but is less active against non-fermenters. Activity is retained against most strains with AmpC and extended-spectrum ß-lactamases, although resistance can arise if these enzymes are combined with extreme impermeability. Resistance can also be caused by IMP, VIM, KPC and NMC carbapenemases, but again, co-requires impermeability. Although the spread of carbapenemases {{in the future is}} a concern, they are currently very rare. Given as a 1 g intravenous (iv) infusion once daily, ertapenem has a plasma half-life of ~ 4 h in healthy volunteers, and a Cmax of 155 mg/L and 13 mg/L for total and free drug, respectively. Excretion is largely renal, divided equally between native drug and an open-ring derivative. Trials show equivalence to piperacillin/tazobactam or ceftriaxone in (a) intra-abdominal infections, (b) community-acquired pneumonia, (c) <b>acute</b> <b>pelvic</b> <b>infections,</b> (d) skin and skin structure infections and (e) complicated urinary tract infections. The USA licence grants all these five indications; the EU licence grants the first three. Further potential uses include home iv therapy, directed therapy against Enterobacteriaceae with AmpC or extended-spectrum cephalosporinases, and tentatively, surgical prophylaxis. Widening the usage of carbapenems raises public health concerns, somewhat allayed by the continued rarity of carbapenemases after 17 years of imipenem use, and by the fact that carbapenemases occur mostly in non-fermenters outside the spectrum of ertapenem, and co-require impermeability to confer resistance in Enterobacteriaceae. Nevertheless, if ertapenem is to be used widely, its effects on the resistance ecology need to be monitored carefully. Key word...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Ertapenem, a new {{carbapenem}} with {{a favorable}} pharmacokinetic profile, {{has been approved}} {{for the treatment of}} complicated intra-abdominal <b>Infections</b> (cIAIs), <b>acute</b> <b>pelvic</b> <b>infections</b> (APIs) and complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs). The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the efficacy and safety of ertapenem with piperacillin/tazobactam, which has been reported to possess good efficacy for the treatment of these complicated infections. Methods We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials identified in PubMed, Cochrane library and Embase that compared the efficacy and safety of ertapenem with piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of complicated infections including cIAIs, APIs, cSSSIs. The primary efficacy outcome was clinical treatment success assessed at the test-of-cure visit. The primary safety outcome was drug related clinical and laboratory adverse events occurred during the treatment and the post-treatment period. Result Six RCTs, involving 3161 patients, were included in our meta-analysis. Ertapenem was associated similar clinical treatment success with piperacillin/tazobactam for complicated infections treatment (clinically evaluable population, 1937 patients, odds ratios: 1. 15, 95 % confidence intervals: 0. 89 - 1. 49; modified intention to treat population, 2855 patients, odds ratios: 1. 03, 95 % confidence intervals: 0. 87 - 1. 22). All of secondary efficacy outcomes analysis obtained similar findings with clinical treatment success. No difference was found about the incidence of drug related adverse events between ertapenem and piperacillin/tazobactam groups. Conclusion This meta-analysis provides evidence that ertapenem 1 g once a day can be used as effectively and safely as recommended dose of piperacillin/tazobactam, for the treatment of complicated infections, particularly of mild to moderate severity. It is an appealing option for the treatment of these complicated infections. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Diagnostic {{accuracy}} of first-line sonographic evaluation by obstetrics/gynecology residents {{in determining the}} need for emergency surgery in women with <b>acute</b> <b>pelvic</b> pain is unknown. Aim {{of this study was}} to evaluate the diagnostic {{accuracy of}} routine ultrasound evaluation by obstetrics/gynecology residents, available 24 hours a day, in patients with <b>acute</b> <b>pelvic</b> pain. Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective study included consecutive patients who underwent emergency laparoscopy for <b>acute</b> <b>pelvic</b> pain at a teaching hospital gynecologic emergency unit, between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2006. The laparoscopic diagnosis was the reference standard. Gynecologic and nongynecologic conditions requiring immediate surgery to avoid severe morbidity or death were defined as surgical emergencies. In all patients, obstetrics/gynecology residents routinely performed clinical examination and standardized ultrasonography was routinely recorded. Sonograms were re-interpreted for the study, blinded to physical examination and laparoscopic findings, according to evidence-based predetermined criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were computed for clinical data alone, sonographic data alone, and the combination of both. Results: Emergency laparoscopy was performed in 234 patients, diagnosing 139 (59 %) surgical emergencies. Clinical and sonographic examinations performed by the residents each independently predicted a need for emergency surgery. Combining both examinations was superior over each examination alone and had an acceptable false-negative rate of 1 %.

There was no correlation between the antibody concentrations in the EIA and the spread of chlamydial infection, as determined by cervical, endometrial, and laparoscopic sampling for chlamydia. The immunoblot analysis showed antibodies to the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of C trachomatis elementary bodies in all patients who had had C trachomatis isolated. Reactivity was also frequently observed against the 68, 62, 60, 45, and 31 kilodalton antigens. About 20 antigenic polypeptides were identified. Differences in antibody prevalence to specific chlamydial antigens, however, were not related to the site of chlamydial isolation or serum antibody concentrations observed with the EIA. The results indicate that patients with PID with and without upper genital tract infection with C trachomatis cannot be differentiated by reactivity of sera to specific chlamydial polypeptide antigens.
