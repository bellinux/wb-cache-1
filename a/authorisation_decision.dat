40|$|A core {{aim of the}} European {{chemicals}} legislation REACH is {{to ensure}} that the risks caused by substances of very high concern (SVHC) are adequately controlled. Authorisation – i. e. the formal approval of certain uses of SVHC for a limited time - is a key regulatory instrument in order to achieve this goal. For SVHC which are, in addition to their toxicity, (very) persistent and/or (very) bioaccumulative (PBT/vPvB chemicals), decision-making on the authorisation is conditional on a socio-economic analysis (SEA). In a SEA companies must demonstrate that the gains from keeping a chemical in use outweigh expected damage costs for society. The current setup of the REACH authorisation process, including existing guidance on performing a SEA, ignores that PBT/vPvB chemicals are stock pollutants. This paper explores the implications of incorporating stock pollution effects of these chemicals into a SEA on authorisation decision-making. We develop a cost-benefit approach which includes stock dynamics of PBT/vPvB chemicals. This allows identifying the decision rules for granting or refusing an authorisation. Furthermore, we generalize the model to an entire set of damage functions. We show that ignoring stock pollution effects in a SEA may lead to erroneous decisions on the use of PBT/vPvB chemicals because long-term impacts are not adequately captured. Using a historic case of DDT soil contamination as an illustrative example we discuss information requirements and challenges for <b>authorisation</b> <b>decisions</b> on the use of PBT/vPvB chemicals under REACH. </p...|$|R

There are also probes for obtaining the access control policies currently in place (Steps 1 c and 1 f), and information about users (Step 1 e) and about objects being protected (Step 1 b) by means of their respective PIP.

The Plan stage (Step 4) is responsible for deciding what to do and how to do it by selecting an appropriate adaptation (based on the set of possible adaptations provided by the previews stage) for dealing with the malicious behaviour, and producing the respective adaptation plan.

40|$|AbstractTraditional trust {{management}} authorisation {{decisions for}} distributed technologies, are, in general, {{based on the}} history of the authorisations/computation to date. We consider this a pull authorisation strategy: the <b>authorisation</b> <b>decision</b> reflects the current and/or past authorisations. In this paper, we examine this pull strategy and propose an alternative form of authorisation in a distributed environment. Instead of 'pulling' the information required for the current authorisation decisions from the past, authorisation decisions are made to specify what will happen in the future. This strategy is called push authorisation. When a push decision is made, its result is pushed to just the relevant protection mechanisms. This approach allows the creation of distributed separation of duties policies, without requiring additional synchronisation between components in the execution. It allows present actions to inform future authorisation decisions, before those decisions must be made...|$|E

Because authorisation {{is the process of}} controlling users’ access to resources, improving authorisation techniques may mitigate the insider threat. Current approaches to authorisation suffer from the assumption that users will (can) not depart from the expected behaviour implicit in the authorisation policy. In reality however, users can and do depart from the canonical behaviour.

40|$|Currently, {{regulators}} make marketing <b>authorisation</b> <b>decisions</b> {{based on}} the benefit-risk balance of a treatment with little input from patients and the public. The aims of this thesis are to apply systematic methods of benefit-risk assessment proposed for use in regulatory decision-making, and examine how they can incorporate patient and public involvement. These aims were met through the investigation of three case studies: efalizumab, rimonabant, and natalizumab. Efalizumab (indication: plaque psoriasis) was withdrawn from the market due to the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. I examined the feasibility of applying descriptive and quantitative frameworks to determine the benefit-risk balance of efalizumab, and evaluated where patient and public involvement can be applied in the decision-making process. Rimonabant (indication: overweight and obesity) was withdrawn from the market due to the occurrence of psychiatric disorders. I conducted a discrete choice experiment to elicit patient and public preferences regarding the benefits and risks of treatment, and developed a probabilistic analysis method to analyse the preference data and determine the benefit-risk balance of rimonabant. Natalizumab (indication: relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis) received authorisation, but the benefit-risk balance was reassessed due to the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Authorisation was maintained with risk minimisation measures. I developed a framework to guide the application, reporting, and evaluation of patient and public involvement in benefit-risk assessment. I then tested the feasibility of the framework with protocols designed to elicit patient and public preferences on the benefits and risks of natalizumab. Based {{on the findings of}} these case studies, preferences can be elicited from patients and the public and used to determine the benefit-risk balance of a medicine.

30|$|Further {{objections}} raised {{against this}} “refinement trend” in risk assessment concern the increasing {{loss of transparency}} and greater susceptibility {{to the influence of}} special interests. Considerable scientific expertise is required for PPP producers to be able to further refine the risk assessment and for the assessment authority bodies to understand the measures involved. Quite frequently applicants do commission renowned scientists to prepare a scientific report for a refined assessment which is then submitted to defend the authorisation of the PPP or to argue that fewer management measures are required. Even if the assessment authority is able to respond with equal expertise (which becomes more difficult the smaller the agency of an EU Member State is), this development is problematic. In general, the more important the expert judgements become, the less transparent the decisions become for the public. The decision-making process becomes more susceptible to the influence of parties with special interests due to the relatively small numbers of actors involved. The independence of “super experts” and the democratic legitimation of their decisions, with their far-reaching implications, is a sensitive topic in modern knowledge societies [47, 48]. An indicator of the relevance and political sensitivity of this development has been the public criticism expressed regularly in recent years about the composition of EFSA’s panels of experts [49]. Many experts with earlier or existing connections to the chemical industry are believed to have conflicts of interests. To maintain or increase the public’s trust in the authorisation procedure for PPPs, the understandable call for the independence, transparency, and clarity of the decision-making processes must be answered. As a step in this direction, the German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) has been making public its <b>authorisation</b> <b>decisions,</b> including concise summaries of the evaluations, since 2009 (see [URL] In the future, a significant step towards more transparency would be to make all the relevant data about the environmental behaviour and ecotoxicology of the active substance or PPP, including the results of confidential studies commissioned by the applicant, available in an open database.

40|$|The self-defending object (SDO) {{concept is}} an {{extension}} to the object-oriented programming paradigm, whereby those objects that encapsulate the protected resources of a security aware application (SAA), are made aware of, and responsible for, the defence of those resources. That defence takes two forms, the enforcement of mandatory access control on protected resources and the generation of the corresponding portion of the SAA's audit trail. The SDO concept acts as the philosophy that guides the application level mandatory access control within SAAs which ensures that the provided access control is both complete and non bypassable. Although SDOs accept responsibility for controlling access to the protected data and functionality that they encapsulate, an SDO delegates the responsibility for making <b>authorisation</b> <b>decisions</b> to an associated authorisation object. Thus, SDOs fulfill their access control obligations by initiating the authorisation check and then enforcing the decision made on their behalf. A simple, yet effective mechanism for enforcing that access control at the object level involves controlling the ability to invoke those SDO methods that access protected resources. In the absence of previous research on this approach to the enforcement of application level access control, the primary aim {{of this research was}} to demonstrate that the SDO concept is a viable paradigm for developing SAAs. That aim was achieved in two stages. The first stage targeted the provision of a 'proof of concept', that demonstrated that the SDO concept could be applied to the development of non-distributed SAAs. The second stage demonstrated its applicability to the development of distributed SAAs. In the second stage, two versions of a distributed prototype were developed, one based on a traditional (proprietary) distributed computing model, (Java RMI), and the second using the currently popular Web services model, to demonstrate the general applicability of the SDO concept. Having already demonstrated that the SDO concept could be applied to SAAs executing on a single machine, the major focus of that research was to devise a mechanism by which SDOs could be transferred between machines. The research then concentrated on determining what impacts the adoption of the SDO concept would have on SAA development. Experimentation carried out using the distributed prototypes demonstrated that (1) the adoption of the SDO does not restrict the use of inheritance hierarchies that include SDOs, (2) the restriction of the lifetime of SDOs can be supported, (3) usage rights enforcement can be employed, and (4) the use of cryptographic techniques to provide additional security guarantees is not affected. A key feature of the SDO concept, is that no major changes need to be made to current development tools or　methodologies, so its adoption is not hampered by significant financial or training impediments. This research demonstrated that the SDO concept is practical and constitutes a valuable extension to the object oriented paradigm that will help address the current lack of security in information systems. The SDO approach warrants additional research and adoption...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to confirm the safety profile of an equine collagen patch coated with human fibrinogen and human thrombin with particular focus on the occurrence of thromboembolic events (TEEs), major bleeding and immunological events. Methods This was a non-interventional, multicentre, prospective, surveillance study in which a collagen fleece-bound fibrin sealant was prescribed in accordance with its marketing <b>authorisation.</b> The <b>decision</b> to use the sealant was based solely on current surgical practice. All patients that received the sealant and provided informed consent were included. TEEs (any coagula-based occlusion in a vessel or the heart identified by symptomatic clinical signs and/or verified by paraclinical examination), major bleeding (any bleeding that required intervention), and immunological events (hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis) that occurred during surgery, post-operative hospital stay or 6 months of follow-up were reported as adverse events. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients experiencing a confirmed TEE. Results A total of 3098 patients were recruited at 227 centres in 12 European countries. The most frequent types of surgery were hepatic (33 %), gastrointestinal (16 %) and urological (14 %) and the main indication for surgery was for primary (35 %) or secondary (20 %) malignancy. Forty-six patients (1. 5 %, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 2. 0 %) had at least one TEE during the study. The most commonly reported TEEs were pulmonary embolism or post-procedural pulmonary embolism (n = 18) and deep vein thrombosis (n = 9). There were 64 major bleedings in 62 patients and 9 immunological events in 8 patients. Conclusion Collagen fleece-bound fibrin sealant does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of TEEs, major bleeding or immunological events in patients undergoing surgery.
