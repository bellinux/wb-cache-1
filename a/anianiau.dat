50|$|The <b>anianiau</b> (Magumma parva), {{pronounced}} , is {{a species}} of Hawaiian honeycreeper that is endemic to upper elevation forests {{on the island of}} Kauai.|$|E
50|$|The <b>anianiau</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the 1830s, but was not seen again for another fifty years. This species was not well studied until the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} the <b>anianiau</b> has {{contracted}} by 85%, as it previously {{could be found in}} all forests of Kauai. Habitat degradation and invasion by non-native plants are the most significant threats to this species. Mosquito-transmitted diseases, such as avian malaria and fowlpox, are very rarely observed in captured <b>anianiau,</b> so they may not be a major cause of mortality. Predation by rats and cats is possible but has not been documented. This species is protected in the Alakai Wilderness Preserve and surrounding environs as well as Waimea Canyon and Kokee State Parks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>anianiau</b> mainly {{feeds on}} nectar from the flowers of {{plants such as}} ōhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), ōhelo (Vaccinium spp.), and alani (Melicope spp.). It will also take {{arthropods}} from trees, shrubs, or vines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anianiau</b> {{are found}} in mesic and wet forests at {{elevations}} above 600 m. The highest densities occur above 1100 m. Dominant tree species in its habitat include koa (Acacia koa), ōhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), ōlapa (Cheirodendron trigynum), and lapalapa (C. platyphyllum).|$|E
50|$|The <b>anianiau</b> {{breeding}} season ranges from February to June. The female makes a small cup-shaped nest of twigs and lichens in an ōhia tree. Typically, three eggs are laid. The small yellow chicks leave the nest in three weeks, but {{while in the}} nest they are fed on a mainly protein diet of caterpillars.|$|E
5000|$|The adult contact call {{is a short}} weet or whit, {{sometimes}} doubled. The call {{may also}} resemble that of the <b>anianiau,</b> with which it may flock. Its song, heard only in breeding season, is a descending trill. [...] The juvenile begging call is a stuttering series of chits. During the breeding season, females use a similar call to solicit feeding by males.|$|E
50|$|The 'anianiau is {{a brightly}} plumaged yellow bird and at 10 cm in length, the {{smallest}} Hawaiian honeycreeper. The <b>anianiau</b> {{has a slightly}} curved bill and a mass of about 10 g. The plumage of the female is more uniform and has a duller yellow-green color than the male's bright yellow. Its call {{is a pair of}} notes, tew-weet, while its song is a trill of wee-see, wee-see, wee-see.|$|E

Color plates were scanned separately at 400 dpi. Insular biotas have attracted considerable biological attention, and have been very important in the formulation of evolutionary thought and theory. Since Charles Darwin's visit to the Galapagos Islands and his description of the Galapagos Finches, insular land birds have played very prominent roles in evolutionary biology, largely based upon detailed morphological and taxonomic analyses. Yet virtually no {{attention has been paid to}} assessments of the functional attributes of terrestrial birds inhabiting oceanic islands. Ideal candidates for studies of adaptive physiology of an island avifauna are the endemic Hawaiian Honeycreepers (Passeriformes: Drepanididae) which exhibit among their…. "numerous species the most striking example of adaptive radiation from an assumed single ancestral species of any bird family in the world" (Berger, 1970). This study undertakes to examine certain bioenergetic characteristics of two congeneric species of Hawaiian Honeycreepers, the Amakihi (Loxops virens) and the <b>Anianiau</b> (L. parva), with the view of providing data for comparisons with those derived from continental land birds. Such data, hopefully, will reveal the magnitudes of physiological divergence and/or convergence of these island birds. Included in this study are assessments of oxygen consumption, thermoregulation, and evaporative water loss.

40|$|Synopsis This study uses a {{spatially}} explicit microclimate/biophysical {{approach to}} examine the potential distribution of the Po’ouli on Maui to find either new habitats to search for existence or refine search efforts in previously occupied areas. We used specific physiological and behavioral ecology bird data, and Po’ouli morphological and spectral data obtained from museum specimens to address ecological and conservation-related questions about the Po’ouli that are otherwise very difficult to quantify. Laboratory and field tested microclimate and biophysical—behavioral animal computer models were integrated with remote sensing technologies. To show that the generic microclimate and endotherm models can predict metabolic and water loss requirements of Hawaiian Honeycreepers, we used the 2 species with known physiological properties, the Hawaiian Amakihi, Hemignathus virens, and the Hawaiian <b>Anianiau,</b> Hemignathus parvus. Predictions were within experimental measurement error of the laboratory measurements. Then using field rather than laboratory conditions as input data, we predict the field distribution of the Amakihi on Maui as the first spatial test of the models applied to birds. Results are consistent with Amakihi field distribution data. Fossils show that the Po’ouli once lived on Maui at low elevations in dry/mesic habitats on a likely diet of native tree snails and insects. The arrival of lethal mosquito-borne avian malaria in Hawaii exterminated low elevation Po’ouli forcing a population shift to mountain rainforests and possibly a snail diet instead of insects. To explore the maximum consequences of such a diet shift we assumed exclusive diets of snails versus insects at both low and high elevations. Snail diets require 4 times higher foraging rates than do insect diets, making...|$|E
