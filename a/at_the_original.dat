5|$|A third airfield, Alamo Field, was {{established}} in 1942 by aviator George Crockett {{south of the city}} of Las Vegas, at the present location of McCarran Airport. As the Army sought to open a local base at the site of McCarran Field, Clark County purchased Alamo Field from Crockett in order to relocate commercial air traffic. Alamo Field became the new McCarran Field on December 19, 1948. The opening of this new airfield broke Western Air Express' monopoly on flights to Las Vegas, allowing other airlines to serve the market. Meanwhile, the Army reopened its base <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> McCarran Field in 1949 and named it Nellis Air Force Base in 1950.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} survey of 1998, only nine plants were {{identified}} in one single Radyr garden, where it traditionally grew on grassy banks and lawns, often in shade. It was no longer found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> locality of Radyr Quarry where examples were last seen in 1985. At Bridgend, six possible plants of the Radyr genus were found on an old garden wall, but confirmation of identification is still awaited.|$|E

5|$|Officially {{designated}} on 1924-08-24, {{the original}} route encompassed all of current SH-9 west of Blanchard. East of Blanchard, SH-9 followed a more northerly route. Bypassing Norman, SH-9 ran north to Oklahoma City before going east through Harrah, Meeker, Prague, Henryetta, and Checotah. The highway ended <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> State Highway 3 in Spiro. Upon {{the creation of}} the United States Numbered Routes system in 1926, the section between Oklahoma City and Warner was overlaid with U.S. Highway 266. Four years later in 1930, SH-9 was truncated to Chickasha. By this time, much of the route had become part of U.S. Highway 62.|$|E

5|$|The axe and log logo was {{conceived}} {{by the first}} Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in the early 1920s to distinguish Gilwell Park from the Scout Headquarters. Gidney wanted to associate Gilwell Park with the outdoors and Scoutcraft rather than the business or administrative Headquarters offices. Scouters present <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> Wood Badge courses regularly saw axe blades masked for safety by being buried in a log. Seeing this, Gidney chose the axe and log as the totem of Gilwell Park.|$|E

5|$|Albion {{had spent}} the {{majority}} of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the FA Premier League was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed Division Two. In 1992–93, Albion finished fourth and entered the playoffs for the first time, having just missed out the previous year. Albion's first appearance at Wembley for over 20 years – and their last ever <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> stadium – saw them beat Port Vale 3–0 to return to the second level – now renamed the First Division. Manager Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur, however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the final}} venues, apart from four, have been in London with most being played <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> Wembley Stadium, which was used from 1923 until the stadium closed in 2000. The other venues that {{were used for the}} final prior to 1923 were Kennington Oval, Crystal Palace, Stamford Bridge and Lillie Bridge, all in London, Goodison Park in Liverpool and Fallowfield Stadium and Old Trafford in Manchester. The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff hosted the final for six years (2001–2006), while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction. Other grounds have been used for replays, which until 1999 took place if the initial match ended in a draw. The new Wembley Stadium has been the {{permanent}} venue {{of the final}} since 2007.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their victory, Plymouth Argyle {{returned}} to the third tier of English football just one year after being relegated to the fourth tier {{for the first time in}} its history. They returned to the Third Division two years later before being promoted as champions in 2002, and the club followed that up by winning the Second Division in 2004, to reclaim their place in the second tier of English football after a twelve-year hiatus. For Darlington, there was to be more disappointment in the play-offs four years later under David Hodgson, Platt's successor. They reached the Third Division final in 2000, the last to be played <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> Wembley Stadium, and were defeated 10 again; on this occasion to Peterborough United.|$|E

5|$|London was the world's {{largest city}} from about 1831 to 1925. London's overcrowded {{conditions}} led to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866. Rising traffic congestion {{led to the}} creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital. London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War, and during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city. Immediately after the war, the 1948 Summer Olympics were held <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> Wembley Stadium, at a time when London was still recovering from the war.|$|E
5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received back only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 2015 the World Championships {{were moved}} to their new home, one of the cycle track bridges over the river Windrush in Langel Common, near to the Cogges Manor Farm Museum in Witney, Oxfordshire. The new {{location}} still retains a rural atmosphere while being {{only a few minutes}} walk from Witney town centre with its convenient public transport links to Oxford. Car Parking is also much closer than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> venue, which was a factor that influenced the choice of venue. As this was the first year at the new location, the organizers decided not to hold the 2015 team games.. However, the team games were restored in 2016. The move to the new venue has also allowed the event to move to June when the weather is likely to be better.|$|E
