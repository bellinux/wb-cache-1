40|$|For the {{development}} of a structural topology, structural grammars predefine locations of structural mass based on the building spatial design, whereas topology optimisation distributes structural mass freely and based on the loads. This paper presents a new method that involves first an iterative structural grammar that uses finite element simulations to optimise an initial structural topology for minimal structural mass. Hereafter topology optimisation is applied to modify the structural topology elements for minimal compliance. Due to the several groups of structural topology elements involved, a separate volume fraction is maintained for each group. Using an academic case study, the method is compared to standard structural grammars and topology optimisation, defining Pareto fronts for the objectives structural volume and strain energy. Future research will focus on {{the development}} of structural grammars that take into <b>account</b> <b>openings,</b> and on the implementation of the new method in simulations of co-evolutionary design processes...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of social constructionist writings {{have been critical of}} psychological science-on both ideological and conceptual grounds. The constructionist emphasis on microsocial processes also functions oppositionally to psychological accounting. The existing animus grows, however, from a realist metaphysics and a correspondence view of language, neither of which constructionism endorses. Viewing the relationship between constructionism and psychological science in more pragmatic terms, we find three significant ways in which constructionism contributes to a more fully enriched and broadly effective psychology. First, critical constructionism functions to denaturalize psychological <b>accounts,</b> <b>opening</b> them to reflexive deliberation, and democratizing the field more generally. Second, constructionist metatheory invites a resuscitation of marginal or suppressed discourse within the field, and invigorates societally engaged efforts to forge new and more useful discourses of the mind. Finally, social constructionism offers the possibility for a fundamental reconceptualization of the self. Illustrative is the family of theories conceptualizing the self as either constituted by or constituting relationships...|$|R
