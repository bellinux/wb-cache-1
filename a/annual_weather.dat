5000|$|Generally, the {{experimental}} measure of climate adaptation is conducted by exposing an experimental population to different environmental stimuli. Successful studies {{outside of a}} laboratory setting take place in locations with a variable annual climate. Areas where <b>annual</b> temperature and <b>weather</b> extremes vary greatly can give insight into the climate adaptability of organisms that live there. [...] Tropical or arctic microclimates, for example, would be ideal settings for experimentation, as <b>annual</b> temperature and <b>weather</b> can vary greatly.

50|$|Fossils {{dating back}} to Pangean time also support the claim that a {{strongly}} monsoonal circulation dominated the supercontinent’s climate. For example, tree rings (also called growth rings) provide convincing proof of distinct changes in <b>annual</b> <b>weather</b> patterns. Trees rooted in areas that do not experience seasonality will not exhibit rings within their trunks as they grow. Fossilized wood excavated from what was once coastal, mid-latitude Pangea, however, display the clear presence of rings. Other paleoflora suggest that {{a significant portion of}} the year would have been dominated by a warm, moist season. Large, smooth leaf shapes with thin cuticles and symmetric distribution of stomata, as well as tropical fern species have been uncovered from these regions.|$|E

5000|$|The dehesa is a {{complete}} ecosystem in which trees, pastures and vegetation form an association with animal life. This ecosystem is situated in the south-west of the Iberian Peninsula. Joselito's pigs live in this south-west region of the Iberian Peninsula, characterised by its high density of holm oaks and cork oaks. [...] But {{not all of the}} region's trees function in the same way with regard to fruit production, so {{the quantity and quality of}} the latter depend on both the <b>annual</b> <b>weather</b> and the number of hectares in which these trees are present. In the case of cork oaks, less fruit is produced in the year following a good harvest. In addition to this, cyclical harvests in which production may be very high occur every certain number of years, depending on the farming conditions. In contrast, holm oaks enjoy a more constant level of acorn production, although the flowering process may fail in the event of adverse weather conditions, and some years may see reduced yields. So, it is essential that the number of animals grazing in the dehesa is adjusted according to their density and the weather. [...] In the dehesa, the montanera (the final stage in the life-cycle of an Iberian pig) runs from the end of October until the end of November. The dehesa offers up the fruits of its trees at this time of year as the mature acorns fall to the ground and the pigs run freely about their surroundings, enjoying this autumnal foodstuff and the grasses that grow in the dehesa ecosystems.|$|E
5000|$|In 1994 Nguyen began chasing {{storms in}} Texas and soon {{expanded}} his range {{to the larger}} area of the central United States commonly known as Tornado Alley. Nguyen began publishing images regularly in Accord Publishing's popular <b>annual</b> <b>Weather</b> Guide Calendar series, Smithsonian Magazine, NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day, as well as Weatherwise, Storm Track, UCAR Quarterly, textbooks, and other venues. His Mulvane, Kansas image of white tornado with a rainbow {{is one of the}} most frequently licensed tornado images of all time and several other of his photos have appeared in publications and presentations around the world. Nguyen's storm and tornado photography was considered among the most expressive in the field, with a particular emphasis on unusual palettes and the use of foreground elements to create dynamic line structures in the composition. On April 21, 2007, Nguyen and his storm chasing partner, Amos Magliocco, were struck by a tornado in Tulia, Texas. Nguyen's scientific grade weather instrumentation survived the hit and arguably measured the sharpest pressure fall ever recorded on Earth. Upon his death, hundreds of weather enthusiasts from around the world praised Nguyen's skills as a photographer and chaser in the online journal Storm Track The University of Oklahoma hosted a memorial tribute ceremony in the National Weather Center (NWC) on September 22, 2007. The keynote speaker was Dr. Charles A. Doswell III. An endowed scholarship for graduate and undergraduate meteorology students was created in Nguyen's name at OU's prestigious School of Meteorology (SoM).

40|$|Understanding how {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} heterogeneity influence ecological processes forms a central challenge in ecology. Individual responses to heterogeneity shape population dynamics, therefore understanding these responses is central to sustainable population management. Emerging evidence has shown that herbivores track heterogeneity in nutritional quality of vegetation by responding to phenological differences in plants. We quantified the benefits mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) accrue from accessing habitats with asynchronous plant phenology in northwest Colorado over 3 years. Our analysis examined both the direct physiological and indirect environmental effects of weather and vegetation phenology on mule deer winter body condition. We identified several important effects of <b>annual</b> <b>weather</b> patterns and topographical variables on vegetation phenology in the home ranges of mule deer. Crucially, temporal patterns of vegetation phenology were linked with differences in body condition, with deer tending to show poorer body condition in areas with less asynchronous vegetation green-up and later vegetation onset. The direct physiological effect of previous winter precipitation on mule deer body condition was much {{less important than the}} indirect effect mediated by vegetation phenology. Additionally, the influence of vegetation phenology on body fat was much stronger than that of overall vegetation productivity. In summary, changing <b>annual</b> <b>weather</b> patterns, particularly in relation to seasonal precipitation, have the potential to alter body condition of this important ungulate species during the critical winter period. This finding highlights the importance of maintaining large contiguous areas of spatially and temporally variable resources to allow animals to compensate behaviourally for changing climate-driven resource patterns...|$|E
