40|$|It is {{intended}} to present technical analysis of issues using data that are currently available. The purpose in the release of such reports is to facilitate the exchange of technical information and {{to inform the public}} of technical developments which may form the basis for a fi nal EPA decision, position, or regulatory action. Purpose This report describes and documents exhaust emission factors, crankcase estimates, and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) estimates used for spark ignition (SI) engines in EPA s final NONROAD 2005 emission inventory model. It covers engines powered by gasoline, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. <b>Additional</b> <b>EPA</b> reports describe other issues relating to emission factors including NONROAD evaporative emission rates (NR- 012 c), refueling emissions (NR- 013 b), adjustments to emission rates due to variations in fuel and temperature (NR- 001 c), speciation of hydrocarbon emissions (NR- 002 c), and adjustments to emission rates as equipment deteriorates due to time and use (NR- 011 c). Emission factors for compression ignition (diesel) engines are covered in a separate report (NR- 009 c) ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{and documents}} exhaust emission factors used for spark ignition (SI) engines in EPA’s NONROAD emission inventory model. It covers emission factors for engines powered by gasoline, {{natural gas and}} liquefied petroleum gas. EPA expects to recalculate most SI emission factors prior to release of {{the final version of}} the NONROAD model. This report describes the emission factors that will be used for the draft version of the model and lists the data sources that will be considered when calculating new emission factors for the final model. When complete, the final emission factors will be similarly documented and distributed for stakeholder review. <b>Additional</b> <b>EPA</b> reports will describe other issues relating to emission factors including NONROAD emission factors for evaporative emissions, crankcase emissions, spillage and other non-exhaust emissions (NR- 012), adjustments to emission rates due to variations in fuel and temperature (NR- 001), speciation of hydrocarbon emissions (NR- 002), and adjustments to emission rates as equipment deteriorates due to time and use (NR- 011).

OECA sets overall enforcement policies and through its 10 regions oversees state agencies authorized to implement environmental programs consistent with federal requirements. GAO was asked to (1) identify trends in federal resources to regions and states for enforcement between 1997 and 2006, and determine regions' and states' views on the adequacy of these resources; (2) determine EPA's progress in improving priority setting and enforcement planning with states; and (3) examine EPA's efforts to improve oversight of states' enforcement programs and identify <b>additional</b> actions <b>EPA</b> could take to ensure more consistent state performance and oversight. GAO examined information from all 10 regions and 10 authorized states, among other things. ...|$|R
2500|$|On November 2, 2016 the EPA {{issued a}} second notice of {{violation}} (NOV) pertaining to certain diesel 3.0-liter V6 equipped Audi, Volkswagen Touareg and Porsche Cayenne vehicles. The EPA found beginning with the 2009 model year all vehicles powered by the V6 were non-compliant. During testing the EPA, CARB and Transport Canada discovered software that activates pollution reduction systems when the automobiles are being driven under federal test conditions, otherwise during real world driving these devices are inactive. Volkswagen disputed the EPA's findings stating their software was legally permitted, however shortly after Volkswagen issued a stop-sale for the EPA's disputed vehicles and <b>additional</b> models the <b>EPA</b> did not question.|$|R

"Nellis AFB complex" [...] {{refers to}} a group of {{southern}} Nevada military areas that are predominantly USAF and Bureau of Land Management areas outside of the base (e.g., controlled by military units at Nellis). The complex's land areas include Nellis AFB, the USAF Nevada Test and Training Range, the active portion of the Small Arms Range Annex north of the base, the annex's Formerly Used Defense Site of 5775 acre (cleared in March 1972, returned to the DoI), 13 BLM areas of 5.7 acre each leased for Patriot Radar/Communications Exercises, and other BLM sites [...] "under Military Operations Area (MOA) airspace". [...] Nellis AFB also leases space at the former Las Vegas AFS, and environmental sites of the Tonopah Bombing Range (FUDS) are monitored by the <b>EPA.</b> <b>Additional</b> Formerly Used Defense Sites associated with the area's military operations are the Nye County Areas A, G, H, & I; the [...] "Delamar Dry Lake Test Annex" [...] and the [...] "Sunrise Mountain Machine Gun Range".|$|R

40|$|Summary and {{recommendations}} Alcoa World Alumina Australia (Alcoa) proposes {{to expand the}} Wagerup Refinery through construction of a third production unit. The proposed production increase to approximately 4. 7 million tonnes per annum of alumina is to be achieved {{by a combination of}} new equipment and an upgrade of existing equipment in order to achieve an increase in both capacity and efficiency. The Refinery currently operates at about 2. 4 million tonnes per annum. Alcoa also proposes to establish a Cogeneration plant at the Refinery site to provide electricity and steam for the Refinery, and for electricity supply into the South West Interconnected System (SWIS). Section 44 of the Environmental Protection Act 1986 requires the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) to report to the Minister for the Environment on the environmental factors relevant to the proposals and on the conditions and procedures to which the proposals should be subject, if implemented. In addition, the <b>EPA</b> may make <b>additional</b> recommendations. The <b>EPA</b> is also required to have regard for th...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the meeting, MCRC {{announced}} a plan to preserve additional wetlands as part of the McCormick Wilderness to expand its wetlands mitigation plan for the CR 595 project. The land measured 1 x 2.5 mi and would be called the [...] "Dishno Creek Headwaters Wetland Preservation Area". Conservation easements would limit development activities on the parcel owned by various timber companies. The new proposal would mean that 26.6 acre of wetlands mitigation would be provided for every 1 acre of wetlands used to build the roadway. This compared to the 2:1 and 1.5:1 ratios from the county road commission's original plan. Compensation to the land owners would be provided by Rio Tinto if the plan was approved. The deadline was later extended to December 1, 2012, with assurances that Rio Tinto would still finance the road if construction started in the spring of 2013; the delay was to allow the <b>EPA</b> <b>additional</b> time to consider the comments from the public hearing in August. The DEQ had asked the EPA to withdraw its objections so that the project could be approved, reiterating the state's support for the project. The backup plan was to upgrade CR 550 to [...] "all-weather status" [...] if CR 595 is not approved; currently weight restrictions are enacted each spring on that roadway.|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Chemicals {{play an important role}} in everyday life, but some may be harmful to human health and the environment. Chemicals are used to produce items widely used throughout society, such as cleansers and plastics as well as industrial solvents and additives. However, some chemicals, such as lead and mercury, are highly toxic at certain doses and need to be regulated because of health and safety concerns. In 1976, the Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to authorize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to control chemicals that pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment. This testimony is based on GAO's June 2005 report, Chemical Regulation: Options Exist to Improve EPA's Ability to Assess Health Risks and Manage Its Chemical Review Program (GAO- 05 - 458). GAO's report describes EPA's efforts to (1) assess chemicals used in commerce, (2) control the use of chemicals not yet in commerce, and (3) publicly disclose information provided by chemical companies under TSCA. GAO recommended that the Congress consider providing <b>EPA</b> <b>additional</b> authorities under TSCA to improve EPA's ability to assess chemical risks, and that the EPA Administrator take several actions to improve EPA's management of its chemical review program. EPA did not disagree with our findings and is currently implementing some of our recommendations. ...|$|R
