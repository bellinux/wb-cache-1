40|$|Recordings {{were made}} from single neurons in the rat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the {{inferior}} colliculus (ICc). Binaural responses were studied when dichotic tone bursts with various interaural-level differences were presented simultaneously or with a contralateral delay. These dichotic tone bursts allowed us to probe temporal changes in the effect produced by an ipsilateral sound on a contralaterally elicited response. Most of the neurons in the rat 2 ̆ 7 s ICc were excited by contralateral and inhibited by ipsilateral stimulation. For the majority of neurons with excitatory/inhibitory interactions, {{the early part of}} an ipsilateral stimulus caused stronger inhibition than the late part. The ipsilateral stimulus frequently produced an excitatory or inhibitory 2 ̆ 2 offset 2 ̆ 2 effect that was apparent soon after cessation of the stimulus. For many neurons, this aftereffect substantially changed the strength and temporal firing pattern of the response elicited by a lagging contralateral stimulus. Our results suggest that there are time-dependent changes in the effect of ipsilateral stimulation on the pattern and strength of responses to contralateral stimulation. These effects frequently outlast the duration of a leading ipsilateral stimulus. These characteristics of binaural interaction likely reflect the time courses of converging excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to ICc neurons as well as the intrinsic membrane properties of those neurons. © 2009 Elsevier B.

However, molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental formation of this precise organization remain not well understood. Here, we report in the developing mouse cochlea that deleted in colorectal cancer (Dcc) contributes to the proper organization of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) within the Rosenthal 2 ̆ 7 s canal and of SGN projections toward both the peripheral and central auditory targets. In Dcc mutant embryos, mispositioning of SGNs occurred along the peripheral auditory pathway with misrouted afferent fibers and reduced synaptic contacts with hair cells. The central auditory pathway simultaneously exhibited similar defective phenotypes as in the periphery with abnormal exit of SGNs from the Rosenthal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> canal towards <b>central</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Furthermore, the axons of SGNs ascending into the cochlear nucleus had disrupted bifurcation patterns.

40|$|Stroke-induced lesions of the insular cortex in {{the brain}} {{have been linked to}} {{autonomic}} dysfunction (sympathoexcitation) leading to arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death. In experimental models, systemic estrogen administration in male rats has been shown to reduce stroke-induced cell death in the insular cortex as well as prevent sympathoexcitation. The <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala has been postulated to mediate sympathoexcitatory output from the insular cortex. We therefore set out to determine if endogenous estrogen levels within the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala are altered following stroke and if microinjection of estrogen into the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala modulates autonomic tone. Plasma estrogen concentrations were not altered by middle cerebral artery occlusion (22. 86 +/- 0. 14 pg/ml vs. 21. 24 +/- 0. 33 pg/ml; P> 0. 05). In contrast, estrogen concentrations in the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala increased significantly following middle cerebral artery occlusion (from 20. 83 +/- 0. 54 pg/ml to 76. 67 +/- 1. 59 pg/ml; P< 0. 05). Local infusion of an aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, into the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala at the time of middle cerebral artery occlusion prevented the increase in estrogen concentration suggesting that this increase was dependent on aromatization from testosterone. Furthermore, bilateral microinjection of estrogen (0. 5 microM in 200 nl) directly into the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala significantly decreased arterial pressure and sympathetic tone and increased baroreflex sensitivity, and these effects were enhanced following co-injection with either an N-methyl-D-aspartate or non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. Taken together, the results suggest that middle cerebral artery occlusion resulted in synthesis of estrogen within the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala and that this enhanced estrogen level may act to attenuate overstimulation of <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala neurons to prevent middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced autonomic dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Using brain microdialysis, it was {{demonstrated}} that the release of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) in the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala is under inhibitory control of somatodendritic and postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors. Systemic administration of flesinoxan, a selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, significantly reduced the extracellular levels of 5 -HT in the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala. This effect could be completely antagonized by the 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist N-(2 -(4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl) -N-(2 -pyridyl) cyclohexane carboxamine trihydrochloride (WAY 100635). Local administration of these compounds by reversed microdialysis into the raphe nuclei revealed that extracellular 5 -HT levels in the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala can be regulated through 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the caudal linear raphe nucleus, {{but not in the}} dorsal and median raphe nuclei. Interestingly, administration of flesinoxan into the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala also decreased dialysate 5 -HT levels both locally and in the caudal linear raphe nucleus.

Respiratory and behavioral parameters were assessed during this data collection session. Microinjections of oxytocin (0. 5 µg) into the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of amygdala produced hypergrooming behavior but did not change cardiorespiratory parameters. However, hypergrooming evoked by microinjections of oxytocin (1 µg) into the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of amygdala was accompanied by increase in arterial pressure, heart rate and ventilation and augmented the power of low and high (respiratory-related) frequency bands of the systolic arterial pressure spectrum.

Baroreflex sensitivity was found lower after oxytocin microinjections, demonstrating that the oxytocin-induced pressor response may involve an inhibition of baroreflex pathways and a consequent facilitation of sympathetic outflow to the cardiovascular system. The microinjection of oxytocin (1 µg) into the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of amygdala not only induces hypergrooming but also changes cardiorespiratory parameters.

Within the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus,</b> the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive neurons were found predominantly in the lateral subdivision. This region contained medium-sized neurons (largest diameter ranging from 10 to 15 mu m), with a round or slightly ovoid cell shape. At the subcellular level, however, the labeled neurons revealed relatively few muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive postsynaptic densities. Immunofluorescent double-labeling demonstrated that nearly all of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive neurons (98. 6 %) in the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> expressed abundant amounts of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, further substantiating the cholinoceptive character of these cells. In addition, the vast majority of these muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive neurons (94. 3 %) were GABAergic neurons. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive neurons expressed moderate levels of protein kinase Cy, one of the likely intracellular mediators between muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and their elicited physiological response. The number and staining intensity of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive neurons in the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> varied dramatically among rats.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether stimulation of the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of amygdala activated ventrolateral medulla neurons projecting to the intermediolateral nucleus. For this purpose, the injection of a retrograde tracer, the cholera toxin b subunit (CTb), into the intermediolateral nucleus of the T 2 segment was combined with immunohistochemical detection of Fos protein following chemical stimulation of the <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of amygdala. Results showed that retrogradely labeled neurons were found throughout the ventrolateral medulla.

This study was designed to verify whether the mechanisms involved in the ROE depend on the integrity of either the basolateral amygdala complex or <b>central</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala.
