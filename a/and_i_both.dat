She {{was changed to}} [...] "a Senator's daughter with a liberal mentality". One of the drafts had General Thade, Tim Roth's character, as an albino gorilla, but Burton felt chimpanzees were more frightening. Limbo, Paul Giamatti's character [...] "was supposed {{to turn into a}} good guy. There was supposed to be this touching personal growth thing at the end," [...] Giamatti reflected. [...] "But Tim [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> thought that was kind of lame so we decided to just leave him as a jerk into the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics universally acknowledged, {{but gave}} mixed {{opinions}} on, the game's {{high level of}} difficulty. This sentiment was epitomized by Sliva's comment that [...] "Don't Starve will never, ever hold your hand, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> love it and hate it for that." [...] For example, he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game's camera system obscuring needed objects. Meunier stated that [...] "survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge," [...] but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game's cons. Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that [...] "learning is half the fun and even the smallest victory {{makes you feel like}} you’re winning with a capital FU." [...] Reviewers also felt that players' levels of satisfaction would depend heavily on their levels of commitment to survival.|$|E
500|$|After Alberta's {{two most}} {{prominent}} Liberals, Peter Talbot and Frank Oliver, {{made it clear}} that they were not interested, DeVeber considered himself as a possible candidate. [...] Less than two months before Alberta's formal creation, he wrote to his colleague in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories, Alexander Cameron Rutherford, that the possibilities [...] "practically came to you <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>both</b> of us weak enough God knows but we have the sense to see it." [...] DeVeber's belief that he may be appointed premier does not appear to have been well-founded: his opposition to the introduction of party lines earned him the enmity of some Liberals, not least because it aligned him with Haultain, a Conservative. [...] In the estimation of historian L. G. Thomas, DeVeber's fellow Liberals [...] "were not inclined to take him too seriously" [...] as a potential premier.|$|E

500|$|Bundy {{confessed to}} 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown. Published {{estimates}} have {{run as high}} as 100 or more, and Bundy occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage that speculation. He told Hugh Aynesworth in 1980 that for every murder [...] "publicized", there [...] "could be one that was not." [...] When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, [...] "Add one digit to that, and you'll have it." [...] Years later he told attorney Polly Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate, but Robert Keppel wrote that [...] " [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> knew [...] was much higher." [...] "I don't think even he knew ... how many he killed, or why he killed them", said Rev. Fred Lawrence, the Methodist clergyman who administered Bundy's last rites. [...] "That was my impression, my strong impression." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{group was}} unable to bring the large amounts of Faygo needed for their concerts to their European tours without a sales permit visa because customs {{believed}} that the group had intended to sell the soda at their concerts. As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and created fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, [...] "The craziness was this: {{they were not the}} regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount... maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner...when you're doing what we do with them—that makes a world of difference". During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he [...] "rocketed one of them bottles off my foot and that motherfucker shot straight up and out like a guided Patriot missile, right towards the disco ball high above the crowd...The bottle nailed the disco ball, and... came falling down... on top of some English kid's head.... We must've knocked fifteen or twenty people flat-out cold on that tour...Shaggy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> had black eyes and several injuries and bruises ourselves from them things hittin' us".|$|E
500|$|Devourment {{reformed}} during Rosas's incarceration, with Knupp taking Rosas's {{place on}} vocals, and Braxton Henry rejoining the {{band in the}} place of Brian Wynn. The band recorded a single song, named [...] "Babykiller", which was featured on a compilation album named Southern Uprising. The song was also featured on the band's own compilation album, 1.3.8., the title of which represents the one song, [...] "Babykiller", with the three songs from Impaled, and the eight songs from Molesting the Decapitated. The compilation was released four times—once on Corpse Gristle Records while Rosas was in jail, once on Unmatched Brutality in 2004, once after Rosas's release while the band was working on new material, including the band's first DVD, on Displeased Records, and finally as a limited edition record by the label Night of the Vinyl Dead. Upon Rosas's release in 2002, he reformed the band with new members, featuring himself on vocals, guitarists Robert Moore and Kevin Clark, Jeremy Peterson on drums and Joseph Fontenot (later of Jacknife) on bass. Clark was then replaced by Chris Hutto of Ingurgitate. Rosas's new lineup played a few shows, but then split up again. Majewski later referred to the time between the band's two full-length albums, explaining that [...] "Ruben <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> made attempts to get the band going again but both failed".|$|E

Richie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> burst out laughing and, needless to say the appeal was not upheld. Test cricket can have its lighter moments.

2500|$|Lennon's {{inspiration}} for the song came when his son, Julian, showed him a nursery school drawing he called [...] "Lucy—in the Sky with Diamonds", depicting his classmate Lucy O'Donnell (later Lucy Vodden). Julian Lennon said, [...] "I don't know why I called it that or why it stood out from all my other drawings, but I obviously had an affection for Lucy at that age. I used to show Dad everything I'd built or painted at school, and this one sparked off the idea..." [...] Vodden, in a BBC radio interview in 2007, said, [...] "I remember Julian <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> doing pictures on a double-sided easel, throwing paint at each other, much to {{the horror of the}} classroom attendant...

2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to break up}} {{came as a surprise}} to many in the industry who believed Bardot {{was in the process of}} establishing a strong and credible reputation. Rumours circulated that the split was a result of Monk's desire to begin a solo career, though she denied this. In 2004, during an interview with FHM magazine, Polihronas revealed, [...] "I think when Sophie went solo, everyone assumed that it was she who broke up the band, which wasn't right. I don't know whether I should say this, but I wanted out for a long time. Sophie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> knew that we were going to fulfil the last album and then move on, but Sophie stayed with the management, and continued on. I took a whole year off without even thinking about it." [...] Soon after Bardot's split, Wood confirmed that at the time, both she and Chapple were the two members keen to continue as Bardot. In 2013, an unreleased track titled [...] "Honesty", written by Chapple and Play It Like That collaborator [...] Michael D'Arcy leaked onto the internet, with lyrics stating a [...] "little girl who wants to sing all the songs / a little blonde caught up in the show" [...] not being honest.

2500|$|Tony and Mandy begin a relationship. Dunn {{said that}} when she was first {{informed}} of the storyline she was surprised. She added that although she felt the pairing was unlikely, [...] "it did actually work". The pair marry and later have a child who they name Grace. Grace dies from suspected SIDS and the pair split. Pickard said [...] "If they hadn't lost a child, they might have stayed together the first time round. They were really happy before that happened". Dunn said that the storyline worked well, saying [...] "as much as it was really difficult. By that stage, Nick <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> knew how we would play things and it worked". Tony leaves Hollyoaks with Mandy and her daughter. Tony returns three months later without Mandy. Dunn explained the reason for Tony leaving Mandy saying: [...] "Mandy told Tony she couldn't have more children and he freaked out and left her in Laos". Dunn revealed Mandy wanted revenge for this. In 2011 Tony leaves the village and returns three months later having reinvented himself. Pickard said despite Tony's changes [...] "Tony is still the same person and he loves Mandy". Speaking about the couple's future, Dunn told Taryn Davies of Femalefirst: [...] "they've been on and off for years and they're a great couple and I think that they make a great couple and I think it's such a shame that just as they get happy something horrendous happens again. So there's the possibility that their relationship might be re-kindled".|$|E

2500|$|Cantrell was a {{close friend}} of former Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, who he {{described}} as his best friend. Staley died in April 2002 at the same time of Cantrell's Degradation Trip tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, [...] "It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it [...] I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.". [...] "The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's {{one of those things where}} if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again." [...] Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said: [...] "Jerry really loved Layne. They had a bond I haven't seen before." [...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.|$|E
